The defendants filed a motion for a directed verdict, which was denied subject to their exception. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendants thereafter moved that a verdict be entered in their favor under leave reserved. The motion was denied, and the defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">The jury could have found the following facts: The defendants were engaged in the scrap iron and metal business. For four months before March 4,1939, the date of the injury, the plaintiff had been in their employ as a general laborer, picking up scrap iron, loading trucks, and removing dirt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>In the yard there was a machine for cutting up metal, which weighed six tons and consisted of a stationary base and a moving arm operated by an electric motor, gears, and pinions. To each portion there was fastened a blade or knife. The blades were removable, and were fastened to the base and to the arm by four bolts held by nuts and check nuts. Operation was on the principle of a pair of shears except that the lower blade was stationary. The operator stood on the right side about three feet from the base, and fed the metals in between the blades as- they opened up. There were no guards on the machine. About two weeks before the accident, at the request of Philip Chafitz, who was a son of one of the defendants, and who had charge of the yard, the plaintiff ran the machine an entire day without trouble. On that occasion \u201ca man kept the place clean,\u201d and the ground around the machine was \u201cin good order.\u201d Thereafter the plaintiff worked as a general laborer, picking up scrap iron and loading it onto trucks. On March 3 about 3 p.m. Philip Chafitz asked the plaintiff to run the machine the next day. Chafitz, who was then working on the machine \u201cbecause it was stuck,\u201d said that \u201che would fix it and tighten it; that the cutters were loose and they should be tightened.\u201d Later in the day Philip Chafitz told him that the \u201cmachine was already fixed, he fixed the knives.\u201d At some unstated time on that day Philip Chafitz told the plaintiff to pick up \u201call the scrap iron around and put it on the side.\u201d It did not appear whether the plaintiff did so. On March 3 the plaintiff knew that there were pieces of metal and pipe on the ground around the machine. At no time between 3 p.m. and the time he left the yard that day did the plaintiff go over to take a look at the machine. He heard it operated between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m., and a little later when he got ready to leave he saw \u201csome junk, around the machine.\u201d When he came to work at 7 a.m. on March 4 \u201cthe ground around the machine was the same.\u201d \u201cHe made a foot path to the machine by doing- away with some of the scrap iron that was there.\u201d He oiled and greased the machine, started it and allowed it to warm up for about an hour. He then began cutting iron and pipes. At first there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>was no trouble, although he noticed a knife was loose. After the plaintiff had cut five pieces \u201cof pipe and various things like that\u201d he began to cut a \u201cwashing machine\u201d pipe which was about one or one and one half inches in diameter and consisted of metal the thickness of a fingernail. While he was so engaged, the pipe \u201cgot stuck in the machine.\u201d He sought to pull it out without shutting off the power. In trying to free the piece \u201cit got loose and the cutter went up,\u201d his left foot \u201cslipped on a piece of pipe or something underneath,\u201d and he \u201clost . . . [his] balance, went backwards and then went into the machine,\u201d injuring his hand. He had his hand \u201cright in the stationary knife as the other knife came down.\u201d The condition of the ground was \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201cpiled up with junk.\u201d There was \u201cjunk on the ground around the machine,\u201d small pieces of steel rod and pipe \u201cprobably an inch\u201d long.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">As the defendants were not insured under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, the plaintiff merely had to prove that his injury was caused by negligence on the part of the defendants or their agents. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Frank\u2019s Inc. </em>314 Mass. 42, 45. <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Paul\u2019s for Tires, Inc. </em>314 Mass. 83, 85. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">There was no evidence how the pipe became stuck in the machine or that this was attributable to any negligence on the part of the defendants with respect to the machine itself. If the blade was loose, and loose because of the negligence of Chafitz, there was no evidence of any causal connection between that condition and the plaintiff\u2019s injury. \u201cOrdinarily one cannot be held liable for conduct having no causal connection with harm constituting the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.\u201d <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>284 Mass. 587, 592. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Benz Kid Co. </em>279 Mass. 533, 537-538. There likewise was no evidence that the defendants were negligent as to the condition of the ground. A junk yard must be expected to contain junk, and a cutting machine to give off cuttings. \u201cIt is implied in the contract of employment that the person employed is to work upon the premises in the condition in which, if he makes a reasonable examination, the premises will appear to be, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>that the employer is not obliged to raise them to a higher standard for the employee\u2019s benefit. The employee, as it is said, assumes the risk of the condition of the premises, except as to defects which such an examination would fail to reveal.\u201d <em>Keough </em>v. <em>E. M. Loew\u2019s, Inc. </em>303 Mass. 364, 365, and cases cited. While it could be found that the ground was \u201cin good order\u201d the first time that the plaintiff ran the machine, and that there were small pieces of steel rod and pipe on the ground at the time of the accident, it is left in doubt whether the plaintiff did not fall by reason of slipping on something which had fallen during his own five cutting operations. <em>Mucha </em>v. <em>Northeastern Crushed Stone Co. Inc. </em>307 Mass. 592, 596-597, and cases cited. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>311 Mass. 278, 281. <em>Ruffin </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>311 Mass. 514, 516. There was no obligation on the defendants to provide someone to pick up cuttings as they were dropped in the course of the plaintiff\u2019s work. The cases r\u00e9lied upon by the plaintiff are distinguishable on their facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\">On the evidence there was error in denying the defendants\u2019 motions, first for a directed verdict and later for entry of a verdict in their favor under leave reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
