There was enough evidence to support the alleged conversion of the plaintiff\u2019s chattels, and the defendants fail to show any error of law in the failure of the jury to accept as true testimony tending to show that there was no conversion or in the denial of their motions for directed verdicts. <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>108 Mass. 191. <em>Korbe </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>130 Mass. 255. <em>Scollard </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>170 Mass. 445. <em>McGonigle </em>v. <em>Victor H.

Y. 35. Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The defendants introduced in evidence an interrogatory propounded to the plaintiff by the female defendant, which requested the plaintiff to state all the acts committed by the defendant \u201cin ejecting the plaintiff\u2019s personal property from the premises,\u201d and which the plaintiff answered by stating that she was informed and believed that all her property had been thrown away. The plaintiff was then properly allowed to read to the jury another interrogatory and answer of the plaintiff to the effect that the acts done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>in ejecting her from the premises consisted of locking the premises and her forcible ejection from the premises by the male defendant. Both interrogatories related to the same subject matter, the exclusion of the plaintiff from the possession and use of her property. The plaintiff had the right to introduce the second interrogatory and answer. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 89. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>United Fruit Co. </em>223 Mass. 300, 304. <em>Bradley Lumber &amp; Manuf.
