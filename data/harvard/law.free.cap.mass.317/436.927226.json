That being so, the judge could take those facts as agreed for the purpose of the hearing and decide the case accordingly. They stand in the place of evidence. <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>239 Mass. 188, 190. They may be summed up as follows. The petitioner, hereinafter referred to as the mayor, has always been notified of the meetings of the school committee, hereinafter referred to as the committee. In January, 1944, the committee organized and elected the respondent Gilgun as chairman. The mayor did not attend any of the meetings of the committee until March 27, 1944. He was present at its meeting on that date and informed the committee and the chairman that he desired to preside, but the chairman and the members of the committee refused to permit him to do so. He also attended its meetings on April 24, May 1, May 4 and May 31. At these meetings he requested that he be allowed to preside, but to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Section 29 of the charter of the city of Woburn (St. 1897, c. 172) provides as follows: \u201cThe school committee shall meet on the first Monday in January in each year, and shall at such meeting, or as soon thereafter as may be, choose by ballot a chairman from among its members, and the votes of a majority of all the members of the school committee shall be required in order to elect. The mayor may be present at all sessions of the school committee, and when present he may participate in the discussions and may preside, but shall have no right to vote.\u201d The respondents, however, seek to justify their action under the provision of one of the rules adopted by the committee (c. 1, \u00a7 2) which provides that \u201cThe chairman shall preside at all meetings and appoint all committees not otherwise provided for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The respondents contend that they had authority to make this rule and to uphold it by refusing to allow the mayor to preside because the provision of \u00a7 29 is in terms that the mayor may, not shall, preside over its meetings. We agree that the provisions of \u00a7 29 of the charter that the mayor \u201cmay be present at all sessions of the school committee, and when present he may participate in the discussions and may preside,\u201d are not mandatory in the sense that the mayor shall be present, and when present shall take part in the discussions and shall preside, but we are of opinion that the privileges accorded to him by \u00a7 29 when present may not be abrogated by any rule of the school committee. There is nothing ambiguous about the language of \u00a7 29. It is apparent from its terms that the Legislature had in mind that the mayor might not always be present, and that the clear intention was that when present he could exercise at will the privileges conferred upon him by the statute, and that the decision was to rest solely with him. In the exercise of these privileges he requires no permission from the committee. That the Legislature intended this provision to be binding upon the committee is evidenced by the fact that these privileges were conferred upon the mayor by \u00a7 29 following a provision therein that the committee \u201cshall . . . choose by ballot a chairman from among its members . . ..\u201d It would be unreasonable to suppose that by the subsequent privileges granted to the mayor to attend and preside at the meetings it was not intended that, in the event that he saw fit to do so, he should supersede the chairman as presiding officer. The contentions of the respondents followed to their logical conclusion would bring about the result that the mayor could not as of right attend the sessions of the committee or participate in the discussions. No extended citation of authorities is needed to support the proposition that the committee may not make rules repugnant to the statutes which confer their powers upon them and that rules so made are void. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>128 Mass. 308; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Segee, </em>206 Mass. 380, 381, and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baronas, </em>285 Mass. 321, 322. The provision in \u00a7 29 that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>mittee shall determine the rules of its proceedings <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not confer upon them authority to make rules repugnant to the statute read as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\">In so far as the rule in question might be susceptible of the construction that the chairman of the committee shall preside at all meetings, notwithstanding that the mayor is present and demands that he be allowed to exercise his privilege of presiding as provided in \u00a7 29 of the charter, the rule would be void as repugnant to the statute under which the committee derives its powers. Reading the rule, however, in the light of the provisions of the city charter, we think that its true construction is that the chairman shall preside at all meetings of the committee when the mayor does not attend and exercise his privilege of presiding under the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-11\"> This provision followed the portion of \u00a7 29 quoted <em>supra, </em>page 437, and was as follows: \u201cThe committee shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of its members and shall determine the rules of its proceedings.\u201d \u2014 Reporter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
