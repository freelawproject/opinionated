The vessels and cargoes arrived safely at Surinam, but the cargo could be sold foi nothing hut the paper currency of that country \u2014 neither molasses nor specie could be procured for it \u2014 -it could be exchanged for nothing but sugar or coffee, each of which was contraband by the law of that country, but were notwithstanding, usually and commonly purchased by the ships and vessels of all nations resorting thither, and there had been no instance of a seisure or information lodged with the officers of toe government for many years \u2014 the tobacco was exchanged for svgan: \u2014 and after they were shipped, a vessel in the harbor laden with sugar, was seized \u2014 it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>then became necessary to re-laud the sugars, and have th'-m conveyed to another part of the sea coast, and for the D&lt; fendant\u2019s vessels to depart as if for their homeward voyage, and to return secretly and take in the sugars.\u2014 AU this wa- done, and about one half of the sugars were lost in the operation, getting wet when put into the flats\u2014 the vessels took in the sugars in this damaged state, and carried them to Guadaloupe.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b321-5\">Counsel for the Plaintiff</attorneys>\n\n<attorneys id=\"b321-7\">\n<em>E contra</em>\n</attorneys>\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b320-5\">EDENTON,</p><p id=\"AWu\">A factor, agent or consignee ought to pursue the directions given by his principal with respect to the goods committed to his care \u2014 if instructed to sell for ready money, or to sell generally, which is for ready money, lie cannot sell upon credit, without running the risk himself \u2014 if he fails to pay customs in a foreign port, lie runs the risk of the forfeiture if any should ensue thereupon \u2014 if he attempts to transport goods prohibited to be exported, and his own government should seize the goods, the loss is his own, 2 <em>Mb. </em>100. <em>Vide </em>3 <em>P. fVil. </em>185, 187\", 279. <em>Cow. </em>255,</p><p id=\"Ayk\">It was argued, that though in general the law is as stated on the other side respecting factors or consignees, and their consignments, yet sometimes <em>impotmtia eoemsat legem. </em>Exceptions may be made to this general rule where the Defendant., the consignee, proves to the satisfaction of his jury, that it was impossible to comply with the terms of the commission given by his principal; if lie cannot sell .for ready money, when empowered to sell; and that is implied in the case in 2 <em>Mo. </em>100, where one of the reasons rendered by the court for their judgment, is, for that, lie did not plead he could not sell for ready money, implying if this had appeared to the court, then judgment would have heendifferent. By parity of reason, if he could not exchange the consigned good- for goods of the country that were legally exportable, though in general he ought not to exchange for contraband goods; yet. in a case like the present, where such goods in the common course of trade were usually and generally pur-ch-.sed, and it was generally thought not to be unsafe to purchase them, there ought to be -411 exception from rhe general rule \u2014 and ot that opinion were the. court \u2014 and th'-.-s- was a verdict for the value of the'sugars saved, and judgment.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
