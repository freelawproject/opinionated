Lacking the requisite adversity and genuineness of controversy, and because appeals are taken from judgments and not from opinions, the instant appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Briefly, by way of background, plaintiff is a resident and taxpayer of Union City, where Hudson Heights owns property on 37th Street that it seeks to develop. Because the property is located in a mixed residential zone, which does not permit multifamily development, a use variance is required to implement defendant\u2019s plan to demolish an existing residential structure and construct in its stead a multi-family building.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">To this end, on December 23, 2005, Hudson Heights filed an application with the Board seeking approval to build an eight-story multi-family structure consisting of 96 residential units and 121 off-street parking spaces.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A public hearing on the proposal was held on January 12, 2006. The Board approved the application and a memorializing resolution was adopted on February 9, 2006. No appeal was ever filed challenging the Board\u2019s action in approving defendant\u2019s site plan application.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>On July 12, 2006, Hudson Heights filed a new application, seeking site plan and variance approval to construct a four-story, forty-eight unit multi-family residential building on the same property. Following a public hearing on the proposal, the Board approved the application and adopted a memorializing resolution on October 12, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Thereafter, plaintiff filed a timely complaint in lieu of prerogative writs, seeking to invalidate the Board\u2019s approval of defendant\u2019s forty-eight unit plan. Following a hearing, the Law Division dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Plaintiff appealed and we reversed, holding that the Board incorrectly applied the \u201cD3\u201d conditional use variance standard rather than the proper standard of a \u201cDl\u201d use variance, and remanding the matter to the Board for reconsideration. Price <em>v. Hudson Heights Development, LLC, </em>No. A-4766-06T1, 2008 WL 5119157 (App.Div. Dec. 8, 2008). Hudson Heights took no further action with respect to its forty-eight unit application and thus no final approvals were obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">During the pendency of that appeal, Hudson Heights requested and received two one-year extensions on the site plan and variance approval that it had previously obtained from the Board for the ninety-six unit project. The first was granted on April 12, 2007 and the second was granted on May 8, 2008.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, on January 7, 2009, defendant filed yet another application with the Board, this time seeking major subdivision, site plan and variance approval for the construction of eight three-family homes on the same property. After a public hearing on the proposal, the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>approved the application and adopted a memorializing resolution on February 24,2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Hudson Heights did not take any additional steps to perfect the major subdivision plan and no permits were issued in furtherance of that project. Instead, defendant reverted to its original plan to develop its property as an eight-story, ninety-six residential unit structure. To effectuate that plan, defendant sought building permits from the Union City Building Department, but when the construction code officer noticed multiple approvals for the same property, he consulted with David Spatz, the City Planner, before issuing any permits. Spatz, questioning whether the original approvals were still valid, instructed defendant to seek advice from Thomas Sarlo, the Board\u2019s attorney, which defendant did via letter of July 28, 2009. Although Spatz opined that defendant\u2019s approval for the ninety-six unit structure had not expired because of the interim extensions and applicability of the Permit Extension Act, all agreed that defendant should formally request clarification from the Board. As a result, the matter was listed on the Board\u2019s July 30, 2009 agenda as an \u201cinterpretation,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-70(b), and, on that date, the Board confirmed that defendant\u2019s original approval was still valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Plaintiff then filed another complaint in lieu of prerogative writs, seeking to invalidate the Board\u2019s July 30, 2009 action on the ground that defendant abandoned its ninety-six residential unit plan by its subsequent applications. At the conclusion of trial on November 6, 2009, the Law Division judge declared the Board\u2019s July 30, 2009 determination null and void, concluding that the Board \u201chad no authority to hear this matter and provide what amounted to a[n] advisory opinion,\u201d effectively returning the parties to the \u201cstatus quo.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">I\u2019m prepared to find that the [B]oard had no authority under the Municipal [L]and [UJse [Law] to consider this question and that therefore it had no authority to act. And therefore Mr. Price is right, they had no authority to act and I am reversing the decision of the [B]oard as to its actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Having found that the Board lacked jurisdiction to act, the judge did not reach the issue of abandonment. This appeal by plaintiff follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Although the trial judge did not void the Board\u2019s action for the reason plaintiff advanced, plaintiff nevertheless obtained the ultimate relief he sought, namely invalidation of the Board\u2019s July 30, 2009 resolution. Having succeeded, plaintiff cannot be said to have been aggrieved by the judgment of the Law Division from which he now seeks to appeal. Indeed, plaintiff has no personal or pecuniary interest or property right adversely affected by the judgment in issue. <em>Howard Sav. Inst. v. Peep, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>494, 499, 170 A.2d 39 (1961); <em>Daly v. High Bridge Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 15-16, 575 A.2d 1373 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>356, 585 A.2d 366 (1990); <em>see also </em>Mandel, <em>New Jersey Appellate Practice, </em>ch. 2:4-2 (2010). Consequently, plaintiff is not entitled to appeal from the judgment in his favor. <em>Howard Sav. Inst., supra, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>at 499, 170 A.2d 39 (holding that \u201c[o]nly a party aggrieved by a judgment may appeal therefrom\u201d); <em>Hughes v. Eisner, </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>228, 229, 84 A.2d 626 (1951) (dismissing for want of jurisdiction an appeal from a party who was successful in the Appellate Division but appealed out of dissatisfaction with the court\u2019s opinion); <em>Green v. Blackwell, </em>32 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>768, 770 (E. &amp; A.1880) (\u201c[I]t is certain that there can be no appeal from an order by which a party is not aggrieved. The very object of the appeal is to redress an injury. If there be no injury to redress, there can be no appeal____\u201d (quoting <em>Coryell v. Holcombe, </em>9 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>650, 652 (E. &amp; A.1854))); <em>Janicky v. Point Bay Fuel, Inc., </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>203, 207-08, 981 A.2d 96 (App.Div.2009) (holding that, when the parties consent to entry of a final judgment memorializing a settlement of all claims in an action, there no longer exists a justiciable controversy from which a party may appeal); <em>Popow v. Wink Assocs., </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 528, 636 A.2d 74 (App.Div.1993) (\u201c[A] litigant may not appeal from a judgment or so much of a judgment which is in that party\u2019s favor.\u201d); <em>Malhame v. Borough of Demarest, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 31, 415 A.2d 358 (App.Div.1980) (dismissing the borough\u2019s appeal because \u201cthe borough was not an aggrieved party entitled to appeal from the judgment\u201d since the trial judge ruled in its favor).</p>\n<citation id=\"b495-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>10 A.3d 236</citation>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Correspondingly, because an appeal questions the propriety of <em>action </em>below, the rationale underlying the action is not independently appealable. <em>Mandel, supra, </em>ch. 2:4-2. In other words, appeals are taken from judgments, not opinions of the trial court. <em>Do-Wop Corp. v. City of Rahway, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>191, 199, 773 A.2d 706 (2001); <em>Heffner v. Jacobson, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>550, 553, 498 A.2d 766 (1985); <em>Hughes v. Eisner, supra, </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>at 229, 84 A.2d 626; <em>Arons v. N.J. Network, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 181, 775 A.2d 778 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>388, 788 A.2d 772 (2001); <em>Home Props. of N.Y. v. Ocino, Inc., </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>604, 616, 775 A.2d 671 (App.Div.2001); <em>Glaser v. Downes, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 16, 312 A.2d 654 (App.Div.1973), <em>certif. denied, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>513, 317 A.2d 726 (1974). Thus, a party, such as plaintiff, who obtains the judgment sought, may not be heard to complain on appeal about the reasons or rationales cited for the action. <em>Mandel, supra, </em>ch. 2:4-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The appeal is therefore dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-11\"> In an earlier application submitted to the Board on August 4, 2004, not here in issue, defendant sought approval to erect an eleven-story building with 110 residential units on the same 37th Street property. On May 12, 2005, the Board approved the application consistent with agreed-upon modifications, including the elimination of one stoiy, reduction to ninety-eight units and a front setback <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>of five feet.
