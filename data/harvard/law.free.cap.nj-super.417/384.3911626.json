We conclude that a party who brings an action that is shown to have been a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for the cessation of conduct alleged to violate the Civil Rights Act may qualify as a prevailing party entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">In 2006, the governing body of the defendant Township of Union adopted an ordinance regulating sexually-oriented businesses. This ordinance imposed certain restrictions upon the operation of such businesses, including limitations upon their conduct and hours of operation and the imposition of substantial licensing fees, which had not existed before.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">Plaintiff D. Russo, Inc., which operates a live nude-dancing establishment in Union called Hott 22, and plaintiffs Expo Video Unlimited, LLC and Bokram, Inc., which operate stores in Union that sell sexually-oriented books, movies and products, brought separate actions under the Civil Rights Act, which were subsequently consolidated, challenging the validity of the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>regulating sexually-oriented businesses under the free speech guarantee of the New Jersey Constitution. <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, H 6. Plaintiffs obtained temporary restraints and then a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the ordinance, which remained in effect throughout the course of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Union twice amended its ordinance regulating sexually-oriented businesses. Plaintiffs claim that those amendments were designed to address the constitutional deficiencies in the original ordinance they had identified in their complaints and that the \u201csuccessor ordinances were arguably less offensive to the Constitution.\u201d Nevertheless, plaintiffs subsequently filed amended complaints, which alleged that the amended ordinances regulating sexually-oriented businesses still violated their rights under the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">On March 11, 2009, Union advised the trial court that it had repealed the amended ordinance regulating sexually-oriented businesses. Plaintiffs claim that their challenges to the validity of the ordinance were the catalyst for its repeal and that, but for their actions, the ordinance would have remained in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Following the repeal of the ordinance, plaintiffs filed a motion under <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:6-2(1) for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. In opposing plaintiffs\u2019 motion, Union contended not only that the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d should not apply in determining whether a litigant is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:6\u20142(f), but also that it had repealed its ordinance regulating sexually-oriented businesses for reasons unrelated to the pendency of this litigation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and therefore, plaintiffs could not qualify as prevailing parties even under the catalyst theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>By a written opinion dated July 31, 2009, the trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Relying upon the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 decision in <em>Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, </em>532 <em>U.S. </em>598, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001), which rejected application of the catalyst theory in determining whether a plaintiff qualified as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the sections of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and Americans with Disabilities Act authorizing awards of attorney\u2019s fees, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3613(e)(2), 12205, the court concluded that the catalyst theory cannot be relied upon by a party seeking attorney\u2019s fees under <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:6-2(f). Having reached this conclusion, the court did not make any findings regarding the role this litigation played in Union\u2019s decision to repeal its ordinance regulating sexually-oriented businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">On September 3, 2009, the trial court entered an order of dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints \u201cwith prejudice by consent,\u201d which was followed by this appeal from the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Before considering the applicability of the catalyst theory to a determination of prevailing party status under <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:6\u20142(f), we note that plaintiffs could be entitled to an award of at least a portion of their attorney\u2019s fees even if the catalyst theory were held to be inapplicable. Subsequent to <em>Buckhannon, </em>a number of federal courts of appeals have held that a party who obtains a preliminary injunction against enforcement of a statute that is later repealed, thus mooting that party\u2019s challenge to the statute, may be a prevailing party entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under a federal fee-shifting statute for the legal work performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>in obtaining the injunction. <em>See, e.g., Common Cause/Georgia v. Billups, 554 </em>F.3d 1340, 1356 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- <em>U.S. </em>-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>2770, 174 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>271 (2009); <em>Dearmore v. City of Garland, </em>519 <em>F.3d </em>517, 520-26 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>131, 172 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>240 (2008). Our courts also have recognized that success in obtaining preliminary injunctive relief may provide a sufficient foundation for an award of the attorney\u2019s fees under a fee-shifting statute even though the case became moot before a final adjudication. <em>See, e.g., Westfield Ctr. Serv., Inc. v. Cities Serv. Oil Co., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>453, 472, 432 A.2d 48 (1981); <em>Patterson v. Vernon Twp. Council, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>329, 334-35, 901 A.2d 411 (App.Div.2006). <em>But see Right to Choose v. Byrne, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>287, 317-18, 450 A.2d 925 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">Because we conclude that plaintiffs may seek recovery of their attorney\u2019s fees on the ground this action was allegedly the catalyst for repeal of the challenged ordinance and the parties have not briefed the question whether plaintiffs would be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees based on their success in obtaining preliminary injunctive relief, we have no need to decide whether plaintiffs may be entitled to a portion of their attorney\u2019s fees on this ground. However, if the trial court determines on remand that plaintiffs\u2019 actions were not the catalyst for Union\u2019s repeal of its ordinance regulating sexually-oriented businesses, plaintiffs may pursue recovery of a portion of their attorney\u2019s fees on this alternative ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">Under the catalyst theory, as described by our Supreme Court in <em>Mason v. City of Hoboken, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>51, 72, 951 A.2d 1017 (2008), a litigant will qualify as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under a fee-shifting statute if the lawsuit \u201cachieves the desired result because [it] brought about a voluntary change in the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d (quoting <em>Buckhannon, supra, </em>532 <em>U.S. </em>at 601, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1838, 149 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 861). In the absence of a judgment or enforceable consent decree, the catalyst theory entitles a plaintiff to an award of attorney\u2019s fees if it \u201ccan demonstrate: (1) \u2018a factual causal nexus between plaintiffs litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>tion and the relief ultimately achieved\u2019; and (2) \u2018that the relief ultimately secured by plaintiffs had a basis in law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76, <em>951 </em>A.2d 1017 (quoting <em>Singer v. State, 95 N.J. </em>487, 495, 472 A.2d 138, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>832, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>121, 83 L.Ed.2d 64 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In <em>Mason, </em>the Court held that the catalyst theory applies to a request for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Open Public Records Act (OPRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 to -13. 196 <em>N.J. </em>at 75-76, 951 A.2d 1017. In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied on the fact that an award of attorney\u2019s fees in an action under OPRA is mandatory, that a prevailing party in an action under OPRA may not recover money damages, and the important public interests promoted by OPRA <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">However, the Court\u2019s rationale for applying the catalyst theory in <em>Mason </em>extends beyond requests for attorney\u2019s fees under OPRA The Court began its discussion of this issue by recognizing that \u201cNew Jersey law has long recognized the catalyst theory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 951 A2d 1017. The Court then surveyed a series of its own decisions and decisions of this court in which the catalyst theory had been applied in granting attorney\u2019s fees under fee-shifting statutes other than OPRA <em>See id. </em>at 73-75, 951 A.2d 1017. Most significantly, the Court quoted with seeming approval our decision in <em>Warrington v. Village Supermarket, Inc., </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 420-23, 746 A.2d 61 (App.Div.2000), which applied the catalyst theory to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the fee-shifting provision of the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-27.1. <em>See Mason, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 73-74, 951 A.2d 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The Senate sponsor\u2019s statement to the Civil Rights Act indicates that one of its purposes was \u201cto address potential gaps which may exist under remedies currently provided by [LAD].\u201d New Jersey Civil Rights Act, Sponsor\u2019s Statement to <em>S. 1558, </em>211th Leg. (2004). Thus, there is a close relationship between LAD and the Civil Rights Act. Furthermore, the language of the fee-shifting provisions of these civil rights statutes is similar: <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-27.1 provides that \u201cthe prevailing party may be awarded a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>able attorney\u2019s fee,\u201d and <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:6\u20142(f) provides that \u201cthe court may award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Therefore, these provisions should be given the same construction. <em>See T.H. v. Div. of Dev. Disabilities, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>478, 493, 916 A.2d 1025 (2007) (\u201c[W]hen the Legislature uses the same term in cognate statutes, unless it expressly provides otherwise, the term should be given the same meaning in both\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Our decisions interpreting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1 include Warrington, which expressly held that the catalyst theory should be applied in determining who is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1. 328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 420-23, 746 A.2d 61. We see no reason to reach a different conclusion with respect to the meaning of \u201cprevailing party\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:6\u20142(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Union argues that because the Court in <em>Mason </em>distinguished <em>Buckhannon </em>on the ground that \u201cunlike other fee-shifting statutes, OPRA does not provide for damages,\u201d 196 <em>N.J. </em>at 76, 951 A.2d 1017, the Court would follow <em>Buckhannon </em>in interpreting a fee-shifting provision in a statute, such as the Civil Rights Act, which authorizes an award of damages for a violation. <em>See </em>10:6-2(c). However, the mere fact that the Court noted this distinction when declining to follow <em>Buckhannon </em>in interpreting OPRA does not indicate that the Court would hold the catalyst theory inapplicable in interpreting the fee-shifting provision of a statute that provides for an award of damages. Indeed, there are a number of contrary indications in the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Mason. </em>The Court expressly noted that \u201cNew Jersey law has long recognized the catalyst theory,\u201d 196 <em>N.J. </em>at 73, 951 A.2d 1017; it characterized the majority opinion in <em>Buckhannon </em>as having \u201cadopted a narrow view of the term \u2018prevailing party,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 71, 951 A.2d 1017; and it quoted with seeming approval our opinion in Warrington, which held that the catalyst theory applies to an application for attorney\u2019s fees under LAD, <em>id. </em>at 73-74, 951 A.2d 1017. Therefore, there is no basis for concluding that the Court in <em>Mason </em>implicitly overruled Warrington simply because it relied in part on the absence of any damages remedy in OPRA to distinguish <em>Buckhan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>non. </em>And for the reasons previously set forth, the catalyst theory should be applied in the same manner to attorney\u2019s fee applications under the Civil Rights Act as under LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Finally, we note that there are substantial policy reasons for applying the catalyst theory in determining who is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the Civil Rights Act. Although <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:6-2(c) authorizes an award of damages, parties who are granted preliminary injunctive relief, such as plaintiffs, may suffer no monetary loss as a result of conduct that allegedly violated their civil rights, other than incurring the attorney\u2019s fees and costs required to enjoin that conduct and to encourage defendant\u2019s cessation of the violation of their civil rights. The denial of an award of attorney\u2019s fees under such circumstances, as pointed out in Justice Ginsburg\u2019s dissent in <em>Buckhannon, </em>\u201callows a defendant to escape a statutory obligation to pay a plaintiffs counsel fees, even though the suit\u2019s merit led the defendant to abandon the fray, to switch rather than fight on, to accord plaintiff sooner rather than later the principal redress sought in the complaint.\u201d 532 <em>U.S. </em>at 622, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1850, 149 L.Ed.2d at 874. Therefore, we believe our Supreme Court would decline to follow <em>Buckhannon </em>in interpreting the fee-shifting provision of the New Jersey Civil Rights Act and would instead recognize the appropriateness of applying the catalyst theory in this context. <em>See L.W. v. Toms River Reg\u2019l Sch. Bd. of Educ., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>381, 405, 915 A.2d 535 (2007) (noting that \u201c[ajlthough [the] Court may look to federal jurisprudence for guidance when interpreting the LAD, [the Court] will not hesitate to depart \u2018from federal precedent if a rigid application of its standards is inappropriate under the circumstances\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Lehmann v. Toys R\u2019 Us, Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>587, 601, 626 A.2d 445 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the order denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees and remand the case to the trial court to determine whether plaintiffs are entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the test for the application of the catalyst theory set forth in <em>Mason, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 76, 951 A.2d 1017. On the remand, Union also may present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>whatever evidence it may have to support its claim that plaintiffs entered into a binding agreement not to seek attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\"> Union claimed that it repealed the ordinance because the prosecutor had successfully enforced <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:34-7, which prohibits the location of any sexually-oriented business within 1000 feet of any place of worship, school, playground, child care center, area zoned for residential use, or any other sexually-oriented business, against D. Russo, Inc. Russo had brought a separate action against the prosecutor and Union County challenging the constitutionality of their enforcement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-7 against the operation of its business. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The trial court rejected this challenge, but we recently reversed the dismissal of that action in an unreported opinion and remanded for further proceedings. <em>D. Russo, Inc. v. Romankow, </em>Docket No. A-0633-08T1, 2010 <em>WL </em>3720292 (Sept. 17, 2010). Plaintiffs Expo Video Unlimited and Bokram were not parties to that action, apparently because the prosecutor had not undertaken enforcement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-7 against them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
