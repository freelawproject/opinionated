On appeal, defendant presents the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-15\">Point I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>THE DECISION OF THE HUDSON COUNTY LAW DIVISION, WHEREIN THE COURT RULED THAT THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT WAS NOT ENTITLED TO THE HISTORICAL ALCOTEST DATA DOWNLOAD INFORMATION, HAS BEEN RENDERED MOOT BY THE APPELLATE DIVISION\u2019S RULING IN <em>STATE V. REARDON, </em>WHEREIN SUCH DISCOVERY WAS ORDERED TO BE PROVIDED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">Point II\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">THE LAW DIVISION ERRED IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR ADDITIONAL DISCOVERY SINCE NO RECORD HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE MUNICIPAL COURT FOR THE LAW DIVISION TO RELY UPON IN THE CONTEXT OF TRIAL DE NOVO.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The record reflects that on August 6, 2006 at approximately 10:25 p.m., defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated, <em>N.J.SA </em>39:4-50, speeding, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-98, and making an illegal U-turn, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-125. An Alcotest was administered, creating a reading of 0.19 blood alcohol content.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Chun, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>54, 943 A.2d 114, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>158, 172 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008), defense counsel moved for the following discovery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\">1) Downloaded Alcotest results from the subject matter instrument from the date of the last calibration until Defendant\u2019s breath tests pursuant to the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s Order attached to the <em>Chun </em>Opinion as set forth on page 8,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>3.B. of same;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-12\">2) the calculation set forth in the foregoing Order on page 3,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A.(l)(a) for the purported two breath sample results of Defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-13\">3) any repair logs or written documentation relating to repairs of the subject matter Alcotest as set forth in <em>Chun </em>on page 124,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> footnote 48;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-14\">4) to advise Defendant whether, and when, the fuel cell drift algorithm has been implemented since the subject matter Alcotest was last calibrated (see <em>Chun </em>Order on page 7,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at subsection 2.F.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">Thereafter, a municipal court judge entered an order denying the first, third and fourth discovery requests and granting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>second. No record of any argument on the motion exists, and the judge did not specify the grounds for his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The matter came before a different municipal court judge for trial. At that time, defense counsel stated that he wished to file an interlocutory appeal from the order denying discovery. However, after defense counsel placed on the record his arguments regarding the discovery, and after the State had responded, the judge denied counsel\u2019s motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal, but preserved the issue by permitting defendant to enter a conditional plea of guilty to the charge of driving while intoxicated. A plea was entered, and defendant was sentenced. The charges of speeding and making an illegal U-turn were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Defendant appealed to the Law Division. At that time, defense counsel again raised the discovery issue and argued to the Law Division judge that the matter should be remanded in order for a record to be created on that issue. The Law Division judge declined to do so and determined to decide the discovery issue anew. After hearing argument, the judge denied discovery, ruling that none of the requests fell within the \u201cthe enunciated fundamental documents required [by <em>Chun </em>] to be produce[d] in discovery by the State\u201d and that defendant had not shown how the discovery was otherwise relevant. The judge therefore enforced the plea agreement and imposed sentence upon defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">This appeal, which has been limited to discovery requests one and three,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Discovery in the municipal courts is governed by <em>Rule </em>7:7-7, which provides in \u201call cases involving a consequence of magnitude,\u201d that \u201crelevant\u201d discovery substantially similar to that enumerated in <em>Rule </em>3:13\u20143(b) shall be provided on written notice to the municipal prosecutor. The present matter is considered a ease involving a consequence of magnitude to which the discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>rule applies. <em>State v. Utsch, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>575, 579, 446 A.2d 1236 (App.Div.1982); <em>see also State v. Tull, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 493, 560 A.2d 1331 (Law Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We have discussed the scope of discovery available to a municipal court defendant in a prosecution for driving while intoxicated as established by breathalyzer results in <em>State v. Ford, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>44, 572 A.2d 640 (App.Div.1990), a case in which defendants requested approximately 100 items of discovery and received in response approximately eleven separate items including drunk-driving reports, narratives of the investigations and certificates of analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 572 A.2d 640. In analyzing the discovery requests, we noted that \u201ca defendant in a drunk driving case is entitled to discovery of all the relevant materials listed in the 11 categories enumerated in <em>R. </em>3:13-3(a).\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 48, 572 A.2d 640. However, we noted that \u201c[u]nlike discovery in civil cases, information cannot be demanded which merely leads to other information which is \u2018relevant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Tull, supra, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 499-500, 560 A.2d 1331 and citing <em>State in Interest of W.C., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>218, 221-22, 426 A.2d 50 (1981)). We stated further that: \u201c \u2018While our system recognizes a defendant\u2019s right to have complete discovery, \u201callowing a defendant to forage for evidence without <em>a reasonable basis </em>is not an ingredient of either due process or fundamental fairness in the administration of the criminal laws.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 572 A.2d 640 (quoting <em>State v. Laurick, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>464, 473, 555 A.2d 1133 (App.Div.1989), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>1, 575 A.2d 1340, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>967, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>429, 112 L.Ed.2d 413 (1990), quoting <em>State v. R.W., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>14, 28, 514 A.2d 1287 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Nonetheless, we noted that in <em>Romano v. Kimmelman, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>66, 82, 474 A.2d 1 (1984), the Court had recognized that breathalyzer test results would generally be admissible in evidence when the breathalyzer was shown to be in proper working order, when the breathalyzer test was shown to have been administered by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>qualified operator, and it was used in accordance with accepted procedures. <em>Ford, supra, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 50, 572 A.2d 640. We then stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">Although the presumption of reliability is irrebuttable once the State establishes certain facts, <em>see State v. Downie, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>450[, 569 A.2d 242, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>819, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>63, 112 L.Ed.2d 38 (1990) ], inquiry regarding these facts is extremely material. Thus information concerning the conditions under which the tests were held, the machine operator\u2019s competence, the particular machine\u2019s state of repair and identification and documentation of the ampoules used for defendant\u2019s tests are all relevant inquiries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 51, 572 A.2d 640 (citing <em>Romano, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 474 A.2d 1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Moreover, we rejected the argument that, to obtain discovery, the defendant must know of the existence of flawed procedures or equipment. In doing so, we quoted with approval the following statement by the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\"><em>R. </em>3:13-3 permits a defendant \u201cto inspect and copy or photograph any relevant\u201d materials on request. The State argues on appeal that much of the requested discovery was not \u201crelevant.\u201d Its position is that only those requests based upon a defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of facts supporting defense contentions are relevant. This is incorrect. A defendant, for example, need not <em>know </em>flawed procedures were used in giving a breathalyzer test in order to require the State to disclose information about those procedures. That information is relevant because it \u201c(1) concerns an issue involved in the prosecution, and (2) tends, reasonably, to prove a fact material to such an issue.\u201d <em>Tull, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 499 [560 A.2d 1331]. The State\u2019s position would require defendants to discover information favorable to them <em>before R. </em>3:13-3 discovery could be undertaken. That is not the way our system works.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 49, 572 A.2d 640.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">The relevance of repair records was also noted in the context of Alcotest devices in <em>Chun, </em>where the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">The record includes scant evidence relating to repair history of any of these devices. Presumably the devices that were part of the evidence in the prosecutions for the named defendants were so newly put into service that no repairs have been needed. At the same time, there is evidence suggesting that from time to time one or more of the devices has been adjusted by a coordinator or returned to Draeger for repair. The record reflects that in either event, a document is generated by the coordinators that evidences those repairs. We commend to the State the establishment of a protocol for maintaining repair logs to the extent that these become more frequent and, therefore, potentially relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\"><em>[Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 145, 943 A.2d 114.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">The Supreme Court has held in the context of discovery in a criminal matter: \u201cThis Court\u2019s policy concerning pretrial discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>ery has been to encourage the presentation of all relevant material to the jury as an aid in the establishment of truth through the judicial process. The pretrial discovery practice promotes the quest for truth.\u201d <em>W.C., supra, 85 N.J. </em>at 221, 426 A.2d 50 (citing <em>State v. Cook, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>560, 563, 206 A.2d 359 (1965)). Given that statement of principle and the acknowledged relevance of the Alcotest repair records, we find that the Law Division judge misused his discretion when he denied discovery of such records pertaining to the Alcotest device used in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Defendant also requested downloaded Alcotest results from the date of the machine\u2019s last calibration. In <em>Chun, </em>the Court noted the significance of this data, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">[T]he Special Master recommended, and the parties by and large agree, that the State should create and maintain a centralized database of information regularly uploaded through modem (Special Master\u2019s Finding 7), and that defendants should have access to centrally collected and maintained data on them own cases, as well as to the compiled scientific data on matters involving others that has been redacted to shield the personal information related to those other individuals as appropriate (Special Master\u2019s Finding 2(h)). Our review of the record satisfies us that there is substantial, credible evidence that supports the Special Master\u2019s recommendation concerning the creation and maintenance of a regularly-updated database, as well as his recommendation relating to providing access to that data to defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\"><em>[Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 90, 943 A.2d 114 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Further, the Chun Court ordered that the State \u201cforthwith\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">[e]reate and maintain a centralized statewide database, comprised of downloaded Alcotest results, and shall make the data, following appropriate redactions of personal identification as needed, available to defendants and counsel____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">[Id. at 153, 943 A.2d 114.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">The subject of the database was addressed in a Memorandum dated April 29, 2008 from Gregory A. Paw, Director of the Division of Criminal Justice, to all municipal prosecutors and law enforcement executives. In that memorandum, Paw noted that the Supreme Court had contemplated \u201ca system by which breath tests results are \u2018regularly uploaded through a modem.\u2019 \u201d He stated that such a system did not presently exist. Further, Paw described practical difficulties in downloading the data on a local level and advised municipal prosecutors to resist discovery re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>quests \u201cgrounded in the inaccurate premise that data can quickly and easily be retrieved through a centralized system.\u201d Paw then suggested a procedure to municipal prosecutors in responding to defense requests for access to historical Alcotest readings. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">Each local police department currently has approximately 3 discs o\u00ed Alcotest data. The department could open the data stored on each disk, make the appropriate column adjustments, print a hard copy, redact all names, dates of birth and driver\u2019s license information, then use this data as a master copy. By arrangement with the municipal prosecutor, the police agency could either give defense counsel the opportunity to view the hard copy record at the agency\u2019s location or supply counsel with a separate hard copy (with associated costs of reproduction). Alternatively, the local agency can store the redacted files in an electronic medium on a new compact disc, and provide defense counsel with the opportunity to view, or receive a copy of, the compact disc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">(Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Thus, the Court has acknowledged the discoverability of this data and Paw has developed and promulgated a mechanism for providing it on an interim local basis while a statewide database is established. Moreover, in the present case, defense counsel has acknowledged his responsibility to pay any costs incurred in the production of the data. In these circumstances, we likewise find the denial of discovery in response to defendant\u2019s first request to have been mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">In the Findings and Conclusions Submitted to the Supreme Court by the Special Master in <em>Chun, </em>Judge King concluded that \u201ca proper foundation for the admission of an Alcotest 7110 reading\u201d should include \u201c[t]he testimony of the operator that the customary procedures have been meticulously followed and the production of the operator\u2019s credentials\u201d and twelve enumerated foundational documents that \u201cmust be provided by the municipal prosecutor in discovery\u201d that could be admitted in evidence as business records if kept in the normal course of the State\u2019s business. <em>Chun, Report and Recommendation of the Special Master, </em>Feb. 13, 2007, at 239, <em>reprinted at </em>2007 <em>N.J. LEXIS </em>39. Those foundational documents were discussed by the Supreme Court in its opinion. <em>Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 142\u201445, 943 A.2d 114. There, the Court noted that \u201c[ajlthough, as all parties agree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>these documents should continue to be produced in discovery, they are not fundamentally a part of demonstrating that the particular device was in good working order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144-45, 943 A.2d 114 (footnotes omitted). The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">The foundational documents that we conclude need to be entered into evidence therefore are few. They are: (1) the most recent calibration report prior to a defendant\u2019s test, with part I control tests, part II\u2014linearity tests, and the credentials of the coordinator who performed the calibration; (2) the most recent new standard solution report prior to a defendant\u2019s test; and (3) the certificate of analysis of the 0.10 simulator solution used in a defendant\u2019s control tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 145, 943 A 2d 114.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">We acknowledge that the two items of discovery requested by defendant in this case are not included in either Judge King\u2019s list of fundamental documents or in the more abbreviated list adopted by the Supreme Court. However, we do not regard that fact as acting as a restriction on discovery. As is clear from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, the foundational documents are required in order to establish the reliability of the Alcotest device utilized in connection with a particular prosecution. As in <em>Ford, </em>discovery of the sort defendant seeks is \u201cextremely material\u201d as a means to test that reliability. <em>Ford, supra, </em>240 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 51, 572 A.2d 640. It is accordingly required.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">As a result of the foregoing, we remand this matter to the municipal court with directions that the discovery sought by defendant be ordered. Upon its review, defendant may move to vacate his plea, should the evidence warrant that step.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">We decline to address defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, determining that they do not warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). We merely note that our decision in <em>State v. Reardon, </em>Motion No. M-0085-09 (App.Div. September 14, 2009), is not precedential, and that the order of the municipal judge denying the discovery at issue provided a sufficient basis for the Law Division judge\u2019s consideration of the discovery issue in connection with his de novo review of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Reversed and remanded to the municipal court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-16\"> <em>See Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 153, 943 A.2d 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-17\"> <em>See id. </em>at 150, 943 A.2d 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-18\"> This should be <em>id. </em>at 145, 943 A.2d 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b310-19\"> See <em>id. </em>at 152, 943 A.2d 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\"> At oral argument, defense counsel withdrew his request for discovery concerning the fuel cell drift algorithm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> That enumeration now appears in <em>Rule </em>3:13-3 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
