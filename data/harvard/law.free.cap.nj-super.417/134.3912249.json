On July 24, 2004, at approximately 4:00 a.m., he heard a knock at the front door to his apartment in Keansburg. As he opened the door, he saw an individual wearing a ski mask. He immediately shut the door, locked the deadbolt, and went toward his bedroom. Before Covington could make his way into the bedroom, the apartment door was forced open and he was pushed onto his bed. Covington did not see who entered the apartment. While on his knees, with his hand and chest facing down on the bed and a cover over his head, Covington felt something on \u201cthe back of [his] head\u201d and he was told by a \u201cwhite guy\u201d that \u201cit was a \u2018GAT\u2019 which is interpreted as a gun.\u201d According to Covington, \u201cthe white guy asked for money and drugs\u201d and proceeded to remove Covington\u2019s bracelet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">Meanwhile, a neighbor had called the Keansburg police and reported a break-in at Covington\u2019s apartment____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">Covington testified that after the police arrived at his apartment he removed the cover from over his head and saw the police \u201con top of\u201d defendant in the living room while the \u201cwhite guy\u201d sat next to Covington on his bed and codefendant Stevens stood by the dresser.... He had known defendant for about two or three months prior to the incident. On cross-examination, Covington admitted that he used to sell drugs from his apartment and that certain individuals whom he \u201cwould sell [drugs to] and get high with ... would just come in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">Within an hour after the incident, Covington went to police headquarters where he submitted a handwritten complaint. He returned home but later went back to police headquarters and provided Detective Gary Kronenberger with a formal statement. According to Covington\u2019s statement, three individuals broke into his apartment and a person by the name of \u201cWorld\u201d (codefendant Stevens) pushed him to the end of his bed while \u201cDonny\u201d (defendant) \u201cwent in [Covington\u2019s] pockets and took [his] money out.\u201d He noted in his statement that a \u201cwhite guy\u201d told him he \u201chad a GAT to the back of [his] head.\u201d He also stated, \u201c[t]hen I seen Donny going into the kitchen and World was in the same room looking in drawers, looking under the bed. Then all of a sudden I hear \u2018freeze, freeze,\u2019 then I look up and see Keansburg\u2019s finest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">In his statement, Covington mentioned that he had met World twice before, had known Donny for \u201cabout a month\u201d and had met the \u201cwhite guy ... just one time for about 15 minutes.\u201d He told the detective that \u201cWorld had the black stocking cap, the white guy had a blue do-rag over his face and I\u2019m not sure what Donny had on his face.\u201d After completing his formal statement, Covington reviewed the statement, certified that it was truthful, and signed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>[Id, </em>at 3-5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Prior to the commencement of trial on June 21, 2005, the judge noted that defendants were not in the courtroom, although all three attorneys were present. The judge stated that he had an application from the prosecutor for two material-witness warrants, one for Gregory Covington and one for Helen Brown. The judge noted that this was a matter that could have been handled in chambers; it was not a critical stage of the proceedings; and defendants\u2019 presence was not required. The judge heard from the prosecutor and then asked defense counsel if they wished to be heard. Both defense attorneys said that they had no objection to issuance of material-witness warrants. The judge granted the prosecutor\u2019s application and required that the warrants be served immediately and that the witnesses be brought before the court for questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">After a recess, defendants were brought to the courtroom at which time it was agreed that there were no pretrial motions that needed to be addressed, although certain issues were discussed. Before the jury was brought up, the judge addressed codefendant Stevens, who had a toothache, and explained that the Sheriffs\u2019 Department could not issue any medication to him in the courtroom. If it was still bothering him at lunchtime, the sheriffs officers would take him back to the jail for medication and return him to the courtroom by 1:80 p.m. for the resumption of the trial. At that point, the judge began jury selection. When he was ready to recess for lunch, defendant\u2019s counsel indicated that his client also needed to take his antibiotics and pain medication, which he took with every meal. The judge also released defendant to the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">At five minutes to three, the judge returned to the bench and advised counsel that defendants had finally been returned from the jail. At that point, there were only thirteen jurors in the box, and both jury panels had been exhausted. After instructing counsel and the sheriffs officers to make certain that such delays not be repeated, the judge observed that both defendants were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>\u201cdownstairs, ready to be brought up. But we have another issue at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Covington was in the courtroom, and the judge needed to address the material-witness warrant. The prosecutor explained that Covington had apparently not been served with the first subpoena, but after speaking with Covington, who wanted a lawyer, the prosecutor was not certain if he would appear the next day. As a result, the prosecutor asked the judge to determine whether Covington needed to be housed by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Defendant had not been brought to the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The judge then placed Covington under oath and questioned him about the subpoena that had been served on him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">Q Mr. Covington, I issued a material witness complaint for you today based on representations made by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of their inability to secure your attendance at this proceeding. In fact, they indicated they had served you with a subpoena to appear on June 20th, 2005, in Superior Court. That\u2019s yesterday. And that you were personally served with that subpoena on May 11, 2005, at 3:24 p.m. by Keansburg Det. Wayne Davis, Junior. Were you served with that subpoena?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">A I can\u2019t remember being served with the subpoena.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">Q Have you ever been served with a subpoena by a Keansburg detective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">A I can\u2019t recall being served no subpoena. I got served with one today after I was arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">Q You weren\u2019t arrested. Do you know Det. Wayne Davis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">A Yes, I know Det. Wayne Davis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">Q Did you see Det. Wayne Davis about a month ago at about 3:24 p.m. where he handed you a piece of paper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-15\">A I can\u2019t really recall because I see Wayne Davis a lot and I see him and his partner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-16\">Q Does he hand you pieces of paper a lot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-17\">A No, he doesn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-18\">Q So you don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-19\">THE COURT: Det. Davis is here in the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-20\">MR. LeMIEUX: Yes, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-21\">THE COURT: We will question him shortly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-22\">MR. LeMIEUX: Yes, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-23\">BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-24\">Q Mr. Covington, you are going to be served if you haven\u2019t already, with a notice that you have to be back in court tomorrow to testily in this case. Do you intend to appear if you are served with that notice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>A Yes, sir. If I\u2019m served I do intend to appeal- because I would have to be served in front of you and I don\u2019t want to cause no problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">Q Where do you live?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">A I live at ... apartment number eight. That\u2019s exactly where they picked me up at today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">Q What is your telephone number there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">A I don\u2019t have no phone number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">Q Who do you live there with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">A I live by myself, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">Q And do you have a job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">A Yes, I work but my job is right now slow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-13\">Q And you are served with a notice. Do you have means of transportation to get here tomorrow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-14\">A Yes, Ido.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-15\">Q How would you get here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-16\">A I would either catch the bus, get up early or either I catch a car, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-17\">Q How about if I arrange to have somebody pick you up tomorrow morning and bring you here so you don\u2019t have to pay any money for car fare, etcetera?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-18\">A I appreciate that, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-19\">At that point, the judge began to examine Covington about whether he would testify consistently with the statements he gave to the police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-20\">Q Okay. Now, the State is asking you to testify as a witness in the case, the alleged victim. And I assume that they wanted you to testify consistent with a statement that you may have given that I don\u2019t have a copy of, I don\u2019t know what it says. Do you intend to testify and answer the State\u2019s questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-21\">A Yeah, I intend to. And I talked to I guess it\u2019s the [pjrosecutor, and I made it clear to him that I can\u2019t recollect everything that happened that night due to the fact that it was late at night and it was so long ago and I was drinking, but I\u2019m going to testify to the best of my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-22\">Q Well, do you realize that if I deem you to be a reluctant witness that I can then have the prosecutor question you about the specific statement that you gave to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-23\">A I don\u2019t understand that part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-24\">Q Well, you gave a formal written statement to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-25\">THE COURT: Is that accurate, Mr. LeMieux?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-26\">MR. LeMIEUX: That is correct. He gave a handwritten statement and then he gave a formal written statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-27\">BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-28\">Q Have you had an opportunity to review those statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-29\">A Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Q And does that help refresh your recollection as to what you told the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">A A little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">Q If you were asked to testify and you are asked questions about your recollection, they are going to show you that statement and they are going to show you a handwritten statement in the other one. And they\u2019re going to expect that you are going to testify consistent with that. Was that the truth when you testified to it\u2014strike that\u2014when you gave those statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">A I can\u2019t remember that night, your Honor, what I said and if it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">Q Even being shown the documents doesn\u2019t help refresh your recollection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">A No. If it\u2019s possible I could write a statement out now and I can testify to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">Q How would you write the statement now? You just say you don\u2019t remember anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">A Because I told you that night I was drinking and it was late at night and I was frustrated. It was a lot going on that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-13\">THE COURT: Seems clear to me that we\u2019re going to need a <em>Gross </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing. The only question is do we do it today or do we do it tomorrow?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">The judge and the prosecutor then discussed when to schedule the <em>Gross </em>hearing and what action the prosecutor wished the judge to take to ensure Covington\u2019s appearance for trial. At the suggestion of the prosecutor, the judge examined Covington further after stating that the question was merely for the purposes of the material-witness issue; if a <em>Gross </em>hearing were required, it would be in defendant\u2019s presence. This round of questioning was confined to the material-witness issue. The judge then proceeded to the <em>Gross </em>hearing because Covington was there in court. Before beginning, he asked to have defendants brought to the courtroom. After defendants arrived, the prosecutor asked the judge to address the other material witness, Brown, who was in the prosecutor\u2019s office. The judge did so, and the prosecutor participated in the examination of Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">The judge prefaced the <em>Gross </em>hearing with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-16\">Now, based upon the discussion I had with Mr. Covington concerning the material witness complaint and his appearing, it became obvious to me that there is some reluctance on his part to testify in this ease and he may or may not testify consistently] with a statement he gave to the police in this matter. In light of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>fact, I\u2019m going to, at this time, hold a 104 hearing to determine whether or not he is a reluctant witness and whether or not there is enough evidence to convince me by a preponderance of the evidence that the State would be able to question [Covington] with his prior statement and in fact attempt to utilize that as substantive evidence in this case. That would be consistent with the rule on prior inconsistent statements under <em>[N.J.R.E.'i </em>803(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">After the judge ruled on the <em>Gross </em>issue, the matter proceeded to trial, and the above-described verdict was returned against defendant. We then affirmed his conviction, and the Supreme Court denied certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Defendant filed his PCR petition on April 7, 2008, and a verified amended petition for PCR was filed on November 3, 2008. In support of PCR, defendant verified the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">a) Defendant-petitioner was denied effective assistance of trial counsel in that: i. During the pre-trial hearing pursuant to [Gross, <em>supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>1, 577 A.2d 806], defense counsel failed to properly cross-examine Mr. Gregory Covington; \u00dc. Prior to the <em>Gross </em>healing, defense counsel failed to ensure the presence of defendant-petitioner while the <em>[c]omt </em>questioned Mr. <em>Covington, </em>thereby denying defendant-petitioner his right to confront the witnesses against him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">iii. After the trial, prior to the closing argument of the prosecutor, defense counsel failed to discuss the issue regarding the juror named Octavia Gadson. Because Ms. Gadson had a conflict with her job, defendant-petitioner was denied a fan- trial. Had defendant-petitioner been properly informed by his attorney of the job conflict with Ms. Gadson, he would have objected to her remaining on the jury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">iv. During the sentencing hearing, defense counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of the various municipalities where defendant-petitioner is alleged to have committed criminal offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">b) Defendant-petitioner was denied a fair trial because Mr. Covington was forced to testily against his will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">i. The trial court wrongly found that Mr. Covington was in fear of defendant-petitioner and reluctantly made eye contact with defendant-petitioner during the pre-trial hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">The PCR judge denied all relief on January 16, 2009. His decision respecting defendant\u2019s absence from the courtroom follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-13\">At trial, which was initially scheduled on June 20th, 2005, the State\u2019s witness, Gregory Covington, failed to appear. Subsequently, a material witness complaint was issued. This [c]ourt questioned Covington regarding his failure to appear when he appeared in court the next day. This [c]ourt then issued Covington a subpoena for his appearance and commenced a <em>Gross </em>healing to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>reliability and admissibility of Covington\u2019s July 24th, 2004[,] statements to the police. At the conclusion this [e]ourt found Covington\u2019s prior statements to be reliable and admissible pursuant to <em>[N.J.R.E. </em>803(a) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">Again, as I noted in going through the transcript, the defendant was only not in the courtroom for that discussion with Covington about his obligation to appear. It was not during any testimonial phase of the trial, of any <em>Gross </em>hearing or anything else. It was merely to advise him of his obligation, what would happen if he didn\u2019t, and to give him a notice for the next day to appear at the <em>Gross </em>hearing or that he had to continue to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">When the [e]ourt did conduct the <em>Gross </em>hearing, defendant was in the courtroom, as were both defendants and the attorneys and everyone was present. Nothing occurred outside of their presence by way of any trial testimony or motion testimony in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">The defendant argues that his Sixth Amendment rights to effective assistance of counsel were violated for the following reasons. One, defense counsel failed to insure [sic] his presence when the [e]ourt questioned Gregory Covington prior to the <em>Gross </em>hearing. And again, prior to the <em>Gross </em>hearing is correct. There was nothing about the <em>Gross </em>hearing that was discussed with Covington. It was merely his necessity to appear pursuant to a subpoena.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">After discussing the standards governing PCR claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the judge addressed defendant\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective in failing to secure defendant\u2019s presence during the questioning of Covington:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">Defendant claims that counsel was ineffective because he failed to secure defendant\u2019s presence during the questioning of Gregory Covington regarding his failure to appear under subpoena. \u201c[T]he right of confrontation is not absolute. The right of the accused to be present must be anchored to the reason[ ] for its existence. The right to meet one\u2019s accuser face to face iis] not guaranteed when presence would be useless[,J or the benefit but a shadow.\u201d <em>[State v. Zenquis, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>358, 364, 598 A.2d 245 (App.Div.1991) (citation and internal quotations omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>84, 618 A.2d 335 (1993) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">This [c]ourt found that the questioning of Gregory Covington regarding his failure to appear did not constitute a crucial part of the proceeding. The transcript previously cited, page 4, line 10 to page 4, line 12. This [c]ourt questioned Covington regarding his failure to appear to which Covington responded that he did not remember being served. Again, transcript page 21, line 2 to page 2, line 4, transcript one. When asked if he intended to testify at trial, Covington responded that he did and that he would testify to the best of his knowledge. Again, that\u2019s transcript page 23, line 4 to page 23, line 11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-12\">He was then served with a subpoena in the courtroom. Transcript page 26, line 23 to page 31, line 12. This [e]ourt believes that the defendant was not entitled to be present during the questioning of Covington as it was not a crucial part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>proceedings. Even if it was considered a crucial part, the defendant has not shown prejudice that resulted from his absence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">Defendant\u2019s presence during questioning would have been useless and thus his attendance was not required. The result of the questioning would have been exactly the same regardless of whether defendant was present or not. And therefore defendant\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective on this point has no merit. There was no opportunity nor should there have been for defense counsel to do any cross[-]examination on that issue of appearance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">Although the defendant frames this issue as one of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Appellate Court has decided that Covington\u2019s prior inconsistent statements were properly admitted under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>[803(a)(1)(A) ]. See the unpublished appellate opinion at page 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">Therefore, had the trial counsel objected and demanded the presence of the defendant, the objection most likely would have been overruled and the proceeding would have continued. Therefore the defendant\u2019s claim for post conviction relief will not be granted on this issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Defendant raises the following issue for our consideration: POINT I\u2014DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTIONS MUST BE REVERSED DUE TO INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL, IN THAT COUNSEL FAILED TO OBJECT TO, OR RAISE THE ISSUE OF, DEFENDANT\u2019S ABSENCE IN THE COURTROOM DURING A CRITICAL STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS.

Included within that guarantee is a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present in the courtroom during every \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the trial. <em>Zenquis, supra, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 363, 598 A.2d 245. A defendant\u2019s right to be present at trial is also protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cto the extent that a defendant\u2019s absence would hinder a fair and just hearing.\u201d <em>State v. Finklea, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>211, 216, 686 A.2d 322 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>837, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>110, 139 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>63 (1997); <em>see also Kentucky v.

Robertson, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499, 509, 755 A.2d 1249 (App.Div.2000). In New Jersey, a defendant\u2019s right to be present is protected by <em>Rule </em>3:16(b), which provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe defendant shall be present at every stage of the trial, including the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict, and at the imposition of sentence, unless otherwise provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ed by Rule.\u201d <em>See also State v.

Washington, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>36, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Physical presence of the defendant enhances the reliability of the fact-finding process and promotes \u201csociety\u2019s interest in having the accused and accuser engage in an open and even contest in a public trial.\u201d <em>Lee v.

Traditional justifications for a defendant\u2019s presence at critical stages of the proceedings are to enable the defendant to communicate with his attorney, assist counsel in the presentation of a defense, assist in cross-examination of witnesses, and influence the jury psychologically by defendant\u2019s presence. <em>State v.

The defendant was not present during the hearing and had argued that the court should have required his presence. <em>Ibid. </em>The court concluded that \u201cthe referenced events did not transform a ministerial proceeding into a critical stage.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Here, the events that transpired outside of defendant\u2019s presence are analogous to those in <em>Moltrer. </em>Covington\u2019s testimony outside of defendant\u2019s presence concerned his obligation to testify at trial and the fact that he could not recollect everything that had occurred on the night in question, which led the judge to conclude that a <em>Gross </em>hearing was required. We also note that defendant was present during the <em>Gross </em>hearing itself and that no substantive testimony was elicited from Covington before defendant returned to the courtroom. Further, during the <em>Gross </em>hearing, counsel for defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine Covington about the very issues raised outside of defendant\u2019s presence. Thus, even if defendant had a right to be present during the judge\u2019s examination of Covington prior to the <em>Gross </em>hearing, he would not have gained anything by attending. <em>See Gagnon, supra, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>at 527, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1482, 84 L.Ed.2d at 490.
