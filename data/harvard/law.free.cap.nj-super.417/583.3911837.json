Specifically, when a defendant stipulates to a finding of abuse and/or neglect at a fact-finding hearing, what information must counsel provide to the defendant to insure he or she has made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his or her rights, and what are the obligations of the judge in accepting such a stipulation? In this case, the issue arose in the context of a contentious divorce and bitter custody dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We conclude that neither defense counsel nor the judge provided defendant with the minimum, necessary information regarding the consequences of the stipulation. We also conclude that given the significant rights a defendant waives by entering such a stipulation, and the frequency with which issues regarding these stipulations are raised on appeal, trial counsel and Family Part judges must make specific inquiries of the defendant on the record, as set forth below, before accepting a stipulation. We also refer the matter to the Supreme Court\u2019s Committee on Practice in the Family Part, and the Acting Administrative Director of the Courts, and suggest that a form be adopted and used at all fact-finding hearings wherein the defendant intends to stipulate to a finding of abuse and/or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Defendant M.D. appeals from two orders of the Family Part. The September 10, 2009 order terminated the Title 9 litigation initiated by the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS or the Division) and granted defendant\u2019s ex-husband, S.D., custody of the couple\u2019s three minor children. The December 10, 2009 order denied defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Although not specifically listed in defendant\u2019s Notice of Appeal, based upon her brief and the arguments of counsel, two other orders entered by a different Family Part judge are also at issue. On April 11, 2008, after a \u201cDodd\u201d hearing, the judge ordered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>continued removal of defendant\u2019s children from her custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.31(b) (permitting \u201ccontinued removal [when] necessary to avoid an ongoing risk to the child\u2019s life, safety or health\u201d). At a September 17, 2008 fact-finding hearing, following defendant\u2019s stipulation, the judge entered an order finding that defendant had neglected her children by \u201cle[aving] the burners and oven on in the home to heat the home thus posing a risk to the minor children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">On appeal, defendant has raised the following points for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">POINT I: M.D. WAS DENIED EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL PRIOR TO AND DURING THE STIPULATION TO NEGLECT (not raised below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">POINT II: THE TRIAL COURT ERREp BY TRANSFERRING CUSTODY OF [George <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] TO HIS FATHER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">POINT III: M.D. WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS OF LAW AS THE CHANGE OF CUSTODY AT THE DISPOSITIONAL HEARING WAS CONDUCTED AT A LESSER EVIDENTIARY STANDARD THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THE CHANGE OF CUSTODY OCCURRED UNDER THE FM DOCKET.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">POINT IV: THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY INTERVIEWING THE CHILD N.D. AND THE SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEW OF N.D. AND S.D. WAS INADEQUATE, DID NOT GIVE COUNSEL FOR M.D. AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT QUESTIONS PURSUANT TO <em>R. </em>5:8-6, AND DID NOT GIVE M.D. AN OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE INTERVIEW (partially raised below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">POINT V: THE EMERGENCY REMOVAL (DODD) HEARING VIOLATED M.D.\u2019S CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHTS AS IT FAILED TO ESTABLISH THAT REMOVAL OF S.D. AND G.D. FROM M.D.\u2019S CARE WAS NECESSARY TO AVOID AN ONGOING RISK TO LIFE, SAFETY OR HEALTH OF THE CHILDREN.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Because we conclude that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel at the fact-finding hearing, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Defendant and S.D. are the parents of three children: a son, Neal, born in 1994; a daughter, Samantha, born in 1995; and a son, George, born in 2002. Well before DYFS initiated this complaint, defendant and S.D. had already appeared in the Family Part in other litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">For example, defendant had filed various domestic violence complaints against S.D. An amended final restraining order, dated October 27, 2006, granted defendant possession of the couple\u2019s home in Washington Township, barred S.D. from the residence and the children\u2019s elementary school, and awarded defendant custody of Samantha and George and gave S.D. custody of Neal.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In addition, defendant and S.D. were in the midst of a divorce. Although we cannot discern from the record when the complaint for divorce was filed, an order to show cause was entered on December 21, 2007, in the FM action granting S.D. temporary custody of all three children pending the return date on January 4, 2008. Defendant was granted \u201csupervised custody with the children at [S.D.\u2019s] discretion.\u201d The reasons, as listed by the judge on the face of the order, included S.D.\u2019s certification that defendant had been \u201chospitalized ... in an apparent suicide attempt.\u201d Although the order is not part of the record, the judge awarded defendant pendente lite custody of Samantha and George on the January return date. Thus, when these proceedings were initiated, on April 11, 2008, residential custody of Samantha and George remained with defendant, and Neal resided with his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The Division\u2019s verified complaint against defendant and S.D. sought custody of all three children. The complaint detailed the Division\u2019s contacts with the family, beginning in 1997 and ending with the removal of Samantha and George from defendant\u2019s custody on April 10, 2008. We recite some of the allegations to provide a more complete picture of the acrimonious relationship that existed between defendant and S.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>On June 2, 1999, DYFS received a report that Samantha, three years old at the time, was found alone at the Clinton Community Care Center. Defendant had left her daughter with an adult friend while she ran errands, and that friend had forgotten the child at the Center. No finding of abuse or neglect was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On September 12, 2001, the Division received a referral from the Crisis Intervention Unit (CIU) alleging that defendant was \u201can untreated bi-polar, [had] pulled a knife on [S.D.] th[at] morning,\u201d and was \u201csuicidal and homicidal.\u201d It is unclear who made the report to CIU.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">When contacted by DYFS, S.D. was \u201crather complacent.\u201d DYFS assessed defendant at her home that day, and, although she was \u201cvisibly upset,\u201d she \u201cwas not irrational or erratic.\u201d Defendant denied any history of mental illness and told the caseworker that she was planning to divorce S.D., citing financial difficulties and various incidents of domestic violence. Defendant told the caseworker that she had dismissed an earlier restraining order against S.D. after being pressured by him and his family. The CIU worker interviewed defendant\u2019s neighbors who \u201creiterated that [S.D.] was the problem not [defendant].\u201d Defendant was taken to the local police department, a domestic violence temporary restraining order was issued against S.D., and he was ordered to leave the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The Division\u2019s caseworker interviewed Neal and Samantha the next day. Neal denied that his mother had threatened S.D. with a knife and both denied that they were fearful of their parents. Neal told the caseworker that his parents \u201cha[d] been arguing a lot,\u201d and that they \u201cf[ou]ght a lot about money.\u201d When S.D. was interviewed by the Division two days later, he denied any incidents of domestic violence but admitted that defendant had previously obtained a restraining order against him. S.D. claimed that defendant was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder five years earlier, had repeatedly threatened him with knives and had threatened to kill him and the children. DYFS closed its case file in October 2001 without any finding of abuse or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>In December 2004, the Division received a referral from Florida Child Protective Services regarding an incident that occurred on November 24 while the family was attending a motocross event in that state.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the report, when S.D. returned from the event late in the evening, he found the three children standing outside the motel room. They claimed to have left the room because defendant was making too much noise. S.D. confronted defendant, who was apparently speaking with a man from a neighboring room, and physically assaulted her. S.D. was arrested that night and made bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">DYFS re-opened its file and conducted an investigation of the incident. Defendant told the caseworker that Neal was staying with S.D. in Florida. She claimed that her son went to Florida with S.D. every winter, had become \u201ca professional dirt bike racer,\u201d and, because he had missed so much school, was being \u201chome schooled while ... in Florida.\u201d Defendant told the caseworker that Samantha had been diagnosed with \u201cselective mutism,\u201d i.e., \u201cshe d[id] not talk to anyone she d[id] not know.\u201d The caseworker noted that Samantha did not respond when she greeted the child. George had \u201cdelayed speech\u201d and was receiving in-home therapy. Defendant told the caseworker that she had filed for divorce in August.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She also reiterated some of the history of domestic violence that existed between her and her husband. DYFS referred defendant to a local domestic abuse resource center.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In February 2005, DYFS received an anonymous report that defendant left the three children unsupervised at home on multiple occasions. The reporter also stated that Neal was not registered in school because S.D. took him to motocross events at which Neal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>was paid. A DYFS caseworker met with all five members of the D. family. Defendant denied leaving the children alone. However, she verified that Neal and S.D. \u201ctravelled] all over the country so that [Neal] c[ould] compete in ... motocross events[,]\u201d where he \u201cearn[ed] money.\u201d Defendant told DYFS that Neal was being tutored and was not \u201cmissing anything academically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">S.D. told the caseworker that his wife did not leave the children home alone. He also acknowledged that Neal was being privately tutored because he \u201cmiss[ed] too much school with his busy motocross schedule.\u201d S.D. denied any incidents of domestic violence other than his arrest in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Neal told the worker that defendant did not leave the children alone. Samantha \u201cdid not respond\u201d to the worker\u2019s questions and George was too young to be interviewed. The caseworker noted that the children appeared clean and healthy. DYFS again concluded that there was no abuse or neglect of the D. children and closed its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">On December 14, 2007, Neal, in the company of S.D., reported to his counselor at Hunterdon Behavioral Health that several days earlier, defendant had taken his cell phone, hit him in the arm and threatened to \u201crun him over with the car.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> S.D. stated that defendant had obtained a restraining order against him, that she had a \u201chistory of yelling\u201d at both him and the children, and that she \u201cthrew a knife at him\u201d on December 9. DYFS interviewed Neal the next day, during which the boy claimed that his mother was \u201cout of control,\u201d threatened to kill herself and \u201cneed[ed] help.\u201d DYFS interviewed defendant\u2019s mother who stated that \u201cneither parent [wa]s ... fit.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Defendant and S.D. were interviewed by a caseworker and both admitted to incidents of domestic violence in the home. S.D. said that he and defendant were going through a divorce, that he had custody of Neal, and, that while he did not intend to pursue custody of the other two children, he believed they should be removed from defendant\u2019s care. Defendant claimed that Neal was verbally and physically abusive toward her.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">DYFS interviewed Samantha. She corroborated defendant\u2019s claim that Neal tried to hit their mother, that S.D. and defendant frequently fought and that both parents asked her to \u201csay things against the other parent.\u201d George also told the caseworker that his parents fought all the time. DYFS concluded that the allegations of physical abuse by defendant toward Neal were unfounded, but recommended that defendant and S.D. undergo psychological evaluations and that the entire family attend therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">On December 21, 2007, DYFS received a referral from the Washington Township Police Department advising that defendant was taken to the Emergency Department at Warren Hospital. S.D. had called the police after receiving a text message from Samantha claiming that her mother was suicidal. Police officers dispatched to the family home convinced defendant to undergo a mental health assessment at the hospital. Defendant explained that she was not suicidal, and the crisis assessment team concluded that defendant was suffering from depression. After being issued a prescription, defendant was discharged. On the same day, S.D. sought the order to show cause we referenced above and obtained custody of all three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">DYFS again conducted an investigation. At the time, defendant was staying with her sister because the furnace in her home needed repair and there was no heat. The Washington Township home was also in foreclosure. Defendant claimed that she was not suicidal and that Samantha had misunderstood a phone conversation defendant was having with her sister. Defendant told the caseworker that S.D. had taken Neal and George with him to Bermuda on vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>DYFS then interviewed Samantha who doubted that she had misconstrued her mother\u2019s phone conversation. Samantha preferred to live with S.D. or her paternal grandmother because defendant was mean and \u201cd[id] not do anything for her,\u201d such as cook or clean. However, Samantha also told the caseworker that when she was mad at her grandmother, she sometimes texted defendant with false allegations, including claims that her grandmother was mean and hit her. The caseworker opined that Samantha seemed \u201ccoached\u201d on what to say during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">On January 18, 2008, DYFS received a report from Neal\u2019s doctor who had seen the boy and S.D. in his office that day. Neal claimed that defendant had kicked him in his lower back six to seven weeks prior. The doctor conducted an exam and found that the area \u201cwas not tender.\u201d He told DYFS that Neal\u2019s parents \u201cmay be having custody issues\u201d and that \u201c[S.D.] knew the child would tell him [about the incident] and that [the doctor] ... would have to report this [to DYFS].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">When contacted by the Division, defendant denied kicking Neal. She also told DYFS that she had little contact with her oldest son, who now resided with S.D. in Chester at defendant\u2019s brother\u2019s apartment. Samantha told the caseworker that she \u201cha[d] no problems with her mom ... [and that] [defendant] d[id] not use physical discipline and [wa]s not abusive.\u201d The caseworker concluded her report by noting, \u201cit appears that until custody is resolved, referrals will continue to be made by the family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The case was still open on February 1 when Samantha, accompanied by S.D., filed a police report alleging that defendant had entered her room while she was on the phone with her father, told her to get off the phone and hit her on her leg and arm. S.D. told the police that he \u201cwas going to the Family Court ... to attempt to get a TRO to get full emergency custody of [Samantha] and [George] for their protection.\u201d S.D. told the caseworker that \u201che ha[d] his children at least 70% of the time and would like to attain full custody of all of his children because of his concerns with them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>living with their mother.\u201d S.D. told DYFS that he \u201cneed[ed] $5000 to have a custody evaluation done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The Division\u2019s caseworker, however, did not observe any bruises or marks on Samantha, who also claimed that her mother had hit her approximately one month earlier. The child told the caseworker that her mother never made breakfast for her and her brother, and that \u201cthey ha[d] to go to school hungry each morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">On Saturday, February 2, the children\u2019s paternal grandmother called DYFS. She stated that Samantha was at her home in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and was \u201cafraid to return home with [defendant],\u201d who had allegedly told the child over the phone the previous evening, \u201cThanks for calling DYFS on me.\u201d DYFS was already intending to interview the family that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">When the DYFS caseworkers arrived at the Washington Township home, defendant expressed concern about her daughter, claiming she had not returned home from school, presumably the day before. Defendant told the caseworkers that S.D. was not paying child support, even though she had custody of the children. She acknowledged that there was no \u201ccustody agreement.\u201d Defendant stated that she was attending counseling and taking prescription medication including Wellbutrin and Zoloft. The caseworkers inspected defendant\u2019s home and found it to be \u201cappropriate[,] with no health or safety concerns,\u201d and with \u201cadequate food.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">DYFS interviewed Samantha on Monday, February 4, at her school. She told the caseworker that she wanted to live with S.D. and that defendant did not provide food and left her home alone. Later that same day, defendant called the Washington Township police to report that S.D. had violated the \u201crestraining order\u201d by picking up Samantha at school. S.D. acknowledged that he had picked up his daughter and taken her to lunch, but that he had already returned her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>On the night of February 5, S.D. took Neal to the house to gather some belongings; thinking her son was a burglar, defendant called the police, who responded and again notified DYFS. The next day, S.D. explained to DYFS that he had brought Neal to the house to gather some things, was unable to tell defendant beforehand because there was no phone service in the home and defendant had Samantha\u2019s cell phone. The caseworker interviewed defendant, who stated that she had taken Samantha\u2019s cell phone, and that her daughter threatened \u201cshe would tell her principal at school that she was hit with a belt\u201d if the phone was not returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">On February 19, DYFS interviewed S.D., his girlfriend, and the three children at S.D.\u2019s brother\u2019s home. S.D. and his son were sleeping in the living room of the one-bedroom apartment. S.D. told the caseworker that he had paid $5000 for a custody evaluation so that he could obtain full custody of all three children. He claimed that George was already staying with him four to five nights per week, and Samantha, about three nights per week. George, now five years old, told the caseworker that he preferred being at his father\u2019s house because there was no food at defendant\u2019s home and defendant disciplined the child by hitting him. George also claimed that defendant left him alone at home while she worked and Samantha was at school.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">On February 20, the caseworker visited defendant at her home with both Samantha and George present. Defendant was working two days a week as a receptionist and received child support, but claimed that S.D. was \u201cbehind in payments.\u201d The record contains a print-out DYFS obtained from probation indicating that S.D. was indeed in arrears of his child support payments in the amount of $5010 as of February. Defendant claimed she made ends meet through the help of her parents, who paid for her car and gave her money.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendant advised that the home was being sold, but claimed there would be little money \u201cleft over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Samantha told the caseworker that defendant hit her and her siblings \u201call the time\u201d and that she was \u201calways scared\u201d when she stayed with her mother. Although no physical abuse was confirmed, the caseworker had defendant execute a Case Plan that included, among other suggestions, that defendant \u201cnot use [her] stove or oven to heat [her] home at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">On March 10, the caseworker visited defendant at home and noticed that although nothing was cooking, the burners on the stove were lit. Defendant explained again that there had been no heat in the home since November 2007, that S.D. was behind in child support, that the family had \u201c[no] television,\u201d and that the house was being sold on April 15. DYFS referred defendant to Family Preservation Services (FPS), operated through Catholic Charities.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Samantha claimed that defendant had \u201cignored her since the last time\u201d the caseworker was there, that defendant continued to use the stove and oven to heat the home, and that there was little food in the home. Both she and George told the caseworker they were scared because their mother was using the oven for heat. A few hours later, the caseworkers returned to see if defendant was still using the stove and oven to heat the house. Defendant became irate and showed them space heaters she was using to heat the house. Later that same evening, Samantha called the caseworker to tell her that defendant was still using the stove and oven to heat the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">On March 20, 2008, DYFS requested that defendant undergo a risk assessment. She became angry and arrived at the Division\u2019s office to speak to a supervisor; a meeting ensued, and defendant was again told that it was hazardous to heat her home with the stove and oven. Because defendant was moving from the house on April 13, 2008, DYFS had her execute an amended Case Plan in which she agreed to have Samantha and George stay with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>at a Mend\u2019s house until she could secure \u201csafe and stable housing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">FPS terminated services on March 31. The termination report reveals that defendant had addressed a number of areas of concern. She found housing and had applied for food stamps and daycare for George. Samantha and George indicated that \u201cphysical discipline ha[d] stopped in the home.\u201d FPS \u201cnoticed a correlation between what [S.D.] ... ha[d] been telling DYFS and what [Samantha] ha[d] also [been] saying.\u201d Although FPS concluded that defendant \u201csuccessfully achieved] her goals and [the] risks ha[d] been reduced,\u201d it noted several areas of concern, including defendant\u2019s \u201c[disciplinary [practices,\u201d and the \u201c[presence of [p]hysical abuse of [the] children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">On April 9, DYFS received a call from Samantha\u2019s school counselor stating that the child was afraid to go home fearing that her mother would kill her. Samantha claimed that defendant kept pictures of her daughter on her online My Space page, drawing comments from older men that made the child uncomfortable. Samantha told the caseworker that defendant had not resumed physical discipline, that she and George were still residing with their mother in her friend\u2019s home, and that they were planning to move to a new apartment the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The Division then received a call from Samantha\u2019s paternal grandmother who was concerned about the child\u2019s fears and the appearance of her photos on defendant\u2019s My Space page. The grandmother faxed the Division notes regarding a rash she had observed on Samantha\u2019s back, as well as copies of defendant\u2019s My Space page containing pictures of Samantha, along with comments about the child from defendant\u2019s \u201cMend,\u201d \u201cGreg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The following day, April 10, 2008, Samantha\u2019s school counselor again called DYFS claiming that Samantha refused to go home because her mother was moving that day, and she was afraid. Samantha also told the counselor that defendant had borrowed her cell phone and refused to return it. The child found it the next morning in defendant\u2019s car and it contained \u201cnaked pictures of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>people ... and possibly white powder (cocaine) on the floor.\u201d The school counselor summoned police to the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Detective Schott of the Washington Township police reviewed the pictures on Samantha\u2019s cell phone and told DYFS that they showed defendant in lingerie and an unknown woman, from the rear, possibly performing fellatio on a man. Schott believed the photos were \u201cnot of concern,\u201d but it was \u201cinappropriate [for them] to be on [Samantha\u2019s] phone.\u201d DYFS decided to seek emergency custody of Samantha and George.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">S.D. was in California with Neal at the time. DYFS informed him of its plan and asked that he be available by phone for any hearing. Defendant was contacted and told to come to the Division\u2019s offices with George. She refused to consent to the emergency removal of Samantha and George from her custody, but provided a urine sample as requested by the Division. The record does not disclose the results of that urine screening. DYFS took Samantha and George to their uncle\u2019s home in Chester where their paternal grandmother took custody of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">On April 11, 2008, the Division filed its verified complaint against defendant and S.D. seeking emergency custody of Neal, Samantha and George pursuant to Title 9 and Title 30; it contained the events we have detailed above. At a hearing held that day before the same Family Part judge that was handling the parties\u2019 divorce, defendant appeared with counsel; S.D. did not appear. The deputy attorney general (DAG) indicated that the Division\u2019s plan was to have all three children stay with S.D. upon his return from California. However, she noted that a final domestic violence restraining order against S.D. was still in effect, and he had failed to provide any proof that Neal was being home-schooled.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">After the Division\u2019s caseworker verified the allegations in the complaint under oath, Schott testified regarding the cell phone photos. The Division\u2019s screening summaries, contact sheets and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>other documentary evidence were admitted in evidence. Defendant testified regarding the ongoing divorce litigation and noted the \u201cissue of custody [wa]s ... still unresolved[.]\u201d Defendant claimed the children were well-fed, though she admitted that she used the stove to heat her house because the furnace did not work. She further testified that S.D. was responsible for repairing the furnace but refused to do so. Defendant denied ever being diagnosed with any mental illness or being suicidal, but admitted taking Zoloft and Wellbutrin.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Defendant claimed Samantha was extremely unhappy with the new apartment, and, after seeing it for the first time a few days earlier, the child hatched a plan to transfer her custody to S.D. Defendant read a text message from Samantha to S.D.\u2019s girlfriend sent the night before. In it, Samantha told the woman that defendant did not want the child to spend time with her, but \u201cif [Samantha] g[ot] taken away from [defendant], then [defendant] wo[uld]n\u2019t have any say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Reviewing the evidence, the judge observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">[I]t\u2019s just a totality of circumstances that in and of itself would not support the request that\u2019s being made by the Division, but I am very concerned about the fact that for some period of time culminating in this week the children do not want to go home. They\u2019re scared of their mother. I\u2019m not sure ... other than the corporal punishment that\u2019s been described and being left home ... alone and the food issue, I don\u2019t think the food issue would rise to that level, but they\u2019re scared and I\u2019m not sure I have ... all the reasons as to why they\u2019re scared----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">I\u2019m looking at this ... on a blank slate. I have two children who say they don\u2019t want to go home, they\u2019re scared of their mother. And a history of corporal punishment, that although [it] was denied today doesn\u2019t seem to have been denied according to these records. I don\u2019t give a lot of weight to the cell phone pictures____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">But I think that the life, safety, or health of the children is in imminent risk if they were to remain home. So they should be removed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">The judge entered an order that granted \u201clegal and physical custody\u201d of the three children to S.D. \u201con a self-executing basis once he [wa]s in New Jersey,\u201d and required S.D. to participate in an anger management program, defendant and S.D. to be evaluated, and all three children to enroll in and attend school.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Status conferences took place in May, June and July and a plethora of problems continued to exist between defendant, S.D., and the children. At the May conference, defendant\u2019s conduct during supervised visitation was noted to be problematic, with Samantha, through the law guardian, indicating that she no longer wished to see her mother. S.D. meanwhile had taken all three children out of school and brought them to Georgia for a day so that Neal could compete in a \u201cnational [motocross] qualifier.\u201d S.D., who was appearing without counsel, disclosed that he \u201chad business plans\u201d that might cause him to relocate out of state, further noting that his attorney had discussed this with the judge \u201cin the FM case.\u201d The judge ordered that an evaluation conducted by \u201cDr. Witt\u201d in the FM matter be released to the psychiatrist and psychologist evaluating defendant and S.D. in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">During the June conference, the law guardian chastised S.D. for failing to cooperate in setting up counseling for Samantha. The judge was not surprised, noting she had \u201cbeen involved in this case on more than one level,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t\u2019s consistent with [S.D.\u2019s] ... conduct.\u201d Defense counsel alleged that George was now active in motocross and had suffered bruises as a result. The judge observed, \u201cdad has to understand that if he is not protecting these children\u2019s ... life, safety, and health, he\u2019s not going to have them----He\u2019s got his own ideas about life, but they may backfire on him---- [H]e\u2019s got to act appropriately as a parent, not live vicariously off a five-year-old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Defendant appeared with new counsel at the July conference. The DAG continued to express concerns about defendant\u2019s supervised visitations. She further noted that defendant \u201ccompleted a psychiatric assessment\u201d that determined her to \u201cbe bipolar and borderline personality disorder.\u201d The evaluation is not part of the record, and defense counsel disputed these conclusions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>DAG told the judge that DYFS \u201cseem[ed] to be involved in the middle of a custody dispute\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The DAG also noted that Neal had been excused from school because of a shoulder injury, but, during the same time, had raced in a motocross event. Neal told his therapist that he was \u201cnumbed up ... and taped\u201d for each race. The therapist reported \u201cfeeling threatened by [S.D.],\u201d and that the family was \u201cbeing supported by th[e] child\u2019s [motocross].\u201d The caseworker furnished a report advising that Neal was having trouble sleeping, was anxious, and had not attended school since the second grade. Although S.D. maintained Neal was being home-schooled, Neal disputed that. The judge emphasized that she had \u201cequal, if not greater concerns about [S.D.\u2019s] conduct with respect to the children\u201d and ordered Neal not to compete in any [motocross] events.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">By this time, the parties\u2019 divorce had become final. The judge acknowledged that pursuant to a property settlement agreement entered in the divorce action, defendant agreed that her \u201chusband shall have custody of the minor children pursuant to the DYFS order.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The July transcript also reveals that S.D. had just recently become employed again after a substantial period of time, that defendant was earning $22,000 per year as a receptionist, that the house in Washington Township had gone through foreclosure and was sold, and that the Internal Revenue Service had filed a $100,000 lien against the parties and their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">On September 17, 2008, the parties appeared for a fact-finding hearing. After appearances were entered, defendant was immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ately placed under oath and questioned by her attorney. We quote the exchange at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">Q. Ms. [D.], I\u2019ve spoken to you just prior to today\u2019s court proceeding. We\u2019re here for a fact-finding and also a review. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">Q. You\u2019re familiar with the facts of this particular case that\u2019s been going on for quite some time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">Q. And I ... substituted in sometime around July so I haven\u2019t been here since the inception of this matter. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">Q. Okay. And ... we have a stipulation, that\u2019s a legal term which means we\u2019re agreeing .. to a particular fact in this case. That\u2019s what a stipulation means. I explained that to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-14\">Q. And the stipulation to which you are agreeing is that at some point in time, while the children were in your care and custody you ... left the burners on in the oven or the stove to heat the home. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-16\">Q. And a caseworker from DYFS had seen you do that, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-18\">Q. And although you have a reason for doing that and that being that the furnace wasn\u2019t working you still lit the burners to heat the home knowing that that was not a safe condition for your children and yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-19\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-20\">Q. And you were told to leave shortly after doing that and you complied with the request of DYFS. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-21\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-22\">Q. And in fact you\u2019ve removed yourself from that living condition and you\u2019re in other living quarters. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-23\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-24\">Q. So for all intents and purposes you\u2019ve corrected that situation and behavior? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-25\">The DAG then questioned defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-26\">Q. Ms. [D.], was the date that you left the stove burners and the oven on all night when the Division worker went to the home, was that on or about March of 2008?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0e\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-27\">Q. And has anyone forced you or coerced you to make this stipulation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">Q. <em>And are you aware that the Division would have to prove at a trial that they have jurisdiction if you decided not to make this stipulation?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">Q. Are you under the influence of anything that would impair your judgment today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The judge then found there was \u201ca factual basis\u201d for the stipulation and that defendant had \u201cconceded voluntarily.\u201d She further found that in March 2008,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">[A]fter having been told by a Division caseworker that she should not heat the home by turning on ... the burners on the stove, that [defendant] did so anyway, thereby putting the children and ... herself actually at risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">The judge concluded, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s an adequate basis <em>for establishing the participation of the Division in this matter.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The judge also asked defendant if she was \u201csatisfied with the information and advice given ... by counsel in connection with ... th[e] stipulation,\u201d to which defendant responded, \u2018Tes.\u201d The dispositional order executed by defendant and her attorney indicated that defendant \u201cknowingly, willingly and voluntarily agreed to waive [her] rights to a Fact Finding Hearing,\u201d \u201cadmitted to ... le[aving] the burners and oven on in the home to heat the home thus posing a risk to the minor children,\u201d and that this \u201cconstitute[d] abuse or neglect pursuant to law____\u201d The order further provided, \u201cDefendant ... wa[i]ves the right to an OAL Hearing; The defendant will be maintained as a substantiated perpetrator on the Division\u2019s central registry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">Since the children were residing with S.D. in Chester, DYFS asked that the litigation be transferred from Somerset County to Morris County. The law guardian, however, disclosed that S.D. continued to violate the judge\u2019s order regarding Neal and George\u2019s motocross activities and advised the judge that the children had participated in another event over the past weekend. The DAG responded, \u201c[I]f it continues the Division will be looking to remove the children from him.\u201d On October 1, 2008, the judge entered an order transferring the litigation to Morris County.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>A compliance hearing in December 2008 again revealed concerns regarding Neal\u2019s education. In April 2009, now represented by a third attorney, defendant sought to have the children returned to her. She argued that she had fully complied with all of the Division\u2019s recommendations, had secured new housing, obtained medical insurance for the children and found employment. Defense counsel alluded to a number of psychological evaluations that found \u201cno reason for limiting [defendant\u2019s] parental rights.\u201d The judge concluded that defendant should make a motion to modify the children\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">On August 6, 2009, DYFS sought to dismiss the FN litigation, telling the judge that defendant \u201cha[d] adequately remediated the conditions that led to the children\u2019s removal and subsequent Division involvement.\u201d DYFS recommended defendant and S.D. share joint legal custody, with S.D. retaining physical custody of Neal, and defendant having physical custody of Samantha and George. The law guardian indicated Samantha and George preferred that their parents share joint physical custody. The judge scheduled another hearing after suggesting that the parties attempt to settle their differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">A dispositional hearing took place on September 10, 2009. The law guardian explained that no agreement was reached regarding residential custody or parenting time and that the children wished to reside with their father. She further noted that the children were at the courthouse to be interviewed. DYFS did not object. Defense counsel requested that the court interview George but not Neal because his custody was not at issue. Defendant also agreed that the FN litigation should be terminated and conceded that Samantha should be permitted to \u201cdecide where she wants to live.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">After initially stating that interviewing Neal did not \u201cmake much sense,\u201d the judge decided to interview both him and Samantha in camera with only the law guardian present. Both expressed a desire to continue to live with S.D. The court declined to interview George and accepted, over defendant\u2019s objection, the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>guardian\u2019s representation that the child wished to remain in S.D.\u2019s custody. No other testimony was taken and no evidence was adduced at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In a brief oral opinion that followed, the judge recognized that defendant\u2019s and S.D.\u2019s dispute was \u201clongstanding and they [were] in terrible conflict over the years.\u201d He characterized the issue as \u201ca custody-style problem.\u201d The judge, noting it was not \u201csensible to have a full custody battle, or full custody hearing here in ... this child protective service case,\u201d concluded it was \u201csensible to keep the children together at this juncture.\u201d He entered an order terminating the litigation, continuing joint legal custody of the children and awarding S.D. physical custody of all three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Defendant moved for reconsideration. In a December 10, 2009 order, the judge denied the request, determining \u201cthere [wa]s no reasonable basis to conclude it w[as] in the best interest either of [George] or the other siblings to be separated____\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On January 22, 2010, defendant and S.D. entered into a consent order in the PM action transferring residential custody of Samantha to defendant and continuing joint legal custody; this appeal was filed on January 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">While her appeal was pending, defendant moved to supplement the record. We granted her motion. The supplemental material was a certification from defendant in which she claimed that that she did not abuse or neglect her children, that her trial attorney failed to advise her that by entering the stipulation she was admitting to neglect, and that her attorney did not inform her that the stipulation would cause her name to be entered on the abuse/negleet Central Registry. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.11. Defendant certified that she would have insisted on a fact-finding hearing if she knew of these consequences, would not have entered the stipulation, and executed the stipulation order simply because she was told to sign it. Defendant further claimed that she was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>advised by anyone that \u201ca finding of abuse or neglect was being entered against her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Defendant argues that her attorney provided ineffective assistance because he essentially consented to a finding of child abuse and/or neglect, even though the conduct that she admitted, i.e., using the stove and oven to heat her home, did not violate <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6\u20148.21(e). Defendant also contends that counsel was ineffective because he failed to specifically advise her that the stipulation was an acknowledgment that she had abused or neglected her children. Lastly, defendant argues that counsel was ineffective because he failed to inform her that the stipulation \u201cwould cause her name to be entered on the State Central Registry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">The Division urges us to reject defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance without any remand. It contends that trial counsel\u2019s performance was not \u201cobjectively deficient\u201d because defendant\u2019s answers to the questions posed, and the executed stipulation itself, belie her claim that she was unaware of the significance and consequences of the stipulation. Additionally, DYFS and the law guardian argue that despite the finding of neglect based upon defendant\u2019s stipulation, no \u201cactual prejudice has befallen\u201d defendant, although they concede that her name is now entered in the Central Registry as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Parents are entitled to the effective assistance of counsel in termination proceedings. <em>N.J.

The Court \u201cdirect[ed] that claims of ineffective assistance ... be raised on direct appeal.\u201d <em>B.R., supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 311, 929 A.2d 1034; <em>see R. </em>5:12-7 (providing that claims of ineffective assistance \u201cshall be raised exclusively on direct appeal\u201d). \u201cIn many eases, the issue will be resolvable on the appeal record alone.\u201d <em>B.R., supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 311, 929 A.2d 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">In <em>B.R., supra, </em>the defendant did not stipulate to a finding of abuse or neglect at a fact-finding hearing. 192 <em>N.J. </em>at 303-04, 929 A.2d 1034. We have said that \u201c[a] \u2018fact-finding hearing is a critical element of the abuse and neglect process,\u2019 because the court\u2019s \u2018determination has a profound impact on the lives of families embroiled in this type of a crisis.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J.

Indeed, the entire proceeding was bereft of any mention of the terms \u201cabuse or neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Defense counsel only elicited from defendant her understanding that she was in court for \u201ca fact-finding and also a review\u201d; that she understood a stipulation was \u201ca legal term\u201d by which she was \u201cagreeing ... to a particular fact,\u201d i.e., \u201cthat at some point in time while the children were in [her] care and custody [she] ... left the burners on in the oven or the stove to heat the home\u201d; that she knew this was \u201cnot a safe condition for [her] children\u201d; that she \u201ccomplied with the request of DYFS\u201d and \u201cremoved [herself] from that living condition\u201d; and that \u201cfor all intents and purposes\u201d she had \u201ccorrected that situation and behavior[.]\u201d The DAG only questioned defendant regarding when this had occurred; whether \u201canyone forced ... or coerced [defendant] to make th[e] stipulation\u201d; her understanding that DYFS \u201cwould have to prove at a trial ... jurisdiction if [she] decided not to make th[e] stipulation[]\u201d; and that defendant was not \u201cunder the influence of anything that would impair [her] judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Before the stipulation was entered, the judge did not \u201cdirectly apprise defendant] of [her] rights under Title 9 to a fact-finding hearing where the burden of proof [would have been on] DYFS to establish the elements of abuse and neglect by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>J.Y., supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 266, 800 A.2d 132. The judge\u2019s inquiry after the stipulation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>quite limited, asking defendant only if she was satisfied with her attorney\u2019s representation. In accepting defendant\u2019s factual basis, the judge never stated that the stipulated facts were adequate to prove defendant had abused or neglected her children under the standards contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6\u20148.21(c), and never used the terms abuse or neglect. Instead, the judge only announced that the stipulated facts provided \u201can adequate basis for establishing the participation of the Division.\u201d The DAG\u2019s use of the term \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d and the judge\u2019s determination that the facts \u201cestablish[ed] [grounds for] the participation of\u2019 DYFS, inadequately conveyed the essential legal consequence of defendant\u2019s stipulation\u2014that defendant was admitting to having abused or neglected her children.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Although the dispositional order may have addressed some of these deficiencies, it did not cure them. We acknowledge, for example, that the order advised defendant that she had \u201cwaive[d] [her] rights to a Fact Finding Hearing at which the Division would have the burden of proof.\u201d But it did not advise defendant that DYFS had to prove that she abused or neglected her children, as those terms are defined by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The order provided that defendant was waiving her \u201cright to an OAL Hearing,\u201d and that her name would \u201cbe maintained as a substantiated perpetrator on the Division\u2019s central registry.\u201d It did not, however, explain defendant\u2019s rights in this regard, nor did it explain the consequences of the entry of her name on the Registry. We have noted that \u201c[t]he impact of the Registry is substantial,]\u201d and \u201c[t]he entry of an individual\u2019s name on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Central Registry gives rise to a significant liberty interest on the part of that individual.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. V.M., </em>408 <em>N.J.Super. </em>222, 237-38, 974 A.2d 448 (App.Div.) (Carchman, concurring), <em>certif. denied, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>505, 983 A.2d 1113 (2009), <em>certif. denied, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>272, 989 A.2d 1264 (2009), <em>cert. denied, V.M. v. N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs., </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>3502, <em>177 L.Ed.2d </em>1095 (2010). Under this context and without any other explanation provided in the record, defendant\u2019s execution of the stipulation order, standing alone, failed to adequately apprise her of the consequences of the entry of her name on the Central Registry resulting from her stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">By executing the order, defendant acknowledged that her use of the oven \u201cpos[ed] a risk to the minor children,\u201d and that this \u201cconstitute[d] abuse or neglect pursuant to law....\u201d However, we do not deem that to be adequate. In all likelihood, the dispositional order was executed <em>after </em>the proceedings ended.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Certainly, the record lacks any indication that defense counsel or the judge explained the significance of the terms contained in the order to defendant <em>before </em>she made her statements under oath. Moreover, defendant has certified that her attorney only told her to sign the order without explaining it to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">In short, at a minimum, defense counsel was obligated to clearly and unequivocally advise defendant that she would be deemed to have committed child abuse and/or neglect once she admitted to certain facts. Given the significant inadequacies of the proceedings in this regard, counsel\u2019s performance was objectively deficient. Defendant has established the first prong of the <em>Striclcland/Fritz </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Although we recognize the inherent differences between claims for post-conviction relief in criminal cases, and claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in Title 9 and Title 30 litigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>we analogize the circumstances presented here to those that exist when a criminal defendant asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel after entering a guilty plea. In that context, \u201c[t]he second part of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel is whether \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, [the defendant] would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Nunez-Valdez, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>129, 142, 975 A.2d 418 (2009) (quoting <em>State v. DiFrisco, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>434, 457, 645 A.2d 734 (1994)(in turn quoting <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>52, 59, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>366, 370, 88 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 203, 210 (1985))).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Here, defendant claims that had she known of the consequences of entering the stipulation, she would have insisted on a fact-finding hearing, i.e., she \u201cwould have insisted on going to trial.\u201d Given the allegations actually made against her in the complaint, and the totality of the circumstances regarding her tumultuous relationship with S.D., her assertion is objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We understand that without the stipulation being entered, DYFS may have marshaled more extensive testimony regarding its involvement with defendant and the D. family. In our view, however, the record before us presents an equivocal picture as to whether defendant had indeed committed abuse or neglect of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Allegations of physical discipline were made by the children to the police, DYFS, health care providers, and school counselors under circumstances that suggested S.D. had coached the children. Further, the reports grew out of a bitter custody dispute in which Samantha told DYFS that each parent tried to get the children to \u201csay things against the other parent,\u201d and S.D. repeatedly evidenced his intention to secure custody of all three children. In the end, after the Division\u2019s investigation every claim of physical abuse was unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Allegations of defendant\u2019s neglect were also frequently unfounded. Despite the children\u2019s claims that defendant failed to feed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>them or have adequate food in the house, actual inspections of the home conducted by DYFS painted a different picture. While defendant improvidently used her stove and oven to heat her home, we are mindful of the circumstances that existed at the time. S.D. was in arrears of his child support and refused to provide any funds to repair the furnace. The house was in foreclosure. At the same time, S.D. was vacationing in Bermuda with his two sons and traveling around the country so that Neal could participate in motocross events.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">At the time of the fact-finding hearing, defendant had re-located to an apartment that was adequate for her needs and those of her children. She was employed and was attending counseling. S.D., who we note was still a named defendant in the litigation, was residing in his brother\u2019s one-bedroom apartment with Neal, was apparently unemployed and was allegedly living off his son\u2019s motocross earnings. In clear violation of court orders, S.D. failed to document his son was being home-schooled.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In short, we will not presume the outcome that may have resulted from a full-fledged fact-finding hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We only conclude that defendant has demonstrated a reasonable probability that had she known the full consequences of her stipulation, she would have proceeded and insisted that DYFS prove her actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>amounted to child abuse or neglect. Thus, defendant meets the second prong of the <em>Strickland/Fritz </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Under these circumstances, there is no need to remand the matter for an evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s claim. From the record presented, we conclude that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to insure that defendant received the minimal protections she was entitled to during this \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceedings. <em>See N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. G.M., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>382, 401, 968 A.2d 698 (2009). We therefore reverse the September 17, 2008 order.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Because of the frequency with which issues surrounding stipulations at fact-finding hearings present themselves despite our holding in <em>J.Y. </em>nearly eight years ago, we provide some additional guidance.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> First, we reiterate our recognition of the utility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>stipulations in this context. \u201cAs a general proposition, stipulations permit parties in a civil case to agree on relevant facts, thereby-narrowing the area of dispute requiring the production of evidence and promoting the efficient administration of justice.\u201d <em>J.Y., supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 265, 800 A.2d 132 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Unlike other \u201ccivil case[s],\u201d however, the parental rights implicated in Title 9 litigation \u201care constitutionally protected [although] not absolute.\u201d <em>N.D., supra, </em>at 108, 8 A.3d 809 (citing <em>G.M., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 397, 968 A.2d 698). \u201cParents\u2019 rights must be balanced against the State\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>responsibility to protect the welfare of children.\u201d <em>N.D., supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 109, 8 A.3d 809 (quotations omitted). \u201cWhen that balancing is required, a court must ensure that the statutory and constitutional rights of the parent or guardian are scrupulously protected.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Therefore, before a stipulation is accepted at a fact-finding hearing, DYFS, after consultation with defense counsel, should advise the judge which specific provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c) is expected to be proven by way of defendant\u2019s stipulated facts. The judge must then explicitly inform the defendant: that by agreeing to enter into a stipulation, she is waiving her right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>a hearing at which DYFS must prove abuse or neglect by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>J.Y., supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 266, 800 A.2d 132; that at such a hearing, the judge would determine what documentary evidence and testimony would be admitted, and that defendant, through counsel, would have the right to challenge the evidence and cross-examine the witnesses, <em>Id. </em>at 265, 800 A.2d 132; that if the judge accepts defendant\u2019s stipulated facts and concludes they demonstrate abuse and/or neglect, the judge will enter an order finding that defendant has abused and/or neglected her child; and, that as a result of that order, DYFS may seek termination of the defendant\u2019s parental rights, and the judge may remove, or continue the removal of, the child from the defendant\u2019s custody, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6\u20148.50(d), and/or require DYFS to \u201cprovide such services as are deemed appropriate to the ends of protecting the child and rehabilitating and improving family life,\u201d N.J.S.A 9:6-8.50(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Additionally, we have noted the \u201cnumerous collateral consequences [that] flow from such a finding [of abuse or neglect].\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. N.S., </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>593, 619, 992 A.2d 20 (App.Div.2010).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">Specifically, a finding of abuse and neglect is forwarded by the Division to a central registry maintained by the Department of Children and Families (DCF). On written request, the records may be released to individuals identified in the statute, including doctors, courts, child welfare agencies, and any person or entity mandated by statute to consider child abuse or neglect information when conducting a background check or employment-related screening of an individual ... seeking employment with an agency or organization providing services to children[J <em>[Id. </em>at 619-20, 992 A.2d 20. (citations omitted) (quotations) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Therefore, the judge should advise the defendant that as a result of a finding of abuse and/or neglect, the defendant\u2019s name shall remain on the Central Registry of confirmed perpetrators, and that defendant is waiving any ability, either through the administrative process or through the proceedings in court, to challenge the inclusion of her name on the Central Registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Requiring the judge to conduct this inquiry of defendant on the record may be time-consuming, or even a daunting endeav- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>or. On occasion, as sometimes occurs in the criminal context, a defendant may be unwilling to acknowledge and accept that his or her actions amounted to a violation of law\u2014the abuse and/or neglect of their own child. Yet, when constitutional rights are at stake, nothing less than procedures that \u201cscrupulously protect[ ]\u201d those rights are required. <em>N.D., supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 109, 8 A.3d 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In the criminal context, our courts have imposed long-standing obligations on the judge to ensure that a criminal defendant\u2019s guilty plea was voluntarily entered with full understanding of the nature of the charge. <em>State v. Reali, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>222, 224, 139 A.2d 300 (1958). For years, our <em>Rules of Court </em>have required a criminal defendant to execute a written form acknowledging an understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea and the rights he was waiving as a result of pleading guilty. <em>See State v. Deutsch, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>190, 201, 168 A.2d 12 (1961) (discussing the significance of the plea form then mandated by <em>Rule </em>3:5\u20142(b)); <em>and see R. </em>3:9-2 (providing that in accepting the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, \u201cthe court shall require the defendant to complete ... and sign the appropriate form prescribed by the Administrative Director of the Courts\u201d). Our <em>Rules of Court </em>have mandated such a form be used in juvenile delinquency proceedings. <em>See R. </em>5:21A. The current \u201cChildren in Court Case Processing Manual,\u201d issued by the Administrative Office of the Courts to all trial judges involved in Title 9 and Title 30 litigation, now contains a form to be used whenever a defendant voluntarily surrenders his or her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Whenever a defendant was entering a stipulation at a fact-finding hearing, a similar form would assist the judge in making the necessary finding that the defendant was entering into the stipulation with full and complete understanding of his or her rights, that he or she was waiving those rights, that he or she understood the consequences of the stipulation, and that he or she was entering into the stipulation \u201cwillingly, knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d <em>J.Y., supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 266, 800 A.2d 132. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>therefore refer this matter to the Supreme Court\u2019s Committee on Practice in the Family Part, and the Acting Administrative Director of the Courts, so that they may consider our suggestions.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In Points II, III, and IV, defendant claims a remand is necessary because the dispositional hearing conducted by the second judge applied the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard, contrary to the Court\u2019s holding in <em>G.M., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 968 A.2d 698; because the interview of the two children was \u201cinadequate\u201d in that the judge did not permit counsel \u201cto submit questions pursuant to <em>R. </em>5:8-6,\u201d and did not provide defendant with \u201can opportunity to answer the issues raised in the interview\u201d; and because hearsay evidence was admitted at the dispositional hearing. At oral argument before us, DYFS conceded that the second judge in this case applied the wrong standard to decide which parent should maintain residential custody of George. The Division, however, argues that defendant can seek a change in custody under the FM docket, noting that she and S.D. have negotiated a consensual change in Samantha\u2019s custody since the dispositional order was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">In <em>G.M., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 968 A.2d 698, the Court held that before Title 9 litigation is dismissed, the judge must conduct a dispositional hearing. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.45 and -8.50. \u201c[T]he central question in a Title 9 dispositional hearing is whether the child may be safely returned to the custody of the parent from whom the child was removed.\u201d <em>N.D., supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 107, 8 A.3d 809 (citing <em>G.M., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 968 A.2d 698). The focus should not be \u201con the wishes of the children,\u201d but rather \u201con whether the children c[an] be safely returned to the custody of the[ ] [offending parent].\u201d <em>G.M., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 968 A.2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">However, \u201can order of disposition placing a child with a person other than the parent from whose custody the child was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>removed may be entered pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.51 only if there is first a finding of abuse or neglect.\u201d <em>N.D., supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 110, 8 A.3d 809. Since we have reversed the order finding that defendant had neglected her children, the issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">However, we recognize that S.D. has maintained residential custody of George since the Dodd hearing more than thirty months ago. We also know that thereafter, the parties entered into a property settlement agreement that included terms regarding the children\u2019s custody. Specifically, defendant agreed that S.D. should have custody of all three children. We do not know what has transpired in the year since the dispositional order was entered, except that the parties agreed residential custody of Samantha should return to defendant. Under the circumstance, \u201c[t]o avoid undue disruption [to George], we continue the present order until modified by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 8 A.3d 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">No later than February 25, 2011, DYFS shall determine whether it wishes to proceed in the Title 9 litigation or dismiss its complaint. If the Division opts to continue, the judge shall, upon notice to defendant and her counsel, and S.D. and his counsel, schedule a fact-finding hearing. <em>Ibid,. </em>The necessity of a dispositional hearing shall abide the results of that fact-finding hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">If the complaint is dismissed by DYFS or the judge following the fact-finding hearing, residential custody of George shall remain with S.D. pursuant to the dispositional order which shall then be entered pendente lite under the FM docket. Thereafter, \u201cproceedings should be scheduled to resolve the custody issues in accordance with the <em>Rules of Court </em>and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4,\u201d and the parties may attempt to \u201cresolvfe] the questions of custody and parenting time by agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 8 A.3d 809. At the custody hearing, \u201cabsent a finding of abuse or neglect in the Title 9 action, [defendant] cannot be burdened by assumptions about her parental fitness based on the prior orders entered in this litigation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
