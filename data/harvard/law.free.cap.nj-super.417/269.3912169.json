We reverse again because the trial judge\u2019s final adjustment required plaintiff to pay an entrepreneurial profit inconsistent with the interloper\u2019s position as a constructive trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In 1998, plaintiff Joseph Marioni contracted to buy real property in Jersey City from third-party defendant Roxy Garments Delivery Co., Inc. Prior to the closing date, Roxy breached the contract by selling the property to 94 Broadway, Inc. (Broadway). Marioni filed a complaint in the Chancery Division seeking both specific performance and damages. Shortly after suit was filed, the Chancery judge at the time granted summary judgment dismissing Marioni\u2019s claim for specific performance and transferred the action to the Law Division for resolution of the damages claim; we denied Marioni\u2019s motion for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Approximately two years later, final judgment was entered and Marioni appealed, again seeking our review of the dismissal of his claim for specific performance. We reversed, holding that the contract between Marioni and Roxy was valid and enforceable and that Broadway was not a bona fide purchaser for value because it had actual and constructive knowledge of the Marioni-Roxy contract. <em>Marioni v. 94 Broadway, Inc., </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>588, 601, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>616, 866 A.2d 208 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>591, 874 A.2d 1109 (2005). We determined that Broadway\u2019s knowledge of Marioni\u2019s contract put Broadway in the position of a constructive trustee. <em>Id. </em>at 621-22, 866 A.2d 208; <em>see </em>Pomeroy, <em>Specific Performance of Contracts </em>\u00a7 465 (3d ed. 1926). Absent undue hardship in light of the evolving circumstances, we held Marioni was entitled to specific performance and remanded to the Chancery Division with instructions to \u201creassemble Humpty Dumpty.\u201d <em>Marioni, supra, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 622, 866 A.2d 208. In other words, acknowledging that more than three years had transpired during which Broadway had repaired, renovated and leased the property, we directed the Chancery judge to determine whether equitable relief would be oppressive or create an undue hardship in light of any changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">After a five-day trial, the Chancery judge decreed specific performance, subject to further proceedings to equitably adjust the original contract price of $170,000\u2014which Marioni had agreed to pay Roxy\u2014now to be paid by Marioni to Broadway. In his oral decision, the judge correctly recognized his goal was to place the parties, to the extent possible, in the same positions they would have occupied had the Marioni-Roxy contract been performed as originally required. The judge correctly observed that equitable principles prohibit a constructive trustee from profiting and that Broadway should receive no entrepreneurial profit as a result of its interim wrongful possession of and dominion over the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">With these principles as a guide, the judge increased the purchase price from $170,000 to $579,155.69. In reaching this result, the judge considered numerous factors. First, he awarded Broadway six percent interest on the contract price, compounded annually, yielding an interest factor of $85,617.13, which raised the purchase price to $255,617.13. Second, the judge found the value of the property increased by $790,000 over the five-year period due to both market conditions and physical renovations to the property made by Broadway. He arrived at this by subtracting the stipulated value of the property without renovations ($480,000) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>from its stipulated value as renovated ($1,270,000). The judge also found, however, that Marioni would be required to expend $50,000 to alter Broadway\u2019s renovations so that Marioni could utilize the property for his own particular interests.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judge added $740,000 to the purchase price. Third, the judge added three operating costs paid by Broadway that Marioni would have paid had he been in possession, namely, the cost of maintaining insurance, property taxes and mortgage interest payments totaling $71,018.56. This raised the purchase price to $1,026,635.69. Lastly, the judge found Broadway was not entitled to $487,500 in rents collected from its tenant\u2014because as trustee, Broadway collected those rents on Marioni\u2019s behalf\u2014thus reducing the purchase price to $579,155.69. Restated in ledger form, the judge adjusted the original $170,000 purchase price, which Marioni would have paid Roxy but for the inequitable conduct that generated this suit, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">Contract Price: 170,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">Interest: +85,617.13</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">Increase in value: + 790,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">Less required alterations: \u2014 50,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">Insurance + 33,779.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfR\">Taxes + 24,373.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVJ\">Mortgage interest + 12,866.56</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-13\">Gross adjusted contract price 1,026,635.69</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtK\">Rents - 487,500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Net adjusted contract price $579,155.69<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The judge also denied Marioni\u2019s request for $107,000 in fees incurred from storing his artwork in alternate locations in the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">On appeal, Marioni argues the judge erred in adjusting the purchase price by including the increase in the property\u2019s market value rather than restricting Broadway\u2019s award solely to its base investment. Marioni also argues he should have been awarded damages to compensate for expenditures incurred in storing his artwork elsewhere in the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In fashioning relief, the Chancery judge has broad discretionary power to adapt equitable remedies to the particular circumstances of a given case. <em>Salorio v. Glaser, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>447, 469, 461 A.2d 1100 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>993, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>486, 78 L.Ed.2d 682 (1983); <em>Mitchell v. Oksienik, </em>380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>119, 130-31, 880 A.2d 1194 (App.Div.2005). Equitable remedies \u201care distinguished by their flexibility, their unlimited variety,\u201d and \u201ctheir adaptability to circumstances.\u201d <em>Salorio, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 469, 461 A.2d 1100. This general approach requires consideration of three specific components. First, the facts the judge adopts in an equity case, like any other non-jury case, are entitled to our deference \u201cwhen supported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence.\u201d <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). Second, in drawing conclusions from those facts, the Chancery judge is required to apply accepted legal and equitable principles; no deference is afforded in this regard. <em>Manalapan Realty v. Manalapan Twp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995); <em>In re Estate of Shinn, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. 55, </em>66, 925 A.2d 88 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>595, 934 A.2d 637 (2007). And third, in fashioning an appropriate equitable remedy to fit the particular circumstances, we will decline to intervene absent an abuse of discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>see Sears Mortgage Corporation v. Rose, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>326, 354, 634 A.2d 74 (1993), or where the judge\u2019s conclusions prove inconsistent with his own findings of fact, <em>VRG Corporation v. GKN Realty Corporation, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>447, 454, 619 A.2d 251 (App.Div. 1993), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>539, 641 A.2d 519 (1994). In turning to this third aspect, we conclude the remedy imposed was inconsistent with the directions provided in our earlier opinion regarding Broadway\u2019s role as constructive trustee; indeed, the judge similarly found that Broadway should not profit in any way from having purchased the property in the face of Marioni\u2019s prior contract to purchase. Because the judgment under review included an award of profit in Broadway\u2019s favor, we are constrained to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The judge\u2019s findings in quantifying the various monetary elements incorporated in the final judgment were thoroughly supported by evidence in the record. The judge also applied correct equitable principles when he held that Broadway was not entitled to profit due to its own wrongdoing in depriving Marioni of the property he had contracted to buy. The Chancery judge, however, mistakenly exercised his discretion in formulating a remedy by allowing Broadway the value of the property as enhanced by its renovations; Broadway was entitled to be reimbursed for the funds it expended in renovating the property, but it was not entitled to the value that the property had been increased by those renovations.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">This particular disputed element of the award has been referred to as entrepreneurial profit, which is the amount of profit an investor expects to receive by investing in a piece of real estate and is calculated as the difference between the total of \u201cthe cost of acquiring land plus ... the cost of constructing an improvement\u201d minus \u201cthe improved property\u2019s market value.\u201d <em>Westwood Lanes, Inc. v. Garwood Borough, </em>24 <em>N.J. Tax </em>239, 250 (2008); <em>see also BASF Corp. Coating &amp; Ink Div. v. Belvidere Town, </em>23 <em>N.J. Tax </em>551, 570 (2007). More simply stated by Broadway\u2019s appraisal expert at trial, entrepreneurial or \u201cresidual\u201d profit is measured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the final total value of a property minus the funds expended by the purchaser in purchasing and improving the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Applying this concept, any amount added to the total due from Marioni to Broadway for the purchase of the property after accounting for Broadway\u2019s expenditures (its hard costs) results in an award of entrepreneurial profit to Broadway. Broadway, as trustee, is not entitled to such a profit; plaintiff, as the beneficiary of the constructive trust created by Broadway\u2019s wrongful conduct, is owed any and all such benefits. Bogert, <em>The Law of Trusts and Trustees, </em>\u00a7 862 at 63, 70 (Rev.2d ed. 2006). It was therefore improper to increase the purchase price due from Marioni to reflect any gain in the property\u2019s value even if brought about by Broadway\u2019s expenditure of funds to improve the property. Rather than using the sum of $790,000 in adjusting the purchase price, the court should have added only Broadway\u2019s base investment in the property, that is, the cost of renovations. This mistake resulted in Broadway\u2019s receipt of an entrepreneurial profit of $394,117; that is, the enhanced value of $790,000 minus Broadway\u2019s renovation expenses of $395,883.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Adding Broadway\u2019s base investment (acquisition and renovation costs) plus the award of insurance, taxes and mortgage interest to the purchase price returns Broadway to the position it would have been in had title rightfully transferred to Marioni instead of Broadway, and ensures that Broadway does not receive any entrepreneurial profit from purchasing the property from Roxy with knowledge of Marioni\u2019s contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, we reverse and remand for the entry of judgment in the amount of $185,018.69, calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">Contract Price: 170,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">Interest: + 85,617.13</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">Broadway\u2019s expenditures: -I- 395,883.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">Less required alterations: \u2014 50,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Insurance + 33,779.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aga\">Taxes + 24,373.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbD\">Mortgage interest + 12,866.56</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">Gross adjusted contract price 672,518.69</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoO\">Rents -487,500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">Net adjusted contract price $185,018.69</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Although we commend the Chancery judge for his prodigious efforts in restoring Humpty Dumpty to his original condition, we are constrained to conclude that he mistakenly determined that Marioni should compensate Broadway for the amount to which the property\u2019s value was enhanced as a result of Broadway\u2019s renovations.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Marioni lastly argues that the equitable relief to which he is entitled should include reimbursement for his storage fees. We remand for further proceedings on this point. In rejecting Marioni\u2019s request for an award of storage fees, the judge erroneously felt constrained by our mandate. In previously remanding, we recognized that circumstances had changed and expressly stated that the Chancery judge \u201cshould look with liberality upon any applications to amend the pleadings\u201d and, further recognized, that we did \u201cnot intend to limit the future proceedings in this action solely to those claims that had been pleaded previously.\u201d Id. at 621. We neither expressed nor implied any limitation on the pursuit of alternate or consequential claims and remedies. <em>See Bubis v. Kassin, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>415, 427-28, 803 A.2d 146 (App. Div.2002). Even though the judge provided other comments regarding the storage fees that have been urged as a basis for our affirmance of this aspect of the judgment, we nevertheless reverse and remand for reconsideration because our close examination of the record suggests the judge felt constrained by his mistaken view of the scope of our mandate and offered those comments about the merit of that claim more as an afterthought.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Reversed and remanded for proceedings in conformity with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-14\"> Marioni, an artist, contracted to purchase the property for use as a residence as well as a studio and storage facility for his artwork. He described in great detail why this particular property was ideal both geographically, because of its accessibility to New York City, and structurally, because of its high ceilings and open space. To his dismay, upon wrongfully purchasing the property from Roxy, Broadway renovated the property for use as office space, which included the installation of drop-ceilings and wall partitions, effectively frustrating Marioni\u2019s plans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\"> These calculations result in a difference of $20 from what the judge found that is attributable to clerical error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-12\"> For the same reason, we reject Broadway's cross-appeal for reimbursement of any fees and costs associated with management of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
