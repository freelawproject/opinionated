Triffin appeals from a November 5, 2009 order dismissing his complaint seeking to collect on a dishonored check originally issued by defendant Liccardi Ford, Inc. (Liccardi).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the check was post-dated, and the check cashing service from which Triffin purchased it had made payment in violation of the Check Cashers Regulatory Act of 1993(Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:15A-30 to -52, we hold that the service was not a holder in due course. Triffin\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed based on evidence that the check was stolen from Liccardi.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Viewed in the light most favorable to Triffin, these are the facts. <em>See Estate of Hanges v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>369, 374, 997 A.2d 954 (2010); <em>Triffin v. Somerset Valley Bank, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>73, 82, 777 A.2d 993 (App.Div.2001). The underlying dispute concerns a cheek dated August 10, 2007, that was made payable to one of Liccardi\u2019s employees, Charles Stallone, Jr. According to an unrebutted certification submitted in support of Liccardi\u2019s summary judgment motion, the company withheld the check from Stallone because he was suspected of embezzlement. However, the check disappeared from the company offices, and when the disappearance was discovered, Liccardi \u201cimmediately placed a stop payment on [the check].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">On this record there is no dispute that JCNB Check Cashing, Inc. (JCNB) cashed the check for Stallone before the issue date and then deposited the check in its own bank account on or before August 9, 2007. However, the issuing bank refused to honor the check. On February 11, 2009, Triffin acquired the dishonored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>payroll check from JCNB and sued Liccardi and Stallone for the amount of the check plus interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The Special Civil Part judge granted Liecardi\u2019s summary judgment motion. The judge reasoned that JCNB was not a holder in due course because the fact that the check was postdated should have put JCNB on notice that there was a claim or defense against collection. The judge further reasoned that Triffin was not a holder in due course because he acquired the Liccardi check, and seven other checks, as part of a \u201cbulk transaction\u201d from JCNB. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-302c.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Under the New Jersey Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-302a, to be a holder in due course one must take \u201can instrument for value, in good faith, and without notice of dishonor or any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person.\u201d <em>Triffin v. Quality Urban Hous. Partners, supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 541, 800 A.2d 905. \u201cGood faith\u201d includes \u201cthe observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-103a(4). Further, the document must not be \u201cso irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-302(a)(l); <em>see Triffin v. Pomerantz Staffing Servs., LLC, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 307, 851 A.2d 100 (App.Div.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Triffin did not take the Liccardi check as a holder in due course, because he purchased the instrument with notice that it had been dishonored. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-302a; <em>Triffin v. Quality Urban Hous. Partners, supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 541-42, 800 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>A.2d 905. However, if JCNB was a holder in due course when it obtained the check from Stallone, it could assign its interest in the check to Triffin and he in turn could enforce JCNB\u2019s rights as its assignee. <em>Triffin v. Quality Urban Hous. Partners, supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 542, 800 A.2d 905; <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-305b (enforcement rights of a holder in due course); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:25-1 (\u201c[A]ll choses in action arising on contract shall be assignable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">There is no basis on this record to dispute that Stallone stole the check from his employer and induced JCNB to cash it before the issue date on the check. If Stallone attempted to collect on the check from the obligor, he would be subject to Liccardi\u2019s defenses. Therefore, the critical question is whether JCNB took the check as a holder in due course and can thereby avoid the defenses to enforcement that Liccardi has against Stallone. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-305a(3)c (\u201can obligor is not obliged to pay\u201d if the plaintiff is not a holder in due course and \u201cthe obligor proves that the instrument is a lost or stolen instrument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We have previously held that \u201ca holder in due course must satisfy both a subjective and an objective test of good faith, requiring a consideration of the holder\u2019s honesty in fact and observance of reasonable commercial standards.\u201d <em>Triffin v. Pomerantz Staffing Servs., supra, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 308, 851 A.2d 100 (internal citations omitted). \u201cA party who fails to make an inquiry, reasonably required by the circumstances of the transaction, so as to remain ignorant of facts that might disclose a defect cannot claim to be a holder in due course.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 851 A.2d 100. In <em>Pomerantz, </em>we denied holder in due course status to an assignor who failed to comply with instructions on the face of the check to test whether the ink on the check was heat-sensitive. <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded that a check casher must inquire into the authenticity of checks when presented with \u201cevidence that they were not authentic.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">It is reasonable, in considering whether the instruments were received in good faith and <em>whether the holder comported with reasonable commercial standards, </em>that the holder be expected to fully examine the front and back of the instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>and, where the instrument purports to contain a method by which its authenticity may be tested, that the holder actually utilize that method. <em>[Id. </em>at 309-10, 851 A2d 100 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Similarly, in <em>Triffin v. Travelers Express Co., </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>399, 851 A.2d 667 (App.Div.2004), we held that an assignor could not qualify as a holder in due course of money orders that contained \u201ctelltale unmatching serial numbers,\u201d because the apparent defect \u201cshould have caused [the] assignors[ ] to be suspicious about their legitimacy, and should have prompted them to seek information from [the maker].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405, 851 A.2d 667. We concluded that the \u201cassignors, especially because they are in the business of making a profit by cashing such instruments, cannot claim holder in due course status by blithely and blindly cashing such instruments.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Under the express terms of the Cheek Cashers Regulatory Act of 1993, a check cashing service is prohibited from \u201ceash[ing] or advancing] any money on a postdated check.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:15A-47e. Therefore, the Act requires that a licensee, such as JCNB, examine the face of a check and refrain from cashing it if the check is postdated. We conclude that in this case the Act defined the \u201creasonable commercial standards\u201d that JCNB was required to follow, and having failed to follow those standards, JCNB was not a holder in due course. <em>See Martin Glennon, Inc. v. First Fid. Bank, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48, 57, 652 A.2d 199 (App.Div.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Triffin\u2019s reliance on section 113 of the UCC is misplaced. <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-113a provides that \u201c[a]n instrument may be antedated or postdated.\u201d However, it also defines when an instrument is payable: \u201cExcept as provided in subsection c. of 12A:4-401 [permitting banks to make payment on postdated checks], an instrument payable on demand is not payable before the date of the instrument.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As we have recognized, \u201c[a] check ... is a demand instrument.\u201d <em>Commerce Bank, N.A. v. Rickett, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>379, 382-83, 748 A.2d 111 (App.Div.2000); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-104f. Therefore, we find no inconsistency between the UCC and the Check Cashers Regulatory Act, which prohibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>check cashing services from making payment on postdated checks. <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:15A-47c.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Relying on <em>Valley National Bank v. P.A.Y. Check Cashing, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>406, 875 A.2d 1056 (Law Div.2004), <em>aff'd, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 875 A.2d 953 (App.Div.2005), Triffin argues that Liccardi cannot assert a defense based on the Act, because the Act was intended to protect check payees and not obligors. We find no merit in this argument. The plaintiff in that case brought an action against a check casher in order to recoup funds from a check that a payee fraudulently obtained from the plaintiff and subsequently cashed with the check casher. <em>Valley Nat\u2019l Bank, supra, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 409-11, 875 A.2d 1056. As in the present case, the Uniform Commercial Code governed the outcome. <em>Id. </em>at 415, 875 A.2d 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The Law Division ruled that under the UCC, the check casher was liable to the plaintiff for the amount of the check. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 875 A.2d 1056. The court rejected a UCC defense asserted by the check casher that required proof of good faith. <em>Id. </em>at 420, 427, 875 A.2d 1056. The issue presented to the court was \u201cwhether [the check casher] as a matter of law failed to act in accordance with reasonable commercial standards applicable ... to check cashing licensees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422, 875 A.2d 1056. The court found that the check casher failed to observe reasonable commercial standards, because it \u201cviolated the Check Cashers Regulatory Act, which establishes reasonable commercial standards for check cashing licensees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425, 875 A.2d 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The language on which Triffin relies appears in a portion of the Law Division opinion holding that a bank cannot assert a private right of action for a check casher\u2019s violations of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 415, 875 A.2d 1056. However, in a later portion of the opinion, the Law Division held that a violation of the Act is relevant to whether a check cashing service has acted in good faith under the UCC. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 875 A.2d 1056. The court rendered judgment for the bank for the defendant\u2019s UCC violations, and only the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>In rejecting the defendant\u2019s appeal, we specifically agreed with the Law Division \u201cthat defendant\u2019s conduct in cashing the check in violation of the provisions of the Check Cashers Regulatory Act of 1993, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:15A-30 to -52, did not, as a matter of law, satisfy defendant\u2019s obligation of \u2018good faith\u2019 under the UCC.\u201d 378 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 234-35, 875 A.2d 953. That is the pertinent holding for purposes of the case before us. Like the check easher in <em>Valley National Bank, </em>JCNB clearly violated a provision of the Act and, therefore, failed to observe reasonable commercial standards of the check cashing industry as established by the Act. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, JCNB cannot qualify as a holder in due course. <em>See Triffin v. Pomerantz Staffing Servs., supra, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 308, 851 A.2d 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Triffin\u2019s reliance on <em>Triffin v. Bank of America, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 917 A.2d 257 (App.Div.2007), is equally unpersuasive. In that case, Triffin sued a bank to collect on a dishonored, overdrawn check. <em>Id. </em>at 85, 917 A.2d 257. In turn, the bank claimed that the check cashing service from which Triffin bought the cheek had violated section 48 of the Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:15A-48a(5), by dealing with Triffin a person previously found liable for civil fraud.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 86, 917 A.2d 257. In rejecting the bank\u2019s argument, we reasoned that the Act did not necessarily prohibit a cheek easher from selling cheeks to such a person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">[The] legislative history shows that the Check Cashers Act was enacted to establish a regulatory framework to protect against money laundering. It does not reflect a public policy that would prohibit a licensee from lawfully conducting business with a person simply because the individual has had a civil fraud judgment entered against him____The language of the statute that confers on the Commissioner the authority to suspend or revoke a license does not warrant the conclusion that the entry of a fraud judgment against an individual will constitute a per se bar to that person\u2019s ability to accept an assignment of rights from a licensed check easher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 88, 917 A2d 257.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">By contrast, the case before us concerns JCNB\u2019s clear violation of a \u201cper se bar\u201d against cashing postdated cheeks. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, as a practical matter, a check casher may not necessarily know that a person who seeks to buy its checks has been convicted of fraud. On the other hand, a simple perusal of the face of the check will reveal whether it is postdated. <em>See Triffin v. Travelers Express Co., supra, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 405, 851 A.2d 667; <em>Triffin v. Pomerantz Staffing Servs., supra, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 309-10, 851 A.2d 100; <em>see also Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Camp, </em>159 <em>Ohio App.3d </em>784, 825 N.E.2d 644, 647 (2005) (holding that a check cashing service failed to act in good faith by accepting a postdated check \u201c[w]ithout taking any steps to discover whether the postdated check\u201d was valid).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Because the check cashing service from which Triffin bought the Liccardi check violated the Act by paying on a postdated check, Triffin could not, by taking an assignment of the check, assert the rights of a holder in due course.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> His complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\"> Triffin is in the business of buying dishonored checks and attempting to collect on them. <em>See Triffin v. Quality Urban Hous. Partners, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 540, 800 A.2d 905 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\"> Stallone did not appear in the action, although he was served with the complaint and Liccardi's summary judgment motion.

On this appeal, we permitted Triffin to submit a supplemental brief addressing the Act.

The trial judge properly accepted defendant's proofs, recognizing that the Rules of Evidence may be relaxed in Small Claims actions. <em>See NJ.R.E. </em>101(a)(2)(A). Triffin's additional arguments on this appeal are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:1 l-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
