After closely examining this difficult issue, we conclude the Legislature most likely intended that the \u201cclaim\u201d is \u201cfiled\u201d when the latter event occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The facts are not in dispute. Garrison Lange was injured in an automobile accident in Sayreville on December 1, 2006, when his vehicle was struck by a vehicle owned by Holger Trucking Company and driven by a Holger employee. That day, Lange contacted his automobile insurer, plaintiff New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Group (NJM), advising of the accident and claiming he had sustained neck and back injuries. On that same day, NJM created a file for Lange\u2019s PIP claim and assigned it a file number.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">On December 4, 2006, Michael Feher, an NJM adjuster, mailed Lange a PIP application to be completed and returned. That same day, Lange was first treated by Dr. Edward Palluzzi, a chiropractor. On December 6, 2006, Dr. Palluzzi submitted medical bills to NJM for treatment rendered on December 4 and 5, 2006. NJM received Dr. Palluzzi\u2019s bills on December 8, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">On December 8, 2006, Dr. Palluzzi sent NJM a letter of medical necessity, which referenced the file number NJM had assigned to Lange\u2019s PIP file, asserting that Lange\u2019s right and left shoulders required adjustment. Dr. Palluzzi requested NJM\u2019s approval of a one-month treatment plan, which was authorized by Feher on December 11, 2006. Dr. Palluzzi forwarded additional bills for treatment rendered on December 8 and 11, 2006, which were received by NJM on December 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">On December 20, 2006, as requested, Lange sent NJM a completed PIP application, which NJM received on December 26, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">On December 24, 2008, NJM filed its complaint in this action against Holger and its insurer, ARI Insurance Companies, seeking reimbursement of $53,323.29 in PIP benefits NJM paid on Lange\u2019s behalf. Because NJM\u2019s suit was filed more than two years after Lange first advised NJM of the accident and more than two years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>after NJM opened a file, assigned it a number, received medical bills and treatment plans regarding Lange\u2019s treatment, and approved Lange\u2019s treatment plan, Holger and ARI (defendants) moved for summary judgment based on <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">An insurer ... paying [PIP] benefits ... or medical expense benefits ... as a result of an accident occurring within this State, shall, <em>within two years of the filing of the claim, </em>have the right to recover the amount of payments from any tortfeasor who was not, at the time of the accident, required to maintain [PIP] protection or medical expense benefits coverage at the time of the accident. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">NJM countered that the suit was timely filed because it did not receive Lange\u2019s formal PIP application until December 26, 2006, slightly less than two years before the filing of this suit. The trial judge agreed with NJM\u2019s proposed construction of the statute and denied defendants\u2019 motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1 does not expressly define what is meant by \u201cthe claim\u201d as used in this context. We have in the past broadly defined \u201cclaim\u201d as \u201c \u2018a challenging request, a demand of a right, a calling upon another for something due, a demand for benefits or payment, a privilege to something, a title to something in the possession of another____\u2019 \u201d <em>Burlington Cnty. Abstract Co. v. QMA Assocs., </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>398, 404, 400 A.2d 1211 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Lamberton v. Travelers Indem. Co., </em>325 A.2d 104, 107 (Del.Super.Ct.1974), <em>aff'd, </em>346 A.2d 167 (Del.1975)), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>280, 405 A.2d 824 (1979). The statutory framework for the rendering of PIP benefits, however, fully recognizes that an insured or health care provider may provide many such claims, and, as a result, there is significant uncertainty about which of the many demands for payment that might be submitted in a given case\u2014or were submitted here\u2014constitutes \u201cthe\u201d claim that commenced the limitation period prescribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1. For example, Dr. Palluzzi\u2019s various bills may be viewed as \u201cclaims,\u201d because they were submitted with the intent that NJM provide payment within the brief time frame contained in <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-5(g). In addition, NJM requested Lange\u2019s submission of a completed PIP claim form, which might also be viewed as \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>claim\u201d referred to in <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1. Accordingly, in casting about the many demands that may be asserted in this setting for \u201cthe claim\u201d that the Legislature referred to in <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1, we must resort to the familiar guidelines of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In interpreting a statute, we generally look to the particular wording of the statute, <em>see, e.g., Germann v. Matriss, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>193, 220, 260 A.2d 825 (1970) (recognizing that \u201cthe meaning of words may be indicated and controlled by those with which they are associated\u201d), as well as the overall sense and purpose of the statute, <em>see, e.g., Lesniak v. Budzash, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8, 626 A.2d 1073 (1993) (holding that courts should consider the \u201clegislative policy underlying the statute and any history which may be of aid\u201d). These factors should also be considered in conjunction so that \u201ca literal interpretation of individual statutory terms or provisions\u201d is not permitted to override \u201cthe overall purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Licensed Beverage Ins. Exch., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>1, 5, 679 A.2d 620 (1996) (quoting <em>Young v. Schering Corp., </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>16, 25, 660 A.2d 1153 (1995)). We are thus required to carefully examine the words chosen by the Legislature in expressing its intent as well as the overall purpose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1 and its neighboring and related provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">In looking first to the words of the statute and the critical phrase, we focus initially on the Legislature\u2019s use of the definite article. That is, in giving the words in the statute their common meaning, <em>Darel v. Pennsylvania Mfrs. Assoc. Ins. Co., </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>416, 425, 555 A.2d 570 (1989); <em>N.J.S.A </em>1:1-1, the Legislature\u2019s reference to the submission of <em>\u201cthe </em>claim\u201d as the event triggering the running of the statute of limitations was likely intended to mean a single, definite event and not any one of a series of events. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reach this conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>not only because the phrasing of the statute strongly suggests a single, definite submission to the insurer as the triggering event, but also because the very nature of the undertaking'\u2014the fixing of the moment upon which the limitations period begins to run\u2014 suggests a need to provide the parties with a clear and unambiguous understanding of which of any number of occurrences is the triggering event. With that goal in mind, we are satisfied the Legislature intended to fix a single circumstance as the triggering event. Accordingly, we place significant emphasis on the fact that the Legislature described that event as the filing of \u201cthe claim\u201d and not \u201ca claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Concluding that \u201cthe claim\u201d refers to a single event and not any one of an array of possible events, however, only partially narrows the focus. That is, the Legislature\u2019s use of the definite article undoubtedly was intended to describe one event clearly distinguishable from all others. But it does not provide enlightenment as to whether that singular claim was meant to be <em>the </em>first claim, <em>the </em>last claim, or <em>the </em>claim that is different from all others, namely, the insured\u2019s PIP application.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Having narrowed the field of possibilities, we reject the last request for payment from a health care provider as \u201cthe claim\u201d referred to in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1. What might be the last request for payment may not always be obvious to the parties until there is a considerable passage of time from its submission. For example, an insurer could receive a series of requests for payment over the course of a few months ending on January 5, 2008. With an interval of a few weeks during which no request was submitted, the insurer might be led to assume that the two-year period began running on January 5, 2008. Many weeks or months later, however, another request for payment might be received, causing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the insurer to readjust its view of the deadline for filing suit. In that fashion, the two-year limitations period will become a moving target until such time as the insured or his or her health care providers eventually stop making requests for payment. Because of the impracticalities and uncertainty associated with such an approach, we reject as unlikely that the Legislature intended \u201cthe claim\u201d to be \u201cthe last demand for payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The first request for payment seems more logical because it would tend to compel the early filing of suits for reimbursement. The Legislature\u2019s choice of that event would best serve the goals underlying all statutes of limitations\u2014providing defendants with \u201ca fair opportunity to defend\u201d and \u201cpreventing] plaintiffs from litigating stale claims,\u201d Price <em>v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>519, 524, 867 A.2d 1181 (2005) (quoting <em>W.V. Pangborne &amp; Co. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>543, 563, 562 A.2d 222 (1989))\u2014by requiring the insurer to commence its reimbursement suit sooner than it would if the last request for payment was chosen as the trigger point. But interpreting \u201cthe claim\u201d as the equivalent of the insured\u2019s first request for PIP benefits generates uncertainty. For example, in this case the first claim could logically be construed as the insured\u2019s initial telephone call to the insurer to advise of the accident or it could be construed as Dr. Palluzzi\u2019s first request for payment of a bill. Although here those two events occurred only two days apart, other problematic scenarios can be envisioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We think it unlikely that the Legislature intended to leave parties in the dark as to the commencement of the limitations period by choosing an uncertain triggering event. Instead, the Legislature likely had some other event in mind when it referred to \u201cthe claim\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1. Our focus on the definite article in the phrase \u201cthe claim\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1 was helpful in recognizing the Legislature\u2019s intent to fix one particular, distinguishable event as the trigger for the limitations period. Yet our consideration of the word \u201cclaim\u201d as used in the statutory scheme, as well as the purposes of the no-fault laws, compels our conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>sion that it is the submission of the PIP claim form that triggers the two-year limitations period contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">As we have noted, in other circumstances we have viewed the word \u201cclaim\u201d broadly as including any assertion of a right or demand for payment. <em>Burlington Cnty. Abstract Co., supra, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 404, 400 A.2d 1211. Viewed broadly, practically everything submitted by either the insured or his health care providers to NJM constituted a \u201cclaim.\u201d However, as we have explained, utilization of such a broad definition would generate undue uncertainty regarding the application of the statute of limitations in most any given case. Logic suggests that the Legislature intended one particular, clearly distinguishable event to trigger the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">In seeking what the Legislature intended, we find it significant that, in declaring the parties\u2019 obligations upon the submission to an insurer of a demand for payment, the Legislature did not always refer to those submissions as \u201cclaims.\u201d Instead, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-5(a) directs that <em>\u201cwritten notice </em>shall be provided to the insurer by the treating health care provider no later than 21 days following the commencement of treatment\u201d (emphasis added),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5(b) speaks in terms of an insured or health care provider giving \u201cwritten notice\u201d or \u201cnotification\u201d of a \u201cbill or invoice to the insurer for reimbursement of services within 21 days of the commencement of treatment.\u201d We glean from the manner in which these demands were labeled in other related provisions that the Legislature likely contemplated something other than a routine submission of a bill as \u201cthe claim\u201d mentioned in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">This assumption of the legislative intent from the words of the statute and neighboring provisions is reached with no great abundance of certainty. We are concerned by the fact\u2014as the parties recognize\u2014that the policy in question and perhaps others like it do not require that an insured ever submit a PIP claim form; nor do the no-fault laws compel such a \u201cfiling.\u201d <em>As </em>a result, the event we have assumed to be the triggering event for the time within which a reimbursement suit must be commenced may be something that, in many cases, may never occur. However, because nothing else would sensibly constitute a logical event for the commencement of the limitation period, we conclude that \u201cthe claim\u201d referred to in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1 is the submission of the claim form or application requested by the insurer. It is only this submission that provides in a single document: the nature of the accident and the injuries claimed; an identification of the health care provider and his contact information; information about other automobiles garaged at the insured\u2019s household; whether the insured is employed; and whether the accident occurred while the insured was in the course of his employment. The claim form also called for the insured\u2019s signature, thus providing greater formality to the parties\u2019 undertaking. Such a document better conforms to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>what it means to be a \u201cclaim\u201d and its submission constitutes an event that provides clarity and predictability to the commencement of the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In addition, our conclusion as to the likely meaning of <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1 is suggested by the Legislature\u2019s goal in enacting and periodically amending the no-fault laws, which has been to reduce insurance costs for New Jersey residents. <em>David v. Gov\u2019t Emp. Ins. Co., </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 134-35, 821 A.2d 564 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>251, 837 A.2d 1094 (2003). To that end, the various provisions of the no-fault laws, including <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1, are liberally construed. <em>Washington v. Mkt. Transition Facility, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>368, 372, 685 A.2d 57 (App. Div.1996). As a result, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1 is to be read \u201cbroadly so as to encompass all potentially liable tortfeasors, consistent with the legislative objective of reducing insurance premiums\u201d for vehicle owners. <em>David, supra, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 135, 821 A.2d 564. Reimbursement \u201cadvances stability in the insurance marketplace by requiring that the ultimate cost of PIP benefits be borne by the insurer of the responsible party, not by the insurer of the victim.\u201d <em>Fernandez v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>591, 593, 974 A.2d 1031 (2009). Accordingly, adoption of a later moment in time\u2014the submission of the claim form\u2014provides additional time for \u201cthe insurer of the victim\u201d to seek reimbursement from \u201cthe insurer of the responsible party\u201d and, thus, better serves the goals of the no-fault laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">As can be seen, our resolution of this novel issue is based largely on an interpretation of the wording and general sense of the statute, as well as its overall goals. To be sure, the possible triggering events we have rejected represent plausible interpretations of the statute, and we take comfort in knowing that the Legislature is fully capable of correcting the statute\u2019s ambiguity if it believes we have erroneously interpreted the statute. <em>See LaFage v. Jani, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>412, 430, 766 A.2d 1066 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> Common usage might suggest that the word \u201cclaim\u201d preceded by \u201ca\u201d restricts application to a single object or subject; however, the \u201cusual presumption in favor of [that] natural application appears to be reversed\u201d in matters of statutory interpretation. 2A Norman Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47:34 at 377 (2d ed. 2010). That is, most courts have ruled \u201cthat a term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>introduced by a' or 'an' applies to multiple subjects or objects unless there is reason to find that singular application was intended or is reasonably understood.\" <em>Ibid. </em>Application of this general guideline would suggest that an insurer could timely commence a reimbursement suit within two years of any claim\u2014an outcome we believe unlikely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> The entire relevant text of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5(a), quoted below, demonstrates that the various notifications of treatment provided by the insured and Dr. Palluzzi are different than \"the claim\u201d that triggers the limitation period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq89\">In the case of <em>claims </em>for medical expense benefits under [standard, basic or special automobile insurance] policies [required by <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:6A-4, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-3.1, or <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:6A-3.3], <em>written notice </em>shall be provided to the insurer by the treating health care provider no later than 21 days following the commencement of treatment. <em>Notification </em>required under this section shall be made in accordance with the regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance and on a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance.

However, the sense derived from all the subsections of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5 is that the many bills for payment that may be served on the insurer in a given case are only portions of what the Legislature viewed as an insured\u2019s \"claim\u201d for PIP benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
