J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABL\">\u2014A juryconvicted defendant Carlos Cortez Burton of torture, aggravated mayhem, corporal injury, and misdemeanor child endangerment. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 206, 205, 273.5, subd. (a), 273a, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to support (1) his conviction for torture; (2) his conviction for child endangerment; and (3) the enhancement allegations that he used a dangerous or deadly weapon. (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1).) We disagree and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">In so doing, we conclude that a parent may be convicted of misdemeanor child endangerment under section 273a, subdivision (b), by engaging in serious domestic violence against the other parent while aware that his or her child is at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Defendant and the victim, Shanita S., have had a stormy relationship dating back to 1994. Defendant had threatened Shanita multiple times, sometimes with a gun. They had lived together off and on and have two sons. In 2004, Shanita and the children moved from Arkansas to Sacramento after defendant threatened to \u201churt\u201d her if she stayed in town. Shortly thereafter, defendant moved to Sacramento and eventually moved in with Shanita because Shanita wanted the children to be near their father. Several days before the attack that is at issue on appeal, defendant accused Shanita of cheating on him. Two days before the attack, Shanita asked defendant to move out.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>In the early morning of May 20, 2005, Shanita was preparing to drive to work with her two children. She had placed the younger son, then two years old, in his car seat while the older son, then eight, had gone behind a wall adjacent to the passenger\u2019s side of the car to urinate (he could no longer hold it).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>Shanita then walked around to the driver\u2019s side of the car and found defendant crouched near the front tire. As Shanita described it, defendant stood, punched her three to four times, then ran away after she lost her balance and fell. Shanita soon realized defendant had inflicted a series of deep cuts to her face. Shanita was hospitalized and treated with over 200 stitches. She is permanently disfigured.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">At trial, defendant presented evidence that he was sleeping at the home of a friend at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">In reviewing the sufficiency of evidence in a criminal appeal, we review the record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether there is substantial evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738].) An appellate court must presume the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence. <em>(People v. Redmond </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 745, 755 [79 Cal.Rptr. 529, 457 P.2d 321].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">2. <em>Torture Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Defendant contends there is insufficient evidence to support his torture conviction under section 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Section 206 provides: \u201cEvery person who, with the intent to cause cruel or extreme pain and suffering for the purpose of revenge, extortion, persuasion, or for any sadistic purpose, inflicts great bodily injury as defined in Section 12022.7 upon the person of another, is guilty of torture.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] [&lt;J[] The crime of torture does not require any proof that the victim suffered pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">Torture has two elements: \u201c(1) the infliction of great bodily injury on another; and (2) the specific intent to cause cruel or extreme pain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>suffering for revenge, extortion or persuasion or any sadistic purpose.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 882, 888 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 498].) It is uncontested <em>that </em>defendant inflicted great bodily injury. The issue is whether substantial evidence supports a finding of the second element of torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">a. <em>Intent to cause cruel or extreme pain and suffering</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Defendant contends the evidence establishes only the intent to disfigure, rather than the intent to cause cruel or extreme pain and suffering. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Courts have interpreted intent to inflict \u201ccruel\u201d pain and suffering as intent to inflict extreme or severe pain. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aguilar </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1196, 1202 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 619].) Absent direct evidence of such intent, the circumstances of the offense can establish the intent to inflict extreme or severe pain. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hale </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 94, 106 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 904] [smashing victim\u2019s teeth out with a hammer constitutes torture under section 206]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kwok </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1245 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 40].)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">A jury may consider the severity of the wounds in determining whether a defendant intended to torture. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mincery </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 432-433 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388].) Here, defendant inflicted four deep cuts, each at least one and a half centimeters, to Shanita\u2019s face, and one to her tongue. The cuts went through the skin, through the underlying tissue, and down to the muscle.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Moreover, \u201cscarring and disfigurement constitute strong circumstantial evidence of intent to inflict severe pain and suffering.\u201d <em>(People v. Baker </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1224 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 313].) The attack here permanently disfigured Shanita. On the right side of her face, she has two scars: one from the comer of her mouth mnning toward her ear, and another along the jaw line. On the left side of her face, a scar mns from the comer of her mouth down her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Also, a jury may infer intent to cause extreme pain from a defendant who focuses his attack on a particularly vulnerable area, such as the face, rather than indiscriminately attacking the victim. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Quintero </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1163 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 884].) Here, defendant focused the attack on Shanita\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Finally, defendant\u2019s earlier threats to Shanita suggest the intent to cause extreme or severe pain. He had threatened to \u201ckill [Shanita] or fuck her up,\u201d \u201churt [her],\u201d \u201cbash [her] head in,\u201d \u201cput [her] in a wheelchair,\u201d make her \u201cpay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Given the severity of the injuries, the scarring and disfigurement, the attack\u2019s focus on the face, and defendant\u2019s prior statements, we conclude there is sufficient evidence that defendant intended to cause cruel or extreme pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">b. <em>For revenge, extortion, persuasion, or for any sadistic purpose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Defendant argues there is insufficient evidence to establish that he acted with sadistic intent. Section 206 requires that a defendant commit the act for \u201crevenge, extortion, persuasion, or for any sadistic purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Defendant concedes he intended to disfigure Shanita, but argues that such intent is not the same as acting with a sadistic purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201csadism\u201d as \u201ca form of satisfaction . . . derived from inflicting harm on another.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Diet. (5th ed. 1979) p. 1198.) By disfiguring Shanita, defendant intended to make her undesirable. He had threatened to \u201cfuck her up where nobody else would want her\u201d and \u201c[he would] make sure no one ever want[ed] to look at [her] again.\u201d A jury could reasonably conclude that defendant disfigured Shanita to receive satisfaction and thus acted with a sadistic purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">The record also contains substantial evidence that defendant attacked Shanita for revenge. Shanita testified that she had asked defendant to move out two days before the attack, after he had repeatedly accused her of cheating. On his way out, defendant warned, \u201cbitch, you\u2019ll pay.\u201d Earlier he had threatened, \u201cif you\u2019re messing around, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d On this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude the attack was done for revenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Finding all elements met, we uphold the torture conviction under section 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">3. <em>Misdemeanor Child Endangerment Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">Defendant contends the evidence is insufficient that he violated section 273a, subdivision (b)\u2014misdemeanor child endangerment. He argues that because his older son did not see the actual attack on Shanita, it did not occur in the minor\u2019s presence and was not directed at him; consequently, section 273a, subdivision (b), does not apply. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">Section 273a, subdivision (b), provides; \u201cAny person who, under circumstances or conditions other than those likely to produce great bodily harm or death, [1] willfully causes or permits any child to suffer, or [2] inflicts thereon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, or [3] having the care or custody of any child, willfully causes or permits the person or health of that child to be injured, or [4] willfully causes or permits that child to be placed in a situation where his or her person or health may be endangered, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See <em>People v. Sargent </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1206, 1215 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 835, 970 P.2d 409] <em>(Sargent).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The People charged defendant under the first two branches of section 273a, subdivision (b): (1) willfully caused or permitted his older son to suffer; and (2) inflicted on his older son unjustifiable mental suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Section 273a encompasses a wide variety of situations and includes both direct and indirect conduct. <em>(People v. Smith </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 798, 806 [201 Cal.Rptr. 311, 678 P.2d 886]; see <em>People v. Valdez </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 778, 786-787 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 3, 42 P.3d 511] <em>(Valdez).) </em>When the harm to a child is directly inflicted, the requisite mental state for the section 273a offense is general criminal intent. <em>(Valdez, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 786; <em>Sargent, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 1215-1216, 1222, 1224 [general criminal intent is the intent to do the proscribed act].) When that harm is indirectly inflicted, the requisite mental state is criminal negligence. <em>(Valdez, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pp. 781, 786-791; see also \u00a7 20 [in every crime there must exist act and intent, or act and criminal negligence].) Criminal negligence is aggravated, culpable, gross or reckless conduct that is such a departure from that of the ordinarily prudent or careful person under the same circumstances as to be incompatible with a proper regard for human life. <em>(Valdez, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 783.) A defendant may be deemed to be criminally negligent if a reasonable person in his or her position would have been aware of the risk. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Here, there is no suggestion that defendant intended to directly inflict suffering on his older son. As defendant points out, his older son was not physically injured or threatened during the attack on Shanita, nor was the minor near enough to be in danger of physical injury. The record suggests, as defendant asserts, that the minor did not see the actual attack. Based on these facts, defendant argues the attack did not occur in his older son\u2019s presence and was not directed at him. However, the minor was on the scene while the attack took place and witnessed its bloody immediate aftermath.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Defendant\u2019s conviction under section 273a, subdivision (b), then, rests on whether defendant indirectly inflicted harm on his older son by attacking Shanita while the minor was at the scene; more specifically, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>evidence is sufficient that defendant willfully caused or permitted the minor to suffer, or inflicted unjustifiable mental suffering on him, and whether defendant did so with a mental state of criminal negligence toward the minor. The term \u201cwillfully\u201d in the section 273a context of indirect conduct implies simply a purpose or willingness to commit the act or make the omission referred to; an act or omission amounting to criminal negligence can, in limited contexts, constitute a willful violation of the law. <em>(Valdez, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pp. 787-788, 790.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The record contains substantial evidence that defendant\u2019s attack on Shanita caused or inflicted on his older son unjustifiable mental suffering. Following the attack, the minor screamed, \u201cwe have to go, we have to get out of here, we have to leave, he\u2019s going to come back\u201d; the boy, who was only eight years old at the time, actually tried to put Shanita\u2019s car in reverse himself. We must bear in mind that file attacker was not just anyone, but the minor\u2019s father, and the victim was not just anyone, but the minor\u2019s mother, whose face had been slashed severely. Subsequently, the minor expressed his suffering by writing in his journal, \u201cI hate my life. I wish I was dead by a gun or a knife. I wish I was never bom. I hate my life.\u201d Before the attack, the minor never got in trouble at school; now he lands in trouble daily and sees a counselor weekly.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">There is also sufficient evidence that defendant acted with criminal negligence toward the minor when he attacked Shanita. There is no doubt that defendant\u2019s attack on Shanita was a willful act, and that defendant\u2019s older son was at the scene. The record shows that at the time of the attack, defendant knew of the minor\u2019s presence. Before the attack, defendant crouched near the driver\u2019s side front tire of Shanita\u2019s car, where he would have been able to hear Shanita place the younger son in the car seat, and the older son say that he had to urinate. Additionally, Shanita had a consistent practice of leaving for work at the same time each day (presumably with the children in tow) for her 6:45 a.m. shift. Moreover, prior to the attack Shanita had left her work schedule on the refrigerator, in full view of defendant. As noted, defendant argues the attack did not occur in his older son\u2019s presence. But defendant\u2019s older son was at the scene of the attack and, as the People aptly put it, saw \u201cthe immediate and bloody results of [defendant\u2019s] handiwork.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Under the criminal negligence standard, defendant\u2019s conduct toward his older son was such a departure from that of the ordinarily prudent or careful person as to be incompatible with a proper regard for human life. A reasonable person would easily recognize that a child would endure unjustifiable mental suffering by being on the scene while his father slashed his mother\u2019s face several times, and then immediately seeing the horrible, bloody aftermath.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Defendant maintains that no published California case encompasses facts similar to those presented here. He is mistaken. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Pantoja </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 492], the defendant was convicted of first degree murder and child endangerment after he killed his girlfriend in the presence of their daughter. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 3.) The defendant in <em>Pantoja </em>argued that, under the single act/multiple punishment proscription of section 654, he could not be separately punished for the child endangerment conviction because, in killing his girlfriend, he had not directed his acts at his daughter and therefore had not committed a crime of violence against her. <em>(Pantoja, supra, </em>at pp. 15-16.) The <em>Pantoja </em>court rejected this argument, noting that section 654 does not apply to multiple victims of a single violent act, and reasoning that there was \u201cno doubt that defendant\u2019s acts harmed [the daughter]\u201d and the defendant could be \u201cpunished separately for that separate crime\u201d of violence. <em>(Pantoja, supra, </em>at p. 16; see also <em>People v. Martin </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 776, 782-783 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 105] [discussing <em>Pantoja </em>with approval].)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">We also find a similar factual and legal scenario in <em>People v. Johnson </em>(2000) 95 N.Y.2d 368 [718 N.Y.S.2d 1, 740 N.E.2d 1075] <em>(Johnson). </em>There, the defendant was convicted of two counts of child endangerment after he attacked his ex-girlfriend as she walked home with her three daughters. (740 N.E.2d at pp. 1075-1076.) The children followed as the defendant dragged their mother to her apartment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1075.) The children were trapped in their bedroom as they listened to the defendant abuse their mother for over 10 hours. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1075-1076.) The New York high court affirmed the endangerment convictions, holding that the applicable statute there was broad enough to cover conduct directed at others that is likely to cause harm to children.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1077.) Although the brutal attack on Shanita did not last 10 hours, the presence of his eight-year-old son at the scene of the attack\u2014who saw the immediate and bloody results of his father\u2019s handiwork on his mother\u2019s face\u2014likely caused similar mental suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Children often witness domestic violence. (See Comment, <em>The Child Witness as a Victim of Domestic Violence: Prosecuting the Batterer Under California\u2019s Child Abuse Statute </em>(1998) 19 J. Juv. L. 196.) There are up to six million victims of domestic violence annually in the United States and half of these incidents occur in the presence of children. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Children witnessing such violence suffer adverse effects similar to victims of direct physical and sexual abuse. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 197; see also <em>Johnson, supra, </em>740 N.E.2d at p. 1077 &amp; fn.) Section 273a applies to suffering resulting from direct physical and sexual abuse. It follows that section 273a should also protect children from actions that indirectly cause similar suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>We conclude that defendant\u2019s conviction under section 273a, subdivision (b), is supported legally and factually.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">4. <em>Use of a Deadly or Dangerous Weapon</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Defendant contends there is insufficient evidence to support the weapon use enhancements on his convictions for torture, aggravated mayhem and corporal injury. (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1).) Defendant raises the possibility that he did not use a weapon, but rather that Shanita\u2019s injuries resulted from a sharp or ribbed edge on the gloves he allegedly was wearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Section 12022, subdivision (b)(1) provides: \u201cAny person who personally uses a deadly or dangerous weapon in the commission of a felony or attempted felony shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of imprisonment in the state prison for one year, unless use of a deadly or dangerous weapon is an element of that offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">There are two classes of dangerous or deadly weapons: instrumentalities that are weapons in the strict sense, such as guns and blackjacks; and instrumentalities which may be used as weapons but which have nondangerous uses, such as hammers and pocket knives. <em>(People v. Raleigh </em>(1932) 128 Cal.App. 105, 108 [16 P.2d 752].) Instrumentalities in the first category are \u201c \u2018dangerous or deadly\u2019 \u201d per se. <em>(Ibid.) </em>An instrumentality in the second category is only \u201c \u2018dangerous or deadly\u2019 \u201d when it is capable of being used in a \u201c \u2018dangerous or deadly\u2019 \u201d manner and the evidence shows its possessor intended to use it as such. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 108-109.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Defendant correctly notes there is no evidence that the instrument he used falls into the first category. Shanita\u2019s testimony described only gloved hands. Whatever caused Shanita\u2019s injuries fell into the second category. However, this does not preclude a jury from finding that it was a dangerous or deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">We need look no further than <em>People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 R2d 365], which held that a jury could properly infer the use of a dangerous or deadly object from the victim\u2019s injuries. In <em>Alvarez, </em>a woman was hit from behind with an unknown object. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 179.) There, the nature of the injury established the use of a dangerous or deadly weapon (the victim received 20 stitches). <em>(Id. </em>at p. 225.) Here, Shanita received over 200 stitches. Moreover, a plastic surgeon testified that based on the nature of Shanita\u2019s injuries, he \u201cbelieve[d] it was a sharp object. A hand or blunt object would most likely not cause ... a direct linear laceration with sharp edges.\u201d A police officer at the scene reached a similar conclusion. He testified to looking for \u201c[s]ome sort of knife or possibly a box cutter\u201d after seeing Shanita\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Based on the injuries and circumstances, the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant used a dangerous or deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Raye, J., and Hull, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 19, 2006, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 17, 2007, S147790.
