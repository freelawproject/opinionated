(Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359.) Critical evidence supporting that charge was obtained from defendant\u2019s dormitory room at Santa Clara University (University) as a result of a warrantless search and seizure by police officers of the City of Santa Clara.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Defendant brought a motion to suppress evidence pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contended that evidence supporting the charge against him\u2014i.e., marijuana, a digital scale, and $1,800 cash (collectively, the contraband<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>)\u2014was illegally seized by the police. After an evidentiary hearing, submission of supplemental briefing, and a further hearing, the superior court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. In so ruling, the court rejected the People\u2019s contention that the search and seizure of the contraband was reasonable because a University security officer\u2014who had the lawful right to be present in defendant\u2019s dormitory room\u2014had given consent for the police to enter the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">The People filed a statutory petition for writ of mandate challenging the suppression order, pursuant to section 1538.5, subdivision <em>(o). </em>For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the University security officer did not have actual authority to consent to the search; on this basis, we therefore do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>deem the warrantless police entry into defendant\u2019s dormitory room to have been reasonable. The People also contend that the search was reasonable based upon a third party\u2019s apparent authority to consent, i.e., it was reasonable for the police to believe that the security officer could consent to the search. While we acknowledge that this position may have some validity, we need not resolve the question, in light of our holding that the suppression motion should have been denied on another basis; the seized contraband was not subject to the exclusionary rule because the contraband would have been inevitably discovered. Accordingly, we will grant the People\u2019s petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Defendant was charged with possession of marijuana for sale. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a preliminary hearing, he was held to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Defendant thereafter filed a motion to suppress evidence pursuant to section 1538.5. He sought suppression of \u201cany physical evidence, any statements, and any observations that were obtained, as a result of or after any officers or campus security officers made any entry into or observations into\u201d his dormitory room. Defendant argued that the entry into and observations made of his room were the product of a warrantless and unreasonable search or seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">The People filed written opposition to the motion, and the court conducted an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After receiving supplemental briefs, and after hearing further argument, the court granted the motion to suppress the contraband seized by the Santa Clara police.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">On July 6, 2005, the People filed their petition for writ of mandate with this court, pursuant to section 1538.5, subdivision (o). Because we concluded that the petition presented close and important questions of constitutional law, we issued an order directing the superior court to show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue as prayed in the People\u2019s petition. That order established a briefing schedule for the filing by defendant of a return in opposition and any reply by the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>RELEVANT FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">I. <em>Stipulated Testimony of University Safety Officer Kim Payne</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on May 24, 2005, the parties stipulated that Kim Payne (Payne), a University safety officer, would have testified (had he been sworn) as follows:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">\u201cOn October 15, 2004, about 6:30 p.m., Santa Clara University Campus Safety Service Officer Kim Payne was conducting routine bicycle patrol of the campus. He observed the defendant smoking marijuana outside Sobrato Hall. As the defendant was walking with two other students, Mr. Payne watched defendant light what appeared to be a \u2018blunt\u2019 (a small cigar stuffed with marijuana). As Mr. Payne turned towards the group, the defendant tried to hide the blunt in his right hand as one of the other students moved in front of him. Mr. Payne smelled the odor of marijuana. He stopped the three students and asked them for their access cards. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">\u201cMr. Payne then asked the defendant what he was smoking. The defendant stated that it was a blunt, saying it was the only one he had, but that he had more marijuana in his room for medical use. He spontaneously said that Mr. Payne could come up to his room and invited him to look at the marijuana and his medical marijuana card. He then showed Mr. Payne two cannabis club cards, which he said that he had used to legally purchase the marijuana. When asked if the Dean of Student Life was aware of his marijuana use and needs, the defendant stated that he had not notified the University. He then gave the blunt to Mr. Payne when requested to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">\u201cAfter Mr. Payne had informed the defendant that he would meet him at his room, they met at the east entrance to Graham Hall 100. Mr. Payne used his access card to gain entry into the building. The defendant unlocked his room door with his own key and escorted Mr. Payne inside. The defendant then removed a sandwich size plastic bag of marijuana from the drawers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>the closet. He stated that he had purchased this marijuana from a cannabis club in Oakland, showing Mr. Payne a medical release form that purported to authorize his use of marijuana for therapeutic use. Mr. Payne observed a knife, a pair of scissors, four miniature cigars and a small electronic scale on the desk near the doorway.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">\u201cThe defendant was acting rather suspiciously as he stood near the closet drawers. When asked if there was any more marijuana in the room, he stated that there was not, and if there were more marijuana in the room, he would know about it. Mr. Payne then checked the top drawer in the closet and noticed an open box of snack size plastic bags, a plastic bag of several disassembled cigars, and several snack size plastic bags with marijuana remnants inside. The bottom right drawer contained a white and red Igloo cooler with two sandwich sized bags full of marijuana. In the second drawer a wad of cash containing $1,800 was located. Walker claimed that he had won the money while playing cards, [f] . . . [j[]</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">\u201cAfter the arrival of the two Santa Clara Police Department Officers, Mr. Payne continued to search and found a jar containing two more sandwich size bags full of marijuana beneath a bunch of dirty clothes in the closet. Two additional boxes of unused sandwich size plastic bags were also found in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">\u201cAll evidence items located there and the photos of them were given to [Police] Office Green, who later booked them into evidence at the Santa Clara Police Department. Exhibit 2. The defendant stated spontaneously that these items belonged to him and not to his roommate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">II. <em>Stipulated Testimony of Police Officer Tyson Green</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">The parties agreed further at the hearing on the motion to suppress that Officer Tyson Green of the Santa Clara Police Department would have testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">\u201cThe Santa Clara Police Department was contacted by the University Campus Safety Office, and they were told that a considerable amount of drugs had been found in a Residence Hall room. As a result, Officers Green and Lamendola went to that [Ujniversity Residence Hall at about 7:04 p.m. [on October 15, 2004], and they met in the first floor hallway with Santa Clara University campus safety officer Michael Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">\u201c[Brady\u2019s] partner, Kim Payne . . . was still inside the room with the defendant. Mr. Brady said to the [police] officers, \u2018You\u2019ve got to see this.\u2019 And he swung open the door inwardly to room 104[,] which is the defendant\u2019s residence room.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>\u201cAt that point, the Santa Clara [police] officers were standing in the hallway next to the defendant\u2019s dormitory room. And while standing in the hallway after the door was swung open, from a distance of approximately five feet, the officers were able to observe a large quantity of what they knew to be marijuana in plastic baggies and cash on the desk just inside room 104. The marijuana was in plain view and openly visible to any persons that walked the hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">\u201cThe [police] officers stood there for a few moments until [Mr.] Payne and the defendant were standing near the doorway and they asked [Mr.] Payne if he had received consent to search the room. Mr. Payne told him that he had received consent but that it wasn\u2019t necessary because of the waiver the defendant had signed in his Residence Housing Contract. Both officers then entered the room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">HI. <em>University Housing Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">In addition to the stipulated testimony of Payne and Officer Green, the housing agreement between the University and the defendant (Housing Contract) was before the court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The \u201cTerms and Conditions of Occupancy\u201d appended to the contract provided in relevant part: \u201cRoom entry and inspection may occur periodically. The University balances the right to privacy of the resident students with the responsibility to maintain a safe environment for all students and staff in the residence halls. The University will take all reasonable steps to ensure the residents of a room receive reasonable notice prior to entry by University personnel for the purposes of repair, inventory, construction, and/or inspection. The University also reserves the right to enter a residence room without notice for responding to real or reasonably perceived emergencies, . . . and/or for response to situations where there is a reasonable suspicion that a violation of the law or University policies is occurring or has occurred inside a particular room. Under such circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>it is not necessary that the room\u2019s resident(s) be present; nor will a resident\u2019s refusal, either verbal or physical, prevent an entry or inspection. By entering into the University Residence Hall Contract . . . the student consents to the room entry and inspection under those circumstances indicated.\u201d The appendix to the agreement provided further that \u201c[Residents agree to abide by all applicable laws and University regulations. . . . Students who fail to abide by this agreement will be subject to University disciplinary procedures as well as possible termination of their University Residence Hall Contract.\u201d Included among specified acts subjecting the resident student to disciplinary action is the \u201c[violation of state laws regarding possession and/or consumption of controlled substances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">I. <em>Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The People contend that the court erred in suppressing the contraband for essentially four reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">1. The police officers\u2019 entry into defendant\u2019s dormitory room was lawful because they had valid third party consent (from Payne); under the circumstances, the officers\u2019 conduct was justified because Payne had either actual or apparent authority to consent to the entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">2. Because the contraband was in plain view from the hallway, the police officers\u2019 entry into the room and seizure of the contraband were justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">3. The police officers\u2019 entry into the room was justified under the \u201cconsent-once-removed\u201d doctrine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">4. Even if the police officers\u2019 entry into the dorm room was unlawful, the seized contraband that would have otherwise been subject to the exclusionary rule was admissible under the inevitable discovery rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">We will first delineate our standard of review and identify general principles of search and seizure law before addressing the People\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Our Supreme Court has explained the trial court\u2019s role in deciding motions to suppress brought under section 1538.5 and appellate review of those decisions as follows: \u201cIn ruling on such a motion, the trial court (1) finds the historical facts, (2) selects the applicable rule of law, and (3) applies the latter to the former to determine whether the rule of law as applied to the established facts is or is not violated. [Citations.] \u2018The [trial] court\u2019s resolution of each of these inquiries is, of course, subject to appellate review.\u2019 [Citations.] [f] The court\u2019s resolution of the first inquiry, which involves questions of fact, is reviewed under the deferential substantial-evidence standard. [Citations.] Its decision on the second, which is a pure question of law, is scrutinized under the standard of independent review. [Citations.] Finally, its ruling on the third, which is a mixed fact-law question that is however predominantly one of law, viz., the reasonableness of the challenged police conduct, is also subject to independent review. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1268, 1301 [248 Cal.Rptr. 834, 756 P.2d 221]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 182 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Since the trial court here decided the motion based on stipulated testimony, all aspects of the trial court\u2019s ruling are subject to this court\u2019s independent review. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 811, 818 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 750, 135 P.3d 3]; see also <em>People v. Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 969 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044] [appellate court, in reviewing ruling on motion to suppress, \u201cindependently review[s] the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts\u201d].) Further, we examine the legal issues surrounding the potential suppression of evidence derived from a police search and seizure by applying federal constitutional standards. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robles </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 789, 794 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 914, 3 P.3d 311].)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">We review the court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s section 1538.5 motion to suppress with the above standard of review in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">III. <em>Search and Seizure Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d Our state Constitution provides for similar safeguards against unreasonable searches and seizures. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 13.) As the Supreme Court has explained: \u201cThe touchstone of the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>Amendment is reasonableness. [Citation.] The Fourth Amendment does not proscribe all state-initiated searches and seizures; it merely proscribes those which are unreasonable.\u201d <em>(Florida v. Jimeno </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 248, 250 [114 L.Ed.2d 297, 111 S.Ct. 1801]; see also <em>Brigham City, Utah </em>v. <em>Stuart </em>(2006) 547 U.S._[164 L.Ed.2d 650, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 1947].)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">\u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\u201d <em>(Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 347, 351 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 S.Ct. 507].) A Fourth Amendment claim \u201c \u2018may not be vicariously asserted.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Rakas v. Illinois </em>(1978) 439 U.S. 128, 133-134 [58 L.Ed.2d 387, 99 S.Ct. 421].) \u201c[I]n order to claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment, a defendant must demonstrate that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place searched, and that his expectation is reasonable.\u201d <em>(Minnesota v. Carter </em>(1998) 525 U.S. 83, 88 [142 L.Ed.2d 373, 119 S.Ct. 469]; see, e.g., <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>(1990) 495 U.S. 91, 99 [109 L.Ed.2d 85, 110 S.Ct. 1684] [houseguest has legitimate expectation of privacy in host\u2019s home].) The defendant thus bears the burden \u201cof establishing a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched or the thing seized. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 972; see also <em>People v. McPeters </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1148, 1171 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 832 P.2d 146].) And \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures applies only to governmental action. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re William G. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 550, 558 [221 Cal.Rptr. 118, 709 P.2d 1287], citing <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 443, 487 [29 L.Ed.2d 564, 91 S.Ct. 2022] <em>(Coolidge).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">\u201c \u2018[P]rivate residences are places in which the individual normally expects privacy free of governmental intrusion not authorized by a warrant, and that expectation is plainly one that society is prepared to recognize as justifiable.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 795, quoting <em>United States v. Karo </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 705, 714 [82 L.Ed.2d 530, 104 S.Ct. 3296].) Therefore, searches and seizures conducted without a warrant \u201care <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment [of the United States Constitution]\u2014subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>(Katz v. United States, supra, </em>389 U.S. at p. 357, fns. omitted; see also <em>Payton v. New York </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 573, 586 [63 L.Ed.2d 639, 100 S.Ct. 1371]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at pp. 817-818.) Where the defendant establishes that the search or seizure was made without a warrant, and was prima facie unlawful, \u201cthe burden then rest[s] on the prosecution to show proper justification. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Horack v. Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 720, 725 [91 Cal.Rptr. 569, 478 P.2d 1]; see also <em>People v. Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 972.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>That the police may have probable cause for their belief that items are subject to seizure does not eliminate the need for a warrant to effect a search of a residence. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 493, 497 [2 L.Ed.2d 1514, 78 S.Ct. 1253].) \u201cWere federal officers free to search without a warrant merely upon probable cause to believe that certain articles were within a home, the provisions of the Fourth Amendment would become empty phrases, and the protection it affords largely nullified.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 498.) As our nation\u2019s high court also explained over 50 years ago: \u201cThe point of the Fourth Amendment... is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime. Any assumption that evidence sufficient to support a magistrate\u2019s disinterested determination to issue a search warrant will justify the officers in making a search without a warrant would reduce the Amendment to a nullity and leave the people\u2019s homes secure only in the discretion of police officers. Crime, even in the privacy of one\u2019s own quarters, is, of course, of grave concern to society, and the law allows such crime to be reached on proper showing. The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home is also a grave concern, not only to the individual but to a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security and freedom from surveillance. When the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or government enforcement agent.\u201d <em>(Johnson v. United States </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 10, 13-14 [92 L.Ed. 436, 68 S.Ct. 367], fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The reason for this presumption that warrantless searches are unreasonable (and hence illegal) is plain: \u201cAn intrusion by the state into the privacy of the home for any purpose is one of the most awesome incursions of police power into the life of the individual. ... It is essential that the dispassionate judgment of a magistrate, an official dissociated from the \u2018competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime\u2019 [citation], be interposed between the state and the citizen at this critical juncture.\u201d <em>(People v. Ramey </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 263, 275 [127 Cal.Rptr. 629, 545 P.2d 1333].)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">And the warrant requirement cannot be forfeited for the sake of the efficiency of law enforcement. \u201c[T]he inconvenience to the officers and some slight delay necessary to prepare papers and present the evidence to a magistrate ... are never very convincing reasons ... to by-pass the constitutional requirement\u201d of a warrant. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>333 U.S. at p. 15; see also <em>Mincey v. Arizona </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 385, 393 [57 L.Ed.2d 290, 98 S.Ct. 2408] [person\u2019s privacy rights in \u201chome and property may not be totally sacrificed in the name of maximum simplicity in enforcement of the criminal law\u201d]; <em>Coolidge, supra, </em>403 U.S. at p. 481 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>[warrant requirement is valued part of constitutional law and \u201cnot an inconvenience to be somehow \u2018weighed\u2019 against the claims of police efficiency\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Thus, \u201cthe Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.\u201d <em>(Payton v. New York, supra, </em>445 U.S. at p. 590; see also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>333 U.S. at pp. 14-15 [warrant required save in cases involving \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramey, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 270 [warrantless searches \u201cunreasonable per se in the absence of one of a small number of carefully circumscribed exceptions\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">IV. <em>Third Party Consent to Search and Seizure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The People contend that the police officers had valid third party consent to enter defendant\u2019s dormitory room because University employee Payne had actual authority to consent to the police officers\u2019 entry into the room. In the alternative, the search and seizure of the contraband were reasonable because the police officers reasonably believed that Payne had authority to consent to their entry. Although we will conclude that the motion to suppress should have been denied on another ground\u2014i.e., the contraband would have been inevitably discovered and thus the exclusionary rule should not apply\u2014we address this third-party-consent issue because we deem it to be one of considerable constitutional significance. Before doing so, however, we will first identify the relevant legal authority concerning (1) the third-party-consent exception to the general proscription against warrantless searches and seizures, and (2) the validity of warrantless searches of college and university dormitory rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">A. <em>Nature of Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">A recognized exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription against warrantless searches is a search that is based upon consent. <em>(Schneckloth v.

That consent may be given by the party later challenging the search\u2019s constitutional validity. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Alternatively, \u201ca third party who possesses common authority over the premises\u201d may consent to the search. <em>(Illinois v.

As the United States Supreme Court has explained: \u201cThe [common] authority which justifies the third-party consent does not rest upon the law of property, with its attendant historical and legal refinements [citations] but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.\u201d <em>(United States v. Matlock </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 164, 171, fn. 7 [39 L.Ed.2d 242, 94 S.Ct. 988] <em>(Matlock).) </em>Third party consent is valid where it is given by one \u201cwho possesses] common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 171, fn. omitted; see also <em>People v.

In <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 186, the Supreme Court held that where the police conduct a warrantless search based upon the consent of a third party whom they reasonably believe at the time to have the authority to give it, no Fourth Amendment violation occurs. The high court reasoned: \u201cIt is apparent that in order to satisfy the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 requirement of the Fourth Amendment, what is generally demanded of the many factual determinations that must regularly be made by agents of the government\u2014whether the magistrate issuing a warrant, the police officer executing a warrant, or the police officer conducting a search or seizure under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement\u2014is not that they always be correct, but that they always be reasonable.\u201d <em>{Rodriguez, </em>at p. 185; see also <em>People v. Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 972-980 [officers had reasonable basis for believing that the defendant\u2019s sister, who had possession of his unlocked briefcase, could consent to search of its contents].) The prosecution bears the burden of proof in showing the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s belief in the apparent authority of the third party giving consent. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>at p. 972.)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>Thus, the owners of property may consent to a police search thereof as long as no other persons are legitimately occupying that property. <em>(People v.

For example, the co-occupant may be the defendant\u2019s spouse <em>(Coolidge, supra, </em>403 U.S. at pp. 488-489), the defendant\u2019s lover posing as his wife <em>(Matlock, supra, </em>at p. 176), or the defendant\u2019s mistress <em>(People v.

The same principle applies to prevent a finding of third party consent where the leased property is an apartment unit <em>(People v.

(See generally Annot., Search Conducted by School Official or Teacher as Violation of Fourth Amendment or Equivalent State Constitutional Provision (1995) 31 A.L.R.Sth 229, 296-300, \u00a7 8 and cases cited.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Only one case was decided in California. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 669 [16 Cal.Rptr. 177] <em>(Kelly).) </em>Many of the cases have involved the legality of searches by college officials only, and have not addressed whether police searches abridged the Fourth Amendment rights of dormitory room occupants. We first discuss Kelly\u2014a case relied on by the People in the writ petition<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\u2014and then discuss several out-of-state cases concerning dormitory room searches.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">1. People v. Kelly</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">In <em>Kelly, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.2d 669, the defendant (a college student attending California Institute of Technology) contended that his conviction of two counts of burglary was based upon evidence illegally seized from his dormitory room. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 671.) After the police obtained information concerning several burglaries that led them to suspect the defendant, they contacted the college dean, who in turn contacted the house master, who had general responsibility over all resident students at the college. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 672-673.) The house master advised the police that he had \u201cfree inspection rights to all rooms\u201d and was specifically authorized under the housing rules to use his master key to enter any of the rooms in case of emergency. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 673.) The police then accompanied the house master to the defendant\u2019s room. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As they approached the room, the door was open at an angle of approximately 35 degrees. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The house master opened the door further as he went into the room; an officer then entered the room, found no one present, and searched for the defendant under the bed and in the closet. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 673-674.) The police officer located one stolen article in the closet and observed a toolbox in the room. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 673-674.) He found a gun in the toolbox and removed it and two other articles believed to have been stolen. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 674.)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The appellate court characterized the defendant\u2019s right to occupy the dorm room as being \u201cquite different from the usual relationship of landlord and tenant\u201d <em>(Kelly, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.2d at p. 678), apparently placing considerable reliance upon the housing rules: \u201c[The defendant\u2019s] occupancy of the room was conditional upon his accepting the responsibility of practicing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>school\u2019s traditional principle of personal honor and upon his agreeing to abide by the house rules.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 677.) It found further that the defendant, through the rules, had implicitly agreed that the house master might enter the room for the purpose of \u201cupholding the high disciplinary standards and integrity of the school.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 678.) The <em>Kelly </em>court upheld the denial of the motion to suppress, based upon (1) the police having reasonable cause to believe that the defendant had participated in a series of burglaries; (2) the general authority that the house master possessed over the occupancy and use of the dorm rooms; (3) the house master telling the police that he had the authority to enter rooms and that the housing rules specifically permitted such entry in an emergency; and (4) the police officer\u2019s assertion that a felony investigation constituted an emergency. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 676-677.) It concluded: \u201cThe evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the officers believed in good faith that the master had authority to permit them to enter the room.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 677.)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">2. <em>Out-of-state college dormitory search cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">As one authority has observed: \u201c[I]n the case of the [college dormitory] room, ... the educational institution\u2019s position is more akin to that of any other landlord. This being the case, courts are understandably reluctant to put the student who has the college as a landlord in a significantly different position than \u2018a student who lives off campus in a boarding house.\u2019 The latter student is quite obviously protected by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Chapman[, supra, </em>365 U.S. 610,] that a landlord may not consent to a police search of his tenant\u2019s quarters merely because he has some right of entry of his own in connection with his position as landlord. . . . [T]he same may be said of the college landlord.\u201d (4 LaFave, Search and Seizure (4th ed. 2004) \u00a7 8.6(e), pp. 260-261, fns. omitted.) Consistent with this viewpoint, there are cases at odds with <em>Kelly, </em>in which courts in other jurisdictions have held unreasonable the warrantless police searches of college dormitory rooms, even where school officials themselves had the lawful right of entry and gave the police consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">For instance, an Ohio appellate court held recently that \u201c[a] college student\u2019s dormitory room is entitled to the same protection against unreasonable search and seizure that is afforded to a private home for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>(State v. Ellis </em>(Ohio Ct.App., Mar. 31, 2006, No. 05CA78) 2006 WL 827376 <em>(Ellis), </em>f 13.) In <em>Ellis, </em>Central State University resident assistants discovered marijuana in the defendant\u2019s dorm room while they were conducting an authorized, unannounced safety inspection. <em>(Id. </em>at H 8, 9.) Campus police officers were then notified and went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>the room. <em>(Id. </em>at 1 10.) While the campus police did not participate in the search, they were present in the room at the resident assistants\u2019 invitation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Ellis </em>court concluded that the seizure of the marijuana was unconstitutional. <em>(Id. </em>at f 20.) It found that while the resident assistants\u2019 search was authorized under the university\u2019s policies and procedures <em>(id. </em>at | 15), the later police entry into the room was unlawful because it was made without a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances. <em>(Id. </em>at Q 18, 19.) The court explained: \u201cThe problem arises in this case because, after the resident advisors initially discovered marijuana in [the] Defendant\u2019s room and notified campus police, the campus police then came to the scene and <em>entered </em>[the] Defendant\u2019s room. ...[][] By entering [the] Defendant\u2019s dormitory room, campus police infringed upon the reasonable expectation of privacy that [the] Defendant had in that place which ... is entitled to the same level of protection against unreasonable search and seizure as a private home. [Citation.] In order to lawfully enter [the] Defendant\u2019s room, police needed either a warrant, which they did not have, or an established exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at ffl 17, 18.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Similarly, in <em>Piazzola v. Watkins </em>(5th Cir. 1971) 442 F.2d 284, the court invalidated a warrantless search of several Troy State University dormitory rooms conducted by the police in conjunction with school officials. There, a regulation provided that \u201c \u2018[t]he college reserves the right to enter rooms for inspection purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 286.) In holding that the search was unreasonable, the Fifth Circuit stated: \u201c[A] student who occupies a college dormitory room enjoys the protection of the Fourth Amendment. True the University retains broad supervisory powers which permit it to adopt the regulation heretofore quoted, provided that regulation is reasonably construed and is limited in its application to further the University\u2019s function as an educational institution. The regulation cannot be construed or applied so as to give consent to a search for evidence for the primary purpose of a criminal prosecution. Otherwise, the regulation itself would constitute an unconstitutional attempt to require a student to waive his protection from unreasonable searches and seizures as a condition to his occupancy of a college dormitory room. [Citation.] Clearly the University had no authority to consent to or join in a police search for evidence of crime.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 289-290, fns. omitted.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>Likewise, in <em>Commonwealth v. Neilson </em>(1996) 423 Mass. 75 [666 N.E.2d 984], the court held unreasonable the police search of the defendant\u2019s dormitory room at Fitchburg State College, which was conducted without a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances after college officials had discovered marijuana plants in the room. In so doing, the court rejected the commonwealth\u2019s contention that, because the defendant had signed a resident contract authorizing college officials to conduct reasonable searches to enforce college health and safety regulations, the police had received the consent of the defendant (through the college) to enter the dorm room. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 987.)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Finally, in <em>People v. Cohen </em>(1968) 57 Misc.2d 366 [292 N.Y.S.2d 706, 709], the court rejected the argument that the defendant (a Hofstra University student) gave his implied consent to a police search of his dormitory room under the theory that \u201ca student impliedly consents to entry into his room by University officials at any time, except at late hours.\u201d After noting that the search conducted by police and university officials was \u201ca fishing expedition calculated to discover narcotics\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>the court concluded that \u201ceven if the doctrine of implied consent were imported into this case, the consent is given, not to police officials, but to the University and the latter cannot fragmentize, share or delegate it.\u201d (Ibid.; see also Smith &amp; Strope, <em>The Fourth Amendment: Dormitory Room Searches in Public Universities </em>(1995) 97 Ed. Law Rep. 985, 987 [where student signs waiver giving university officials permission to search dorm room for health, safety or maintenance reasons, \u201cofficials cannot delegate their authority to other individuals to conduct a search for other reasons\u201d].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>C. <em>Analysis of Third Party Consent Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">As we have noted, valid third party consent to a warrantless search occurs where the party giving that consent \u201cpossesses common authority over the premises.\u201d (Rodriguez, <em>supra, </em>497 U.S. 177, 181; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyer, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 445.) That common authority is founded \u201con mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes.\u201d <em>(Matlock, supra, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, fn. 7.) And the burden rests with the People to establish the existence of common authority supporting the contention that the search was based on third party consent. <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>at p. 181.) Also, where the facts available to the officer at the time of the search would lead a reasonable person to believe \u201cthat the consenting party had authority over the premises\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 188), the search is valid even if it ultimately turns out that no actual authority to consent existed. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 188-189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">We therefore examine whether the police officers\u2019 warrantless entry into defendant\u2019s dorm room and their seizure of the contraband were justified by third party consent, based upon either actual or apparent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">1. <em>Actual authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">We evaluate whether the University possessed common authority over defendant\u2019s dormitory room sufficient for it to give valid third party consent. <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 181.) We start by reiterating the Supreme Court\u2019s caution that common authority is not determined merely by virtue of the third party\u2019s interest in the property. <em>(Matlock, supra, </em>415 U.S. at p. 171, fn. 7.) Here, the University\u2019s property interest notwithstanding, its relationship to the dormitories (specifically, to defendant\u2019s dorm room) is atypical of instances in which courts have found third party consent based upon common authority. This is not a case in which the third party allegedly giving consent\u2014the University employee\u2014had common authority over the dorm room. It differs greatly from the case of consent given by a spouse of a home\u2019s occupant <em>(Coolidge, supra, </em>403 U.S. at pp. 488-489), or by the host-homeowner who offered lodging to a guest <em>(People </em>v. <em>Welch, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 747-748). Rather, the relationship between the University, defendant, and defendant\u2019s dormitory room is more closely akin to relationships in which the Supreme Court has rejected third party consent arguments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>such as landlord-tenant <em>(Chapman, supra, </em>365 U.S. 610) or hotel-occupant relationships <em>(Stoner, supra, 316 </em>U.S. 483). (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 517, 521 [271 Cal.Rptr. 769] [college dormitory \u201canalogous to a hotel or apartment complex,\u201d and \u201ceach student lives and enjoys separate privacy in each of their individual dormitory rooms\u201d].) In this respect, borrowing the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Stoner, supra, </em>at page 489, \u201c[i]t is important to bear in mind that it was [defendant-student\u2019s] constitutional right which was at stake here, and not the [security officer\u2019s] nor the [University\u2019s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Within the plain language of <em>Matlock, </em>the University had neither \u201cmutual use\u201d of defendant\u2019s dorm room, nor \u201cjoint access or control for most purposes\u201d over it. <em>(Matlock, supra, </em>415 U.S. at p. 171, fn. 7.) Likewise, it could hardly be said that defendant \u201cassumed the risk that [the University] might permit\u201d inspection of his dorm room by others, such as the police. (Ibid.; see also <em>Commonwealth v. Neilson, supra, 666 </em>N.E.2d at p. 987.) On the surface, therefore, the University did not have common authority over the dorm room.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">We perceive of no legitimate reason to distinguish between privacy expectations reasonably enjoyed by college students in occupying dormitory rooms with those experienced by tenants occupying houses or apartments. Nor do we believe that college students should have less protection from unreasonable searches and seizures in their dorm rooms than occupants have in their hotel rooms.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The \u201cphysical entry of the home is the chief evil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>United States District Court </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 297, 313 [32 L.Ed.2d 752, 92 S.Ct. 2125]; see also <em>People v. Sanders </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 318, 324 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 630, 73 P.3d 496].) We agree with (among others) the federal District Court of New Hampshire and the Western District of Michigan, respectively, that \u201c[a] dormitory room is a student\u2019s home away from home\u201d <em>(Morale v. Grigel, supra, </em>422 F.Supp. at p. 997), and defendant\u2019s \u201cdormitory room is his house and home for all practical purposes, and he has the same interest in the privacy of his room as any adult has in the privacy of his home, dwelling, or lodging\u201d <em>(Smyth v. Lubbers, supra, </em>398 F.Supp. at p. 786). (Contra, <em>Moore, supra, </em>284 F.Supp. at pp. 729-731 [students living in on-campus dorms have \u201cspecial relationship with the college,\u201d college may adopt regulations \u201cto protect campus order and discipline,\u201d and resident student \u201cwaives objection to any reasonable searches conducted pursuant to reasonable and necessary [college] regulations\u201d]; <em>Kelly, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.2d at p. 677 [student\u2019s dorm room occupancy \u201cconditional upon his accepting the responsibility of practicing the school\u2019s traditional principle of personal honor and upon his agreeing to abide by the house rules\u201d]; <em>State v. Kappes, supra, </em>550 P.2d at p. 124 [privacy rights under Fourth Amendment \u201cdo[] not include freedom from reasonable inspection\u201d of dorm room by college officials].) As such, the dormitory\u2014in the case of a student-occupant who is an adult (as is the case with defendant here)\u2014may serve as a residence for voter registration purposes. (See <em>Walters v. Weed </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1 [246 Cal.Rptr. 5, 752 P.2d 443].) Therefore, we conclude that defendant enjoyed the same Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable searches and seizures in his dormitory room as would any other citizen in a private home. (See, e.g., <em>Morale v. Grigel, supra, </em>at p. 997; <em>Smyth v. Lubbers, supra, </em>at p. 786; <em>Devers v. Southern University, supra, </em>712 So.2d at pp. 204-205; <em>Ellis, supra, </em>2006 WL 827376 at ][ 13].)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Our conclusion is not altered by the fact that defendant signed a Housing Contract that authorized the University (1) to conduct routine room inspections on reasonable notice to the resident student, and (2) to enter rooms without notice \u201cwhere there is a reasonable suspicion that a violation of the law or University policies is occurring or has occurred inside a particular room.\u201d These terms of occupancy, while constituting consent to the <em>University\u2019s </em>entry into defendant\u2019s dorm room under certain circumstances, cannot be reasonably construed as defendant having given such consent to <em>others. </em>(See <em>Piazzola v. Watkins, supra, </em>442 F.2d at pp. 289-290; <em>Commonwealth v. Neilson, supra, 666 </em>N.E.2d at p. 987.) In particular, these contract terms do not constitute defendant\u2019s agreement to nonconsensual warrantless searches and seizures of his private residence by the police. (Contra, <em>Moore, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>284 F.Supp. at pp. 730-731.) Nor could the Housing Contract be so construed, since such purported advance consent to warrantless police searches would be an illegal waiver of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment. (See <em>Piazzola </em>v. <em>Watkins, supra, </em>at p. 289 [regulation authorizing college to inspect dorm rooms could not be interpreted as student\u2019s \u201cconsent to a search for evidence for the primary purpose of a criminal prosecution\u201d (fn. omitted)]; <em>Devers v. Southern University, supra, </em>712 So.2d at pp. 204-207 [lease provision reserving college\u2019s right to inspect dorm room with police unconstitutionally abridged student\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights]; cf. \u00a7 626.11, subd.

But if the police officers\u2019 entry into defendant\u2019s dorm room was based upon their reasonable (but mistaken) belief that University employee Payne had the authority to consent to that entry, the police search and seizure would be deemed to have been reasonable. <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>497 U.S. 177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">As the Supreme Court has explained, the question of apparent authority is determined objectively by asking whether \u201c \u2018the facts available to the officer at the moment . . . \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 \u2019 that the consenting party had authority over the premises. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 188, quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>392 U.S. 1, 21-22 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 88 S.Ct. 1868].) If the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d the warrantless search is valid. (Rodriguez, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 188-189.) And as the Supreme Court has made plain, \u201cin order to satisfy the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 requirement of the Fourth Amendment, what is generally demanded of the many factual determinations that must regularly be made by agents of the government\u2014. . . the police officer conducting a search or seizure under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement\u2014is not that they always be correct, but that they always be reasonable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The People, citing <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>497 U.S. 177, and <em>Kelly, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.2d 669, argue that the police had a reasonable basis for believing that Payne could consent to their entry. Defendant, citing <em>Chapman, supra, </em>365 U.S. 610, and <em>People v. Escudero, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 800, 807, responds that a landlord may not consent to a police search of a tenant\u2019s property\u2014and thus argues (inferentially) that apparent authority is inapplicable in this instance because the University was essentially acting as defendant\u2019s landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The police officers asked whether Payne had received consent to search the room. Payne responded in part that he had defendant\u2019s consent. By itself, this was insufficient to support a finding of reasonableness. This inquiry and Payne\u2019s response concerned only whether <em>the University officials </em>had the right to be in defendant\u2019s dorm room; it did not address whether the University could consent on defendant\u2019s behalf to a police search or seizure of the room. In the ordinary case, the police may not reasonably rely on a landlord\u2019s claimed authority over a rented room as being a sufficient basis for consent to a search. (See <em>Chapman, supra, </em>365 U.S. at pp. 616-618; <em>People </em>v. <em>Escudero, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 807 [ranch owner could not give consent to search of foreman\u2019s house under principle that landlord may not ordinarily consent to police entry of premises occupied by tenant].) Likewise, here, the relationship between the University and the student-resident, defendant, was akin to a landlord-tenant relationship, and the mere fact that Payne stated that he had defendant\u2019s consent to search the room did not give rise to a reasonable conclusion that that University official could agree to a police search of the room on defendant\u2019s behalf. (See <em>Piazzola v. Watkins, supra, </em>442 F.2d at pp. 289-290.)</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Payne\u2019s additional response to the police that defendant\u2019s consent was unnecessary \u201cbecause of the waiver the defendant had signed in\u201d the Housing Contract was also insufficient to support the reasonableness of the search. This was not a direct statement that Payne could consent to the officers\u2019 entry or that defendant had expressly given him that right of consent. Absent clarification as to what Payne meant by the defendant\u2019s \u201cwaiver\u201d in the Housing Contract, the police could not have reasonably concluded that Payne had the authority to consent to a search of the dorm room.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>But <em>Kelly, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.2d 669, might support a contrary conclusion, i.e., that the officers\u2019 conduct was reasonable solely on the basis of Payne\u2019s two statements concerning defendant\u2019s consent and Housing Contract \u201cwaiver.\u201d In <em>Kelly, </em>the appellate court held that there was sufficient evidence\u2014including the house master\u2019s statement to the officers that he had free inspection rights to all dorm rooms and the housing rules permitted entry into the defendant\u2019s room in an emergency\u2014supporting the finding \u201cthat the officers believed in good faith that the [college] master had authority to permit them to enter the [dorm] room.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 677.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">We believe that <em>Kelly </em>has limited precedential value. <em>Kelly </em>was decided nearly 45 years ago, prior to the development of Fourth Amendment law that today controls suppression motions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> College life and societal norms as a whole have changed significantly since 1961. Also since <em>Kelly </em>was decided, the Legislature, by its enactment of section 626.11 in 1975, gave express recognition to the constitutional rights of college students, including the right of privacy and the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> That statute made inadmissible in any administrative proceeding any evidence seized by officials of any University of California, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>California state university, or public community college, in violation of another\u2019s constitutional rights (\u00a7 626.11, subd. (a)); declared that any provision in such an institution\u2019s housing agreement purporting to waive the student-occupant\u2019s protection from unreasonable searches and seizures was against public policy and void (\u00a7 626.11, subd. (b)); and made inadmissible in any administrative proceeding any evidence seized by officials of any such institution through a nonconsensual search of a dormitory room, where the evidence was \u201cnot directly related to the purpose for which the entry was initially made\u201d (\u00a7 626.11, subd. (c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Moreover, it is questionable whether Kelly\u2019s reasoning\u2014including its seemingly antiquated view that the college student had impliedly agreed that the house master could search the dorm room to uphold the disciplinary standards and integrity of the institution <em>(Kelly, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.2d at pp. 677-678)\u2014would pass constitutional muster today.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As the district court reasoned in <em>Morale v. Grigel, supra, </em>422 F.Supp. at page 997: \u201cWhile the school also has a \u2018legitimate interest in preventing disruption on the campus,\u2019 [citation], its interests are limited by its function as an educational institution. A college cannot, in this day and age, protect students under the aegis of <em>in loco parentis </em>authority from the rigors of society\u2019s rules and laws, just as it cannot, under the same aegis, deprive students of their constitutional rights.\u201d We therefore <em>conclude\u2014Kelly </em>and its reasoning notwithstanding\u2014that Payne\u2019s statements, by themselves, were insufficient to justify police entry into the dorm room under apparent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">But as the People point out, the case before us differs from <em>Kelly </em>in that here the University solicited the police investigation. Further\u2014and also unlike Kelly\u2014defendant was present when the police entered his room, and the search was conducted in his presence. Defendant was standing near the doorway when Payne told the police officers that he had defendant\u2019s consent but that it was unnecessary because of the \u201cwaiver\" in the Housing Contract. While defendant\u2019s silence in the face of Payne\u2019s statements did not constitute his implied consent to the police search (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Shelton </em>(1964) 60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>Cal.2d 740, 746 [36 Cal.Rptr. 433, 388 P.2d 665]),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> it is an additional factor to consider in evaluating the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 belief in Payne\u2019s apparent authority.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">In reviewing this issue, we note that courts in other jurisdictions have upheld warrantless searches (many involving vehicles) under the apparent authority doctrine, based in part upon the defendant\u2019s (1) knowledge of the third party\u2019s consent and (2) acquiescence in the subsequent police search. For instance, in <em>U.S. v. Elam </em>(8th Cir. 2006) 441 F.3d 601, 603 <em>(Elam), </em>the lessee of the home in which the defendant lived agreed\u2014in the defendant\u2019s presence\u2014that the police could search the home for evidence of methamphetamine production. During the course of the search, the police encountered a locked cabinet in a common closet; the tenant retrieved a key to the cabinet and gave it to the officer while the defendant stood mute. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court concluded that the officer\u2019s belief that the tenant had authority to consent to search the locked cabinet was reasonable. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 603-604.) In so doing, the court, citing <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Stapleton </em>(8th Cir. 1993) 10 F.3d 582,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>that the defendant was silent and gave no indication to the police that he had an interest in the cabinet or that he did not give his permission to the search. <em>(Elam, supra, </em>at p. 604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomlinson </em>(2002) 2002 WI 91 [648 N.W.2d 367, 254 Wis.2d 502] <em>(Tomlinson), </em>the defendant\u2019s teenaged daughter answered the door and admitted the officers into the home. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 376.) As she did so, the defendant stood behind her and did not object. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Concluding that the police had a reasonable basis to conclude that the daughter\u2019s consent to enter the house was valid, the court gave \u201cweight to the fact that [the defendant] was nearby when the door was opened [and] did not object to the police coming in.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 377.)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">In <em>Elam </em>and Tomlinson\u2014as well as in the vehicle-search cases we have noted (see fn. 26, ante)\u2014the common denominator relevant here is the defendant\u2019s silence in the face of the third party\u2019s consent to search the defendant\u2019s property and the resulting police search. There are, of course, factors that are distinguishable from the case before us. Unlike most of those cases, here the police could have had no doubt as to defendant\u2019s interest in the dorm room. Furthermore\u2014unlike the occupant of a home or the driver of a vehicle\u2014here, the police could not have properly considered the University\u2019s interest in the dorm room to have been coextensive with defendant\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">In our evaluation of the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 conduct, \u201cwe are mindful of the rule applicable to unprecedented factual situations involving the reasonableness of police conduct as restricted by the Fourth Amendment. \u2018There is no exact formula for the determination of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (York) </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 648, 659 [83 Cal.Rptr. 732].) Here, however, we need not decide the issue of whether the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>reasonably believed that Payne had authority to consent to their entry, because as we discuss below, the contraband would have been inevitably discovered.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">V. <em>Inevitable Discovery Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">The People argue as an additional reason that the suppression motion should have been denied: \u201cAlthough the police conduct in this case was not improper, it was inevitable that after completing its private search, the University would have turned the marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia over to the Santa Clara Police.\u201d Therefore (the People argue) the inevitable discovery doctrine should have been applied by the court below to prevent operation of the exclusionary rule. The court below found that the inevitable discovery doctrine did not apply because it was not supported by the evidence.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Assuming that the warrantless search was unreasonable, we find that the contraband would have been inevitably discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The inevitable discovery doctrine operates as an exception to the exclusionary rule: Seized evidence is admissible in instances in which it would have been discovered by the police through lawful means. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, the doctrine \u201cis in reality an extrapolation from the independent source doctrine: Since the tainted evidence would be admissible if in fact discovered through an independent source, it should be admissible if it inevitably would have been discovered.\u201d <em>(Murray </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1988) 487 U.S. 533, 539 [101 L.Ed.2d 472, 108 S.Ct. 2529], italics omitted; see also <em>Nix v. Williams </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 431, 442-443 [81 L.Ed.2d 377, 104 S.Ct. 2501].) \u201cThe purpose of the inevitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>discovery rule is to prevent the setting aside of convictions that would have been obtained without police misconduct.\u201d <em>(People v. Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 800.)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The phrase \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d is somewhat of a misnomer. (Cal. Judges Benchbook: Search and Seizure (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 2002) \u00a7 1.60, p. 39.) The doctrine does not require certainty. <em>(In re Rudy F. </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1136 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 483].) Rather, the People must show a \u201creasonable probability that [the challenged evidence] would have been procured in any event by lawful means.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boyer </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 247, 278 [256 Cal.Rptr. 96, 768 P.2d 610], disapproved on another ground in <em>People v. Stansbury </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 824, 830, fn. 1 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 394, 889 P.2d 588].)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Initially, we reject any assertion that the inevitable discovery doctrine applies here simply because the police had sufficient probable cause to obtain a warrant to enter the dorm room and to seize the evidence legally. (See <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Michigan </em>(2006) 547 U.S._[165 L.Ed.2d 56, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 2178] (dis. opn. of Breyer, J.) [government may not rely on inevitable discovery doctrine to \u201cavoid suppression of evidence seized without a warrant ... simply by showing that it could have obtained a valid warrant had it sought one\u201d].) Such an application of the doctrine\u2014i.e., that the illegally seized evidence should not be excluded because the police <em>theoretically </em>could have obtained a warrant\u2014has been rejected by our Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Robles, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 789. There, the primary issue was the validity of a warrantless search of a garage maintained by the defendant and his brother, where the brother had consented in advance to probation searches, but that consent was unknown to the police at the time of the search. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 792-793.) The court held that the unknown consent of the brother did not vitiate the unlawfulness of the search. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 800.) The People also argued that the evidence from the illegal search was admissible because it would have been inevitably discovered; they argued that a warrant <em>could have been obtained </em>because the police had a plain-view sighting (through a rip in the aluminum siding of the garage door) of the license plate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>of the stolen vehicle. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 801.) The court rejected that contention, concluding that, absent exigent circumstances, a warrant is required to enter a residence (or, in this instance, a garage), even if contraband is in plain view through a window and the officer observes it from a place that he or she has the right to be. (Ibid.; see also <em>U.S. v. Reilly </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 224 F.3d 986, 995 [inevitable discovery exception inapplicable \u201c \u2018to excuse the failure to obtain a search warrant where the police had probable cause but simply did not attempt to obtain a warrant\u2019 \u201d].)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">But rejection of that rationale does not end our inquiry. Here, the record supports a finding that the contraband would have been inevitably discovered. The University contacted the Santa Clara Police Department to report that \u201ca considerable amount of drugs had been found in a Residence Hall room.\u201d The police arrived at the dormitory, met Campus Safety Officer Brady, who then accompanied them to defendant\u2019s dorm room, announcing (as he opened the door), \u201cYou\u2019ve got to see this.\u201d After Brady opened the door, the large quantity of marijuana and cash were easily visible to the police. It defies logic (and common sense) to conclude that the University safety officers\u2014having contacted the police, gathered the contraband (apparently for inspection by the police), and displayed the contraband to the police\u2014thereafter would have withheld the contraband from the police to pursue their own internal investigation. The probability that the University would have involved the police further is heightened by the fact that the safety officers\u2019 investigation had disclosed a potentially significant marijuana sales enterprise on the University campus (evidenced by a \u201clarge quantity\u201d of marijuana, several boxes of packaging materials, an electronic scale, and $1,800 cash)\u2014a possible crime that is a far cry from possession of a small quantity of the drug for personal use. While it would not be unreasonable to conclude that the University might have handled a student\u2019s possession of a small quantity of marijuana privately, the converse is likewise true where (as here) the student was in possession of a significant quantity of the drug along with evidence of sales activity. In resolving this question, this \u201ccourt does not leave its common sense at the door. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 95, 102 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 820].) Under these circumstances, it is plain that the contraband \u201c \u2018would have been eventually secured through legal means regardless of the [allegedly] improper official conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Tunch) </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 665, 673 [145 Cal.Rptr. 795].)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>In reaching the conclusion here that the contraband would have been inevitably discovered, we are mindful of the policy of the doctrine as described by our highest court: \u201cFairness can be assured by placing the State and the accused in the same positions they would have been in had the impermissible conduct not taken place. However, if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably and, therefore, would have been admitted regardless of any overreaching by the police, there is no rational basis to keep that evidence from the jury in order to ensure the fairness of the trial proceedings. In that situation, the State has gained no advantage at trial and the defendant has suffered no prejudice. Indeed, suppression of the evidence would operate to undermine the adversary system by putting the State in a <em>worse </em>position than it would have occupied without any police misconduct.\u201d <em>(Nix v. Williams, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 447; see also <em>People v. Coffman and Marlow </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 1, 62 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 710, 96 P.3d 30].) Application of the exclusionary rule here\u2014and the concomitant refusal to apply the inevitable discovery doctrine\u2014would indeed place the People in a worse position than they would have occupied absent any alleged police misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The prosecution bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that evidence otherwise unlawfully obtained would have been inevitably discovered. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coffman and Marlow, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 62; <em>People v. Carpenter </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1016, 1040 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 988 P.2d 531].)

Accordingly, let the peremptory writ of mandate issue commanding the superior court to vacate its order and enter a new order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Bamattre-Manoukian, Acting P.

However, I write separately to express my disagreement with portions of the analysis in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The majority opinion contains an extremely thorough review of the principles of search and seizure, third party consent to search and seizure, college dormitory room searches, and actual authority and apparent authority to give consent to police entry. It convincingly recites how society and the courts have progressed from a view of college officials as substitute parents for a campus of mostly underage students to a contemporary view of the university as an educational community of adults. From this more modem perspective, the legal relationship of the school administration and the dormitory dweller can be seen as analogous to that of property owner and tenant or hotel manager and room occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">\n<em>Actual Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Applying these principles to this case, I agree with my colleagues that there was no actual authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">As the majority properly recognizes, the University did not have common authority over defendant\u2019s room, and the \u201crelationship between the University, defendant, and defendant\u2019s dormitory room is more closely akin to relationships in which the Supreme Court has rejected third party consent arguments, such as landlord-tenant <em>(Chapman v. [United States </em>(1961)] 365 U.S. 610 [5 L.Ed.2d 828, 81 S.Ct. 776]) or hotel-occupant relationships <em>(Stoner </em>v. <em>[California </em>(1964)] 376 U.S. 483 [11 L.Ed.2d 856, 84 S.Ct. 889]).\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1205.) Thus, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe university had no actual authority to give valid third party consent to a police search of defendant\u2019s dorm room.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1208.)</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">\n<em>Apparent Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">As to apparent authority, I am reluctant to write separately concerning a disagreement with my colleagues over what amounts to dicta, but I cannot agree with the majority analysis in two respects. First, the majority opinion leaves the issue of apparent authority unresolved after ably analyzing the issue\u2014up to a point; I would resolve the issue, finding that it was not reasonable for the police to believe the campus safety officer had the apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>authority to consent to police entry. Second, the majority finds defendant\u2019s silent presence during the entry to be a factor to be considered under the circumstances of this case; I would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">\n<em>Apparent authority cannot rest upon University security officer Payne\u2019s statements to the police</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">I agree with the introductory statement that the police search and seizure would be valid if the police entry into the room was based upon their reasonable belief that University safety officer Payne had the authority to consent to their entry. Such reasonable belief could only arise from Payne\u2019s statements to the police prior to entry: that defendant had given him consent and that consent was unnecessary under the terms of defendant\u2019s housing contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">I agree with the majority that neither of the statements made by University security officer Payne to the police could support a reasonable belief by the officers that Payne had the authority to give consent on defendant\u2019s behalf. Neither statement warrants a belief in Payne\u2019s authority to consent. As to case law supporting apparent authority based on a college housing contract, I join the majority\u2019s criticism of the reasoning in <em>People v. Kelly </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 669 [16 Cal.Rptr. 177] and I agree it should not be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">I would conclude the analysis at this point, finding no apparent authority, and proceed to the discussion of inevitable discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s silent presence cannot be a factor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Rather than concluding this portion of the opinion after determining that \u201cPayne\u2019s statements, by themselves, were insufficient to justify police entry into the dorm room under apparent authority,\u201d the majority opinion continues the analysis by injecting defendant\u2019s silent presence into the discussion. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1211.) My colleagues find defendant\u2019s silence during Payne\u2019s statements and the police entry as an additional factor to consider under the circumstances of this case. I strongly disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">The majority opinion focuses on defendant\u2019s presence near the doorway when the police entered and searched his room and when security officer Payne \u201ctold the police officers that he had defendant\u2019s consent but that it was unnecessary because of the \u2018waiver\u2019 in the Housing Contract.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1211.) The majority, without any elaboration, then concludes that this silent presence \u201cis an additional factor to consider in evaluating the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 belief in Payne\u2019s apparent authority.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1212.)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>What possible relevance could defendant\u2019s silence have in this case? The implication of the majority\u2019s statement and the cases cited from other jurisdictions in support of that finding is that defendant\u2019s silence somehow amounts to <em>acquiescence. </em>There are at least two problems with such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">In the first place, there is nothing in the record to support a finding of acquiescence. By remaining silent, defendant could have been simply yielding to the authority of the police in tandem with the University officers. His silence could be attributed to fear of the academic repercussions of his conduct or to impairment of his cognitive skills for other reasons. It would be pure speculation to find agreement from his silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Moreover, even if defendant\u2019s lack of response could be considered as acquiescence, exactly what was he accepting? The silence that the majority finds noteworthy occurs after the security officers had entered defendant\u2019s room and after the statement by Payne that defendant had given consent\u2014by word and by contract\u2014to <em>university officials. </em>Under these circumstances, how was it reasonable for the police officers to believe that Payne had apparent authority to consent to the <em>police </em>entry? As the majority recognizes, under long-standing and well-established law, police officers cannot justify entry based on purported third party consent given by property owners and hotel managers or their agents. And as the majority also acknowledges, Payne\u2019s statements to the police cannot be the basis for apparent authority. Given this, I am baffled by the unwarranted conclusion that defendant\u2019s silence in the face of Payne\u2019s statements somehow could cloak the security officer with apparent authority to consent to the police entry. I fail to see how defendant\u2019s <em>silence </em>in this situation could add anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">In its discussion, the majority cites two residential search cases from other jurisdictions: <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Elam </em>(8th Cir. 2006) 441 F.3d 601 <em>(Elam), </em>and <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomlinson </em>(2002) 2002 WI 91 [648 N.W.2d 367] <em>(Tomlinson). </em>Neither case aids the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">In <em>Elam, </em>the woman who answered the door said she rented the home. She invited the officers in out of the snow, agreed to a search of the premises, signed a written consent form, and retrieved the key for a locked filing cabinet, which was located 10 feet from where defendant sat in silence. The court found that it was reasonable for the officers to believe the woman had authority to consent to the search, and it rejected the defendant\u2019s later claim of a superior privacy interest in the cabinet since he failed to either disclose that interest or object to the search. <em>(Elam, supra, </em>441 F.3d at pp. 603-604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>In <em>Tomlinson, </em>the door was answered by a person the officers had good reason to believe was the defendant\u2019s daughter. She let them in while the defendant was standing nearby. The court found that the defendant\u2019s silence could have led the officers to believe that he \u201centrusted the girl with at least some authority to give consent to enter.\u201d (Tomlinson, <em>supra, </em>648 N.W.2d at p. 377.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">This case before us is factually distinguishable from both <em>Elam </em>and <em>Tomlinson. </em>Unlike those cases, the person who ostensibly consented here\u2014 security officer Payne\u2014is not someone legally capable of giving consent, nor could the police reasonably believe that he was. Payne was neither a renter nor a household member with common authority over the premises. Here, the police officers knew that the room belonged to defendant and they knew that the security officers were not co-occupants or household members.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">The case before us is more analogous to a scenario where the police are invited inside a leased dwelling by someone known to be the property owner, who tells the officers that the tenant consented to the owner\u2019s entry and that a lease provision allows the owner to enter. <em>(Chapman v. United States, supra, </em>365 U.S. 610.) Our case likewise is closer factually to the situation where a hotel clerk purports to give police consent to search an occupant\u2019s hotel room. <em>(Stoner v. California, supra, </em>376 U.S. 483.) A long line of cases cited in the majority opinion, beginning with <em>Chapman </em>and <em>Stoner, </em>prohibits police entry under such circumstances without a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances. But the language in the majority opinion in effect implies that there is a \u201csilent presence\u201d exception to that body of law. Such an exception would justify police entry where it would otherwise be prohibited, based on the mere chance that the tenant or occupant happened to be standing silently nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Significantly, elsewhere in its opinion, the majority emphatically states that \u201cdefendant\u2019s silence in the face of Payne\u2019s statements did not constitute his implied consent to the police search.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1211.) And it ardently insists that \u201cdefendant\u2019s silence, absent an affirmative statement or conduct, cannot be construed here as his giving the police implied consent to enter his dorm room.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1212, fn. 24.) I submit that the majority\u2019s analysis does exactly that. The majority implies acquiescence from mere silent presence and considers it as a factor supporting apparent authority. Contrary to the disclaimers, the majority\u2019s view, by allowing such consideration under the circumstances of this case, would have the effect of construing defendant\u2019s silence to be implied consent to the police entry and search.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>\n<em>Inevitable Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Regarding inevitable discovery, I concur in the result, but I do not join in that portion of the opinion discussing <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 431 [81 L.Ed.2d <em>111, </em>104 S.Ct. 2501].

Harrington </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 991, 995 [88 Cal.Rptr. 161, 471 P.2d 961] [implied consent found where the defendant stepped aside and gestured to officer indicating permission for officer to enter room].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b924-6\"> Our colleague states in his concurring opinion that we have concluded here that \u201cdefendant\u2019s silence in the face of Payne\u2019s statements somehow . . . cloakfed] the security officer with apparent authority to consent to the police entry\u201d (cone, opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1220), and that we have \u201cimplie[d] that there is a \u2018silent presence\u2019 exception to [the] body of law\u201d that holds that neither a landlord <em>(Chapman, supra, </em>365 U.S. 610) nor hotel manager <em>(Stoner, supra, </em>376 U.S. 483) may give valid third party consent to a police search of a tenant\u2019s dwelling or hotel occupant\u2019s room, respectively. (Cone, opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1221.) We disagree with those characterizations. As we discuss, defendant\u2019s silence after Payne told the police that that he had the student\u2019s consent and that he did not need that consent in any event because of defendant\u2019s \u201cwaiver\u201d contained in the Housing Contract is simply one factor that could be considered here in resolving whether the police entry was justified under apparent authority. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ingle </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 407, 412 [2 Cal.Rptr. 14, 348 P.2d 577] [reasonableness of police conduct determined by facts and circumstances of individual case].) In so concluding under the unique facts of this case, we do not hold that defendant\u2019s silence of itself \u201ccloak[ed] the security officer with apparent authority,\u201d nor do we undercut the <em>Chapman!Stoner </em>line of cases by creating an unprecedented exception to the apparent authority doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b924-7\"> <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Stapleton, supra, </em>10 F.3d 582, concerned a police search of a vehicle with the driver\u2019s consent, which resulted in the seizure of cocaine found in a cell phone located on the floorboard of the passenger\u2019s seat. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 583.) The court upheld the validity of the search on the basis that \u201cit was objectively reasonable for the patrolmen to conclude either that they had all the consent that was constitutionally required (from [the driver]), or that they had [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>defendant\u2019s] implied consent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 584.) In so holding, the court emphasized that, after the driver consented to the search, the defendant (in whose name the cell phone was registered) \u201cremained silent when told of the search and the object of the search, and he did not indicate that the telephone was his property and that the patrolmen did not have his permission to search it.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) A </em>number of other courts have similarly upheld the validity of a vehicle search under the apparent authority doctrine, where the driver consented and the defendant/owner of the personal property inside the vehicle was aware of that consent and said nothing.

In assuming (without deciding) that the police lacked probable cause to draw the sample, the court nonetheless held that it was admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 993.) Because the defendant made statements to the police approximately 30 minutes after the sample was drawn that would have inevitably prompted the police to draw his blood, the court held that the blood sample was admissible. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b928-5\"> As Professor LaFave has stated: \u201c[I]t makes no sense whatsoever to take the substantially broader step [in applying the inevitable discovery doctrine] of suggesting that a violation of the Fourth Amendment may be disregarded simply because the police, had they thought about the situation more carefully, <em>could </em>have come up with a lawful means of achieving their desired results.\u201d (6 LaFave, Search and Seizure, supra, \u00a7 11.4(f), p. 344.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b929-9\"> We have concluded that, assuming that the search was unreasonable, the exclusionary rule should not be applied to bar admission of the contraband because it would have been inevitably discovered.
