J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">Defendant and appellant Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. (SHAC USA), was formed to support an international campaign to \u201cexpose the abusive treatment of animals\u201d by Huntingdon Life Sciences, a biomedical testing laboratory. Respondent Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. (formerly known as Chiron Corporation and referred to herein as Chiron), uses Huntingdon Life Sciences in testing some of its products. After numerous Chiron employees were targeted for \u201chome visits\u201d by SHAC USA\u2014terrifying incidents in which persons broke employees\u2019 windows, vandalized their cars, set off ear-piercing alarms in their yards, and left excrement on their doorsteps, as well as other tactics, including the publication of employees\u2019 personal information on the Internet and that of employees\u2019 spouses and children\u2014Chiron filed suit against SHAC USA seeking injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">SHAC USA brought a motion to strike under the California anti-SLAPP (anti-strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which it argued that the activities that formed the basis of Chiron\u2019s suit are protected under the anti-SLAPP statute. The trial court denied this motion to strike and SHAC USA now appeals from this order. SHAC USA argues that the trial court erred because (1) the complaint arises from speech about matters of public interest and (2) Chiron failed to meet its burden of showing a probability that it would prevail on its claims. In addition, defendant argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction after defendant appealed from the order denying its motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">We find these contentions to be without merit and hence affirm the orders appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">H. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">A. <em>Chiron and SHAC USA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">Chiron is a biopharmaceutical company. Its headquarters are in Emeryville, California. Chiron develops vaccines and blood testing products for diseases like AIDS, cancer and hepatitis. As part of its research, Chiron is required by law to perform testing on animals. Huntingdon Life Sciences, a company based in the United Kingdom, has, in the past, performed animal testing and research for Chiron.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty is, as its name implies, an organization that has targeted Huntingdon Life Sciences because of its use of animals in its research. Founded in Great Britain, SHAC recently incorporated a branch in the United States. We refer to this offshoot of SHAC Great Britain as SHAC USA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">B. <em>The Campaign Against Chiron and Its Employees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">Sometime in, apparently, 2003, SHAC USA announced that Chiron had become a \u201ctarget\u201d of its campaign against Huntingdon. On its Web site, SHAC USA listed the names, home phone numbers, home addresses, and bank account information of Chiron employees. SHAC also listed the names of Chiron employees\u2019 spouses and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">The centerpiece of SHAC\u2019s campaign against Chiron is what SHAC describes on its Web site as a \u201chome visit,\u201d a euphemism for a terrifying and often destructive nighttime invasion. Three Chiron employees in its Emeryville headquarters were singled out as recipients of these visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">The first such \u201cvisit\u201d occurred in May 2003, at the house of Sean Lance, Chiron\u2019s chairman of the board. Prior to the incident, SHAC USA posted Lance\u2019s home address and telephone number on its Web site. A few days later, a group of \u201cunknown individuals\u201d entered Lance\u2019s property in San Francisco while Lance and his family were asleep inside their house. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>individuals set off a shrieking personal alarm and poured a chemical substance on Lance\u2019s front porch, which left a powerful stench. After this incident, SHAC USA posted a message on its Web site. The message stated that the attack on Lance\u2019s house was \u201ca warning of things to come if [Chiron] do[es] not sever all ties to Huntingdon Life Sciences immediately.\u201d Over the next few months, Lance received other late night \u201cvisits,\u201d all of which followed the same pattern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Lance also received phone calls at work and at home, including many phone calls during the middle of the night. In these phone calls, callers shouted slogans attacking Huntingdon Life Sciences and Chiron. They also demanded that Chiron sever its ties to Huntingdon Life Sciences. An unidentified person posted Lance\u2019s home phone number on an Internet classified board falsely advertising sexual services. SHAC USA posted the e-mail addresses of Lance\u2019s wife and daughters on its Web site. They, too, received harassing e-mails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">SHAC USA also posted the home address and home phone number of Amy Hessler, Patent Associates Manager at Chiron, on its Web site at a location entitled \u201cTargets.\u201d At midnight one night in May 2003, several people drove back and forth in front of Kessler\u2019s house screaming through bullhorns and left a screeching personal alarm in her front yard. After this incident, SHAC USA posted the following statement on its Web site: \u201cPrepare yourself Chiron because this is only the beginning. As long as you continue to act as a customer for HLS you will be exposed in your neighborhoods and communities. We know how you make your money, and we know where you live!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Hessler also received many phone calls and messages on her home telephone. The callers would ask whether she killed animals for a living. They would also urge her to \u201cquit HLS.\u201d She also began receiving numerous collect calls from strangers. She changed her home telephone number to an unlisted phone number. Kessler\u2019s home address was also posted on Craig\u2019s List, an Internet bulletin board. The posting stated that Kessler\u2019s mother had died and that Hessler was holding an estate sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">Over the next several months, there were a number of incidents at Kessler\u2019s home. At 2:00 a.m. one night a group of protesters gathered at her house and shouted through bullhorns. SHAC USA posted an account on this incident on its Web site, and also posted Kessler\u2019s home address. The account states: \u201cStop doing business with Huntingdon Life Sciences. Until you do we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>will be watching you. We will invite ourselves over to your homes and into your private lives.\u201d On another night at 2:00 a.m. a number of persons pounded on Kessler\u2019s front door and shouted, \u201cOpen the door you fucking bitch!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Linda Short, Chiron\u2019s Vice President for Corporate Resources, was also a subject of SHAC USA\u2019s \u201cvisits.\u201d Short\u2019s home address and her home telephone numbers were published on the \u201ctargets\u201d section of SHAC USA\u2019s Web page. On May 15, 2003, a group of people arrived at her house in the middle of the night. They were masked and shouted anti-Chiron slogans through bullhorns. They also left a screeching personal alarm in Short\u2019s front yard. Short was the recipient of numerous harassing phone calls. She also discovered that someone had posted her home phone number and fake sales listings on Internet Web sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">On one occasion, a group of individuals smeared animal feces on the front and back entrances to Short\u2019s house, threw mangled stuffed animals in her front yard, and spray-painted slogans, including \u201cpuppy killer\u201d and \u201cdrop HLS\u201d on her front walkway and the sidewalk. On another occasion, Short discovered that, during the night, someone had permanently etched onto the front and back windshields of her car the slogans \u201cpuppy killer\u201d and \u201cdrop HLS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">On the night of August 28, 2003, two bombs were detonated at Chiron\u2019s headquarters in Emeryville. SHAC USA\u2019s president, Kevin Kjonaas, made a public statement that SHAC USA shared the passion of the bombers and that Chiron and its employees should be \u201cvery worried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">SHAC USA posted a link on its Web site to a statement by a group that took responsibility for the bombing. This group, \u201cThe Revolutionary Cells,\u201d stated that: \u201cYou might be able to protect your buildings, but can you protect the homes of every employee?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">Less than a month later, SHAC USA again linked to another statement by The Revolutionary Cells, which read: \u201cHey Sean Lance, and the rest of the Chiron team, how are you sleeping? You never know when your house, your car even, might go boom. Who knows, that new car in the parking lot may be packed with explosives. Or maybe it will be a shot in the dark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">C. <em>Chiron\u2019s Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">Chiron sued SHAC USA in February 2004. Its complaint sought injunctive relief on behalf of Chiron itself and also on behalf of its employees. It alleged that SHAC USA \u201cratified, authorized, aided and/or abetted the unlawful acts\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>of certain individuals. These acts were described at length in the complaint and we have summarized them above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The first cause of action, for harassment, is brought by Chiron on behalf of its employees under section 527.6. The complaint describes these employees as a \u201cwell-defined and easily identifiable group\u201d among whom \u201cthere is a well-defined community of interest ... in being free from Defendants\u2019 intimidating and harassing conduct.\u201d The actions described at great length in the complaint, and summarized already in this opinion, form the basis of the harassment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">In its second cause of action, Chiron asserts a claim on its employees\u2019 behalf for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">The third cause of action, based on article I, section 1, of the California Constitution, is brought by Chiron on behalf of its employees who, according to the complaint, have a reasonable expectation of privacy which defendant has invaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">The fourth cause of action is for the tort of intrusion into private affairs, a common law claim, brought by Chiron on its employees\u2019 behalf. This cause of action alleges that defendant has, by its conduct, intentionally intruded upon the solitude and seclusion of Chiron\u2019s employees and that these intrusions \u201cwould be highly offensive to an ordinarily reasonable person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Chiron\u2019s trespass claim, its fifth cause of action, is brought on its own behalf and also on behalf of its employees. It is based on an event in August 2003 when defendant, without Chiron\u2019s consent, entered the property and allegedly planted two explosive devices that detonated, causing damage to real and personal property. In addition, defendant also allegedly entered on real property belonging to Chiron employees throughout California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">D. <em>The Motion to Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">After Chiron filed its complaint, SHAC USA filed a special motion to strike under section 425.16. A week later, Chiron amended its complaint, adding three individual plaintiffs and alleging causes of action for harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of the California constitutional right of privacy, intrusion into private affairs, and trespass on behalf of the individual plaintiffs and by Chiron on behalf of these individual plaintiffs. Chiron also alleged causes of action for intentional interference with business relations and violation of Business and Professions code section 17200 on its own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>The trial court denied SHAC USA\u2019s motion to strike. On August 12, 2004, SHAC USA appealed from this order of denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">E. <em>The Preliminary Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">On the morning of August 15, 2004, about 35 people, many wearing masks, staged a demonstration at the house of Chiron\u2019s general counsel, William Green. The demonstrators carried signs denouncing Chiron and Huntingdon Life Sciences and chanted slogans through bullhorns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Two groups of demonstrators ran onto Green\u2019s property during this time. One group went to the front of the house and the other to the back. They smashed several windows in Green\u2019s house and turned a garden hose on and left it running on Green\u2019s deck. When one of Green\u2019s neighbors tried to prevent them from entering Green\u2019s backyard, the demonstrators surrounded him and told him they were going to \u201ckick [his] fucking head in.\u201d Informed that the police were on their way, the demonstrators fled, chanting, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">A month before this attack, SHAC USA sent an e-mail to readers. In this e-mail, SHAC USA stated that August 12 through 15 would be a \u201cweekend of action.\u201d The e-mail directed SHAC USA\u2019s members to \u201c[j]oin activists as they caravan to an HLS supporter\u2019s home to let them know that animal abuse will not be tolerated.\u201d The e-mail also contained a schedule of the weekend\u2019s activities, among which was preparation for \u201chome demonstrations\u201d and instructions to gather for a \u201chome demo\u201d on Sunday, August 15 at 9:00 a.m., the morning Green\u2019s house was attacked. In fact, when activists arrived at Green\u2019s house, they were carrying a banner that featured the Internet address for SHAC USA\u2019s Web site.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">On September 10, 2004, Chiron successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against SHAC USA. In issuing this preliminary injunction, the trial court found that \u201cthe evidence submitted by the parties provides a compelling showing that SHAC USA has acted in concert with persons who have terrorized Plaintiffs.\u201d SHAC USA has also appealed the issuance of this preliminary injunction and we have consolidated these two appeals. We will now address their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">A. <em>Motion to Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">1. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">Defendant\u2019s motion to strike was filed under section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1). This section provides that \u201c[a] cause of action against a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">In two recent decisions, <em>Flatley v. Mauro </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 299 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 606, 139 P.3d 2] (Flatley) and <em>Soukup </em>v. <em>Law Offices of Herbert Hafif </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 260 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 638, 139 P.3d 30] <em>(Soukup), </em>our Supreme Court discussed the applicable law in this area. In <em>Soukup, </em>the court explained that \u201c \u2018Section 425.16 posits ... a two-step process for determining whether an action is a SLAPP. First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity. ... If the court finds that such a showing has been made, it must then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Only a cause of action that satisfies <em>both </em>prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning <em>and </em>lacks even minimal merit\u2014is a SLAPP, subject to being stricken under the statute.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Soukup, supra, 39 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 278-279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">The \u201cpurpose of section 425.16 is to prevent the chilling of the \u2018valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances\u2019 by \u2018the abuse of the judicial process.\u2019 (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).)\u201d <em>(Flately, supra, 39 </em>Cal.4th at p. 313.) However, as the court pointed out, \u201c[a]s a necessary corollary to this statement, because not all speech or petition activity is constitutionally protected, not all speech or petition activity is protected by section 425.16.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">In particular, the <em>Flatley </em>court held that \u201csection 425.16 cannot be invoked by a defendant whose assertedly protected activity is illegal as a matter of law and, for that reason, not protected by constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition.\u201d <em>(Flatley, supra, 39 </em>Cal.4th at p. 317.) The court noted that \u201c[a] contrary rule would be inconsistent with the purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute as revealed by its language.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In fact, \u201cit would eviscerate the first step of the two-step inquiry set forth in the statute if the defendant\u2019s mere assertion that his underlying activity was constitutionally protected sufficed to shift the burden to the plaintiff to establish a probability of prevailing where it could be conclusively shown that the defendant\u2019s underlying activity was illegal and not constitutionally protected. While a defendant need only make a prima facie showing that the underlying activity falls within the ambit of the statute, clearly the statute envisions that the courts do more than simply rubber stamp such assertions before moving on to the second step.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>The court held, therefore, that \u201cwhere a defendant brings a motion to strike under section 425.16 based on a claim that the plaintiff\u2019s action arises from activity by the defendant in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s exercise of protected speech or petition rights, but either the defendant concedes, or the evidence conclusively establishes, that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter of law, the defendant is precluded from using the anti-SLAPP statute to strike the plaintiff\u2019s action. In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that the question of whether the defendant\u2019s underlying conduct was illegal as a matter of law is preliminary, and unrelated to the second prong question of whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing, and the showing required to establish conduct illegal as a matter of law\u2014either through defendant\u2019s concession or by uncontroverted and conclusive evidence\u2014is not the same showing as the plaintiff\u2019s second prong showing of probability of prevailing.\u201d (Flatley, <em>supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Finally, the <em>Flatley </em>court summed up our standard of review as follows: \u201c \u2018Review of an order granting or denying a motion to strike under section 425.16 is de novo. <em>(Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1056 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 882].) We consider \u201cthe pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits upon which the liability or defense is based.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(2).) However, we neither \u201cweigh credibility [nor] compare the weight of the evidence. Rather,. . . [we] accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff [citation] and evaluate the defendant\u2019s evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(HMS Capital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawyers Title Co. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 204, 212 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 786].)\u2019 <em>(Soukup, supra, </em>[39 Cal.4th at p. 269,] fn. 3.)\u201d (Flatley; <em>supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at pp. 325-326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">With these principles in mind, we turn now to the issues presented in these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">2. <em>The Motion to Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">The trial court found that defendant had not met its burden of proving that Chiron\u2019s claims arise from SHAC USA\u2019s protected activities<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>moreover, that even if they had, Chiron had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on their claims. SHAC USA attacks both these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">a. <em>Protected Activity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">First, SHAC USA argues that Chiron\u2019s complaint is directed at protected activity under the SLAPP statute because it is based almost entirely on speech made in a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3). SHAC USA also contends that even if the complaint is viewed as involving a mixture of protected and unprotected activities, the court erred in finding its speech was not protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Chiron, on the other hand, argues that the gravamen of the complaint is not speech, but the acts of harassment, infliction of emotional distress, intrusion and trespass that occurred during the \u201chome visits\u201d perpetrated by individuals who are unnamed in the complaint. SHAC USA is liable for these acts, Chiron argues, because it conspired with these persons to commit them and this conspiracy was illegal as a matter of law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">In <em>Flatley, </em>the court held when \u201cthe defendant concedes, or the evidence conclusively establishes, that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter of law, the defendant is precluded from using the anti-SLAPP statute to strike the plaintiff\u2019s action.\u201d <em>(Flatley, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 320.) Here, the evidence conclusively establishes that the activities described at length in the complaint, and about which there is no dispute, are illegal as a matter of law. Indeed, SHAC USA has conceded that the attacks on Chiron employees were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">Moreover, there is ample evidence that SHAC USA conspired with the demonstrators to commit these wrongful acts. It is well established that evidence of a conspiracy to commit wrongful acts \u201c 1 \u201c \u2018may be inferred from the nature of the acts done, the relation of the parties, the interests of the alleged conspirators, and other circumstances.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Wyatt v. Union Mortgage Co. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 773, 785 [157 Cal.Rptr. 392, 598 P.2d 45].) SHAC USA through postings on its Web sites, gave its members essential information for carrying out attacks on the homes of Chiron employees. It named the dates and gathering places, and even supplied its members with the addresses of the targeted Chiron employees. And after these attacks occurred, SHAC USA essentially ratified them by praising them in statements it posted on its Web site.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">It is simply not the case, as SHAC USA argues, that its statements in furtherance of this conspiracy are protected under the anti-SLAPP statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>The First Amendment offers no protection for such communications. <em>(Giboney v. Empire Storage and Ice Co. </em>(1949) 336 U.S. 490, 498 [93 L.Ed. 834, 69 S.Ct. 684].) In <em>McCollum </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc. </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 989, 999-1000 [249 Cal.Rptr. 187], the court held that \u201cthe freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is not absolute. There are certain limited classes of speech which may be prevented or punished by the state consistent with the principles of the First Amendment: . . . solicitation of crime, complicity of encouragement, conspiracy, and the like . ...\u201d In short, statements in furtherance of a conspiracy are not the sort of speech section 425.16 was designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">b. <em>Probability of Prevailing on the Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Not only did the trial court correctly find that SHAC USA had failed to show that, under the first prong of section 425.16, Chiron\u2019s complaint was aimed at speech, but it also properly concluded that Chiron had met its burden of showing a probability of prevailing on its claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Before we discuss this point, however, we must consider a preliminary matter: SHAC USA\u2019s argument that the trial court improperly relied on Chiron\u2019s first amended complaint, a complaint filed after SHAC USA\u2019s motion to strike for the purpose of adding individual plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">The simplest answer to this contention is found in the trial court\u2019s own words. In its decision, the court unambiguously stated that \u201cthe operative pleading is the original Complaint.\u201d Thus, the trial court assessed whether Chiron had met its burden of demonstrating a probability of prevailing on the claims asserted in its original complaint. Although SHAC USA states that the trial court relied on the individual claims asserted in the first amended complaint in reaching this issue, this contention is simply factually incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">We turn then to the issue of whether the trial court erred in concluding that Chiron had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on its claims. SHAC USA first argues that Chiron cannot prevail on the claims asserted in its first through fourth causes of action because it may not assert these claims on behalf of its employees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">In general, a plaintiff may assert a claim on behalf of a third party only when (1) the plaintiff has suffered an injury in fact; (2) the plaintiff has a relationship with the third party so that it can, and will, effectively present the third party\u2019s rights; and (3) obstacles exist preventing the third party from asserting his own rights. <em>(Singleton v. Wulff </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 106, 113-116 [49 L.Ed.2d 826, 96 S.Ct. 2868]; <em>N.Y. State Nat. Organization for Women </em>v. <em>Terry </em>(2d Cir. 1989) 886 F.2d 1339, 1348-1349 <em>(Terry).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>In Terry, a case that also challenged aggressive tactics against an organization by those opposed to its aims, the court found that health care clinics and abortion providers could sue on behalf of their employees and patients to secure an injunction against protesters whose actions barred access to the clinics. The court reasoned that the clinics had shown an injury in fact by asserting their right to be free of tortious acts in conducting their business activities. <em>(Terry, supra, </em>886 F.2d at p. 1339.) The court also found that the right asserted on behalf of third parties by the clinics to travel freely to obtain abortion services \u201c \u2018is inextricably bound up with the activity the litigant wishes to pursue.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1348.) The court concluded that because of the intertwined nature of the rights asserted by the clinics, \u201cwe are assured that the clinics represent the rights and interests of the women seeking their assistance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1348.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Here, as in <em>Terry, </em>all three prongs of the test are met. First, there is no dispute that Chiron has asserted that it has suffered an injury. Chiron\u2019s complaint makes out a trespass claim on its own behalf based on the bombing of its property in Emeryville.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Second, the relationship between Chiron and the third parties it seeks to represent is a strong one, based as it is on the employer-employee relationship. For no reason other than their employment with Chiron, these employees were targeted for vicious and frightening acts of harassment. As then-employer, Chiron has a responsibility to effectively present its employees\u2019 rights to be free from such conduct. Certainly, Chiron\u2019s interest in protecting its employees from harassment due to their employment with Chiron coincides with the employees\u2019 interest in being free from such tactics. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>(3rd Cir. 1980) 638 F.2d 570 [employer permitted to bring invasion of privacy claim on behalf of employees].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Finally, the obstacles that prevent Chiron employees from asserting their own rights are evident from the complaint. It is unlikely that employees who had already been targeted by SHAC USA would permit themselves to be further targeted by becoming a named party to a lawsuit. (See <em>Planned Parenthood Golden Gate v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 347, 351 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 627] [disclosure of private information to antiabortion activists described as \u201cdire\u201d to health clinic employees].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">Nor does <em>Huntingdon Life Sciences, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1228 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 521] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number><em>(Huntingdon Life Sciences) </em>suggest a different result. In <em>Huntingdon Life Sciences, </em>the corporation sought relief on its <em>own behalf </em>for damages suffered by its employees for the protestors\u2019 infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1260.) Despite SHAC USA\u2019s claim to the contrary, this decision did not address the question of whether a corporation may bring such claims on its employees\u2019 behalf.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cA decision, of course, does not stand for a proposition not considered by the court.\u201d <em>(Nolan </em>v. <em>City of Anaheim </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 335, 343 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 857, 92 P.3d 350].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\"><em>City of Los Angeles v. Animal Defense League </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 606, 621-622 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 632], relied on heavily by SHAC USA at oral argument, does not persuade us to alter our decision. In that case, the court noted that \u201cif the defendant concedes the conduct complained of was illegal, the defendant will be unable to make a prima facie showing the action arises from protected activity within the meaning of section 425.16.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In <em>Animal Defense League, </em>the court found that the protest activities were well within the law. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, however, there is no question that the actions of the demonstrators were outside the law, as the court below also found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">In addition, SHAC USA argues that the trial court erred in finding that Chiron had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on its claims because there is insufficient evidence of SHAC USA\u2019s responsibility for the tortious acts alleged in the complaint. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">We note that we review de novo the question of whether the plaintiff has established a reasonable probability of prevailing. A plaintiff is required to make a prima facie showing of facts which would, if proved at trial, support a judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor. We do not weigh the evidence, \u201cbut must decide only whether [defendant\u2019s evidence] defeat[s] plaintiff\u2019s supporting evidence as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Du Charme v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 107, 112 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 501].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">A plaintiff\u2019s complaint need only be shown to have \u201cminimal merit\u201d <em>(Soukup, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 279; <em>Navellier v. Sletten </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 89, 95 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703].) In considering this issue, we look at the \u201c \u2018pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits . . . upon which the liability or defense is based.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Soukup, supra, </em>at p. 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>Chiron has met its burden of showing sufficient evidence of SHAC\u2019s participation in a conspiracy with the protestors who were involved in the incidents detailed in their complaint. Liability for conspiracy may be imposed upon all those who \u201cconcurred in the tortious scheme with knowledge of its unlawful purpose.\u201d <em>(Wyatt v. Union Mortgage Co., supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at pp. 784\u2014785.) As we have noted, a finder of fact may infer the requisite concurrence and knowledge from the nature of the acts done, the parties\u2019 relations to each other, and the common interest of the alleged conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">\u201cIt is not necessary that the plaintiffs produce evidence showing that the defendants met and actually agreed to undertake the performance of the unlawful act.\u201d <em>(Black v. Sullivan </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 557, 567 [122 Cal.Rptr. 119].) \u201cTacit consent as well as express approval will suffice to hold a person liable as a coconspirator.\u201d <em>(Wyatt v. Union Mortgage Co., supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 785.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">There is more than sufficient evidence in this record, both direct and circumstantial, to support a conclusion that Chiron can show a probability of prevailing on its claims. First, SHAC USA admitted that it made available on its Web site the home addresses and phone numbers of Chiron employees and then encouraged activists to make harassing \u201chome visits\u201d to those employees. Second, SHAC USA published instructions about how to conduct these \u201chome visits.\u201d Third, SHAC USA published a calendar on its Web site that directed activists to gather on a specific date to conduct a \u201chome visit.\u201d Fourth, SHAC USA took credit for the conduct that occurred. In one particularly chilling statement, after Chiron\u2019s headquarters were bombed, SHAC USA\u2019s president made a public statement to the effect that SHAC USA \u201cshares the passion of the bombers.\u201d He went on to say that Chiron and its employees should be \u201cvery worried.\u201d SHAC USA also posted a link to an explicit death threat made by an organization called \u201cThe Revolutionary Cells,\u201d which read: \u201cHey Sean Lance, and the rest of the Chiron team, how are you sleeping? You never know when your house, your car even, might go boom. Who knows, that new car in the parking lot may be packed with explosives. Or maybe it will be a shot in the dark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">SHAC USA argues that it did not organize the home visits, or authorize or ratify them. The record supports a contrary conclusion. SHAC USA published the information used by activists to target Chiron employees, along with information scheduling these home visits and information instructing activists on how to conduct a \u201chome visit.\u201d SHAC USA also effectively ratified this conducted by announcing, with approval, the results of these activities and encouraging persons to continue the harassment. Taken together, this evidence is sufficient on which to base a conspiracy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Similarly, there was evidence in the record that made out a prima facie case of conspiracy with regard to Chiron\u2019s claim for the trespass and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>bombing of its headquarters. A declaration from one Christine Loscalzo, an FBI special agent assigned to investigate domestic terrorism cases and threats, establishes that on the date of the explosion at Chiron, SHAC USA\u2019s president spoke by telephone with one of the people suspected by the FBI to be involved in the bombing. In addition, on its web site, SHAC USA stated that it \u201cshare[s] the same passion\u201d as the bombers and it then linked that Web site to one sponsored by those who took credit for the bombing. This is sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie claim that SHAC USA conspired to commit the trespass and bombing of Chiron\u2019s headquarters in Emeryville.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">3. <em>First Amendment Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">SHAC USA also argues that Chiron cannot prevail on the merits, because its claims are aimed at constitutionally protected speech. In <em>Huntingdon Life Sciences, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at pages 1255-1257, the court considered this argument in the context of the same sort of activity directed against Huntingdon Life Sciences. In that case, the court found that SHAC\u2019s activities (publishing targets home addresses on the SHAC Web site, making threats of home visits) were not protected activities because they constituted \u201c \u2018true threats\u2019 \u201d which are not protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">In reaching this conclusion, the court distinguished a case also relied on by SHAC USA, <em>Brandenburg </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 444, 447 [23 L.Ed.2d 430, 89 S.Ct. 1827]. <em>Brandenburg </em>stands for the proposition that the \u201c \u2018First Amendment protects speech that advocates violence, so long as the speech is not directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is not likely to incite or produce such action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Huntingdon Life Sciences, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1251-1252.) However, the <em>Huntingdon </em>court concluded that SHAC\u2019s activities were, in fact, likely to incite or produce imminent lawless action. We agree, on very similar facts, with our colleagues\u2019 reasoning and reach the same result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">4. <em>Communications Decency Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">Finally, SHAC USA argues that it is immune from liability under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, title 47 United States Code section 230. That statute applies, however, only to \u201cinteractive computer services,\u201d which are defined as \u201cany information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server . . . .\u201d There is no evidence in this record that SHAC USA operates in this manner. Moreover, this argument was rejected in <em>Huntingdon Life Sciences, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at page 1258, footnote 9, because there, as here, SHAC put forth \u201cno evidence that SHAC USA\u2019s Web site is an \u2018interactive computer service.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>B. <em>Preliminary Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">SHAC USA appealed from the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion to strike Chiron\u2019s complaint. After the notice of appeal was filed, the trial court granted a preliminary injunction SHAC USA now argues that, under section 916, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief during the pendency of the appeal on the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">In <em>Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 180 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 298, 106 P.3d 958], our Supreme Court held that \u201cthe perfecting of an appeal from the denial of a special motion to strike automatically stays all further trial court proceedings on the merits upon the causes of action affected by the motion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 186.) This rule is consistent with the general principle articulated in section 916 that \u201cthe perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Although SHAC USA argues that the preliminary injunction disturbs the status quo, in our view that injunction is not a decision on the merits and does not effect the merits of the claim. Thus, for example, in <em>People ex rel. Gallo </em>v. <em>Acuna </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1090, 1109 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 277, 929 P.2d 596], the court held that a preliminary injunction is not an adjudication on the merits but, rather, represents the court\u2019s \u201cevaluation of the controversy on the record before it at the time of its ruling.\u201d (Italics omitted; see also <em>Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn. </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, 623 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 237].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\"><em>Var\u00edan </em>does not compel a different result. There, the trial court attempted to set a trial date and proceed to trial on the merits of the case although an appeal was spending. The court concluded that these actions were not permitted under section 916. It reasoned that, because a trial on the merits would result in a final judgment on the issue in the appeal, the matter before the court of appeal would have been rendered moot. Here, however, the granting of a preliminary injunction does not render this matter moot, because it is not a decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>IV.
