J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahm\">Plaintiff Anni Amberger-Warren was injured when she slipped and fell in a dog park in Piedmont. She sued the City of Piedmont on the theory that her injuries were caused by a dangerous condition of public property, and defendant obtained summary judgment on the basis of trail immunity (Gov. Code, \u00a7 831.4, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff contends on appeal that, as a matter of law or as a triable issue of fact, the accident did not occur on a \u201ctrail\u201d within the meaning of the immunity statute, and that, even if the accident happened on a trail, defendant is not insulated from liability because the accident was caused by dangerous conditions defendant created that were \u201cunrelated\u201d to the trail.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">We examine the application of section 831.4 to a paved pathway in an urban park setting. The principal issues are: (1) whether the pathway in question was a \u201csidewalk\u201d for purposes of section 831.4, and, if so, whether a sidewalk can ever be a \u201ctrail\u201d under the statute; and (2) whether trail immunity precludes liability for the design and location, as well as the maintenance, of a trail. We hold that the pathway here is a trail under the statute, even if it could be characterized as a sidewalk, and that trail immunity covers claims arising from a trail\u2019s design and location. Based on these and other conclusions discussed below, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Around 6:00 p.m. on June 29, 2004, plaintiff and her eponymous dog Diogi, and Susan Chow and her dog Rufus, were in the off-leash \u201clower loop\u201d section of Linda Park, a dog park owned and operated by defendant. The off-leash area appears from the photos in evidence to be a fenced-in section of the park. \u201cDesignated Off-Leash Rules\u201d are posted on the gated entrance to the area and inside it, which state among other things that \u201c[ojwners are responsible for all injuries and/or property damage.\u201d Plaintiff admits that, before the accident in question, she had brought dogs to this off-leash area nearly every day for at least eight years without any mishap.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">The \u201clower loop\u201d is a paved pathway across a hill; the hill is described in the record as \u201ca dirt embankment.\u201d Plaintiff and Chow were sitting on benches toward the bottom of the pathway while Diogi and Rufus played unleashed, when a woman came down the pathway and, apparently to protect her smaller dogs from Diogi and Rufus, said, \u201cGet your dog.\u201d When plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>went up the pathway to put a leash on Diogi, she was bumped by Diogi or Rufus, slipped on some debris on the pathway, and fell backward, landing \u201cpart-way off\u201d the pathway. To avoid going down the hill next to the pathway, she grabbed an exposed cement edge as she fell, and injured her hand in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">A. <em>Trail Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Section 831.4, subdivisions (a) and (b) provide that: \u201cA public entity ... is not liable for an injury caused by a condition of: [j[] (a) Any unpaved road which provides access to fishing, hunting, camping, hiking, riding, including animal and all types of vehicular riding, water sports, recreational or scenic areas and which is not a (1) city street or highway or (2) county, state or federal highway or (3) public street or highway of a joint highway district, boulevard district, bridge and highway district or similar district formed for the improvement or building of public streets or highways. H] (b) Any trail used for the above purposes.\u201d This immunity is afforded \u201cto encourage public entities to open their property for public recreational use, because \u2018the burden and expense of putting such property in a safe condition and the expense of defending claims for injuries would probably cause many public entities to close such areas to public use.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Armenio v. County of San Mateo </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 413, 417 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 631] <em>(Armenio).) </em>The trail immunity provided in subdivision (b) of the statute extends to trails that are used for the activities listed in subdivision (a), and to trails that are used solely for access to such activities. <em>(Treweek v. City of Napa </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 221, 224\u2014229 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 883] <em>(Treweek).) </em>The immunity applies whether or not the trail is paved. <em>(Armenio, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 418.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">B. <em>Whether the Accident Occurred on a Trail</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Plaintiff submits that the pathway on which she was injured was not a trail for purposes of section 831.4, subdivision (b), or that the question is at least a triable issue of fact in this instance. We conclude that as a matter of law the pathway was a trail under the statute for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Whether the property is a trail depends on a number of considerations, including accepted definitions of the property <em>(Carroll v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 606, 609 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 504] <em>(Carroll); </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number><em>Treweek, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 230), the purpose for which the property is designed and used, and the purpose of the immunity statute <em>(Farnham v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1097, 1103 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 720] <em>(Farnham)). </em>Each of these three factors militates in favor of immunity in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">First, the pathway constitutes a trail under accepted definitions because it is a paved pathway through a park, and a \u201cpath,\u201d as <em>Carroll, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at page 609, observed, is synonymous with a \u201ctrail.\u201d (See <em>ibid. </em>[dictionary definition of a trail as \u201c \u2018a marked or established <em>path </em>or route . . . .\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Treweek, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 230 [a trail \u201cconsists] primarily of a path or track\u201d]; compare <em>Treweek, supra, </em>at p. 230 [dictionary and judicial definitions did not suggest that a \u201cramp\u201d was synonymous with a \u201ctrail\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Second, the pathway qualifies as a trail because it is designed and used for a recreational purpose, i.e., bringing a dog to an unleashed area of a dog park, a form of recreation for both dog and walker. (See generally <em>Armenio, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 418 [the purpose for which trail is used \u201cis ordinarily viewed as a factual issue, but it becomes a question of law if only one conclusion is possible\u201d].) The pathway is indistinguishable in this regard from the paved paths found to be trails in other cases. <em>(Farnham, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1099, 1102-1103 [bicycle path]; <em>Carroll, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 607 [bike path]; <em>Armenio, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at pp. 415, 418 [path for walking, running, bike riding, and horseback riding].) This conclusion obtains whether the pathway is viewed as providing access to the recreational activity, or the activity is deemed to occur on the pathway itself. <em>(Treweek, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at pp. 224-229.) Plaintiff asserts that trails have heretofore been found to exist only in \u201cremote areas,\u201d but the bicycle path deemed to be a trail in <em>Farnham, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at pages 1098-1099, could not have been too remote because it was located in the city of Los Angeles. Urban recreational areas fulfill many of the same purposes as remote areas. Neither public policy nor the statute suggests any such differentiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Third, the pathway should be treated as a trail to fulfill the purpose of the statute, because public entities could well be inclined to close dog parks if they were exposed to liability for accidents like the one here. (Cf. <em>Treweek, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at pp. 232-234 [municipality would be unlikely to close a ramp connecting a dock to a boat or a parking lot absent the extension of immunity].) As the court in <em>Farnham, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at page 1103, observed with respect to a paved bike path, while it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>\u201creasonable that users would expect a paved surface to be appropriately constructed and maintained,\u201d \u201cthe flip side ... is the difficulty cities and counties might face in inspection and repair. Paved trails are subject to changing irregularity of surface conditions due to seismic movement, natural settlement, or stress from traffic. Additionally, the weather can cause dirt or sand to be blown on a trail, creating an unsafe surface for almost any user. Rocks, tree branches and other debris often find their way onto a trail. ... In today\u2019s litigious society, it does not take a very large crystal ball to foresee the plethora of litigation cities or counties might face over bicycle paths .... The actual cost of such litigation, or even the specter of it, might well cause cities or counties to reconsider allowing the operation of a bicycle path . . . .\u201d For all these same reasons, the purpose of the statute would be well served by the recognition of immunity here.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Plaintiff asserts that this pathway is a \u201csidewalk,\u201d and argues that a sidewalk cannot constitute a \u201ctrail\u201d under section 831.4, subdivision (b), because subdivision (c) of the statute distinguishes between trails and sidewalks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subdivision (c) provides immunity for injuries caused by the condition of: \u201cAny paved <em>trail, walkway, path, or sidewalk </em>on an easement of way which has been granted to a public entity, which easement provides access to any unimproved property, so long as such public entity shall reasonably attempt to provide adequate warnings of the existence of any condition of the paved <em>trail, walkway, path, or sidewalk </em>which constitutes a hazard to health or safety. Warnings required by this subdivision shall only be required where pathways are paved, and such requirement shall not be construed to be a standard of care for any unpaved pathways or roads.\u201d (Italics and underscoring added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Plaintiff believes that the pathway in this case can be shown to be a sidewalk simply by pronouncing it a sidewalk. She notes in her opening brief that her \u201c[declaration [in opposition to the motion for summary judgment] indicates multiple times that she considers the walkway a \u2018sidewalk.\u2019 ... In addition, [her] accident reconstruction expert refers [in his declaration] to the walkway as a \u2018sidewalk\u2019 multiple times .... [Defendant] never objected to [p]laintiff[\u2019s] or [the expert\u2019s] use of the term sidewalk.\u201d But as the court in <em>Farnham, supra, </em>68 Cal.4th at page 1103 observed: \u201cAn object is what it is. For example, an adjacent parking lot does not become a trail by the simple expedient of calling it a trail. The design and use will control what an object is, not the name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">A \u201csidewalk\u201d is ordinarily defined as something that is next to, or part of, a street or highway. (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Diet. (11th ed. 2004) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>p. 1158 [the usual meaning of \u201csidewalk\u201d is that of a \u201cpaved walk for pedestrians at the side of a street\u201d]; Black\u2019s Law Diet. (6th ed. 1990) p. 1381 [a sidewalk is \u201c[t]hat part of a public street or highway designed for the use of pedestrians, being exclusively reserved for them, and constructed somewhat differently than other portions of the street\u201d]; Veh. Code, \u00a7 555 [a sidewalk is \u201cthat portion of a highway, other than the roadway, set apart by curbs, barriers, markings or other delineation for pedestrian travel\u201d]; Sts. &amp; Hy. Code, \u00a7 5600 [defining a sidewalk, for purposes of the chapter on sidewalk maintenance, to include enumerated objects \u201cin the area between the property line and the street line\u201d]; see also <em>In re Devon C. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 929, 932-933 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 513] [minor riding a bicycle on a sidewalk was riding on a \u201cstreet\u201d within the meaning of bicycle helmet law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Paved paths in public parks have thus been distinguished from sidewalks if they were not located on or adjacent to a street or highway. <em>(Hoskinson v. City of Iowa City </em>(Iowa 2001) 621 N.W.2d 425, 426, 428-429 [appellant fell while walking his dog on an asphalt walkway in a city park; collecting cases from around the country construing the word \u201csidewalk\u201d to refer to \u201ca walkway that is a part of the street or is at or along the side of the street\u201d]; <em>Stabley v. Park Authority </em>(1998) 228 Mich.Ct.App. 363 [579 N.W.2d 374, 375, 377-378] [rollerblade became wedged in crack on paved path in city park].) Here, since the pathway was not on or adjacent to a street or highway, it was not a sidewalk as that term is ordinarily defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The pathway could qualify as a \u201csidewalk\u201d only under broader than ordinary definitions of the latter term as \u201ca walk for foot passengers,\u201d \u201ca foot pavement,\u201d or a \u201cwalkway.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Diet. (2002) pp. 2113, 2572 [defining \u201csidewalk\u201d and \u201cwalkway\u201d].) But to equate the words \u201csidewalk\u201d and \u201cwalkway\u201d would only reinforce defendant\u2019s argument that the words \u201ctrail, walkway, path, or sidewalk\u201d in subdivision (c) have overlapping, not mutually exclusive, meanings. While the terms have different shades of meaning (Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Dict., <em>supra, </em>pp. 1654, 2113, 2423, 2572 [defining \u201cpath,\u201d \u201csidewalk,\u201d \u201ctrail,\u201d \u201cwalkway\u201d]), they can overlap to some extent in common usage (Roget\u2019s Intemat. Thesaums (5th ed. 1992) \u00a7 383, p. 280 [terms are potentially synonymous]; Rodale, The Synonym Finder (1978) p. 1249 [same]). Case law has confirmed that overlap by equating the terms \u201ctrail\u201d and \u201cpath\u201d <em>(Carroll, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 609), and has thereby implicitly rejected plaintiff\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">We note that plaintiff cannot even formulate an argument for mutual exclusivity of the terms in subdivision (c) without equating them herself. Plaintiff says that the \u201cwalkway\u201d here was a \u201csidewalk,\u201d and we would agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>that \u201cwalkway\u201d is probably the most natural term to use to describe the site of the accident. (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict., <em>supra, </em>at p. 2572 [defining a \u201cwalkway\u201d as \u201ca path for pedestrians especially] in a garden or park\u201d].) But if a sidewalk cannot be a \u201ctrail,\u201d then neither can it be a \u201cwalkway.\u201d This problem with plaintiff\u2019s argument helps to illustrate why the distinctions she proposes would be unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The difficulties with plaintiff\u2019s argument go beyond mere semantics. Legislative history indicates, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s argument, that subdivision (c), which was enacted after subdivisions (a) and (b) (see <em>Giannuzzi </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 462, 466 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 335] (Giannuzzi) [sequence of enactments]), was not intended to limit existing immunity in any way, but rather to expand it. (See Cal. Coastal Com., Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill. No. 988 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 18, 1979 [subd. (c) expands governmental tort immunity]; State Coastal Conservancy letter to Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 17, 1979, Governor\u2019s chaptered bill files, ch. 1010 [same].) No intent to limit the meaning of a \u201ctrail\u201d under subdivision (b) is apparent in the enactment of subdivision (c) of section 831.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Further, the language of subdivision (c), as a whole, does not support plaintiff\u2019s construction. While the terms \u201ctrail, walkway, path, or sidewalk\u201d are fisted in the disjunctive in the first sentence of subdivision (c), they are all subsumed in the subdivision\u2019s second sentence under the single term \u201cpathways\u201d\u2014suggesting that the terms are broadly synonymous rather than mutually exclusive. The legislative history likewise suggests that the terms \u201ctrail, walkway, path, or sidewalk\u201d were not used to draw fine distinctions, but rather to comprehensively define all of the \u201caccessways\u201d and \u201cimproved easements\u201d that would be covered by subdivision (c). (See Sen. Republican Caucus, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 988 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) p. 1 [\u201cThe California Coastal Act of 1976 provides that public entities may accept offers to dedicate easements. However, proponents of this bill claim that because of budgetary constraints, these public entities are unwilling to accept such offers since existing law granting immunity from liability does not cover improved easements\u201d]; State Coastal Conservancy, letter to Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 17, 1979, Governor\u2019s chaptered bill files, ch. 1010 [immunity would be afforded in order to, among other things, \u201cencourage local governments to take management responsibility for coastal accessways which are the subjects of present offers to dedicate,\u201d and \u201cstimulate the provision of recreational accessways in non-coastal areas of the state as well\u201d]; Assemblyman Kapiloff, sponsor of Assem. Bill No. 988 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.), letter to Governor, Sept. 19, 1979, Governor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>chaptered bill files, ch. 1010 [law would encourage cities and counties to accept \u201cthe 300 or more dedications of coastal accessways which have been offered in connection with coastal development permits\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In sum, the pathway here can be deemed to be a trail under subdivision (b), even though it could also be characterized as a \u201cwalkway,\u201d a \u201cpath,\u201d or even, in the broadest sense of the term, a \u201csidewalk,\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (c). These terms in subdivision (c) are not mutually exclusive and do not limit the application of subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Plaintiff argues that whether the pathway is a trail is a triable issue of fact because she and her expert called it a sidewalk in their declarations, defendant\u2019s park manager called it a \u201cwalkway\u201d in his declaration, and the contract for maintenance of Linda Park and other areas referred to upkeep of \u201csidewalks\u201d and \u201cother paved areas,\u201d rather than trails. However, no triable issue arises as to a property\u2019s status under the statute simply by virtue of what people may call it. As previously noted, \u201c[a]n object is what it is,\u201d regardless of how it has been labeled. (See <em>Famham, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Plaintiff protests that our decision will \u201cmean that every sidewalk in a public park is a trail,\u201d but no such broad pronouncement is implicit in our reasoning. Whether a particular property is a trail under section 831.4, subdivision (b) will depend, as we have said, on accepted definitions of the property, the purpose for which the property is used, and the purpose of the statute. While there might be situations in public parks where fine drawing could be difficult, this is not one of them. We agree with the trial court that the pathway here is clearly a trail under the statute, notwithstanding plaintiff\u2019s arguments to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">C. <em>Whether the Injury Was Caused by Conditions of the Trail</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Plaintiff contends that trail immunity does not apply because her injury was not caused by a condition of the trail. She maintains that the accident resulted from other dangerous conditions, allegedly unrelated to the trail, that defendant created, including: allowing dogs to run unleashed in the park; permitting debris to accumulate on the trail; failing to install a guardrail where the accident occurred; and locating the trail in a dangerous area, i.e., next to a slope onto which people could fall. However, even if a trier of fact could reasonably find that all of these conditions were dangerous and that each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>them substantially contributed to the accident,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> they would not, either individually or collectively, create any liability here.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Plaintiff remarkably complains about defendant\u2019s policy of letting dogs off-leash\u2014the very reason she frequented the park in the first place\u2014 but her argument in this regard is like the one rejected in <em>State of California v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 325, 326-327 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 1]. There, a horseback rider fell off her horse on a trail in a state park when the horse was \u201c \u2018spooked\u2019 \u201d by a mountain bicyclist, and she alleged that the park \u201cwas in a dangerous condition because its trails . . . were open for use by mountain-bike riders as well as equestrians.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court observed that \u201ca public entity is not liable for a dangerous condition of public property based on third party conduct alone,\u201d and that the state was \u201cabsolutely immune from liability for injuries caused by a physical defect of a trail.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 327, 328.) Since there was no claim in that case that the trail itself was defective, the court held that there could be no recovery. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 329.) The same reasoning applies here. Defendant is not responsible for harm caused by third party actors such as plaintiff\u2019s own unleashed dog unless some unimmunized conduct on its part contributed to that harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s case thus hinges on her contention that trail immunity does not apply to the other dangerous conditions she identifies because those conditions were unrelated to the trail. It is well established that the immunity covers negligent maintenance of a trail, such as allowing accumulation of debris as alleged here. <em>(Astenius v. State of California </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 472, 474-475 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 877] [rocks protruded onto trail in vehicular recreation area; surface of trail \u201cwas extremely rough and in poor condition\u201d]; <em>Farnham, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1099 [outer pavement of bicycle path gave way causing appellant to be thrown into an adjacent ditch]; <em>Carroll, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at pp. 607-608 [crack in paved bicycle path]; <em>Armenio, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 415 [\u201cimproper patching\u201d of bicycle path]; <em>Giannuzzi, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 464 [\u201c \u2018large, loose dirt pilings\u2019 \u201d on a vehicular recreation park trail].) Accordingly, defendant is not liable for the debris on the trail.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">As for the absence of a handrail where the accident occurred,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we believe that, to fulfill its purpose, trail immunity must extend to claims arising from the design of a trail, as well as its maintenance. We presume that there are many miles of public trails on slopes in this state that could be made safer with handrails, and that handrails would perhaps enhance the safety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>all trails, wherever located, that bear pedestrian traffic. But to require installation of handrails along every public trail where it might be reasonably prudent to do so would greatly undermine the immunity\u2019s objective of encouraging access to recreational areas, because \u201c \u2018the burden and expense of putting such property in a safe condition and the expense of defending claims for injuries would probably cause many public entities to close such areas to public use.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Armenio, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 417.) While we would like to live in a world of resources sufficient to guarantee reasonable safety at all times, \u201cusers of recreational trails or bike paths generally understand the risk of injury inherent in the use of such pedestrian ways,\u201d and recognize that \u201c \u2018[a] large portion of the activities comprising modem public park and recreation programs . . . might well be curtailed, deferred or even completely eliminated if the risk of tort liability were to impose unduly large obligations upon the public treasury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Treweek, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 234 &amp; fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Plaintiff seeks to avoid the immunity by identifying the hill next to the trail, rather than the trail itself, as a dangerous condition, but this condition is not unrelated to the trail because the trail is what provides access to the hill and exposure to the alleged danger. Plaintiff is in effect arguing that the trail is situated in a dangerous location (see <em>Bonanno </em>v. <em>Central Contra Costa Transit Authority </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 139, 144 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 341, 65 P.3d 807] [dangerous condition liability can be predicated on property\u2019s location]), but location, no less than design, is an integral feature of a trail, and both must be immunized for the same reasons. To accept plaintiff\u2019s argument would be to require installation of handrails or other safety devices on trails, or relocation of trails, whenever the surroundings could otherwise be considered unreasonably dangerous. The likely and unacceptable result, which the immunity was created to avoid, would be the closure of many trails in areas that could be deemed at all hazardous.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Plaintiff contends finally that trail immunity does not apply because defendant entered into a special relationship with her by undertaking to maintain the trail. This argument is improperly advanced for the first time on appeal, and, in any event, the immunity would preclude liability for any breach of the duty created by the alleged special relationship. (See <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>City of Westminster </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 197, 202 [185 Cal.Rptr. 252, 649 P.2d 894] [\u201cimmunity hurdles are not overcome by the existence of a special relationship\u201d].) Otherwise, the special relationship argument would swallow up the absolute immunity promulgated by our Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>III.
