The public agency may validate its action by either active or passive means. It may initiate an action in rem to establish the validity of the matter. (\u00a7 860.) Alternatively, the agency may do nothing, and if no \u201cinterested person\u201d brings suit to determine the validity of the public agency\u2019s action within 60 days (\u00a7 863), the action is deemed valid. (\u00a7 869.) But not all actions of a public agency are subject to validation, and the present case requires us to determine the limits of the validation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Benjamin Kaatz brought suit as a taxpayer to challenge certain actions of the City of Seaside (City) arising out of its purchase and sale of 105 acres of residential property that were formerly part of the Fort Ord military base. Kaatz claimed, among other things, that immediately after the City purchased the property from the United States Army in July 2002, it conveyed the entire acreage to a developer, K&amp;B Bakewell Seaside Venture, LLC (K&amp;B Bakewell), for a fraction of its fair market value. Following motions for judgment on the pleadings and for dismissal filed by K&amp;B Bakewell (joined in by the City), the suit was dismissed on the basis that it was time-barred. In so doing, the court concluded that (1) the challenged purchase and sale of property were matters that were embraced by Government Code section 53511\u2019s language<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>permitting a local agency to bring a proceeding under the validation statutes to \u201cdetermine the validity of its bonds, warrants, contracts, obligations or evidences of indebtedness,\u201d and (2) Kaatz had not filed suit to determine the validity of the City\u2019s actions within 60 days as required by the validation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">As a threshold matter, we will address K&amp;B Bakewell\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal\u2014joined in by the City\u2014on the basis that the notice of appeal was not filed within 30 days of entry of judgment as provided in section 870, subdivision (b) (section 870(b)). We will conclude that the notice of appeal was timely filed; section 870(b) does not apply here, because the appeal is not challenging a \u201cjudgment entered pursuant to\u201d the validation statutes. We will then address the primary issue on appeal, namely, whether the City actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>challenged by Kaatz were ones that were subject to validation under the validation statues. We will hold, based upon the limited scope of the validation statutes, that the City\u2019s conveyance of the property\u2014along with the City\u2019s prior execution of the underlying contract with the developer concerning the potential acquisition and sale of the property\u2014was not subject to validation. We will therefore find that the trial court erred in its application of the 60-day statute of limitations for validation proceedings and consequent dismissal of the action. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment entered on that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY I. <em>Early Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">On May 16, 2003, Kaatz filed a complaint (captioned \u201cComplaint by Taxpayer for Injunctive Relief [CCP \u00a7 526a]\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging eight claims for relief against the City.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Kaatz alleged that he resided in the City and had paid real property taxes to the City within one year before the action was initiated. Kaatz challenged, among other things, the validity of a deed by which the City conveyed property known as the \u201cHayes Park Property\u201d (hereafter Hayes Park or Property) to K&amp;B Bakewell.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Kaatz sought an order pendente lite enjoining the City from granting any construction permits and from approving any final parcel maps for Hayes Park. On August 7, 2003, after extensive briefing and argument, the court granted a preliminary injunction preventing the City from \u201ctaking any action with regard to approval of the final subdivision map\u201d for the Property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">One day after granting the preliminary injunction, the court granted Kaatz\u2019s motion for leave to amend the complaint to add K&amp;B Bakewell as a defendant. And less than a week later, K&amp;B Bakewell filed a motion for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>order vacating the preliminary injunction, or, in the alternative, an order increasing the amount of the bond from $1,000 to $5,320,000. K&amp;B Bakewell argued that it\u2014as well as buyers of homes who had already planned to move into the development\u2014would suffer substantial injury if the injunction were allowed to remain in effect. Over Kaatz\u2019s opposition, the court vacated the preliminary injunction on August 15, 2003, on the condition that K&amp;B Bakewell\u2019s parent, KB Home, execute an enforceable guaranty of any monetary judgment imposed against K&amp;B Bakewell.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">II. <em>Second Amended Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The second amended complaint was the operative pleading addressed in K&amp;B Bakewell\u2019s alternative motions to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Kaatz asserted eight causes of action against all defendants, each claim arising generally out of the City\u2019s purchase of Hayes Park from the United States Army and the City\u2019s immediate resale of that Property to K&amp;B Bakewell. As to the majority of the claims, Kaatz cited as authority the statute permitting suit by a taxpayer to prevent the \u201cillegal expenditure of, waste of, or injury to, the estate, funds, or other property of a . . . city\u201d under section 526a. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The relevant allegations of the second amended complaint consisted of the following: (1) Following the enactment of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the United States closed the Fort Ord military base located in Monterey County; (2) The federal government was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>authorized to sell as surplus property (under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> portions of the former Fort Ord, including Hayes Park; (3) On or about May 4, 1998, the City, pursuant to its council\u2019s resolution authorizing such action, entered into an agreement with K&amp;B Bakewell concerning Hayes Park entitled \u201cLand Disposition Agreement\u201d (LDA); (4) On or about July 25, 2002, the federal government conveyed the Property by quitclaim deed to the City for a purchase price of $5.1 million; (5) Also on or about July 25, 2002, the City transferred all of its interest in Hayes Park to K&amp;B Bakewell for $5,950,000; (6) The City\u2019s transfer of the Property was in contravention of the City Council\u2019s resolution approving the LDA that the Property \u201cnot be sold for other than \u2018fair market value,\u2019 \u201d was a breach of the City\u2019s \u201cstatutory duty to make the surplus property available for affordable housing,\u201d was done \u201cwithout ever considering any other bid, proposal, or offer for the [Property],\u201d and was \u201cin violation of the constitutional and statutory prohibition against cities giving away public property\u201d; and (7) As a result, K&amp;B Bakewell stood to \u201cpocket, in addition to standard profit on the housing construction, an approximately $115 million pure cash windfall representing the value of the [Property] purportedly purchased from the City ... for a fraction of its fair market value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The first cause of action sought to invalidate the deed of the Property from the City to K&amp;B Bakewell. Kaatz alleged that the alleged transfer was void because the LDA, as approved by the City Council, required that Hayes Park be sold at its fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The second cause of action likewise sought to void the transfer of Hayes Park to K&amp;B Bakewell\u2014and to invalidate the LDA\u2014on the ground that the City, both through its execution of the LDA in 1998 and its conveyance of the Property in July 2002, violated the Surplus Land Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 54220 et seq.).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Kaatz alleged that that statute required the City to provide statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>notice to specified public agencies prior to selling or otherwise disposing of surplus public land acquired from the federal government to facilitate that law\u2019s goal of making such surplus land available for affordable housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Kaatz alleged as a third cause of action that the deed of the Property to K&amp;B Bakewell and the underlying LDA were void because they constituted a sale of City property below fair market value and did not fall within the statutory exception of Government Code section 37364, under which a city may sell its land for below fair market value where the sale\u2019s specific purpose is to create affordable housing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The fourth cause of action claimed that the LDA required K&amp;B Bakewell, in conjunction with acquiring the Property, to construct two public works projects to be located on City-owned land outside of Hayes Park, namely, a 4,000 square foot building and 10 housing units for homeless persons. Kaatz alleged that the LDA was void because the City failed to solicit competitive bids for construction of these two public works, as required under Public Contract Code section 20162.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Under the fifth cause of action, Kaatz similarly sought avoidance of the LDA. He alleged that, notwithstanding the LDA\u2019s recital that it was approved after a \u201c \u2018duly noticed public hearing,\u2019 \u201d no valid public hearing occurred, because \u201cthe terms and conditions of the LDA were modified on the very day the LDA Public Hearing was held.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The sixth cause of action alleged that the California Constitution (art. XVI, \u00a7 6) \u201cprohibits public entities from giving away public property.\u201d Kaatz asserted that, because the City sold Hayes Park to K&amp;B Bakewell for 5 percent of its fair market value, the LDA and deed were void because the City\u2019s actions were unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The seventh cause of action alleged that the City\u2019s actions in transferring the Property constituted a \u201cwaste of public estate, property and funds.\u201d Kaatz claimed that the LDA and deed to K&amp;B Bakewell were therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Finally, Kaatz alleged in the eighth cause of action that there was a present controversy that required (under \u00a7 1060) a judicial declaration of the parties\u2019 rights and duties under the LDA and deed conveying the Property to K&amp;B Bakewell.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">III. <em>Motion To Dismiss or Motion for Judgment on the </em>Pleadings<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">On November 14, 2003, K&amp;B Bakewell filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, a motion for judgment on the pleadings. K&amp;B Bakewell argued that the actions of the City being challenged\u2014the execution of the LDA and the sale of the Property pursuant to that agreement\u2014were subject to the validation statutes, and that because Kaatz had not brought a validating proceeding within 60 days, his action was time-barred. The City filed a joinder, and Kaatz opposed K&amp;B Bakewell\u2019s alternative motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">After extensive briefing (including several posthearing briefs) and argument, and after submission of the matter, on March 12, 2004, the court granted the motion to dismiss. It concluded that the City\u2019s challenged actions were subject to validation and accordingly Kaatz\u2019s claims were barred by the 60-day statute of limitations under the validation statutes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Judgment was entered on the dismissal on April 1, 2004. K&amp;B Bakewell gave written notice of entry of the judgment on April 5, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">IV. <em>Postjudgment Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">On April 20, 2004, Kaatz filed alternative motions for new trial or to set aside and vacate the judgment. Kaatz\u2019s principal argument was that the court, in ruling on the alternative motions to dismiss or for judgment on the pleadings, granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings; the court therefore should have granted leave to amend. Kaatz\u2019s alternative motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>new trial or to set aside the judgment\u2014opposed by K&amp;B Bakewell and the City (hereafter sometimes collectively respondents)\u2014were denied by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">On June 4, 2004, Kaatz filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of dismissal and from the order denying the alternative motions for new trial or to set aside the judgment. K&amp;B Bakewell filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, and the City joined in that motion. After considering Kaatz\u2019s opposition and K&amp;B Bakewell\u2019s reply, this court ordered that the dismissal motion be heard concurrently with the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">I. <em>Issues on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Kaatz contends that the court erred in dismissing the action. He asserts that the action was not brought under, and was thus not subject to, a 60-day statute of limitations specified in the validation statutes. Kaatz argues further that his appeal was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">EL <em>Timeliness of Notice of Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Because the timely filing of a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite for our review of this case <em>(Van Beurden Ins. Services, Inc. v. Customized Worldwide Weather Ins. Agency, Inc. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 51, 56 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 166, 931 P.2d 344]), we first address respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal. Here, the notice of appeal was filed on the 60th day after K&amp;B Bakewell mailed a notice of entry of judgment. Respondents contend that the notice of appeal was not timely filed because, pursuant to section 870(b), \u201cno appeal shall be allowed from any judgment entered pursuant to this chapter [9, sections 860 through 870] unless a notice of appeal is filed within 30 days after the notice of entry of the judgment.\u201d Kaatz responds that he is not challenging by appeal a \u201cjudgment entered pursuant to\u201d the validation statutes. Therefore (he asserts), his notice of appeal was timely filed under rule 2(a)(2) of the California Rules of Court, which specifies that the \u201c[n]ormal time\u201d for filing an appeal from a judgment is \u201c60 days after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document entitled \u2018Notice of Entry\u2019 of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">The motion to dismiss the appeal presents an interesting conundrum. Respondents assert that since the trial court concluded that the validation statutes applied to Kaatz\u2019s claims\u2014and, accordingly it dismissed the action\u2014 the judgment entered on the dismissal was clearly one \u201centered pursuant to\u201d the validation statutes. Therefore (they argue), the 30-day appeal period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>section 870(b) applies, and this court must dismiss the appeal without regard to its underlying merits. Thus, respondents urge that we must dismiss the appeal because the trial court ruled that the action was subject to the validation statutes, regardless of whether that conclusion was correct. Naturally, Kaatz argues that we must consider the underlying merits to determine whether the action was governed by the validation statutes before we may consider whether the notice of appeal was timely filed. We concur with Kaatz\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">We are directed to no authority squarely holding that where the trial court concludes that an action is one for which a special statute applies for purposes of calculating the timeliness of a notice of appeal\u2014and the appellant disputes that characterization of the action\u2014the appellate court must accept without question the lower court\u2019s conclusion. Nor do we find the absence of such authority surprising; the proposition respondents advance seemingly suggests an abdication of the appellate court\u2019s responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Respondents, however, urge that dismissal of the appeal here is supported by <em>Planning &amp; Conservation League v. Department of Water Resources </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 264 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 635, 949 P.2d 488] <em>(Planning &amp; Conservation League I), </em>a case in which the Supreme Court held that a notice of appeal based upon an appealable order under the validation statutes was untimely. There, the Supreme Court noted that the underlying facts and the merits of the dispute were not relevant to its determination of the timeliness of the appeal. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 267.) But in that case, there was no dispute between the parties that the underlying action <em>was </em>brought under the validation statutes. Instead, the court only addressed \u201cthe narrow procedural issue\u201d ( <em>ibid.) </em>of whether section 870(b) applied not only to judgments entered in validating proceedings, but to appealable orders as well. Thus, the court was not faced with the unusual procedural setting present here: an appeal from the dismissal of an action in which the plaintiff (Kaatz) did <em>not </em>invoke the validation statutes\u2014and one in which, parenthetically, the public agency defendant (City) only belatedly asserted the statutes\u2019 applicability\u2014but the trial court concluded that the action was subject to the validation statutes. <em>Planning &amp; Conservation League I </em>does not suggest dismissal of the appeal in this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Kaatz cites three cases that he contends support his position that we may consider the underlying merits of the appeal to decide whether the shortened appeal period of section 870(b) applies. (See <em>New Davidson Brick Co. </em>v. <em>County of Riverside </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1146 [266 Cal.Rptr. 432]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>Bliler v. City of San Diego </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 530 [132 Cal.Rptr. 185]; <em>Vogel v. City of Millbrae </em>(1959) 167 Cal.App.2d 403 [334 P.2d 620].) These cases have some bearing on our inquiry; in each of them, the appellate court examined the substance of the plaintiff\u2019s claims to determine whether the action was one that, in fact, invoked the statute that provided for a shortened appeal period. (See, e.g., <em>New Davidson Brick, supra, </em>at p. 1151.) But while they are somewhat supportive of our conclusion that, in resolving the motion to dismiss the appeal, we must consider whether the validation statutes apply to Kaatz\u2019s claims, these cases are by no means dispositive. In none of the cases did the trial court determine that the action was in fact subject to a statute that invoked a shortened appeal period. Thus, the appellate courts were not addressing the precise question here: Are we precluded from reviewing the trial court\u2019s specific finding that the case was subject to the validation statutes, thereby rendering applicable, ipse dixit, the shortened appeal period of section 870(b)?</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">We conclude that in order to determine the timeliness of the appeal notice, under the circumstances here, we must determine if the underlying action was, in fact, a proceeding under the validation statutes. This requires us, of necessity, to resolve the principal issue of the appeal itself. A contrary conclusion, we believe, would yield an anomalous and unjust result. It would preclude review on the merits of a trial court decision by having the appellate court assume the applicability of a statute providing for a shortened appeal period without regard to whether that assumption was correct. Our view that we must consider whether Kaatz\u2019s action was, in fact, subject to the validation statutes\u2014rather than agreeing blindly with the trial court on this point\u2014is consistent with \u201cthe well-established policy, based upon the remedial character of the right of appeal, of according that right in doubtful cases \u2018when such can be accomplished without doing violence to applicable rules.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hollister Convalescent Hosp., Inc. v. Rico </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 660, 674 [125 Cal.Rptr. 757, 542 P.2d 1349].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">We foreshadow the balance of our decision by summarily noting our conclusion below that the City\u2019s conduct challenged by Kaatz was <em>not </em>subject to the validation statutes. The 30-day appeal period under section 870(b) was therefore inapplicable. The appeal was filed within 60 days of the mailing by a party of the notice of entry of judgment as required by California Rules of Court, rule 2(a)(2). We thus deny respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>III. <em>The Order Dismissing the Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"AU\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Kaatz argues that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the action is subject to de novo review. Citing <em>McKay v. County of Riverside </em>(1959) 175 Cal.App.2d 247, 249 [345 P.2d 949], he asserts that when the dismissal motion challenged the pleadings, the order of dismissal should be treated on appeal as if it had been an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend. Of course, under well-settled principles, \u201c[t]he function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter of law, and it raises only a question of law. [Citations.] On a question of law, we apply a de novo standard of review on appeal. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1413, 1420 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 766].) Respondents do not discuss the applicable standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">It is settled that one method of asserting a challenge that an action was untimely filed under the validation statutes is by the method employed here, namely, a motion to dismiss. (See <em>Smith v. Mt. Diablo Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 412, 415 [128 Cal.Rptr. 572]; <em>Phillips v. Seely </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 104, 109 [117 Cal.Rptr. 863].) A defense that the statute of limitations bars a validation proceeding, however, may also be asserted by demurrer. (See <em>Meaney v. Sacramento Housing &amp; Redevelopment Agency </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 566, 572 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 589]; see also <em>Iverson, Yoakum, Papiano &amp; Hatch v. Berwald </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 990, 995 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 665] [complaint barred on its face by statute of limitations subject to general demurrer].) And \u201c[w]hether a statute of limitations applies ordinarily is a question of law.\u201d <em>(Embarcadero Mun. Improvement Dist. v. County of Santa Barbara </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 781, 789 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 6].)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">As we will discuss, the principal issue here is whether the matters alleged in Kaatz\u2019s second amended complaint were subject to the validation statutes, thereby rendering the 60-day statute of limitations provided in those statutes applicable. This issue, in turn, is resolved through interpreting Government Code section 53511 and the validation statutes. As such, the issue here is one of law requiring our independent review. <em>(Planning &amp; Conservation League v. Department of Water Resources </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 892, 906 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 173] <em>(Planning &amp; Conservation League II).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>We review the court\u2019s order dismissing Kaatz\u2019s action with the above standard of review in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">B. <em>K&amp;B Bakewell\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The essential position advanced in K&amp;B Bakewell\u2019s alternative motions to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings was that Kaatz\u2019s claims were based on a challenge to the validity of the LDA, executed in May 1998. The City\u2019s execution of the LDA was a \u201ccontract\u201d such that the City, as a local public agency, had the right to bring an action to determine the LDA\u2019s validity under former Government Code section 53511, and under the validation statutes. Therefore (K&amp;B Bakewell argued) Kaatz was required to have filed his complaint within 60 days of the LDA\u2019s execution in May 1998; Kaatz\u2019s action (filed in May 2003) was initiated nearly five years too late. As a fallback position, K&amp;B Bakewell argued that if the suit were construed simply as a challenge to the City\u2019s sale of the Property, it would nonetheless be time-barred; since the sale occurred in July 2002, Kaatz was required under sections 860 through 870 to have filed an action challenging the validity of the City\u2019s action no later than September 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">In opposing K&amp;B Bakewell\u2019s alternative motions, Kaatz argued that the LDA and subsequent deeding of the Property by the City were not the kinds of public agency actions that were governed by the validation procedures specified in sections 860 through 870. Accordingly (Kaatz asserted), the action was not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">In the court\u2019s lengthy ruling granting the motion to dismiss, it discussed the various authorities cited by the parties. It held that the validation procedures specified in the validation statutes applied to the City\u2019s challenged actions. The court\u2019s holding was based upon the following reasoning: (1) Unless contracts such as the LDA were subject to the validation statutes (i.e., allowing for a prompt determination of such contract\u2019s validity), the City\u2019s ability to operate financially would be substantially impaired; (2) significant third party financial interests were affected by the LDA, suggesting a need for prompt validation of the LDA; and (3) the LDA was a financing mechanism by which the City had acquired the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">C. <em>The Validation Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">The validation statutes provide a procedure by which a public agency may determine the validity of certain acts. The public agency may bring a validating proceeding in superior court within 60 days of \u201cthe existence of any matter which under any other law is authorized to be determined pursuant to [the validation statutes].\u201d (\u00a7 860.) Such an action is \u201cin the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>of a proceeding in rem.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>And where the public agency does not initiate a validating proceeding under section 860, \u201cany interested person may bring an action within the time and in the court specified by Section 860 to determine the validity of such matter.\u201d (\u00a7 863.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The interested person must bring a validating proceeding within 60 days: \u201cNo contest except by the public agency or its officer or agent of any thing or matter under this chapter shall be made other than within the time and the manner herein specified.\u201d (\u00a7 869.) Thus, insofar as section 863 provides that an interested person \u201cmay\u201d bring a validating proceeding, the statute \u201cseems innocuous enough ... section 869 says he <em>must </em>do so or be forever barred from contesting the validity of the agency\u2019s action in a court of law.\u201d <em>(City of Ontario </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 335, 341 [85 Cal.Rptr. 149, 466 P.2d 693] <em>(City of Ontario).)</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Hence, under the validation statutes, the public agency may initiate a proceeding to establish the validity of its act. Alternatively, the agency may do nothing, in which case the act will become immune from attack if no interested person brings a proceeding to establish the act\u2019s validity or invalidity within 60 days. (See <em>Friedland </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 835, 850-851 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 427] <em>(Friedland) </em>[validation statutes permit the public agency to validate its action by doing nothing and without giving notice, but agency may choose \u201cthe more responsible first alternative\u201d of filing a validation proceeding].) As the Supreme Court has observed: \u201c[A]n agency may indirectly but effectively \u2018validate\u2019 its action <em>by doing nothing to validate if, </em>unless an \u2018interested person\u2019 brings an action of his own under section 863 within the 60-day period, the agency\u2019s action will become immune from attack whether it is legally valid or not. . . . Thus a statute which begins by providing a remedy to be pursued by public agencies, . . . concludes by making it unnecessary for such agencies to do anything at all, and the incidental or derivative remedy of an \u2018interested person\u2019 turns out to be controlling. This is truly a case of the tail wagging the dog.\u201d <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at pp. 341-342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The validation statutes do \u201cnot specify the matters to which [they] appl[y]; rather, [their] procedures apply to \u2018any matter which under any other law is authorized to be determined pursuant to this chapter.\u2019 (\u00a7 860.)\u201d <em>(Planning &amp; Conservation League I, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 268-269.) Thus, we look to other statutes to determine the scope of public agency actions that are subject to validation under the validation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">One statutory source is Government Code section 53511\u2014the statute under which Kaatz (respondents contend) was required to bring a timely validating proceeding here. Government Code section 53511 (now subdivision (a)) provides: \u201cA local agency may bring an action to determine the validity of its bonds, warrants, contracts, obligations or evidences of indebtedness pursuant to [the validation statutes].\u201d (See also <em>Planning &amp; Conservation League I, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 269.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">There are numerous other statutes that provide for the validation of public agency actions by reference to the validation statutes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For instance, a validation action may be brought under Government Code section 56103<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to determine the validity of a proposed annexation of territory under the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 56000 et seq.). (See <em>Embarcadero Mun. Improvement Dist. v. County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 789; <em>Hills for Everyone </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 461, 465 &amp; fn. 4 [164 Cal.Rptr. 420] [validation proceeding authorized under former Gov. Code, \u00a7 35005].) Likewise, Health and Safety Code section 33501, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> authorizes a proceeding under the validation statutes to determine the validity of establishing a local redevelopment agency, a redevelopment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>project, or bonds to be furnished in conjunction with such a project. (See <em>Sweetwater Valley Civic Assn. v. City of National City </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 270, 276 [133 Cal.Rptr. 859, 555 P.2d 1099]; <em>Bernardi v.

And under Water Code section 50440,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> a validation action may be brought to determine the validity of the organization of an irrigation district. (See <em>Clark\u2019s Fork Reclamation Dist. v. Johns </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 366, 367 [66 Cal.Rptr. 370].)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">D. <em>Applicability of Validation Statutes to Second Amended Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">1. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The fundamental question on appeal is whether the City\u2019s actions that were challenged in the second amended complaint were matters that were subject to the validation statutes. More specifically, the issue is whether the City could have brought a validating proceeding concerning the execution of the LDA and the sale of the Property to K&amp;B Bakewell\u2014and thus Kaatz, as an \u201cinterested person\u201d (\u00a7 863), was required to do so by filing suit within 60 days. If the City\u2019s conduct was embraced by the language of Government Code section 53511, permitting the public agency to \u201cbring an action to determine the validity of its bonds, warrants, contracts, obligations or evidences of indebtedness pursuant to [the validation statutes],\u201d then dismissal of the action was proper. The trial court itself acknowledged that this question was not easily resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">We begin our analysis by noting two points on which there is no disagreement. Kaatz and respondents concur that not all public agency contracts are within the scope of Government Code section 53511, i.e., not all such contracts are subject to the validation statutes. Indeed, as discussed <em>post, </em>our Supreme Court made this point clear more than 30 years ago. (See <em>City of Ontario, supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 343-344.) For instance, a county contract retaining an attorney to provide legal services to indigent persons is \u201cnot the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>kind of financial obligation contemplated to be automatically validated absent a challenge within the 60 days proscribed in sections 860 and 863.\u201d <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>Seely, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d 104, 112.) Similarly, in <em>Smith v. Mt. Diablo Unified Sch. Dist., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.3d 412, 421, the court held that a taxpayers\u2019 suit challenging the validity of a school district\u2019s contract to acquire a computer was not subject to the validation statutes. (See also <em>Walters </em>v. <em>County of Plumas </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 460 [132 Cal.Rptr. 174] (Walters) [action challenging award of franchises for collection and disposal of solid waste not subject to validation statutes].)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Second\u2014although not expressly admitted by the parties\u2014there are no cases on point that have considered whether the kinds of contracts involved here (i.e., the LDA and the conveyance of the Property to K&amp;B Bakewell) are the types of public contracts that are subject to validation under Government Code section 53511. Specifically, no case has addressed whether an agreement calling for a public agency\u2019s purchase and immediate resale of real property to a private party where the source of the funds for the agency\u2019s acquisition is the third party purchaser\u2014a double-escrow transaction\u2014is subject to the validation statutes. Moreover, no case has held generally that a public agency contract to acquire or sell real property is (or is not) a \u201ccontract\u201d under Government Code section 53511.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Beyond these two undisputed points, the parties offer radically differing viewpoints on the scope of the word \u201ccontracts\u201d in Government Code section 53511, as that issue bears upon whether the City\u2019s actions here were subject to the validation statutes. Because it contains our high court\u2019s most comprehensive discussion of the validation statutes, we review <em>City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 335, in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">2. City of Ontario v. Superior Court</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">In <em>City of Ontario </em>taxpayers challenged a plan for the financing of a motor raceway that included (1) the issuance and sale by a nonprofit entity formed by the City of Ontario (Ontario) of $25,500,000 in tax-exempt bonds without voter approval, (2) the award of a contract to a private party without competitive bidding for the construction of the raceway for $12,500,000, and (3) the lease of the raceway for 50 years by the nonprofit, entity to a for-profit entity that would run the facility as a private business venture. <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 338.) The plaintiffs\u2019 essential claims were that the plan promoted a private commercial enterprise without any public benefit <em>(id. </em>at pp. 338-339) and was an unconstitutional \u201cgift of public funds or lending public credit for private purposes (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 25).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 339.) After filing an answer, Ontario moved to dismiss the complaint because the plaintiffs failed to comply with particular requirements for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>service of summons under the validation statutes. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The trial court denied the motion, impliedly finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were governed by the validation statutes but holding that the plaintiffs had shown good cause for failing to comply with the summons requirements. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Ontario brought a writ of prohibition contending that the trial court had abused its discretion in denying the motion to dismiss, a position the Supreme Court rejected. <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at pp. 345-348.) In the course of determining that the trial court had not abused its discretion, the Supreme Court provided an extensive discussion of the validation statutes which is relevant to the present appeal.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u201c[S]ections 860 through 870 . . . were first enacted in 1961. The legislation was proposed by the Judicial Council, which explained that it had been \u2018concerned for some years with the numerous statutes providing periods within which appeals may be taken at variance with the time for notice of appeal contained in the Rules on Appeal.\u2019 [Citation.] In particular, the Council pointed to numerous scattered statutes authorizing actions by cities, counties, and public agencies to establish the validity of their bonds or assessments or the legality of their existence, and providing special procedures for appeals in such cases.\u201d <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 340.) Thus, as the high court explained the historical context 28 years later, the validation statutes were \u201cfirst enacted in 1961, with the purpose of consolidating and harmonizing the various existing statutes providing special procedures for actions by cities, counties and public agencies to establish the validity of their bonds and assessments.\u201d <em>(Planning &amp; Conservation League I, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 268-269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Government Code sections 53510 and 53511 were enacted in 1963, two years after the enactment of the validation statutes. (Stats. 1963, ch. 2118, \u00a7 1, p. 4404.) Ontario argued that the use of the term \u201ccontracts\u201d in Government Code section 53511 suggested that the validation statutes applied to <em>any </em>public agency contract. <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 341.) While conceding that the challenged raceway agreement facially appeared to be embraced by Government Code section 53511 because there was \u201cno limitation or qualification on the word \u2018contracts\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>at p. 343), the Supreme Court did not end its inquiry at that juncture. Instead, it concluded that a closer examination of Government Code section 53511 suggested a much narrower construction of \u201ccontracts\u201d for at least four reasons: \u201cFirst, the Legislative Counsel\u2019s digest.. . characterized the measure as one allowing \u2018a local agency to bring an action to determine the validity of evidences of indebtedness.\u2019 Second, \u201csection 53511 was enacted as part of chapter 3 of part 1, division 2, title 5, of the Government Code. Chapter 3 is entitled \u2018Bonds,\u2019 and deals exclusively with the power of local agencies to sell their bonds, replace defaced or lost bonds, and pledge their revenues to pay or secure such bonds. If [Government Code] section 53511 was intended to be a provision of general application, logically it should have been placed in article 4 (\u2018Miscellaneous\u2019) of chapter 1 (\u2018General\u2019) of the same part, in which a group of such unrelated matters are collected. Third, the key language of [Government Code] section 53511\u2014\u2018bonds, warrants, contracts, obligations or evidences of indebtedness\u2019\u2014was taken directly from [Code of Civil Procedure] section 864 of Chapter <em>9; </em>under well-known canons of statutory interpretation, it should ordinarily be given the same meaning as it had in the earlier statute. But as a perusal of the companion 1961 legislation reveals, when [the validation statutes were] adopted [they were] made applicable only to such matters as the legality of the local entity\u2019s existence, the validity of its bonds and assessments, and the validity of joint financing agreements with other agencies. If [Government Code] section 53511 was intended to reach any and all contracts into which an agency may lawfully enter, the restricted language of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 864 was inappropriate for that purpose. Finally, that language is peculiarly inapt for expressing such a general meaning in any event, as it lists the word \u2018contracts\u2019 in the midst of four other terms which all deal with the limited topic of a local agency\u2019s financial obligations.\u201d <em>{City of Ontario, supra, </em>at pp. 343-344.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In addition, the Supreme Court suggested that there were policy reasons for construing \u201ccontracts\u201d in Government Code section 53511 more narrowly. In <em>City of Ontario, </em>the court noted that a sweeping interpretation of the term \u201ccontracts\u201d in that statute and the concomitant application of an abbreviated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>60-day statute of limitations for potential challenges to virtually any governmental actions would unduly burden taxpayers presenting such challenges. <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">As we will discuss, the legislative history and statutory construction of Government Code section 53511 elucidated in <em>City of Ontario </em>doom respondents\u2019 arguments that the challenged actions of the City were subject to the validation statutes. Accordingly, we will conclude that the court below erred in holding that the 60-day statute of limitations applicable for validating proceedings barred Kaatz\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">3. <em>Inapplicability of validation statutes to Kaatz\u2019s claims </em>a. <em>statutory construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">We begin our analysis by noting that in statutory interpretation, \u201cwhere the language is clear, its plain meaning should be followed. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Great Lakes Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of El Segundo </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 152, 155 [137 Cal.Rptr. 154, 561 P.2d 244].) Thus, \u201c[i]f the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the Legislature\u201d to interpret the statute. <em>(Lungren v. Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) \u201cBut [this] \u2018plain meaning\u2019 rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Here, the parties have radically opposing views on the meaning of the term \u201ccontracts\u201d in Government Code section 53511. They agree, however, that \u201ccontracts\u201d cannot be interpreted to mean that <em>all </em>public agency contracts are subject to the validation statutes. And the Supreme Court noted that while a superficial reading of the statute suggested a broad interpretation of the unqualified term \u201ccontracts\u201d <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 343), a much narrower construction of the term was evoked upon closer examination <em>(id. </em>at pp. 343-344). Clearly, the \u201cplain meaning\u201d rule does not apply and we are constrained to interpret Government Code section 53511 by reference to legislative intent and any other applicable rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">It is a \u201cfundamental rule that a court \u2018should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Moyer v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230-231 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224]; see also <em>In re Rojas </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 152, 155 [151 Cal.Rptr. 649, 588 P.2d 789].) That intent may be revealed from a review of \u201c[b]oth the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323] <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc.).) </em>\u201cThe words of the statute must be construed in context, keeping in mind the statutory purpose, and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible.

Fierro </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 173, 262 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 821 P.2d 1302], fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And in the case of uncertainty, the court should consider \u201cthe consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.

Accordingly, we deem\u2014as (we infer) the Supreme Court did in <em>City of </em>Ontario\u2014\u201cthe wider historical circumstances of [Government Code section 53511\u2019s] enactment\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1387) to include the legislative history and intent of the validation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">In the context of enacting the validation statutes, the Judicial Council had been concerned about the existence of \u201cnumerous scattered statutes authorizing actions by cities, counties, and public agencies to establish the validity of their bonds or assessments or the legality of their existence, and providing special procedures for appeals in such cases.\u201d <em>(City of Ontario, supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d at p. 340; see also <em>Planning &amp; Conservation League I, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 268-269.) This focus is borne out by identifying the statutes specifically addressed by the validation statutes. Laws that predated the validation statutes that were, in 1961, either amended or were repealed and replaced to make specific reference to the validation statutes typically pertained to actions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>test the validity of (1) bonds;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (2) assessments;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (3) assessments or warrants;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> or (4) the existence of a governmental district or agency.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Likewise, the validation statutes\u2019 relationship to proceedings to test \u201cthe validity of [public agencies\u2019] bonds or assessments or the legality of their existence\u201d <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 340) was reaffirmed in post-1961 legislation that incorporated the procedures of the validation statutes. Those later statutes by and large concerned the validation of (1) bonds;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> (2) assessments;<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> or (3) the creation of districts <footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Moreover, the legislative history of amendments to the validation statutes\u2014cited by the Supreme Court in <em>Planning &amp; Conservation League I, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 264\u2014emphasizes that the focal point of the validation statutes was to ensure the ability of public agencies to obtain the timely validation of their bonds. Section 870 was amended in 1985 to add subdivision (b) to provide for an across-the-board 60-day appeal period. (Stats. 1985, ch. 229, \u00a7 1, p. 1243.) This amendment thereby eliminated the possibility that an appeal made more than 60 days after entry of judgment in a validating proceeding could be deemed timely. <em>(Planning &amp; Conservation League I, supra, </em>at p. 271.) As explained by the high court: \u201cThe 1985 amendment (Sen. Bill No. 479) had a simple purpose: \u2018to clarify the time within which an appeal may be taken in a validation proceeding, and thus accelerate the finality of these proceedings.\u2019 [Citation.] The Senate committee analysis noted that <em>validation actions are most commonly used to secure a judicial determination that a government entity\u2019s proposed issuance of bonds is valid. </em>The possibility of an appeal from the judgment validating the issue, together with [California Rules of Court,] rule 2(a)\u2019s allowance of an appeal within 180 days from entry of judgment if no notice is served or mailed, resulted in a lengthy period of uncertainty, during which underwriters and counsel often felt compelled to wait before issuing the bonds. [Citation.] The amendment to section 870 was proposed in order to \u2018reduce the period of \u201cuncertainty\u201d \u2019 created by application of rule 2(a) to validation actions. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 271-272, italics added.) Additionally, the 1994 amendment to section 870 (Stats. 1994, ch. 242, \u00a7 1, p. 1832) shortening further the appeal period under the validations statutes to \u201c30 days after the notice of entry of the judgment, or, within 30 days after the entry of the judgment if there is no answering party\u201d (\u00a7 870, subd. (b)) was characterized at the time by the state Department of Finance as \u201c \u2018reducing] the time it takes to get bond approval and proceed to market.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Planning &amp; Conservation League I, supra, </em>at pp. 272-273; see also <em>ibid, </em>[holding that appealable order from validation proceeding was governed by same 30-day appeal period under \u00a7 870, subd. (b), because a contrary holding would result in \u201cuncertainty that could affect the confidence of others (e.g., bond buyers) in the finality of the validation action\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>c. <em>Government Code section 53511</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">We have considered the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of Government Code section 53511 based upon legislative history and other rules of interpretation. (See <em>City of </em>Ontario, supra, 2 Cal.3d at pp. 341-344.) In sum, the court identified four factors that suggested that the word \u201ccontracts\u201d in the statute should be construed more narrowly than a reading that would make virtually all public agency contracts subject to the validation statutes: (1) the characterization of the proposed statute in the Legislative Counsel\u2019s digest as permitting \u201c \u2018a local agency to bring an action to determine the validity of evidences of indebtedness\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 343); (2) the statute\u2019s placement as part of chapter 3 (entitled \u201cBonds\u201d) of part 1, division 2, title 5 of the Government Code (ibid.); (3) the fact that the relevant language of the statute (\u201cbonds, warrants, contracts, obligations, or evidences of indebtedness\u201d) was borrowed from section 864 of the validation statutes, requiring that it be given the same meaning that it had in the earlier statute, i.e., the validation statutes were \u201cmade applicable only to such matters as the legality of the local entity\u2019s existence, the validity of its bonds and assessments, and the validity of joint financing agreements with other agencies\u201d <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>at p. 343); and (4) the use of \u201ccontracts\u201d surrounded by four limited-topic terms made it \u201cpeculiarly inapt for expressing such a general meaning\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 344).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">This fourth factor appears to be an application of the <em>noscitur a sociis </em>rule of construction. <em>\u201cNoscitur a sociis </em>(\u2018it is known by its associates\u2019) is the principle that \u2018 \u201c \u2018the meaning of a word may be enlarged or restrained by reference to the object of the whole clause in which it is used.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Texas Commerce Bank v. Garamendi </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 460, 471, fn. 3 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 854].) In other words, \u201ca word takes meaning from the company it keeps.\u201d <em>(People v. Drennan </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1349, 1355 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 584].) \u201c \u2018In accordance with this principle of construction, a court will adopt a restrictive meaning of a listed item if acceptance of a more expansive meaning would make other items in the list unnecessary or redundant, or would otherwise make the item markedly dissimilar to the other items in the list.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Lungren </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 294, 307 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 855, 926 P.2d 1042].) Here, we agree with the court in <em>City of Ontario </em>that a narrower meaning of \u201ccontracts\u201d is appropriate, in part because adopting a more expansive meaning would \u201cmake the [term] markedly dissimilar to the other items,\u201d namely, \u201cbonds, warrants, . . . obligations or evidences of indebtedness\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 53511, subd. (b); see, e.g., <em>English </em>v. <em>IKON Business Solutions, Inc. </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 145-146 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 93] [applying <em>noscitur a sociis </em>to give narrow meaning to term \u201cdismissal\u201d in context of mandatory provisions affording party relief from default, default judgment, or dismissal under section 473, subd. (b)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>We also deem it of some significance that, since <em>City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.Sd 335, was decided in 1970, the Legislature has not acted to modify in any way Government Code section 53511 to give a more expansive definition of the term \u201ccontracts\u201d than its construction by the Supreme Court. (See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Capital Growth Investors XIV </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142, 1155 [278 Cal.Rptr. 614, 805 R2d 873] [Supreme Court \u201cgenerally presume[s] the Legislature is aware of appellate court decisions\u201d].) Furthermore, the Legislature <em>has </em>amended Government Code section 53511 since 1970. In 2004, it added subdivision (b) to the statute but did not change the original text of the statute other than to insert subdivision (a) immediately before it. (Stats. 2004, ch. 470, \u00a7 3.) This fact suggests that the Legislature had no quarrel with <em>City of Ontario\u2019s </em>restrictive interpretation of the term \u201ccontracts.\u201d (See <em>Marina Point, Ltd. v. Wolfson </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 721, 734 [180 Cal.Rptr. 496, 640 P.2d 115] \u201c[W]hen the Legislature amends a statute without altering portions of the provision that have previously been judicially construed, the Legislature is presumed to have been aware of and to have acquiesced in the previous judicial construction.\u201d].) Furthermore, in the Legislature\u2019s addition of subsection (b) of Government Code section 53511, it repeated the same language in the original statute that is at issue here, i.e., \u201cbonds, warrants, contracts . . . .\u201d (See fn. 18, <em>ante.) </em>This fact further suggests the Legislature\u2019s concurrence with <em>City of Ontario\u2019s </em>earlier interpretation of the statute and, in particular, its interpretation of the term \u201ccontracts.\u201d (See <em>City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>Payne </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 184, 191 [44 P.2d 305] [\u201cIt is a well-recognized rule of construction that after the courts have construed the meaning of any particular word, or expression, and the legislature subsequently undertakes to use these exact words in the same connection, the presumption is almost irresistible that it used them in the precise and technical sense which had been placed upon them by the courts.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Moreover, it is clear that the Legislature knows how to draft language that clearly provides a broad scope for matters embraced by the validation statutes. (See generally <em>Dyna-Med, Inc., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1395 [rejecting construction of statute as authorizing Fair Employment and Housing Commission to award punitive damages, where review of other statutes disclosed that \u201cwhen the Legislature intends to authorize an agency to award damages for discrimination, it does so expressly\u201d].) For example, a number of statutes expressly provide for proceedings under the validation statutes to validate <em>any </em>action by the public agency. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 26170.20, 55855; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2006, 9006, 13806; Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 5780.9.) Likewise, various statutes refer to the validation statutes to permit proceedings to determine the validity of <em>any </em>contract. (See, e.g., Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 20434; Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 22670, 35855, 50979, 71752, 81442, 81662; Wat. Code Appen., \u00a7\u00a7 52-39, 64-64, 98-64, 100-19.5, 101-19.5, 112-19.5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>114-163, 118-412, 127-51.) And, significantly, some of the statutes authorizing the testing of \u201cany contract\u201d by an action brought pursuant to the validation statutes were enacted before the 1963 enactment of Government Code section 53511. (See Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 35855, 50979; Wat. Code Appen., \u00a7\u00a7 98-64, 100-19.5, 101-19.5.)<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">It is therefore clear that \u201ccontracts\u201d under Government Code section 53511 should be assigned a restricted meaning. Rather than authorizing proceedings to validate any public agency contract\u2014or even any contract constituting a financial obligation of a public agency<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>\u2014the \u201ccontracts\u201d under Government Code section 53511 are only those that are in the nature of, or directly relate to a public agency\u2019s bonds, warrants or other evidences of indebtedness. We next examine whether, in light of this restricted meaning, the City\u2019s execution of the LDA was an action embraced by Government Code section 53511.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">d. <em>the LDA and the validation statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The LDA bears no relationship to the issuance of bonds. No bonds were issued or contemplated in connection with the proposed transaction under which the City would acquire Hayes Park and then resell it to K&amp;B Bakewell. Likewise, the LDA does not relate to warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">We conclude further that the LDA neither constituted nor related to \u201cevidenceQ of [public agency] indebtedness.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 53511.) In the context of the validation statutes, the LDA did not represent a transaction in which the City borrowed funds for a specific purpose (i.e., the acquisition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the Property). The LDA did not memorialize or otherwise describe an indebtedness incurred by the City. And we reject respondents\u2019 contention to the contrary. In essence, respondents assert that because the City was not itself directly providing the funds for purchasing the Property\u2014but instead was using a portion of the funds provided by K&amp;B Bakewell in exchange for the City\u2019s subsequent, immediate resale of the Property\u2014the LDA was a \u201cfinancing mechanism\u201d that was subject to the validation statutes. But neither the LDA nor the resolution authorizing its execution spoke in terms of loaning funds or otherwise providing money to the City for its acquisition of the Property. We believe that treating the LDA as a financing agreement would be an unnatural characterization of the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Respondents raise several additional arguments that the LDA was subject to a validating proceeding. First, they contend that the Supreme Court distinguished between \u201croutine\u201d or \u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d public agency contracts that are not subject to the validation statutes, and those contracts that \u201cembody important policy decisions affecting the public at large.\u201d <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 341.) Respondents argue that because the LDA fell into the second category, it was governed by the validation statutes. <em>City of Ontario, </em>however, does not establish such a bright-line test. A careful reading of the case discloses that the passage relied on by respondents was meant as an illustration of the breadth of public agency actions accomplished by contract, not as a statement that agency contracts are subject to the validation statutes if they \u201cembody important policy decisions affecting the public at large.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 341.) Further, as seen from our discussion, <em>ante, </em>nothing in the legislative history of either the validation statutes or Government Code section 53511 suggests that the Legislature intended to provide for validation of public agency contracts where they were \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201caffect[ed] the public at large.\u201d Moreover, we believe such a \u201ctest\u201d would create an unworkable formula for determining whether an agency contract was subject to validation.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Second, respondents assert that the LDA was subject to the validation statutes because it was of such significance that \u201cthe lack of a prompt validating procedure [would] impair the public agency\u2019s ability to operate.\u201d <em>(Walters, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d at p. 468; see also <em>Graydon </em>v. <em>Pasadena Redevelopment Agency </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 631, 644-645 [164 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>56] (Graydon).) And they argue further that the absence of proceedings under the validation statutes here would \u201cimpair a public agency\u2019s ability to operate financially.\u201d <em>{Friedland, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th 835, 843.)<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> But while having a prompt validating procedure to permit a public agency to operate without impairment may be a significant rationale for the validation statutes\u2019 application to agency action as provided in the statutes (e.g., the issuance of bonds), this rationale should not be transformed into a test for determining the type of agency action encompassed by Government Code section 53511 and the validation statutes. Nothing in either <em>City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 335, or the legislative history suggests that Government Code section 53511 should be construed to mean that contracts or obligations are governed by the validation statutes if a contrary conclusion would result in the impairment of the public agency\u2019s ability to operate (or to operate financially). Such a proposed standard is unsupported by either the legislative history of the statute or the intent of the Legislature. It is moreover a nebulous test, the application of which would result in uncertainty and inconsistent results based upon the extent to which individual judges might view a public agency\u2019s ability to operate in a particular instance as impaired or not impaired by the absence of a validating proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Third, respondents argue that because the LDA concerned the City\u2019s financial transaction with a third party, K&amp;B Bakewell, it was thus subject to the validation statutes.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The genesis of this argument is apparently a statement in <em>Walters, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d 460. Immediately following its reference to \u201cimpair[ment of] the public agency\u2019s ability to operate\u201d (discussed, <em>ante), </em>the court noted: \u201cWe feel that the possibility of future litigation is very likely to have a chilling effect upon potential third party lenders.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 468; see also <em>Friedland, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th at p. 843 [one objective of validation statutes \u201cis to facilitate a public agency\u2019s financial transactions with third parties by quickly affirming their legality\u201d].) But if this were the standard, then <em>any </em>financial transaction between a public agency and a third party would be subject to the validation statutes, a proposition that is simply not true. (See fn. 35, <em>ante, </em>and cases cited therein.) And the extent to which the nonapplication of the validation statutes may have a chilling effect upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>third party to a transaction with a public entity is not a standard for determining whether the public agency action is, in fact, of the type that is covered by the validation statutes and Government Code section 53511. As is true of the other so-called tests advanced by respondents that we have discussed and rejected, the \u201cchilling effect\u201d standard is unsupported by statutory construction and is an impracticable formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Moreover, the authorities upon which respondents rely do not suggest a different conclusion. For instance, in <em>Graydon, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.3d at page 634\u2014which K&amp;B Bakewell claimed at oral argument to be the principal case supporting its position\u2014the Pasadena Redevelopment Agency sold approximately $58 million in tax allocation bonds to finance the public cost of a retail shopping development, which included buildings and parking garages (one subterranean and two above ground). The <em>Graydon </em>plaintiffs challenged a component of that project, namely, the award and execution by the agency of a contract (valued at approximately $12 million) for construction of the subterranean garage, claiming that it was illegal because it was awarded without competitive bidding. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 634-635.) The appellate court held that the action was subject to the validation statutes because, while it may not have been a direct challenge to the agency\u2019s issuance of bonds to fund the project, the subterranean garage contract was \u201can integral part of the whole method of financing the public costs associated with the retail center. The financing is by bonds issued by the Agency.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 645.) Thus, the public agency action being challenged indirectly in <em>Graydon </em>was a public financing arrangement: \u201cThese bonds were intimately and inextricably bound up with the award of this contract [to construct the subterranean garage].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 646.) The case before us involves no such challenge (direct or indirect) to a public financing arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">In <em>Walters, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d 460, the court concluded that the claims challenging the bidding and awarding of franchises for the collection and disposal of solid waste were not subject to the validation statutes. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 468.) But it held that the validation statutes were applicable to the plaintiff\u2019s claim challenging the county\u2019s guaranty of the third party franchisees\u2019 respective payment obligations for the purchase of heavy equipment. <em>(Walters, supra, </em>at pp. 468-469.) Thus, <em>Walters </em>is likewise factually distinguishable. Unlike Kaatz\u2019s claims, the claim in <em>Walters </em>that was subject to the validation statutes did, in fact, concern a direct commitment of public funds for a project, namely, the guarantee of third party obligations. And while respondents argue that the holding in <em>Walters </em>supports a broad application of Government Code section 53511\u2014enunciating a standard based on whether the \u201clack of a prompt validating procedure will impair the public agency\u2019s ability to operate\u201d <em>(Walters, supra, </em>at p. 468)\u2014we have previously rejected that assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Moreover, we disagree that respondents\u2019 position is supported by <em>Friedland, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th 835, a case that concerned bonds and a substantial commitment of public funds relating to their issuance. In <em>Friedland, </em>an aquarium project was being financed by the issuance of a nonprofit corporation\u2019s revenue bonds in the amount of $130 million. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 838.) The project included pledges of designated funds by two public agencies as security for payment of the debt service on the bonds. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 839.) Following the entry of judgment on a validation action brought by the entities to validate (among other actions) the pledges, the plaintiffs brought suit to invalidate the public actions. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court held that the pledges of public funds were proper subjects of the prior validation proceeding <em>(id. </em>at p. 845) and rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, notwithstanding the 60-day statute of limitations under the validation statutes, they could raise constitutional challenges at any time <em>(id. </em>at pp. 846-847).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Here, unlike <em>Friedland, </em>there was neither a pledge of public funds nor a project involving bonds. And there was no prior action filed by the City to validate its execution of the LDA. To the contrary, as Kaatz argues, there is no evidence that the City\u2014at any time prior to joining in K&amp;B Bakewell\u2019s motion to dismiss (more than six months after Kaatz filed suit)\u2014ever believed that the LDA was subject to the validation statutes. There was no reference to potential validating proceedings in the 34-page LDA. Nor did the City raise the issue of the alleged failure to bring a timely validating proceeding in its opposition to Kaatz\u2019s application for preliminary injunction, or in its answer to the complaint. Thus, <em>Friedland, supra, 62 </em>Cal.App.4th 835, involved very different circumstances\u2014a clear, substantial commitment of public funds as security for the issuance of bonds that had been the subject of prior validating proceedings\u2014than the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Furthermore, we reject the City\u2019s claim that, based on language found in <em>Friedland, </em>62 Cal.App.4th at page 843, public agency contracts under Government Code section 53511 are subject to the validation statutes if they are \u201ccontracts involving financing and financial obligations.\u201d Nothing in <em>Friedland </em>suggests that by \u201cfinancial obligations,\u201d the court meant that <em>any </em>financial obligation incurred by a public agency is subject to the validation statutes. Such a suggestion would be unfounded since, as we have discussed (see fn. 35, <em>ante), </em>not all contracts that involve financial commitments by the agency are covered under the validation statutes. (See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Seely, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d at p. 112.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Lastly, K&amp;B Bakewell cites <em>Planning &amp; Conservation League II, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th 892, in support of its claim that the <em>term </em>\u201ccontracts\u201d in Government Code section 53511 should be read broadly to include the LDA. K&amp;B Bakewell argues that the term \u201ccontracts\u201d is not limited to public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>agency financing issues because those involved in <em>Planning &amp; Conservation League II </em>were long-term contracts affecting water supply and distribution in the state\u2014where \u201c[financing was not the issue . . . [but the contracts clearly involved] issue[s] of widespread public importance.\u201d But in that case, the controversy on appeal did not concern whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were subject to the validation statutes. Rather, the primary issues concerned whether the state Department of Water Resources had abdicated its statutory duty to serve as the lead agency in preparing the environmental impact report (EIR), and whether the trial court had erred in finding the EIR to have been sufficient. A secondary issue concerned whether the trial court had erred in granting summary adjudication of the validation cause of action on the basis that previously dismissed defendants were indispensable parties. The appellate court concluded that this ruling was error because an action pursuant to the validation statutes is an in rem proceeding. <em>(Planning &amp; Conservation League II, supra, </em>at pp. 921, 924\u2014926.)<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> No issue was raised by the parties or addressed by the court concerning whether the public agency action challenged by the plaintiffs was a proper subject for validation. Therefore, <em>Planning &amp; Conservation League II, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th 892, offers no support for respondents\u2019 contention that the LDA was subject to the validation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">e. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the City\u2019s conduct challenged in this action\u2014the execution of the LDA and the City\u2019s subsequent conveyance of the Property to K&amp;B Bakewell pursuant to that agreement\u2014were not matters embraced by the validation statutes and Government Code section 53511. In so concluding, we note that there are competing policy considerations. On the one hand, respondents, as well as amici curiae,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> argue that important matters such as a public agency\u2019s acquisition and subsequent resale of a large tract of land should be the subject of prompt final resolution by application of the validation statutes. Among the concerns is the risk that, absent the mechanism of prompt resolution that a validating proceeding provides, third parties such as developer K&amp;B Bakewell would be unwilling to enter into a transaction such as the LDA here. Irrespective of this policy concern\u2014and without offering an opinion here on its importance\u2014we will not rewrite or interpret the validation statutes and Government Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>section 53511 in a manner inconsistent with legislative history or intent, or in a way that is contrary to the rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We are also mindful of the competing policy concern militating against broad application of the validation statutes to render public agency actions incontestable. As the Supreme Court expressed in response to the potential application of Government Code section 53511 to all public agency \u201ccontracts\u201d: \u201c[I]f [Ontario\u2019s] construction of the word \u2018contract\u2019 is correct, virtually every taxpayer has become an \u2018interested person\u2019 with regard to virtually every action of a local public agency. It is unreasonable to assume that the members of such a large and amorphous group are likely to have prompt notice of each agency action affecting them. Yet whether such a person has such notice or not, he is given only 60 days in which (1) to discover the existence, scope and effect of the agency\u2019s action, (2) to reach a conclusion as to its validity, (3) to determine whether the agency has instituted a validating proceeding or imminently intends to do so, and (4) if not, to prepare and file a proceeding of his own. In an age of increasingly complex government, this seems a heavy burden to impose on the vigilant taxpayer.\u201d <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 342.) We thus decline to interpret the validation statutes broadly insofar as they impose an abbreviated statute of limitations upon challenges to public agency actions, where the Legislature has not intended to do so. (See <em>Norgart v. Upjohn Co. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 396 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 453, 981 P.2d 79] [\u201cTo establish any particular limitations period under any particular statute of limitations entails the striking of a balance between the two [public policies of applying time limits for filing actions to promote repose and the countervailing policy of having matters decided on their merits].

Such a construction would yield the conclusion that \u201ccontracts\u201d under Government Code section 53511 would even include agency contracts previously held to not be subject to the validation act. (See, e.g., <em>Walters, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d 460 [franchises for collection and disposal of solid waste]; <em>Smith v. Mt. Diablo Unified Sch.

Thus, just as the term \u201ccontracts\u201d must be interpreted by reference to the four other terms in Government Code section 53511 surrounding it, so must the term \u201cobligations\u201d be so construed to give it a more restrictive meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Arguing against the proposition that the applicability of the validation statutes to public agency contracts is determined by whether they are \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201caffect[] the public at large\u201d <em>(City of Ontario, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 341), Kaatz relies extensively on a recent decision of the Third District Court of Appeal for which review was subsequently granted by the Supreme Court. <em>(In re Bay-Delta Programmatic Environmental Impact Report Coordinated Proceedings </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 154 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 696], review granted <em>sub. nom.
