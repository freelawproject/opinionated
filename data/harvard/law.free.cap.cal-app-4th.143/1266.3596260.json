At all relevant times, Roussey was over 65 years old and qualified as an \u201celder adult\u201d pursuant to Penal Code section 368, subdivision (g). Based on these transactions, defendant was convicted of theft against an elder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 368, subd. (d)) (count 1) and grand theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. (a)) (count 2). As to each count, the jury found true an enhancement allegation that defendant took property of a value exceeding $150,000 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.6, subd. (a)(2)). Defendant challenges these convictions on numerous grounds. In the one challenge we find dispositive, defendant argues the trial court erred by instructing the jury that Roussey\u2019s apparent consent to the transactions was ineffective if obtained by the exercise of undue influence. The court adopted the Civil Code definition of undue influence and informed the jury that \u201cundue influence exists where a defendant [takes] an unfair advantage of another\u2019s weakness of mind.\u201d We agree with defendant that these instructions were flawed and reverse both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">As a child, Roussey suffered from an anxiety disorder that persisted into adulthood. He never held a job for a significant period of time and eventually moved in with his mother, who managed the shopping and finances. When his mother became ill in the early 1990\u2019s, Roussey hired an attorney, Hubert Forsyth, to oppose a conservatorship of her. After Roussey\u2019s mother died, Forsyth helped him settle her estate, from which Roussey received his mother\u2019s house and the money in her bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">During this period, Roussey met defendant, who worked in Forsyth\u2019s office. Defendant had a law degree, but was not a member of the bar. Forsyth stopped representing Roussey in March 1996, and, in October 1996, terminated defendant\u2019s job. Defendant, however, continued to spend time with Roussey subsequent to his termination. He served as Roussey\u2019s driver, helped him through his anxiety attacks, spent time in Roussey\u2019s home, and traveled with Roussey at Roussey\u2019s expense. Records showed that between December 1995 and May 2003, Roussey placed over 2,500 telephone calls to defendant. As Roussey said to an investigator from the district attorney\u2019s office, \u201cI help [defendant and] he helps me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">While providing this assistance to Roussey, defendant frequently asked him for money, and Roussey wrote defendant checks or deposited money into defendant\u2019s account. Defendant often told Roussey not to discuss these payments with anyone. When Roussey refused to write checks, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>would write the checks himself, follow Roussey around the house and ask him to sign the checks until he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Defendant had great influence over Roussey. For example, in 1998, Roussey purchased a $100,000 annuity. When defendant found out, he called the bank, identified himself as Roussey\u2019s legal advisor, and directed cancellation of the annuity. The bank complied and returned Roussey\u2019s money. In January 2002, Roussey purchased another annuity, designating his niece, Karen Roussey Ramirez (niece), as the beneficiary. Defendant convinced Roussey to cancel the annuity. He called the bank and wrote a letter for Roussey to sign in order to effect the cancellation. When defendant brought the letter to the bank, the financial advisor insisted that Roussey be present. Roussey later went to the bank and cancelled the annuity himself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In June 2002, defendant asked Roussey to withdraw money from another annuity. Roussey withdrew $119,558 and divided the money with defendant because defendant was \u201clow on money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Defendant also failed to follow through on certain commitments made to Roussey. Defendant told Roussey he had prepared Roussey\u2019s taxes for several years, but returns were not filed from 1996 through 2002. As a result, the state and federal governments imposed various liens and fines. In June 2000, defendant asked Roussey to take out a mortgage on his house. Roussey did so and gave half of the $350,000 received to defendant. Defendant agreed to make the mortgage payments, but eventually stopped doing so. Roussey later gave defendant $30,000 to invest in real estate. Defendant kept the money and told Roussey he had used it to pay his bills. On at least two occasions, defendant apparently promised to dispose of automobiles owned by Roussey, but he never provided Roussey with any money received in exchange for the vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">In 2002, Roussey told his niece he was worried about all the checks he had written to defendant and was afraid defendant was stealing from him. But Roussey also spoke positively about defendant to his niece. When she visited Roussey, she suspected he was suffering from diabetes and noticed that some of his expensive furniture was missing. These concerns led her to contact Adult Protective Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">In April 2002, San Mateo Police Officer Carlton Brown left a phone message with Roussey as part of the investigation into the elder abuse complaint by Roussey\u2019s niece. A few hours later, defendant returned Brown\u2019s call and identified himself as Roussey\u2019s friend and advisor. Defendant informed Brown that Roussey suffered from an anxiety disorder and took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>medication for that condition. Defendant said Roussey wrote and signed all of his own checks. Defendant expressed concern that Roussey\u2019s brother was trying to take some of Roussey\u2019s money. Brown indicated that he wanted to speak directly with Roussey, but defendant rejected this request, saying it would make Roussey too anxious.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">When Brown and Diane Wilson, a caseworker for Adult Protective Services, eventually met with Roussey, Wilson noticed that Roussey talked slowly, at times seemed confused and fearful, and did not seem to be taking his medication. Brown said Roussey knew little about his finances. Roussey became agitated when asked about his financial situation, displayed motor and verbal tics and deflected questions by saying, \u201cYou better ask [defendant] ... I don\u2019t want to get in trouble. I better not say.\u201d Brown noticed some bank statements and found two checks made out to defendant for a total of $25,000. When he asked Roussey why he wrote those checks, Roussey told him he did not know and explained defendant told him he (defendant) needed the money. Brown took the bank statements and checks for further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Defendant later called Brown and complained that Roussey had not given informed consent for the removal of the bank statements and checks, and assured Brown that Roussey was doing fine. Defendant said he and his family would inherit Roussey\u2019s estate due to the care he had given Roussey. He told Brown that Roussey had taken a mortgage to cover defendant\u2019s \u201coverhead\u201d and Roussey\u2019s living expenses. He further explained that he had purchased a Jeep and a Cadillac for Roussey, but put the Cadillac in his own name because Roussey was not present at the Department of Motor Vehicles, and defendant had not had a chance to transfer title.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Later, when Brown met with defendant and Roussey at Roussey\u2019s home, defendant explained that Roussey was helping him through his period of financial difficulty by giving him a few thousand dollars each month. Defendant assured Brown he would provide a summary of Roussey\u2019s financial records, but he never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Wilson was also assigned to investigate allegations of elder financial abuse involving Roussey. When she arrived at Roussey\u2019s house, he became upset and said he needed to call defendant. Defendant told her he was Roussey\u2019s advisor and did not want her to talk to Roussey. Wilson was concerned that Roussey\u2019s reluctance to speak and his desire for defendant\u2019s approval suggested financial abuse. Wilson conducted a \u201cmini mental examination\u201d and Roussey scored in the normal range. However, based on their conversation, Wilson determined Roussey had cognitive impairment and was emotionally dependent on defendant. In April 2002, Wilson had Roussey\u2019s bank accounts frozen and submitted a recommendation for the conservatorship of Roussey\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>San Mateo County Public Guardian investigator Linda Eoff received a referral for a conservatorship of Roussey and his estate. She determined that Roussey had little understanding of his financial situation and, based on \u201cthe enormity of [the] mismanagement of his estate,\u201d recommended that county counsel petition for a conservatorship of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">In mid-April 2002, Wilson and Eoff accompanied Brown while he executed a search warrant of Roussey\u2019s home. Brown subpoenaed defendant\u2019s and Roussey\u2019s financial records which revealed the large transfer of funds from Roussey to defendant from 1997 to 2002. The checks written in 2001 and 2002 were filled out by defendant and signed by Roussey. There was no evidence that defendant reimbursed Roussey.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Pursuant to a request by the judge handling the petition for Roussey\u2019s conservatorship, Michael Dirikson, chief inspector for the district attorney\u2019s office, initiated an investigation into possible elder abuse. Roussey told Dirikson he did not know how much money he had or why he refinanced his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Expert psychological testimony was presented by both sides. Psychologist William Lynch, called by the prosecution, testified that in October 2003, he tested Roussey\u2019s memory, ability to care for himself and intelligence. Lynch concluded Roussey suffered from a \u201ccognitive disorder not otherwise specified,\u201d \u201cneurocognitive impairment\u201d and \u201cborderline intellectual functioning\u201d; was subject to undue influence by a person with whom he had formed a dependent relationship; and had a tendency to focus only on immediate results rather than on the long-term implications of his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Psychiatrist James Missett found Roussey unable to focus on a topic, deal with details, make calculations, recall facts about his life or understand the long-term implications of his depleting assets. He determined that Roussey suffered from a cognitive disorder, his impairment was obvious to lay people, he exhibited a strong desire to please and was extremely vulnerable to undue influence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">Psychologist Ronald McKinzey testified for the defense. He concluded no psychiatric reason explained Roussey\u2019s gift of money to defendant. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>suggested Lynch had not read all of Roussey\u2019s records, had not realized Roussey had a vision problem, used outdated and inapplicable norms, failed to test Roussey for malingering even though Roussey exhibited signs he did not try to do well on the tests, and failed to realize Roussey\u2019s low score on one test indicated malingering. McKinzey concluded the tests showed Roussey had malingered, none of the results were reliable and Roussey was \u201c[independent and fully functioning,\u201d but suffering from an antisocial personality disorder. He also determined that Roussey was no more subject to undue influence than any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">In rebuttal, Lynch stated he was aware of Roussey\u2019s vision problem and disagreed with McKinzey\u2019s conclusions regarding malingering and the norms used to test Roussey\u2019s mental condition. Missett testified that McKinzey\u2019s conclusions about Roussey malingering were \u201cmarkedly in variance with every opinion that I\u2019ve ever seen in print anywhere, by anybody, over the last, at least, 10 to 12 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Following the jury\u2019s verdict, defendant was sentenced to an aggregate term of five years in prison and was ordered to pay $661,400 in victim restitution. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Theft by larceny is a trespassory offense that is not committed when the property is taken with the owner\u2019s consent. <em>(People v. Davis </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 301, 305 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 295, 965 P.2d 1165]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Werner </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 216, 225 [105 P.2d 927], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Camodeca </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 142, 147 [338 P.2d 903]; <em>People v. Hanselman </em>(1888) 76 Cal. 460, 462 [18 P. 425].) Defendant contends that all of the money and property he received from Roussey was provided consensually. The People counter that defendant\u2019s constant importuning of Roussey vitiated that consent and justified the court\u2019s undue influence instructions. Resolution of this dispute requires an examination of the common law of larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">I. <em>Larceny and the Law of Apparent Consent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Prior to the amendment of Penal Code section 484 in 1927, the criminal law recognized three types of nonforcible takings of the property of another: larceny, a common law crime, and the statutory offenses of embezzlement and obtaining title by false pretenses. <em>(People v. Davis, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 304; 2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Crimes Against Property, \u00a7 1, p. 19.) Section 484 consolidated these three distinct offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>into the crime of \u201ctheft.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even after the amendment of section 484, however, the \u201celements of the several types of theft included within section 484 have not been changed.\u201d <em>(People v. Ashley </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 246, 258 [267 P.2d 271].) \u201c[T]he California statute making larceny a crime is declaratory of the common law and is therefore to be construed by application of common law principles.\u201d <em>(Davis, </em>at p. 314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The trial court instructed the jury on theft by larceny and the elements of this offense are \u201cwell settled: the offense is committed by every person who (1) takes possession (2) of personal property (3) owned or possessed by another, (4) by means of trespass and (5) with intent to steal the property, and (6) carries the property away. [Citations.] The act of taking personal property from the possession of another is always a trespass <em>unless the owner consents </em>to the taking freely and unconditionally or the taker has a legal right to take the property. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 305, fns. omitted, italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Under certain circumstances, an apparent consent is ineffective. \u201c[I]f, by reason of infancy, insanity, or intoxication, the victim is unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct in question,\u201d a valid consent does not exist. (1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 46, p. 304; accord, 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Defenses, \u00a7 89, p. 428; Fricke &amp; Alarcon, Cal. Criminal Law (10th ed. 1970) p. 37.) Force, fear and duress negate apparent consent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fraud also vitiates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>consent. <em>(People v. Traster </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1377, 1388-1389 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 680]; 2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Crimes Against Property, \u00a7 14, p. 33.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Though never adopted in California, the Model Penal Code sets out a definition of ineffective consent in criminal cases, including theft, that is instructive. After noting that the law on ineffective consent \u201cis neither difficult nor controversial,\u201d the commentary provides: \u201cFour situations are contemplated in which assent will not constitute an excusing consent. The first occurs where one who is not legally entitled to give consent purports to do so, as where a stranger \u2018consents\u2019 to the removal of another\u2019s property. Secondly, consent is vitiated in those situations where it is given by one who, by reason of youth, mental disease or defect, or intoxication, is manifestly unable, or known by the actor to be unable, to make a reasonable judgment as to the harm that would be incurred by virtue of the consent. A drunk who \u2018consents\u2019 to the taking of his property may pose an illustration. The third situation, of which statutory rape is a clear example, involves consent by a person whose improvident consent is the very objective sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense. And finally, consent is deemed to be ineffective if it is induced by force, duress or deception of a kind sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense.\u201d (Model Pen. Code &amp; Commentaries (1985) com. 3 to \u00a7 2.11, pp. 398-399, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">II. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Instructions on Consent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Consistent with common law principles, the trial court instructed the jury with CALJIC No. 1.23: \u201cTo consent to an act or transaction, a person: (1) must act freely and voluntarily and not under the influence of threats, force or duress; (2) must have knowledge of the true nature of the act or transaction involved; and (3) must possess the mental capacity to make an intelligent choice whether or not to do something proposed by another person. [1] Merely being passive does not amount to consent. Consent requires a free will and positive cooperation in act or attitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">However, the court supplemented this instruction with the following: \u201cIf you find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant exerted undue influence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>over . . . Roussey, you may but are not required to find that. . . Roussey did not consent to the subject transactions. Your finding that. . . Roussey did not consent to the subject transactions must be found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The court then adopted the formulation of undue influence set out in Civil Code section 1575, and gave the following special instruction: \u201cUndue influence exists where a defendant does one or more of the following: [1] (1) In the use, by one in whom a confidence is reposed by another, or who holds a real or apparent authority over him of such confidence or authority for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage over him; [f] (2) In taking an unfair advantage of another\u2019s weakness of mind; or [j[] (3) In taking a grossly oppressive or unfair advantage of another\u2019s necessities or distress.\u201d To this statutory definition, the court added an additional alternative rooted in the case law: \u201cWhether from weakness on one side, or strength on the other, or a combination of the two, undue influence occurs whenever there results that kind of influence or supremacy of one mind over another by which that other is prevented from acting according to his own wish or judgment, and whereby the will of the person is overborne and he is induced to do an act which he would not do, if left to act freely.\u201d (See <em>Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1124 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46].) Defendant has challenged these modifications to the standard consent instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">When evaluating jury instructions, we follow familiar rules. \u201cJury instructions must be read together and understood in context as presented to the jury. Whether a jury has been correctly instructed depends upon the entire charge of the court. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tatman </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1, 10 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 480].) Jurors are presumed to be intelligent persons capable of understanding and correlating jury instructions. <em>(People v. Yoder </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 333, 338 [161 Cal.Rptr. 35].) An erroneous instruction requires reversal only when it appears that the error was likely to have misled the jury. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; <em>Tatman, </em>at p. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">From the court\u2019s instructions, we believe the jury understood it could not convict the defendant of either crime unless it believed beyond a reasonable doubt that Roussey did not consent to the monetary transfers, but it could convict defendant if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that Roussey\u2019s consent resulted from defendant taking unfair advantage of Roussey\u2019s \u201cweak mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">These instructions are far too inclusive to act as a standard for negating apparent consent in a criminal prosecution for theft by larceny. Undue influence, as the trial court defined it, is little more than over-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>persuasion. \u201cThe hallmark of [the Civil Code\u2019s definition of undue influence] is high pressure, a pressure which works on mental, moral, or emotional weakness to such an extent that it <em>approaches the boundaries of coercion. . . . </em>[Citation.] Misrepresentations of law or fact are not essential to the charge, for a person\u2019s will may be overborne without misrepresentation. By statutory definition[,] undue influence includes \u2018taking an unfair advantage of another\u2019s weakness of mind, or . . . taking a grossly oppressive and unfair advantage of another\u2019s necessities or distress.\u2019 [Citation.] While most reported cases of undue influence involve persons who bear a confidential or authoritative relationship to one another, a confidential. . . relationship between the parties need not be present when the undue influence involves unfair advantage taken of another\u2019s weakness or distress. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Odorizzi </em>v. <em>Bloomfield School Dist. </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 123, 130 [54 Cal.Rptr. 533], italics added.) The court\u2019s instructions on undue influence render persuasion short of coercion or misrepresentation sufficient to prove a theft, even where the victim does not lack the mental capacity to consent. These instructions create a substantial risk of conviction whenever an accused benefited so greatly from a transaction that the jury is convinced that the victim acted unreasonably in entering into it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">The People defend the court\u2019s undue influence instructions in several ways. First, they argue that the instructions are justified by certain provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>Civil Code. Civil Code section 1567<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides that undue influence undermines apparent consent, and Civil Code section 1575<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> defines undue influence in the same fashion as the trial court, which expressly relied on the Civil Code for these instructions. It is significant, however, that these two Civil Code sections define the consent necessary for contract formation and the factors that undermine such consent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Undue influence may also invalidate the execution or revocation of a will. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 6104.) But the People provide no reason in law or logic for concluding that the same factors that make a contract voidable or a will ineffective should, without more, justify a criminal conviction for theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">The People argue Penal Code section 1102 and Civil Code section 23.2 provide additional justification for adoption of this civil standard in criminal prosecutions. This argument is meritless. Penal Code section 1102, enacted prior to codification of our Evidence Code, simply states that \u201c[t]he rules of evidence in civil actions are applicable also to criminal actions.\u201d But the undue influence provisions in the Civil Code are not \u201crules of evidence\u201d; they are substantive provisions that, if we accept the People\u2019s argument, will define theft by larceny in a fashion that converts otherwise lawful activity into a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">The People rely on <em>People v. Hewlett </em>(1951) 108 Cal.App.2d 358 [239 P.2d 150] to support their argument regarding Penal Code section 1102. <em>Hewlett </em>upheld an embezzlement conviction of an attorney who had obtained a written gift instrument for the subject property from his client, while the client was hospitalized and incompetent. (Hewlett, at pp. 362, 365, 378.) The court approved a series of instructions \u201cinforming the jury that a presumption of undue influence arises where a trustee obtains an advantage over his beneficiary.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 369.) These instructions had been challenged on the basis that they deprived the defendant of \u201cthe presumption of innocence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 369, 371.) The court rejected this argument, relying on examples of other presumptions that had been enacted in the Penal Code and approved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>the courts. The court went on to conclude that any civil presumption could be used in a criminal case because all presumptions constitute evidence, the laws relating to presumptions are rules of evidence and section 1102 extends the rules of evidence in civil cases to criminal actions. <em>(Hewlett, </em>at pp. 374-375.)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\"><em>Hewlett </em>provides little assistance to the People. First, the Evidence Code, which was enacted many years after <em>Hewlett, </em>has specifically rejected the rule that presumptions are evidence. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 600, subd. (a) [\u201cA presumption is not evidence.\u201d].) Second, the People fail to refer us to any presumption expressly set out in the Civil Code (or Evidence Code) that was applied in our case. Finally, the instruction given in this case was far broader than the instruction given in <em>Hewlett, </em>which addressed only the influence exercised by a fiduciary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">The People\u2019s reliance on Civil Code section 23.2 is equally misplaced. That section merely requires that we treat the Civil and Penal Codes as if they \u201chad been passed at the same moment of time and were parts of the same statute.\u201d That is, we must construe the two codes together and attempt to give effect to the provisions in each. <em>(Gonzales </em>v. <em>Wasson </em>(1876) 51 Cal. 295, 297; <em>Granite Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 465, 469-470 [197 Cal.Rptr. 3].) But the People\u2019s argument that section 23.2 compels the conclusion \u201cthat the Civil Code definition of undue influence is applicable in criminal trials\u201d goes too far. Nothing in our decision implicates section 23.2, because restricting larceny to its common law boundaries leaves intact the rules of contract formation in the Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Finally, the People suggest that any apparent problem with the instructions on undue influence is eliminated by subsequent instructions requiring that lack of consent be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and that a good faith belief in consent, though unreasonable, is a defense to theft by larceny. We are unpersuaded. The instructions erroneously expand the list of factors that negate apparent consent. Subsequent instructions requiring proof of nonconsent beyond a reasonable doubt, or providing a defense for a good faith though unreasonable belief in consent, do not cure the problem because they incorporate the faulty definition of consent. That is, the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that consent did not exist because Roussey was weak-minded and that defendant lacked good faith because defendant knew Roussey was vulnerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>HI. <em>Penal Code Section 368, Subdivision (d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">In count 1, defendant was convicted of violating Penal Code section 368, subdivision (d) (hereafter section 368(d)), crimes against elder or dependent adults, by committing a theft of money or personal property exceeding $400 knowing that the victim was an elder or dependent adult. The People argue that even if undue influence does not negate apparent consent in a theft prosecution, we should interpret the theft provisions of the elder abuse statute, section 368(d), more broadly in order to protect certain vulnerable victims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">In interpreting a statute we follow familiar rules. \u201cThe first principle of statutory interpretation is that, to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent, we turn initially to the words of the statute, and if '\u201cthe statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction and courts should not indulge in it. [Citation.] The plain language of the statute establishes what was intended by the Legislature.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 717, 723-724 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 887, 133 P.3d 1044].)  Section 368(d) provides: \u201cAny person who is not a caretaker who violates <em>any provision of law proscribing theft, . . </em>. with respect to the property ... of an elder or a dependent adult, and who knows or reasonably should know that the victim is an elder or a dependent adult, is punishable [as set forth.]\u201d (Italics added.) The italicized portion clearly demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent to rely on the definition of theft contained in other statutes and is inconsistent with the argument that the Legislature intended to create a unique definition of theft for this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">The People note, however, that in Penal Code section 368, subdivision (a) (hereafter section 368(a)) the Legislature stated its intent to provide \u201cspecial consideration and protection\u201d to elders and dependent adults because of their increased vulnerability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The People suggest we should implement this intent and provide increased protection to an elder adult who consents to providing property to another as a result of undue influence, by treating this transaction as a theft. Because of the clear language in section 368(d), we decline to do so. But, this unwillingness does not frustrate the legislative intent to protect vulnerable members of our community because the statute provides for an increased penalty when the victim is a member of the protected class. When, as in this case, the defendant is convicted of stealing more than $400 from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>elder adult, the normal penalty for grand theft is increased by one year. Thus the legislative intent is effectuated without an unwarranted expansion of the definition of theft in section 368(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">IV. <em>Harmless Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">\u201cThe nature of this harmless error analysis depends on whether a jury has been presented with a legally invalid or a factually invalid theory. When one of the theories presented to a jury is legally inadequate, such as a theory which 1 \u201cfails to come within the statutory definition of the crime\u201d \u2019 [citations], the jury cannot reasonably be expected to divine its legal inadequacy. The jury may render a verdict on the basis of the legally invalid theory without realizing that, as a matter of law, its factual findings are insufficient to constitute the charged crime. In such circumstances, reversal generally is required unless \u2018it is possible to determine from other portions of the verdict that the jury necessarily found the defendant guilty on a proper theory.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Perez </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1219, 1233 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 423, 113 P.3d 100].) \u201c[W]hen the prosecution presents its case to the jury on alternate theories, some of which are legally correct and others legally incorrect, and the reviewing court cannot determine from the record on which theory the ensuing general verdict of guilt rested, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 69 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Here, the instructions presented the jury with alternate theories for finding guilt, some of which were legally correct and supported by substantial evidence. For example, the jury could have found defendant guilty on the theories that he obtained Roussey\u2019s consent by duress or by misrepresentation. However, the instructions on undue influence were erroneous, at least to the extent the jury was permitted to convict if it believed defendant took unfair advantage of Roussey\u2019s \u201cweak mind.\u201d The prosecutor argued the erroneous legal theory to the jury, and, on more than one occasion, expressly conceded that her case was focused on undue influence. Nothing in the record demonstrates that the jury necessarily rejected this theory and convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>defendant on the theory that he obtained possession of the property by duress or by misrepresentations. Given the evidence and arguments, we conclude there is a reasonable probability defendant\u2019s conviction was based on the legally insupportable theory that Roussey\u2019s consent to the property transfers was undermined by the defendant\u2019s exercise of undue influence. <em>(People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) Thus, the instructional error was prejudicial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">The judgment is reversed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Jones, P.

Minister Stewart Steiner testified that Roussey often seemed depressed and anxious. Kathleen Petterson, a former employee at the church Roussey attended, supervised Roussey on mundane tasks and assessed that he \u201cdid not seem to be normal in his development.\u201d Petterson said he was concerned about whether he had enough money and upset that he no longer had a car. Debra Owdom, the program coordinator for a retired seniors volunteer program, concluded Roussey had memory problems because he could not remember how to do simple tasks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b987-7\"> Penal Code section 484, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person who shall feloniously steal, take, carry, lead, or drive away the personal property of another, or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been entrusted to him or her, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false or fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money, labor or real or personal property, or who causes or procures others to report falsely of his or her wealth or mercantile character and by thus imposing upon any person, obtains credit and thereby fraudulently gets or obtains possession of money, or property or obtains the labor or service of another, is guilty of theft.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b987-8\"> The common law crime of larceny was said to require a \u201c \u2018trespass in the taking.\u2019 \u201d (2 LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) \u00a7 8.1, p. 328.) If the owner of the property actually consents to the defendant\u2019s taking his property, there is no trespass in the taking and hence no larceny. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1925) 72 Cal.App. 102, 112-113 [236 P. 944] [\u201cThe taking ... must be against the will of the owner or at least without his consent.\u201d], disapproved on other grounds in <em>In re Estrada </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 740, 748 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948]; 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law (15th ed. 1993) \u00a7 46, pp. 303-304 [\u201cconsent destroys the criminal character of an act of . . . taking the property of another which would otherwise constitute larceny\u201d].) Thus, while a lack of consent is not an essential element of the crime, consent is an affirmative defense. (1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal.

Forsyth testified that he had been practicing law since 1950, after graduating from Boalt Hall School of Law. In April 1991, he hired defendant at his law firm. Forsyth\u2019s mother had recently died and his wife was terminally ill. Defendant was initially paid an hourly rate and performed clerical work, though he was a law school graduate. Forsyth and defendant became friends, and defendant\u2019s job responsibilities grew. Eventually, the relationship deteriorated as the two men differed over the services to be offered to clients and the fees that should be billed. Defendant also requested higher compensation, but Forsyth could not afford it. In 1996, Forsyth informed defendant that he was considering terminating him, and defendant initially asked for a severance payment of $100,000. Forsyth hired an attorney to represent him in negotiations with defendant and that attorney advised Forsyth he had no legal obligation to make any severance payment. During formal negotiations, in which both men were represented by counsel, defendant demanded $200,000 and Forsyth ultimately paid him $130,000. On one occasion during the negotiations, in the presence of counsel, defendant spoke in a loud voice, became distraught and ran from the room. Earlier, during disagreements over management of the law office, defendant had acted in a manner that Forsyth found intimidating.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">The People sought admission of this evidence under Evidence Code section 1109, subdivision (a)(2) as \u201cprior elder/financial abuse,\u201d and, on appeal, argue the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the evidence was appropriate because defendant\u2019s treatment of Forsyth constituted \u201ca similar form of elder abuse.\u201d In effect, the People argue that the size of the payment negotiated <em>with the assistance of counsel </em>was so unreasonable in the circumstances that it must have resulted from defendant taking unfair advantage of Forsyth\u2019s weakness of mind.
