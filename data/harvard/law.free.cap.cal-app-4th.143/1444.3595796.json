The City argues that (1) Macy\u2019s 1995 and 1996 refund claims were untimely, (2) the trial court erred by refunding all local business taxes paid by Macy\u2019s during the contested period instead of the amount sufficient to negate the discriminatory effect of the tax, and (3) the rate of prejudgment interest should have been derived from a local ordinance rather than state law. We conclude Macy\u2019s tax refund must be limited to an amount sufficient to cure the discriminatory effect of the tax. So, we reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">Pursuant to City ordinances in effect between 1995 and 1999, a business that operated in San Francisco was required to calculate its tax liability separately under payroll expense and gross receipts taxes, and to pay the greater of the two amounts. (S.F. Mun. Code, pt. Ill, former arts. 12-A &amp; 12-B.) In April 2001, the City repealed the gross receipts tax, effective January 1, 2000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (S.F. Ord. No. 63-01, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-10\">On January 28, 1999, Macy\u2019s filed claims with the City for refunds of all taxes paid since 1995. Later Macy\u2019s filed refund claims for all taxes paid through the year 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The claims were denied. In September 1999, Macy\u2019s filed the first of three complaints seeking tax refunds, on the basis that the City\u2019s business tax scheme failed the internal consistency test used to determine whether a state or local tax violates the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. Macy\u2019s also alleged the City\u2019s tax scheme violated the corresponding provisions of the California Constitution. The cases were consolidated in March 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>Three experts testified in the one-day court trial. Direct testimony was provided by their written reports, and each expert was subject to cross-examination. The experts agreed the City\u2019s pre-2000 \u201ctandem tax\u201d could hypothetically discriminate against intercity taxpayers, who might be subject to tax under a payroll expense measure in one jurisdiction and under a gross receipts measure in another, unlike a local taxpayer, who would pay tax only to San Francisco under only one measure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">Economist Steven M. Shefinn, Ph.D., was retained by the City and described a method for quantifying the extra amount an intercity taxpayer would hypothetically be burdened under the tandem tax. This amount was argued to represent the appropriate measure of refund. Macy\u2019s expert economist, Dr. Charles E. McLure, criticized Dr. Sheffrin\u2019s approach as bad public policy because liability for a partial refund would not serve to sufficiently deter local governments from enacting invalid tax measures, but did not challenge its efficacy in this case, and conceded that the fact situation was \u201crelatively simple.\u201d Certified Public Accountant Everett P. Harry used financial information produced by Macy\u2019s during discovery and applied Sheffrin\u2019s method to calculate the maximum excess taxes the City\u2019s scheme could have imposed on Macy\u2019s.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Macy\u2019s declined to cross-examine Harry, and did not challenge his computations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">The trial court found the City\u2019s tandem tax scheme violated the federal and state Constitutions because it failed the internal consistency test. The court also concluded that <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 448 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 544] compelled a full refund of all taxes paid by Macy\u2019s from 1995 through 1999, that Macy\u2019s refund claims for tax years 1995 and 1996 were timely, and that prejudgment interest should be set at 7 percent, accruing from the date of each tax payment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The City timely appealed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">A. <em>Measure of Refund</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">In <em>Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 159, 169-170 [77 L.Ed.2d 545, 103 S.Ct. 2933], the United States Supreme Court first articulated what has become known as the \u201cinternal consistency\u201d test that measures the validity of a state or local tax argued to have a negative impact upon interstate commerce and thereby violated the dormant commerce clause. \u201cInternal consistency is preserved when the imposition of a tax identical to the one in question by every other State would add no burden to interstate commerce that intrastate commerce would not also bear. This test asks nothing about the degree of economic reality reflected by the tax, but simply looks to the structure of the tax at issue to see whether its identical application by every State in the Union would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as compared with commerce intrastate. A failure of internal consistency shows as a matter of law that a State is attempting to take more than its fair share of taxes from the interstate transaction, since allowing such a tax in one State would place interstate commerce at the mercy of those remaining States that might impose an identical tax.\u201d <em>(Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Jefferson Lines, Inc. </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 175, 185 [131 L.Ed.2d 261, 115 S.Ct. 1331].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-8\">The internal consistency test has since been applied by California courts to determine the validity of local tax measures challenged as discriminatory in violation of the commerce clause of the United States Constitution and \u201cthe equivalent proscriptions derived from provisions of the California Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(General Motors Corp. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1736, 1752 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 430]; see also <em>Union Oil Co. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 383, 389-390, 392 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 81].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-9\">When a tax fails because it is not internally consistent, the United States Supreme Court has generally left it up to the states to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1450\">*1450</page-number>exact remedy they must provide to aggrieved taxpayers. (See, e.g., <em>Tyler Pipe Industries v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1987) 483 U.S. 232, 252-253 [97 L.Ed.2d 199, 107 S.Ct. 2810].) The parameters of state-afforded relief were made clear in <em>McKesson, </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 18 [110 L.Ed.2d 17, 110 S.Ct. 2238] <em>(McKesson), </em>where the Supreme Court held: \u201cTo satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause,... the State must provide taxpayers with, not only a fair opportunity to challenge the accuracy and legal validity of their tax obligation, but also a \u2018clear and certain remedy,\u2019 [citation], for any erroneous or unlawful tax collection to ensure that the opportunity to contest the tax is a meaningful one.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 39, fn. omitted.) The court concluded that when a tax scheme is found unconstitutional \u201conly insofar as it operated in a manner that discriminated against interstate commerce,\u201d the taxing authority \u201cretains flexibility in responding to this determination,\u201d and may \u201creformulate and enforce the [tax] during the contested tax period in any way that treats [the taxpayer] and its competitors in a manner consistent with the dictates of the Commerce Clause. Having done so, the [taxing authority] may retain the tax appropriately levied upon [the taxpayer] pursuant to this reformulated scheme because this retention would deprive [the taxpayer] of its property pursuant to a tax scheme that is <em>valid </em>under the Commerce Clause.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 39-40.) \u201cMore specifically, the [taxing authority] may cure the invalidity of the [tax] by refunding to [the taxpayer] the difference between the tax it paid and the tax it would have been assessed were it extended the same [preferential treatment] that its competitors actually received.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 40; accord, <em>Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner </em>(1996) 516 U.S. 325, 346-347 [133 L.Ed.2d 796, 116 S.Ct. 848].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">Here, the City does not appeal the trial court\u2019s determination that the tandem payroll and gross receipts tax scheme fails the internal consistency test, and is therefore unconstitutional. Instead, the City appeals the award to Macy\u2019s of a full refund of all business taxes paid from 1995 through 1999, rather than a partial refund in an amount sufficient to remedy any hypothetical discrimination. The trial court found that the measure of refund was definitively stated in <em>General Motors Corp. v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>to be a full refund of all taxes paid. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1451\">*1451</page-number>Before the internal consistency test was applied to determine whether a state or local tax was legal, the rule was that a taxpayer was required to \u201cshow more than the possibility of erratic or unconstitutional application. \u2018One who attacks a formula of apportionment carries a distinct burden of showing by \u201cclear and cogent evidence\u201d that <em>it results </em>in extraterritorial values being taxed.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 126.) The taxpayer thus had the burden of showing the taxing authority actually taxed business activity outside its jurisdiction. <em>(Ibid.) </em>But the taxpayer no longer has to \u201cshow more than the possibility of erratic or unconstitutional application\u201d to prove a tax is illegal. As the internal consistency test \u201casks nothing about the degree of economic reality reflected by the tax\u201d <em>(Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 185), <em>McKesson </em>makes clear that due process does not compel a full refund in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">Neither does <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, </em>relied upon by the trial court. In <em>General Motors, </em>the court reviewed a facially invalid tax enacted by a taxing authority that placed the burden upon the taxpayer to demonstrate double taxation in order to secure a refund. <em>(General Motors Corp. v. City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at pp. 453, 455.) This case is very different. It is only the tandem interaction of the City\u2019s payroll and gross receipts taxes that violates the commerce clause under the internal consistency test. In isolation, each of the taxes is valid.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Neither did the City place the burden on Macy\u2019s to demonstrate double taxation and the proper measure of refund. The City\u2019s experts calculated the amount of possible overpayments Macy\u2019s could have made under the tandem tax, and Macy\u2019s does not dispute it.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">Unlike <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, </em>there is no claim here that the City\u2019s proposed remedy is deficient because it is uncertain or would not eliminate the discriminatory effect of the tandem tax scheme. Instead, Macy\u2019s relies on its expert\u2019s testimony criticizing a partial refund as bad public policy. Macy\u2019s argues that hypothetical future cases might require complex factual analysis in order to quantify the appropriate refund, and that the partial refund proposed here by the City would not serve to discourage taxing authorities from enacting unconstitutional taxes in the future. We consider here only the claim before us, however, and \u201cexpress no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1452\">*1452</page-number>general opinion regarding the appropriate remedy in other cases.\u201d <em>(Ceridian Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 875, 889, fn. 9 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 611].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">This is also not a case where a full tax refund is required because the tax \u201cwas beyond the State\u2019s power to impose, as was the unapportioned tax in <em>[Atchison &amp;c. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>(1912) 223 U.S. 280 [56 L.Ed. 436, 32 S.Ct. 216]], or because the taxpayers were absolutely immune from the tax, as were the Indian Tribes in <em>Ward </em>[v. <em>Love County </em>(1920) 253 U.S. 17] [64 L.Ed. 751, 40 S.Ct. 419] and <em>Carpenter [v. Shaw </em>(1930) 280 U.S. 363] [74 L.Ed. 478, 50 S.Ct. 121] . . . .\u201d <em>(McKesson, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 39.) Macy\u2019s relies on those earlier cases to argue that a full refund is required here, but does not acknowledge their limiting treatment by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>McKesson. </em>The more recent federal cases cited by Macy\u2019s do not address this issue, but merely reaffirm a taxpayer\u2019s general right to a postdeprivation refund of illegally-collected taxes, a proposition not under dispute in this case. <em>(Newsweek, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue </em>(1998) 522 U.S. 442 [139 L.Ed.2d 888, 118 S.Ct. 904]; <em>Reich v. Collins </em>(1994) 513 U.S. 106 [130 L.Ed.2d 454, 115 S.Ct. 547].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">This court has followed <em>McKesson </em>to determine the options available to a taxing authority to remedy a discriminatory tax. <em>(Ceridian Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at pp. 888-889.) Under <em>McKesson\u2019s </em>guidelines, we concluded the state Franchise Tax Board could \u201crefund to [the taxpayer] the difference between the tax it paid and the tax it would have been assessed were it allowed the same deductions its competitors actually received,\u201d and affirmed the award of a stipulated refund. <em>(Ibid.) </em>While the parties here have not stipulated to the amount of the refund, Macy\u2019s does not challenge the City\u2019s calculation of the amount necessary to remedy any hypothetical excess it could have paid under the tandem tax. (See also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1453\">*1453</page-number><em>Haman </em>v. <em>County of Humboldt </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 922, 928 [106 Cal.Rptr. 617, 506 P.2d 993] [court may eliminate effects of discriminatory tax by granting a refund based on the difference between the rates in question]; <em>City of Modesto v. National Med, Inc. </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 518, 525 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 215] [when discriminatory taxes have been assessed, the taxing authority may issue a partial refund to the disfavored parties to equalize the tax rate].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">While the states are free \u201cto provide broader relief as a matter of state law than is required by the Federal Constitution\u201d <em>(McKesson, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 52, fn. 36), <em>General Motors Corp. v. City and County of San Francisco </em>does not hold that broader relief is required under California law, nor does it even consider the question. The court there relied on <em>McKesson, </em>but concluded the remedy proposed by the taxing authority would not eliminate the discrimination suffered by the taxpayer, nor would it provide a clear and certain remedy under the circumstances of that case. <em>(General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at pp. 454\u2014455.) Neither does Macy\u2019s argue that it is entitled to broader relief under the due process requirements of the California Constitution than under the federal Constitution, nor has it cited any authority to support such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">Instead, Macy\u2019s says a full refund is compelled by article XIII, section 32 of the California Constitution, which provides: \u201cNo legal or equitable process shall issue in any proceeding in any court against this State or any officer thereof to prevent or enjoin the collection of any tax. After payment of a tax claimed to be illegal, an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid, with interest, in such manner as may be provided by the Legislature.\u201d Article XIII, section 32 recognizes the taxpayer\u2019s right to refund of an illegal tax, as a corollary to the prohibition against enjoining the collection of any tax, but it does not address the proper measure of refund. Nor do the cases cited by Macy\u2019s discuss the issue. <em>(Todd Shipyards Corp. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 222, 224-225 [181 Cal.Rptr. 652] [taxpayer entitled to recover prejudgment interest on taxes voluntarily refunded by municipality]; <em>Flying Dutchman Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 1129, 1136-1139 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 690] [rejecting taxpayer\u2019s claim for prepayment injunctive relief from city\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1454\">*1454</page-number>parking tax because city ordinance authorizing refund of taxes illegally collected provided adequate remedy at law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">Macy\u2019s also says a full refund is required by the City ordinances in effect from 1995 through 1999 that governed payroll tax refunds. (Former \u00a7 911 of the Payroll Expense Tax Ord., S.F. Mun. Code, pt. Ill, art. 12-A.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But that ordinance provides only that \u201cthe amount of any tax . . . illegally collected . . . may be refunded,\u201d and a plain reading does not support Macy\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">Macy\u2019s cites several cases for the general proposition that an unconstitutional statute may be held void and without force or effect. But none of them address the remedy due a taxpayer subjected to a tax that violates the commerce clause or the California Constitution. <em>(Reclamation District </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1916) 171 Cal. 672, 676, 682 [154 P. 845] [prohibition against enjoining the execution of statutes applies only to valid statutes]; <em>Brandenstein v. Hoke </em>(1894) 101 Cal. 131, 134-135 [35 P. 562] [doctrine protecting corporation from collateral questions as to the regularity of the proceedings taken in its organization does not apply when corporation was organized under unconstitutional law]; <em>Hardie v. Eu </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 371, 374, 378 [134 Cal.Rptr. 201, 556 P.2d 301] [state officials directed to refrain from enforcing statute that infringed on First Amendment rights and was not supported by compelling state interest]; <em>Brabant </em>v. <em>City of South Gate </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 764, 766, 772 [136 Cal.Rptr. 150] [enjoining enforcement of unapportioned local business license fee imposed on real estate brokers whose only office was in another city].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">Macy\u2019s is entitled to be placed in a position equivalent to that occupied by local taxpaying businesses so it will have paid a valid measure of taxes. (See <em>McKesson, supra, </em>496 U.S. at pp. 42-43.) In this way, the City may limit Macy\u2019s tax refund to the amount necessary to remedy any discrimination from the City\u2019s former tandem tax. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 39-41.) Macy\u2019s is not entitled to a full refund of all business taxes paid between 1995 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>1999. Such a refund would place Macy\u2019s in a more favorable position than a local taxpayer during the same period. (See <em>Haman v. County of Humboldt, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 928 [\u201cIn determining the proper remedy, we must adopt the one which will best further the legislative intent without increasing discrimination among other taxpayers.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">B. <em>Timeliness of Macy\u2019s 1995 and 1996 Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">The City argues that Macy\u2019s 1995 and 1996 claims were not timely filed, because a local ordinance effective January 1, 1998, shortened the limitations period for filing tax refund claims from three years to 90 days.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (S.F. Ord. No. 18-98.) Macy\u2019s 1995 and 1996 refund claims were filed on January 28, 1999, more than one year, but less than three years, after the taxes were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">The trial court concluded the claims were timely because their filing was governed by the three-year limitations period provided in former section 911 of the City\u2019s Payroll Expense Tax Ordinance.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The City argues the shortened limitations period began to run on the effective date of the 1998 ordinance, and the 1995 and 1996 claims were therefore barred.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The City claims that a legislative body may shorten the period of limitations applicable to preexisting claims, as long as claimants are left a reasonable time in which to assert their rights. (See <em>Coachella Valley Mosquito &amp; Vector Control Dist. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number><em>California Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1072, 1091-1092 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 234, 112 P.3d 623].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">But the language of the City\u2019s Ordinance No. 18-98 does not support the City. It expressly provides: \u201cThis ordinance shall take effect on January 1, 1998, and shall apply to tax obligations and penalties that accrue after that date. All provisions of Part III of the Municipal Code [the City\u2019s Business and Tax Regulations Code] not expressly or necessarily changed by this ordinance shall remain in full force and effect. . . .\u201d (S.F. Ord. No. 8-98, \u00a7 2.) Ordinance No. 24-98, which includes the repeal of section 911 and other procedural provisions of the Payroll Expense Tax Ordinance, and was enacted at the same time as Ordinance 18-98, similarly states: \u201cThe changes made in this ordinance shall take effect on January 1, 1998, and shall apply to tax obligations and penalties that accrue after that date. All provisions of this Article not expressly or necessarily changed by this ordinance shall remain in full force and effect. . . .\u201d (S.F. Ord. No. 24-98, \u00a7 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">The City argues that \u201cit is the statute of limitations amendment and the other provisions of the ordinance that are governed by the effective date language, not the refund claims themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But the claims here arose out of tax obligations that accrued before January 1, 1998, when the ordinances became effective. By their own terms, the limitations periods in the 1998 ordinances do not apply. The trial court properly concluded that Macy\u2019s 1995 and 1996 claims were governed by the prior three-year limitation imposed by former section 911 of the Payroll Expense Tax Ordinance, and were therefore timely.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">C. <em>Prejudgment Interest Rate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">The City and amicus curiae argue that the rate of prejudgment interest payable on Macy\u2019s tax refund should be determined according to a local ordinance that provides for interest at a variable rate, computed from the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1457\">*1457</page-number>the claim for refund is made.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The trial court correctly concluded that prejudgment interest was payable at 7 percent, pursuant to state law, from the time the taxes were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">Article XIII, section 32 of the California Constitution states: \u201cNo legal or equitable process shall issue in any proceeding in any court against this State or any officer thereof to prevent or enjoin the collection of any tax. After payment of a tax claimed to be illegal, an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid, with interest, in such manner as may be provided by the Legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cEvery person who is entitled to recover damages certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right to recover which is vested in him upon a particular day, is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day, except during such time as the debtor is prevented by law, or by the act of the creditor from paying the debt. This section is applicable to recovery of damages and interest from any such debtor, including the state or any county, city, city and county, municipal corporation, public district, public agency, or any political subdivision of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">While Civil Code section 3287 does not specify the rate of interest to be paid, article XV, section 1 of the California Constitution provides: \u201cThe rate of interest upon a judgment rendered in any court of this State shall be set by the Legislature at not more than 10 percent per annum. Such rate may be variable and based upon interest rates charged by federal agencies or economic indicators, or both. [jQ In the absence of the setting of such rate by the Legislature, the rate of interest on any judgment rendered in any court of the State shall be 7 percent per annum.\u201d Thus the courts have applied an interest rate of 7 percent to obligations governed by section 3287. (See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>e.g., <em>Sanders v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 252, 261, 262 [90 Cal.Rptr. 169, 475 P.2d 201]; <em>Walker v. Occidental Life Ins. Co. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 518, 526 [63 Cal.Rptr. 45, 432 P.2d 741]; <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur.

(See <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d at pp. 225-228; <em>ITT Gilfillan, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 581, 584-585 [185 Cal.Rptr. 848]; see also <em>May Dept Stores Co. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1368, 1378 [251 Cal.Rptr. 873].) The City claims those cases are distinguishable, because the Los Angeles ordinance there in question did not provide for the payment of any interest.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The City also argues that certain language in <em>May Dept Stores </em>supports application of the interest rate specified in the City\u2019s ordinance here.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">The City maintains that there are no cases that apply Civil Code section 3287 when a local ordinance provides for interest on local tax refunds, and that a local ordinance governing municipal affairs should prevail unless it conflicts with state law. But here section 3287 and applicable provisions of the California Constitution operate together to require the payment of interest on tax refunds at a rate of 7 percent, from the time the right to recover is vested in the taxpayer. The provisions of the City\u2019s ordinance purporting to apply a different rate of interest, which begins to accrue at a different time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>thus conflicts with state law that occupies the field on a matter of statewide concern. (See <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d at pp. 225-226.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">The City also claims its ordinance provides for the calculation of interest in a manner similar to Revenue and Taxation Code section 5151, which governs refunds of state property taxes.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> But here we are concerned with the rate of interest payable on the refund of a different, local tax to which the Legislature has not extended section 5151. In the absence of another provision by the Legislature, state law provides for an interest rate of 7 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">Finally, the City argues that even under Civil Code section 3287, interest should run from the date of the claim for refund, not from the date of payment, because the taxpayer\u2019s right to recover does not vest until the refund claim is filed. But the case on which the City relies, <em>State of California v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 534, 90 P.3d 116], addressed a different issue. There the court held that a prison inmate who sued the state for failure to provide adequate medical care was required to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate or excuse compliance with the claim presentation requirement of the Tort Claims Act in order to survive a demurrer, and reiterated the principle that compliance with the claim presentation requirement was an element of a cause of action against a public entity. <em>(State of California v. Superior Court, </em>at pp. 1243-1244.) The court did not consider the issue presented here, namely when the right to recover damages vests for purposes of section 3287. In <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>by contrast, the court concluded \u201cthat debt was due, in each instance, on the day the respective payments were wrongfully collected, and in each instance the right to recover vested on the same day on which the money was paid.\u201d <em>(Todd Shipyards Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d at p. 226; accord, <em>ITT Gilfillan Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.3d at p. 585.) This comports with the purpose of prejudgment interest, to compensate the plaintiffs for loss of use of their property. (See <em>Lewis C. Nelson &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clovis Unified School Dist. </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 64, 71-72 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 715].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">The judgment awarding a refund of all taxes paid by Macy\u2019s is reversed, and the case is remanded with directions to enter judgment in an amount sufficient to remedy any potential discriminatory burden imposed by the City\u2019s prior tandem tax from 1995 through 1999.
