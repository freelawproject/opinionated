J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG9\">Shakespeare asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s in a name?\u201d We supply an answer only for the Uniform Commercial Code lien priority statutes; Everything when the last name is true and nothing when the last name is false. When a creditor files a UCC-1 financing statement, the debtor\u2019s true last name is crucial because the financing statements are indexed by last names. A subsequent creditor who loans money to a debtor with the same name is put on notice that its lien is secondary.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The trial court here found that Corona Fruits &amp; Veggies, Inc. and Corona Marketing Company (appellants), failed to perfect a security interest in a strawberry crop because its UCC-1 financing statement erroneously listed the debtor\u2019s last name. We affirm. (Cal. U. Com. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 9503, subd. (a)(4)(A), 9506, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">In 2001, appellants subleased farm land to a strawberry farmer (debtor) who went by the last name of \u201cMunoz.\u201d The sublease, as well as other documents given to appellants, stated that debtor\u2019s name was \u201cArmando <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Munoz Juarez.\u201d That was and is his full true name. But he signed the sublease \u201cArmando Munoz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Appellants advanced money for payroll and farm production expenses. On July 2, 2001, appellants filed a UCC-1 financing statement listing debtor\u2019s name as \u201cArmando Munoz\u201d and a second UCC-1 financing statement on January 17, 2002, listing the same name.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In December 2001, debtor contracted with respondent Frozsun Foods, Inc. (Frozsun Foods) to sell processed strawberries. Frozsun Foods advanced money which was secured by a January 17, 2002 UCC-1 financing statement listing debtor\u2019s last name as \u201cArmando Juarez.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">As of July 26, 2002, debtor owed appellants $230,482.52 and owed Frozsun Foods $19,648.52. When debtor was unable to meet his loan obligations, appellants took back the farm land, harvested the strawberry crop, and kept the crop proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Appellants and Frozsun Foods filed collection actions which were consolidated for trial. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1048, subd. (a).) The trial court found that debtor\u2019s true legal name was \u201cArmando Munoz Juarez, ... as shown on his identification documents as well as the documents of [appellants] and Frozsun, Inc . . . .\u201d The trial court concluded that appellants and Frozsun Foods knew debtor\u2019s true legal name, \u201cbut only Frozsun Foods, Inc. recorded its UCC-1 statement under that full name[.] [I]ts recording supercedes the two recordings by [appellants] using only part of Munoz\u2019s name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\n<em>True Last Name</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">In California, the filing of a UCC-1 financing statement is generally required to perfect a security interest or agricultural lien. (\u00a7 9310, subd. (a); 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Secured Transactions In Personal Property \u00a7 76, p. 634.) \u201cThe requirement that a financing statement provide the debtor\u2019s name is particularly important. Financing statements are indexed under the name of the debtor, and those who wish to find finance statements search for them under the debtor\u2019s name. [Citations.]\u201d (Witkin, <em>supra, </em>pp. 639-640, \u00a7 80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the finding that debtor\u2019s true last name was \u201cJuarez\u201d and not \u201cMunoz.\u201d The pleadings state that debtor\u2019s last name is \u201cJuarez,\u201d as do many of appellants\u2019 business records. Debtor provided appellants with a photo identification and green card bearing the name \u201cArmando Munoz Juarez.\u201d The name appears on the sublease and other documents including the farmer agreement, a crop exhibit, a second sublease agreement (identifying debtor as \u201cJuarez Farms, Armando Munoz Juarez\u201d), a crop assignment, appellants\u2019 accounting records, receipts for advances, appellants\u2019 letters to debtor, and checks issued by appellants. Debtor identified himself by the last name \u201cJuarez\u201d on two tax returns, in tax documents issued by appellants, in debtor\u2019s dealings with the United States Department of Agriculture, in debtor\u2019s bankruptcy petition, and in debtor\u2019s business dealings with Frozsun Foods.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\n<em>Misleading Financing Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Citing <em>Cassel v. Kolb </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 568 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 878], appellants argue that the question of whether they have a perfected security interest is subject to de novo review. It addressed whether a UCC-1 financing statement adequately described the collateral in which a bank claimed a security interest. The Court of Appeal held that interpretation of the security agreement was a question of law. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 573.) We agree with the holding of <em>Cassel v. Kolb, </em>that the adequacy of a UCC-1 financing statement presents a question of law, and is reviewed independently on appeal. This, however, does not aid appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">As a general rule, minor errors in a UCC-1 financing statement do not affect the effectiveness of the financing statement unless the errors render the document seriously misleading to other creditors. (See \u00a7 9506, subd. (a), formerly 9402; <em>Cassel v. Kolb, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th at p. 576; <em>Goldie v. Bauchet Properties </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 307, 320 [124 Cal.Rptr. 161, 540 P.2d 1] [discussing former \u00a7 9402]; <em>In re Softalk Pub. Co., Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 856 F.2d 1328, 1330 [same].) Section 9506, subdivision (b), however, provides: \u201c[A] financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with subdivision (a) of Section 9503 is seriously misleading.\u201d There is a safe harbor. \u201c[I]f a search of the filing office\u2019s records under the debtor\u2019s correct name, using the filing office\u2019s standard search logic, if any, would nevertheless disclose that financing statement, the name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading. (U.C.C. 9506 (c).)\u201d (4 Witkin, supra, Summary of Cal. Law, Secured Transactions in Personal Property, \u00a7 83, at p. 642.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The record indicates that Frozsun\u2019s agent conducted a \u201cJuarez\u201d debtor name search and did not discover appellants\u2019 UCC-1 financing statement. No evidence was presented that the financing statement would have been discovered under debtor\u2019s true legal name, using the filing office\u2019s standard search logic. (\u00a7 9506, subd. (c).) Absent such a showing, the trial court reasonably concluded that the \u201cArmando Munoz\u201d debtor name in appellants\u2019 financing statement was seriously misleading.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u00a7 9506, subds. (b) &amp; (c).) \u201cThe secured party, not the debtor or uninvolved third parties, has the duty of insuring proper filing and indexing of the notice.\u201d <em>(In re Thomas </em>(9th Cir. 1972) 466 F.2d 51, 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\n<em>Naming Convention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Appellants contend that the debtor name requirement is governed by the naming convention of Latin American countries because debtor is from Mexico. We reject the argument because the strawberries were planted in and the debt obligation arose in Santa Barbara County, not Mexico. \u201cIn most Latin American countries, the surname is formed by listing first the father\u2019s name, then the mother\u2019s name... . [T]his is exactly opposite Anglo-American tradition . . . . \u201d <em>(People v. Perez </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 900, 903, fn. 2 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 391].) Debtor\u2019s last name did not change when he crossed the border into the United States. The \u201cnaming convention\u201d is legally irrelevant for UCC-1 financing statement purposes and, if accepted, would seriously undermine the concept of lien perfection.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Appellants knew that debtor\u2019s legal name was \u201cArmando Juarez\u201d or \u201cArmando Munoz Juarez.\u201d Elodia Corona, appellants\u2019 account manager, prepared the UCC financing statements and testified: \u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t put his [i.e., debtor\u2019s] last name [on the UCC-1 financing statement]. I could have made a mistake ...\u201d Ms. Corona was asked: \u201cSo the last name on all the Agreements is Juarez, but on the U.C.C. 1 Forms, you filed them as Munoz?\u201d Ms. Corona answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Appellants are estopped by their pleadings, the contracts, business records, the checks for the cash advances, debtor\u2019s identification papers and tax papers, and the testimony of appellants\u2019 account manager. Appellants could have protected themselves by using both names on their financing statements. (4 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>Summary of California Law, Secured Transactions in Personal Property, \u00a7 80, subd. 7, at p. 640; \u00a7 9503, subd. (e).) The trial court did not err in finding that the UCC-1 financing statement filed by Frozsun Foods perfected a security interest superior to appellants\u2019 liens.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The judgment is affirmed. Frozsun Foods is awarded costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Coffee, J., and Perren, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 20, 2006, S147801.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-12\"> Unless otherwise stated, all statutory references are to the California Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\"> The California Uniform Commercial Code comment to section 9506 states in pertinent part: \u201cSubsection (b) contains the general rule: a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the debtor\u2019s name in accordance with Section 9-503(a) is seriously misleading as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\"> We point out the obvious: Had Frozsun Foods believed that the debtor\u2019s last name was Munoz and filed a UCC-1 financing statement under that name, it would have found the prior financing statement and would have had notice of the prior lien. It then could have made an informed business decision on whether to loan money to the strawberry farmer or not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
