J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Appellant challenges his conviction for four counts of attempted murder and one count of assault with a firearm. His principal contention is that the trial court improperly excluded two of his friends during the examination of a seven-year-old witness. We hold the temporary exclusion of these two spectators did not result in the violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial. We conclude that Penal Code section 686.2 has no application to this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant also challenges his sentence, which we modify. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">In an information filed by the District Attorney of Los Angeles County, appellant was charged with five counts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of attempted, willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder, (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 664.) Count 1 further alleged that in the commission of the crime, appellant personally inflicted great bodily injury upon the victim, causing the victim to become comatose due to brain injury and to suffer paralysis. (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (b).) The information additionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>alleged as to all counts that a principal personally and intentionally discharged a firearm, thereby causing great bodily injury to the victims (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (d), (e)(1)); that a principal personally and intentionally discharged a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (c), (e)(1)); and that a principal personally used a firearm (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b), (e)). The information also alleged that the offenses charged therein were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further and assist in criminal conduct by gang members. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Appellant was tried by a jury and found guilty of willful, deliberate and premeditated attempted murder on four counts (counts, 1, 2, 3, &amp; 5) and guilty of the lesser included offense of assault with a firearm on one count (count 4; \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)). The jury found to be true the allegations in count 1 that appellant personally inflicted great bodily injury upon the victim, thereby causing the victim to suffer paralysis, and that appellant personally and intentionally discharged a firearm, thereby proximately causing great bodily injury to the victim. The jury further found to be true, as to all five counts, the allegations that in the commission of the crimes, appellant acted for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang with the intent to promote, further or assist in criminal conduct by gang members. With respect to counts 2 through 5, the jury found in the commission of the offenses, appellant personally and intentionally discharged a firearm and that appellant personally used a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Probation was denied and appellant was sentenced as follows; count 1, life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 15 years on account of the gang allegation, plus 25 years to life for the use of firearm with great bodily injury enhancement, plus five years for the great bodily injury enhancement, for a total of 40 years to life plus five years; count 2, life imprisonment for attempted murder, with a minimum term of 15 years to life on account of the gang allegation, plus 20 years for the use of firearm enhancement. The term for count 2 was ordered to run consecutive to count 1. On counts 3 and 5, the trial court imposed concurrent sentences identical to count 2. On count 4, the trial court imposed the upper term of 4 years for assault with a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Appellant filed a filed a timely notice of appeal on March 11, 2003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>STATEMENT OF PERTINENT FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The charges against appellant arose from an egregious set of facts, the entire restatement of which is not relevant to the outcome of the appeal. What is relevant is that the charges arose from an incident where a lone gunman came into a public park and shot at a group of adults and children playing in the park. A bullet grazed one of the children. Several adults chased after the shooter, who turned and shot again. One parent (victim in count 1) was shot and paralyzed. Evidence from the incident and expert testimony suggested that the shooting was done for the benefit of a criminal street gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The appeal in this case concerns the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude two apparent friends of appellant from the courtroom during the examination of a seven-year-old boy. The discussion regarding the presence of these spectators began prior to the opening statements in this case. On January 22, 2003, outside of the presence of the jury, the prosecutor informed the trial court that because of the \u201cgang implications\u201d of this case, the mother of a seven-year-old witness was \u201cconcerned about retaliation in the neighborhood.\u201d The mother asked for several accommodations to limit the possibility that her son would be identified. Specifically, she asked if he could testify under the name of John Doe, instead of his own name. The mother also was concerned about having her son testify in the room while certain persons were in the audience inside the courtroom. The prosecutor explained to the trial judge: \u201cAnd she\u2019s also concerned about having\u2014when the child testifies having audience members in the court, as well. I assured\u2014I don\u2019t see any people who appear to be friends of the defendant as far as young males here this morning. And I know his mother who, obviously, has a right to be here. [fJ[] There is one other person who is present, I think, associated with perhaps a mother or an aunt of some of his fellow gang members. And I\u2019m concerned about her presence during the testimony of the child. And I ask that she be excluded as well as any young male Hispanics that might show up this morning, just for the children\u2019s testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The defense counsel indicated that she would object to all of these requests and stated: \u201cAnd as far as people in the audience coming in to testify [szc], I don\u2019t think there has been a showing that there has been any intimidation or any threats by anyone. This is an open proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Defense counsel explained that the men in question were friends of appellant\u2019s family. She stated, \u201cjust because the witnesses feel that for some reason they may be in danger coming here, I don\u2019t think that is a justifiable reason. There is no actual showing of danger to exclude these people from the courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The trial court indicated it understood the prosecutor was suggesting that the court exclude young Hispanic males during testimony of the child witness in question. The court added that it understood there was \u201cimplied intimidation\u201d and that people living in a neighborhood \u201cinfested with these gang people\u201d were concerned and frightened. However, the court acknowledged that it had not yet received any information that there was a danger to any witness at that point in time and it would have to see a danger to a witness. The trial court then denied the prosecutor\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Later, after her opening statements to the jury, the prosecutor engaged in the following discussion with the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I have the child\u2019s mother here. And I want a clarification first on the early ruling. I notice that there are two of the defendant\u2019s friends who have appeared since I made my motion this morning. And I would ask that during the child\u2019s testimony only that they be excluded for the reason, the reasons that I set forth. It is intimidation factor, [f ] . . . [][]</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u201cThe Court: Does the child recognize either of those?</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, the mother\u2019s concern is they will recognize the child when they see him in the neighborhood. And that puts the child\u2019s life in danger. It\u2019s not that the child recognizes them. It is that they will recognize the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The trial judge called counsel to side bar and, after some discussion, granted the \u201cPeople\u2019s motion to the court to exclude public from courtroom during minor witness\u2019s testimony . . . .\u201d The judge then stated: \u201cCertainly the Court has to recognize when we have a witness that is a young witness that we have to make certain accommodations for such a witness. I think probably the appropriate thing, if these are friends of the defendant, why don\u2019t you just ask them to wait outside for the giving of this one testimony, and they can come back in thereafter. I don\u2019t see any harm will be done whatsoever. Certainly, a child is subject to intimidation, as are adults, but a child more so. And I think it would be the appropriate thing to do under these circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Defense counsel then spoke to the judge: \u201cYour honor, then what I would ask this person, I have no interest\u2014I could care less if they\u2019re here or not.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] I did speak with my client. He does know them. I also spoke to his family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>friends and told them to make sure there is no contact whatsoever between any spectator and the witnesses, no riding the elevator, no looks, nothing that could be mistaken the wrong way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Defense counsel went on to say she would ask the two individuals to step out of the courtroom during the child witness\u2019s testimony, and she asked the trial court to take a break before the witness took the stand so the jury would not see the two individuals coming in and out of the courtroom. Defense counsel then repeated:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u201cI understand the district attorney\u2019s concern and I understand the position. But I just think this is an open proceeding. There has been absolutely no showing of any threats made. Like the court indicated, I mean, are these people that the child even recognizes? And if so, how is the witness being intimidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u201cThe Court: Well, again, we are dealing with a very youthful witness. And I\u2019m sure it is a traumatic thing for a witness that age to come into court, anyway, is intimidating. Just in the interest of being sure that the child can relax as much as possible, it would be appropriate for these two gentlemen to leave just during this witness\u2019s testimony. Thereafter they can come back as long as they conduct themselves in the proper fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Defense counsel also asked the court to take a five-minute break after the testimony of the child witness was completed, so that the two individuals who were going to be excluded during the witness\u2019s testimony could return to the courtroom. The trial court granted this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">CONTENTIONS ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\n<em>Right to Public Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention is that the exclusion of two spectators who were friends of appellant\u2019s violated his constitutional and statutory rights to a public trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant cites <em>People v. Cummings </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1233 [18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1] <em>(Cummings), </em>in support of his argument regarding the constitutional violation. In <em>Cummings, </em>a defendant convicted of murdering a peace officer claimed that the trial court erred when it failed to excuse a number of uniformed police officers in the courtroom as spectators. Rejecting the argument, the Supreme Court held: \u201cIn this case there was no effort to close the proceedings. Nonetheless, Cummings sought to exclude a segment of the public. As members of the public, the police officers had both common law and constitutionally based rights to attend the trial. Exclusion of any group on the basis of the members\u2019 status would be impermissible.\u201d <em>(Cummings, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 1298-1299.) Appellant argues \u201cthe exclusion of Mr. Esquibel\u2019s friends was an especially egregious violation of Mr. Esquibel\u2019s right to a public trial, because preserving the ability of a defendant to have his friends and other supporters attend his trial is one of the core purposes of the public trial guarantee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Appellant then states that no reported case has decided whether the exclusion of a spectator violates a defendant\u2019s right to a public trial absent compliance with section 686.2. Appellant argues that the exclusion of appellant\u2019s friends fails to satisfy any of the requirements of section 686.2, which provides guidelines for the exclusion of spectators.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In a second supplemental opening brief, appellant argues in further detail that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of his friends from the courtroom during trial testimony violated appellant\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights to a public trial and that error requires reversal of the judgment in this case. He argues further that no showing of prejudice is required by appellant if such a violation has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\n<em>Sentencing Errors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Appellant argues that his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury was violated by the trial court\u2019s imposition of the upper term on both convictions because the terms were based on facts not determined to be true by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">His second claimed sentencing error deals with count 1. The trial court imposed both a 25-years-to-life enhancement based on the jury\u2019s finding that appellant personally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)) and a five-year enhancement based on the jury\u2019s findings that appellant personally inflicted great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7) on Taalefuli Ryan, causing him to suffer paralysis. Respondent concedes the sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>\n<em>Respondent\u2019s Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">In his brief respondent acknowledges both <em>the </em>United States Constitution and the California Constitution provide that a person charged with a criminal offense is entitled to a public trial and \u201c[a] public trial ordinarily is one which is open to the general public at all times. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodward </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 376, 383 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 434, 841 P.2d 954]; <em>People v. Byrnes </em>(1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 72, 73 [190 P.2d 290].)\u201d Nevertheless, in defense of the action of the trial court, respondent argues that \u201c[a] trial court has discretion to close a portion of a trial to the public even without the consent of or waiver by the defendant when there is good cause for such action based upon justice or protection of the parties. <em>(People v. Cash </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 841, 846 [345 P.2d 462].)\u201d Alternatively, respondent argues that the trial court \u201cproperly excluded these two person [sic] in order to protect child witness from harassment and possible physical harm\u201d and that the error, if any, was clearly harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>Right to Public Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">This appeal is decided by the resolution of two questions: first, whether the exclusion of two spectators from appellant\u2019s trial was a violation of either his constitutional or statutory right to a public trial; and second, if there was any violation, what is the remedy. We conclude in this instance there was no constitutional violation and that any violation of appellant\u2019s statutory right to an open trial (\u00a7 686.2) was de minimis and not prejudicial. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\n<em>Constitutional Right to a Public Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">The right to a public trial is deeply rooted in the history and jurisprudence of our nation. The origins of the right trace back to the Magna Carta and the Bible. As a result of our history, we distrust secret inquisitions and star chamber proceedings. Accordingly, in criminal cases, both the United States and the California State Constitutions guarantee the right to a public trial. (U.S. Const., 6th &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>The observance of the right to a public trial precludes the closure of substantive courtroom proceedings in criminal cases. \u201c \u2018The requirement of a public trial is for the benefit of the accused; that the public may see he is fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned, and that the presence of interested spectators may keep his triers keenly alive to a sense of their responsibility and to the importance of their functions . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Oliver </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 257, 270, fn. 25 [92 L.Ed. 682, 68 S.Ct. 499] <em>(Oliver).) </em>\u201cIn addition to ensuring that judge and prosecutor carry out their duties responsibly, a public trial encourages witnesses to come forward and discourages perjury.\u201d <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 39, 46 [81 L.Ed.2d 31, 104 S.Ct. 2210] <em>(Waller); </em>see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Woodward, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 385 <em>(Woodward), </em>cert. den. <em>sub nom. Woodward v. California </em>(1993) 507 U.S. 1053 [123 L.Ed.2d 655, 113 S.Ct. 1950] [federal and state constitutional rights to public trial are coextensive].)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Due to its constitutional significance and difficulty in proving prejudice, when a violation of the right to a public trial has occurred, there is no requirement to prove any specific prejudice to the appellant. (See <em>Waller, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 45; <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 279 [113 L.Ed.2d 302, 111 S.Ct. 1246]; <em>People v. Byrnes, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.2d 72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The right to an open public trial is not the right of only the criminal defendant, but is rather a shared right of the accused and the public, the common concern being the assurance of fairness. <em>(Los Angeles Times </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 247 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 524].) The term \u201cpublic trial\u201d has no single description, but is used in a relative sense and its meaning depends largely upon the circumstances of each particular case. <em>(People v. Buck </em>(1941) 46 Cal.App.2d 558 [116 P.2d 160].)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Importantly, the United States Supreme Court \u201chas made clear that the right to an open trial may give way in certain cases to other rights or interests, such as the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial or the government\u2019s interest in inhibiting disclosure of sensitive information. Such circumstances will be rare, however, and the balance of interests must be struck with special care.\u201d <em>(Waller, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 45.) Consequently both the defendant\u2019s and the public\u2019s right may be subjected to reasonable restrictions that are necessary or convenient to the orderly procedure of trial, and the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>retains broad discretion to control courtroom proceedings in a manner directed toward promoting the safety of witnesses. <em>(Alvarado v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 1121 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 149, 5 P.3d 203].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In general, there are two types of exclusions: a total closure where all spectators are directed to leave the courtroom and a partial closure where some, but not all, spectators are asked to leave.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The total closure of the courtroom is almost always a per se violation of the constitutional rights of the accused. In the case of a partial closure, the Sixth Amendment public trial guarantee creates a \u201c \u2018presumption of openness\u2019 \u201d that can be rebutted only by a showing that exclusion of the public was necessary to protect some \u201c \u2018higher valueQ\u2019 \u201d such as the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, or the government\u2019s interest in preserving the confidentiality of the proceedings. (See <em>Waller, supra, </em>467 U.S. at pp. 44-45.) When such a \u201chigher value\u201d is advanced, the trial court must balance the competing interests and allow a form of exclusion no broader than needed to protect those interests. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Specific written findings are required to enable a reviewing court to determine the propriety of the exclusion. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 45.) There is also a subcategory of the partial closure which includes the circumstances of this case where only certain identified spectators are excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The identity of the spectator sought to be excluded is highly relevant in a partial closure situation. The United States Supreme Court made the following important observation in the <em>Oliver </em>case: Absent certain special circumstances not relevant here, \u201c[N]o court in this country has ever before held, so far as we can find, that an accused can be tried, convicted, and sent to jail, when everybody else is denied entrance to the court, except the judge and his attaches. <em>And without exception all courts have held that an accused is at the very least entitled to have his friends, relatives and counsel present, no matter with what offense he may be </em>charged.\u201d <em>(Oliver, supra, </em>333 U.S. at pp. 271-272, fn. omitted &amp; italics added; see also <em>State v. Ortiz </em>(1999) 91 Haw. 181 [981 P.2d 1127] [complete exclusion of appellant\u2019s family members].) The application of the above principles and the issue whether an accused has been denied his constitutional right to a public trial cannot be determined in the abstract, but must be determined by reference to the facts of the particular case. <em>(People v. Cash, supra, </em>52 Cal.2d 841, 847.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\n<em>California Constitutional Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The leading California case on the exclusion of spectators from a trial is <em>Woodward, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th 376. In <em>Woodward, </em>during the closing arguments, at the request of the trial judge the bailiff posted a sign on the courtroom doors announcing \u201ctrial in progress\u2014please do not enter.\u201d Courtroom spectators who were already present were not required to leave and additional spectators were permitted to enter at designated recesses. Neither defense counsel nor the defendant was asked to agree with this procedure. Considering the propriety of this procedure, the Supreme Court held: \u201c[T]he right to public trial encompasses the closing argument phase of the trial. But we also conclude that the closure of the courtroom doors to additional spectators during part of the prosecutor\u2019s arguments, being both temporary in duration and motivated by legitimate concerns to maintain security and prevent continuous interruptions of closing arguments, and not involving the exclusion of preexisting spectators, did not constitute a denial of defendant\u2019s public trial right.\u201d <em>(Woodward, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 381.) The <em>Woodward </em>court then cited several federal cases that held the temporary exclusion of the public did not seriously deprive a defendant of his public trial right.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\n<em>Application to Present Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The exclusion in this case was a partial exclusion of two Hispanic male spectators during the testimony of a single minor witness. There was no evidence of any special relationship between the spectators and appellant, other than friendship. There seems to be no dispute that appellant\u2019s family members remained in the courtroom during this examination. These spectators were removed at the request of the prosecutor based on the concern and urging of the mother of the witness. Her principal concern in this gang related case was that the spectators may be gang members and would recognize her child in the neighborhood, not that her child may recognize them. There was no evidence of intimidation or harassment. Over the objection of appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the trial court excluded these spectators during the child\u2019s examination. There was no compliance with section 686.2, nor did the procedure attempt to meet the test suggested by <em>U. S. v. Sherlock, supra, </em>865 F.2d 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Nevertheless, based on the California and federal authority described above, we conclude that this exclusion was not a violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional right to an open trial. There was no order excluding the press or the public in general. Except for these two spectators, no one else connected with appellant was excluded from the courtroom and the exclusion was only for the testimony of the single witness. Members of appellant\u2019s family remained in the courtroom. There was no showing that the excluded individuals had any special relationship to appellant or were needed to provide him support during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We conclude the partial closure of a trial by the temporary exclusion of select supporters of the accused does not create an automatic violation of the constitutional right to a public trial. Furthermore, on the facts of this case, we conclude there was no constitutional violation of appellant\u2019s rights. To hold otherwise would not serve the purposes of the public trial right. Here, the exclusion of the spectators was for a minimal amount of time and appellant\u2019s family supporters remained in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\n<em>California Statutory Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In addition to state and federal constitutional requirements, in California there are statutes setting forth requirements for excluding certain spectators from a public criminal trial. \u201cA trial court also retains broad discretion. to control courtroom proceedings in a manner directed toward promoting the safety of witnesses. (See, e.g., \u00a7 868.7, subd. (a)(2) [upon motion of the prosecutor, a magistrate may close the examination of a witness \u2018[w]hose life would be subject to a substantial risk in appearing before the general public\u2019]; see also \u00a7 686.2 [authorizing the trial court to remove any spectator who is intimidating a witness]; \u00a7 867 [authorizing the magistrate to exclude potential and actual witnesses upon motion of either party]; \u00a7 868 [authorizing the magistrate to exclude the public upon the request of the defendant and a finding by the magistrate \u2018that exclusion of the public is necessary in order to protect tire defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial\u2019]; <em>People v. Woodward, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th [at pp.] 382-386 [upholding the temporary closure of the courtroom to additional spectators during a murder trial, in view of the \u2018unusual security risks\u2019 posed by the trial]; <em>NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1222, fn. 46 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 778, 980 P.2d 337] [noting that among the \u2018overriding interests\u2019 that may justify closure <em>of </em>a courtroom in an appropriate instance is the protection of witnesses from intimidation].)\u201d <em>(Alvarado v. Superior Court, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 1150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Appellant contends that the exclusion of the spectators in this case violated section 686.2, subdivision (b), which provides that a court may order the removal of any spectator who is intimidating a witness, but only after holding a hearing and making the following findings by clear and convincing evidence;</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u201c(1) The spectator to be removed is actually engaging in intimidation of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u201c(2) The witness will not be able to give full, free, and complete testimony unless the spectator is removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u201c(3) Removal of the spectator is the only reasonable means of ensuring that the witness may give full, free, and complete testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">We agree with appellant that the record shows the exclusion of the spectators in this case was not in compliance with section 686.2. However, we find that section 686.2 has no application to the facts of this case. By its own terms, it only applies when there is a proposed exclusion of a spectator who is engaged in the active intimidation of a witness. When the predicate facts are present, the statute directs the court how to handle the exclusion of the offending spectator. Here, there is no evidence of any intimidation by the spectators in this case. They were excluded based solely on the concerns of the witness\u2019s mother for the safety of her child. There is no evidence of any conduct, act or attitude by the spectators which would call for the application of section 686.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Although the statute has no application in this case, we end, however, with the reminder that trial courts should proceed with extreme caution in this area. The exclusion of any nondisruptive spectator from a criminal trial should never be undertaken without a full evaluation of the necessity for the exclusion and the alternatives that might be taken. This evaluation should be reflected in the record of the proceedings. The evaluation would fulfill the statutory requirements for exclusion of persons from a trial, if any, and assist in the evaluation of any alleged constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">SENTENCING ERRORS</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\"><em>Waiver or Forfeiture of </em>Blakely <em>Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Under California law, a defendant\u2019s failure to object in the trial court, even to errors of constitutional dimension, may lead to forfeiture of his claim of error on appeal. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Seaton </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 598, 634\u2014637 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 28 P.3d 175] [selection of unbiased jury]; <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>Barnum </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1210, 1224-1225, fn. 2 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 499, 64 P.3d 788] [5th Amend, privilege against self-incrimination]; <em>People v. Saunders </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 580, 590 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 638, 853 P.2d 1093] [right to jury trial on truth of alleged prior convictions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Appellant argues that his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury was violated by the trial court\u2019s imposition of the upper term on count 4 because the term was based on facts not determined to be true by a jury. The Attorney General contends appellant waived any claim of <em>Blakely </em>error by failing to request a jury trial of the aggravating factors in the trial court. We disagree. Although we understand the well-established notion of waiver of a claim of error, we find there is no waiver or forfeiture of <em>Blakely </em>error in this case because a criminal defendant cannot have forfeited or waived a legal argument that was not recognized at the time of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\n<em>Imposition of the Upper Term</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Appellant argues that his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury was violated by the trial court\u2019s imposition of the upper term on count 4 because the term was based on facts not determined to be true by a jury. Appellant contends the upper term on count 4 must be vacated and the middle term imposed, because the aggravating factors used to justify the upper term were not found true beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury as required under <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348], as construed in <em>Blakely v. Washington, supra, </em>542 U.S. 296. Based on more recent authority, this contention has no merit. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Booker, supra, </em>543 U.S. 220; <em>People </em>v. <em>Black, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th 1238, 1257-1261.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\n<em>Sentence Enhancements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">With regard to count 1, the trial court imposed both a 25-years-to-life enhancement based on the jury\u2019s finding that appellant personally discharged a firearm and a five-year enhancement based on the jury\u2019s findings that appellant personally inflicted great bodily injury on Taalefuli Ryan and caused him to suffer paralysis. Respondent concedes the sentencing error and upon resentencing the trial court is directed to impose and stay the section 12022.7 enhancement to appellant\u2019s sentence in the new abstract of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The trial court is ordered to impose and stay the section 12022.7 enhancement and prepare a new abstract of judgment.

The appeal was then taken by the California Supreme Court and the prior opinion vacated. The case was then remanded to this court for further consideration in light of <em>People v.
