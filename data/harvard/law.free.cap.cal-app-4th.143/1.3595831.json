The order invalidated a special condition of Hudson\u2019s parole that prohibited him from possessing or having access to computers, the Internet, or camera equipment absent permission from the Department of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO). The superior court granted the petition, finding the condition both unreasonable and overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">The Department argues that the petition should not have been heard because Hudson failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The Department also argues that the disputed parole condition was neither unreasonable nor overbroad. We agree with the superior court that Hudson exhausted his administrative remedies. After reviewing the record, however, we find that the parole condition is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances of this case. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">In 1998 in Contra Costa County Hudson was convicted by plea of lewd conduct with a child under the age of 14. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victim was an 11-year-old boy who first met Hudson when Hudson was a coach of the boy\u2019s roller hockey team. Hudson was arrested after the boy complained that Hudson had unbuttoned the boy\u2019s pants and fondled the boy\u2019s genitals on three to six occasions over a span of three to five months. In connection with the arrest, a police officer conducted a search of Hudson\u2019s vehicle, and found paperwork that had been downloaded from the Internet a few days earlier. The paperwork included an article concerning false allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>tions of child abuse and a list of instructions on what to do if one is accused of child molestation. Hudson was sentenced to one year in county jail and five years of formal probation. Hudson\u2019s probation conditions did not prohibit him from having contact with children.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">In May 1999, a probation officer conducting a search of Hudson\u2019s residence reported that Hudson quickly logged off a computer when the officer entered. In February of 2001, another probation search of Hudson\u2019s residence uncovered a paper publication of \u201cobvious\u201d child pornography, newspaper articles about children and about child molesters being arrested, and various thank you letters that Hudson had received from organizations that serve children. At this time Hudson\u2019s computer was seized but the officers were unable to access the computer\u2019s hard drive because it was encrypted. Hudson refused to provide the password for his computer to the police. During a probation search in April 2001, the officers seized, among other things, hundreds of photographs of children, a desktop computer with an attached web camera and Internet access, and a laptop computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">On June 4, 2001, in Santa Clara County, Hudson was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of violating section 647.6, subdivision (a) (annoying or molesting a child under the age of 18). According to the police report, Hudson had taken photographs of two young boys that lived next door and had displayed these photographs on his computer. He had also placed his hands on the boys\u2019 shoulders while they played games on the computer. Following this conviction, the probation officer in Contra Costa County recommended that Hudson\u2019s probation for the 1998 conviction be revoked. In support of this recommendation, the probation officer stated: \u201cMr. Hudson\u2019s attitude about his behavior, his sophistication with computers and refusal to provide the password for his computer to police, his ongoing contact with potential victims, compounded by his resistance to treatment make Mr. Hudson very dangerous for children in any neighborhood.\u201d Hudson\u2019s probation was revoked and he was sentenced to six years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">On March 26, 2005, Hudson filed an administrative appeal form. On the first page of the form, under \u201cDescribe Problem,\u201d Hudson stated: \u201cThe State\u2019s imposition of a mandatory 3-year parole term to be served after, not concurrent with, his agreed 6-year prison term and special conditions of that parole violate his plea agreement. These are significant punishments outside of the agreement that severly <em>[sic] </em>impact his liberty interests. They are based on inaccurate facts and facts not stipulated nor proven by jury. They are unconstitutionally overbroad, vague, and not related to legitimate government objectives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>On June 8, 2005 (two days after his scheduled release date), Hudson filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court. As his first ground for relief, Hudson stated: \u201cPetitioner asserts that numerous special conditions of parole violate numerous constitutional rights such as freedom of association, freedom of the press, freedom of the right to work, the right to privacy, etc.\u201d With respect to exhaustion of administrative remedies, Hudson stated: \u201cPetitioner has filed an administrative appeal with Department of Corrections Parole and Community Services Department and has <em>[sic] </em>been over 30 days and I have had no response. The paroleing <em>[sic] </em>authority, the Board of Prison Terms no longer has an administrative appeals unit under Title 15, Section 2050 and therefore petitioner must make his application to the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">On August 4, 2005, the superior court issued an order to show cause, directing the Attorney General to show why four of Hudson\u2019s special parole conditions did not \u201cunlawfully deprive [Hudson] of his freedom.\u201d The Attorney General filed a return, arguing that Hudson had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The Attorney General also proposed to modify three of the special conditions, while retaining the condition on computer usage that is disputed here. In his traverse, Hudson stated that he had filed four separate appeals with state, regional, and local parole offices. The authorities did not act on any of the appeals, nor did they send Hudson any followup notice regarding the appeals. According to the Department, the state parole agency properly screened out Hudson\u2019s initial appeal because \u201cit did not have the jurisdiction to address the three-year imposition of parole, which must be addressed by the [Board of Prison Terms].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">On November 28, 2005, the superior court issued an order granting relief without an evidentiary hearing. The court found that Hudson had exhausted his administrative remedies because \u201cthe [DAPO] had the appeal of [Hudson] and indicated that it had no intention of acting upon it.\u201d The court then struck the parole condition restricting Hudson\u2019s computer usage as \u201cunreasonable and overbroad,\u201d citing <em>In re Stevens </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1233-1234 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 168] <em>(Stevens). </em>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Because the superior court based its decision solely on documentary evidence without holding an evidentiary hearing, we independently review the record to determine whether the writ was properly granted. <em>(In re Rosenkrantz </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 616, 677 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 104, 59 P.3d 174]; <em>In re DeLuna </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 585, 591 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 643].)</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">I. <em>Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The Department argues that Hudson did not exhaust his administrative remedies, asserting \u201cthere is no recognized exception to exhaustion based on the administrative agency\u2019s refusal to act on the appeal.\u201d The Department\u2019s position is that Hudson\u2019s appeal was \u201cproperly screened out\u201d because DAPO did not have the jurisdiction to address the imposition of parole. Hudson asserts that he is not relying on any exception to the exhaustion requirement. Rather, he asserts that he has exhausted his administrative remedies because he has \u201ctaken his appeal as far as the regulations allowed under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">It is well settled that inmates must exhaust available administrative remedies before filing a petition for habeas corpus in the courts. <em>(In re Muszalski </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 500, 508 [125 Cal.Rptr, 286].) \u201cThe exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement furthers several important societal and governmental interests. These include bolstering administrative autonomy, mitigating damages, giving agencies opportunity to make factual findings, encouraging settlement, filtering out frivolous claims, fostering better prepared litigation, and promoting judicial economy. [Citations.] In addition, the requirement ensures \u2018the use of administrative agency expertise and capability to order and monitor corrective measures . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wright v. State of California </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 659, 666 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 92].)</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">It is also true, however, that \u201cthe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies has not hardened into inflexible dogma. [Citation.] It contains its own exceptions, as when the subject matter of the controversy lies outside the administrative agency\u2019s jurisdiction [citation], when pursuit of an administrative remedy would result in irreparable harm [citations], when the administrative agency cannot grant an adequate remedy [citations], and when the aggrieved party can positively state what the administrative agency\u2019s decision in his particular case would be.\u201d <em>(Ogo Associates </em>v. <em>City of Torrance </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 830, 834 [112 Cal.Rptr. 761].)</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">The regulations of the Department of Corrections provide for a multilevel review process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An inmate contesting a condition of parole must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>file an appeal with a regional appeals coordinator within 15 working days following receipt of the decision outlining conditions of parole. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 3084.7, subd. (g)(1).) Both the informal and the first level of review are waived, and the appeals coordinator is required to forward the appeal to the regional parole administrator for second level review. The second level review must be completed within 30 working days. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 3084.6, subd. (b)(3).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, an inmate or parolee must submit an appeal to the third level review within 15 working days \u201cof receiving an unacceptable lower level appeal decision.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 3084.6, subd. (c).) The regulations do not specify how the third level of review is reached in the event that the second level of review is never undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">We conclude that Hudson has exhausted his administrative remedies. DAPO did not undertake the second level review process and the applicable regulations do not specify what procedures a parolee is to follow in the event of DAPO inaction. Admittedly, Hudson\u2019s initial administrative appeal did not focus precisely on the disputed parole conditions. Nevertheless, Hudson did contest the imposition of the special conditions within his appeal and there is' nothing in the record indicating that DAPO provided Hudson with any type of followup response.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that Hudson exhausted his administrative remedies and we now proceed to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>II. <em>Parole Condition Restricting Access to Computers and the Internet</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">We first observe that \u201c[i]n California, parolee status carries distinct disadvantages when compared to the situation of the law-abiding citizen. Even when released from actual confinement, a parolee is still constructively a prisoner subject to correctional authorities. [Citations.] The United States Supreme Court has characterized parole as \u2018an established variation on imprisonment\u2019 and a parolee as possessing \u2018not ... the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only ... the conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special parole restrictions.\u2019 [Citations.] Our own Supreme Court holds a like opinion: \u2018Although a parolee is no longer confined in prison his custody status is one which requires . . . restrictions which may not be imposed on members of the public generally.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Lewis </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 662, 669-670 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 231].) These principles governing the status of a parolee were again recently approved by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Samson </em>v. <em>California </em>(2006) 547 U.S._[165 L.Ed.2d 250, 258, 126 S.Ct. 2193, 2198].</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The fundamental goals of parole are \u201c \u2018to help individuals reintegrate into society as constructive individuals\u2019 [citation], \u2018 \u201cto end criminal careers through the rehabilitation of those convicted of crime\u201d \u2019 [citation] and to [help them] become self-supporting.\u201d <em>(Stevens, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1233.) In furtherance of these goals, \u201c[t]he state may impose any condition reasonably related to parole supervision.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>These conditions \u201cmust be reasonably related to the compelling state interest of fostering a law-abiding lifestyle in the parolee.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1234.)</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\u201cA condition of [parole] will not be held invalid unless it \u2018(1) has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] Conversely, a condition of [parole] which requires or forbids conduct which is not itself criminal is valid if that conduct is reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant was convicted or to future criminality.\u201d <em>(People v. Lent </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 481, 486 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545], fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">In urging that we affirm the superior court\u2019s order, Hudson relies primarily on <em>Stevens, </em>which is the leading California case on conditions of parole that restrict computer access by persons convicted of child molestation offenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Like Hudson, the defendant in <em>Stevens </em>was convicted of violating section 288, subdivision (a). <em>(Stevens, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1231.) His computer was seized after his initial arrest. The computer was searched and the authorities determined that it had not been \u201cused to download child pornography, to contact the victim, or to commit a crime.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>When he was released on parole, the Board of Prison Terms imposed the following condition: \u201c \u2018You shall not possess or have access to computer hardware or software including the internet [szc].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant filed a petition for habeas corpus with the superior court, arguing that the condition infringed on his right to obtain gainful employment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The superior court denied the petition and he sought relief from the court of appeal. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The appellate court acknowledged that the parole authority \u201cwas legitimately concerned that a released child molester\u2019s unfettered access to a computer might result in criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(Stevens, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1239.) The court concluded, however, that the complete prohibition on use of computers and the Internet \u201cbore no relation to [defendant\u2019s] conviction for child molestation and imposed a greater restriction of his rights than was reasonably necessary to accomplish the state\u2019s legitimate goal.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">In <em>People v. Harrisson </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 637, 646 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 264] <em>(Harrisson), </em>the Third District distinguished <em>Stevens </em>on its facts. In <em>Harrisson, </em>the defendant had been convicted of possession of child pornography. He challenged a probation condition that forbade him from accessing the Internet, relying on <em>Stevens. </em>The court distinguished <em>Stevens </em>because the defendant had previously violated a ban on accessing the Internet and had viewed pornography on his computer. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 647.) Additionally, the defendant had recently expressed a desire to seek revenge against the prosecutor. The court found that \u201c[g]iven the facts specific to this case, we find the prohibition against Internet usage reasonably related to defendant\u2019s offense and necessary to the important dual goals of deterrence and protection of the public.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Like the court in <em>Harrisson, </em>we find that the circumstances of this case distinguish it from <em>Stevens. </em>We are particularly troubled by the fact that Hudson deliberately encrypted his computer and withheld his password from authorities while he was on probation for his first offense. While Hudson points out that, like the defendant in <em>Stevens, </em>his first offense did not involve a computer, this case is distinguishable in that the authorities in <em>Stevens </em>were able search his computer and verify that he had not used it to further his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>criminal conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Hudson deliberately prevented the authorities from searching his computer while he was on probation, similar verification was not available to the authorities in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find the special condition is related to Hudson\u2019s offense and is reasonably related to deterring future criminality.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Additionally, unlike the condition that was at issue in <em>Stevens, </em>the special condition here is not a blanket prohibition. Hudson will be allowed to use a computer and access the Internet if he first obtains permission from DAPO. Hudson argues that the requirement that he obtain permission from his parole officer is akin to a total ban, and therefore represents a \u201cdistinction . . . without a difference.\u201d Hudson asserts that his right to use a computer is jeopardized by the parole officer\u2019s \u201cunfettered and effectively unreviewable discretion to ban use.\u201d Yet many of the conditions of Hudson\u2019s parole are subject to the DAPO\u2019s permission, including his employment, where he may live, and when he may travel more than 25 miles from his residence. Parole officers must exercise a certain amount of discretion and we will not assume that DAPO will unreasonably withhold permission for legitimate computer and Internet usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Finally, we note that other courts have upheld similarly worded conditions: \u201cWe are persuaded that limiting [defendant]\u2019s Internet access without prior approval of the Probation Office is reasonably related to the offense [of transmission of child pornography], and to the important goal of deterring him during the period of supervision from reverting to similar conduct, and thus, to rehabilitation and protecting the public. The condition does not plainly involve a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purpose because it is not absolute; rather, it allows for approval of appropriate online access by the Probation Office.\u201d <em>(United States v. Rearden </em>(9th Cir. 2003) 349 F.3d 608, 621; see also <em>United States v. Zinn </em>(11th Cir. 2003) 321 F.3d 1084, 1093.)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The order of the trial court is reversed.
