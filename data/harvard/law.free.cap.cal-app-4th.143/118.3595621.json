In proceedings following the registration, the trial court adjudicated the amount of arrears owed under the order, including those incurred prior to registration, and determined that Gregory S. Jenkins, the obligor under the support order, owed over $3,000 in child support to his former wife, Amy D. de Leon.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In this appeal Jenkins contends that because neither he nor de Leon challenged the registration of the out-of-state support order and its statement that there were no arrears, within the 20-day period provided by statute the statement of arrears was \u201cconfirmed by operation of law\u201d under Family Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 4955, subdivision (b), precluding any further adjudication of the preregistration amount of arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">As discussed below, we disagree. The statute only binds a nonregistering party who fails to object prior to registration \u201cwith respect to any matter <em>that could have been asserted at the time of </em>registration.\u201d (\u00a7 4957, italics added.) Under the statute, de Leon could not have objected to an understatement of arrears at the time of registration, and consequently, she was not precluded from later objecting on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">After almost four years of marriage, Jenkins and de Leon were divorced by a New Mexico court in February 2002. As part of the divorce proceedings, the parties entered into a Marital Settlement Agreement (Agreement) that was incorporated into the dissolution judgment issued by the New Mexico court. The judgment provides that Jenkins is to pay child support of $915 a month for the parties\u2019 two children, 100 percent of the childrens\u2019 daycare expenses and a pro rata share of their uninsured medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">On September 4, 2003, DCSS registered the New Mexico judgment in superior court in San Diego County where de Leon now resides. DCSS filed a standard form \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d along with the New Mexico judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the form, under \u201cSupport Amount/Frequency,\u201d DCSS listed \u201c$915.00/monthly,\u201d and under the \u201cAmount of Arrears,\u201d DCSS listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u201c$0.00.\u201d The \u201cPeriod of Computation\u201d of the arrears listed was left blank. At the bottom of the form, under \u201cOther,\u201d DCSS noted \u201cMedical Only Case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The court clerk sent Jenkins a \u201cNotice of Registration of Out of State Support Order\u201d and attached the Registration Statement and New Mexico judgment. The notice warns: \u201cIf you fail to contest the validity or enforcement of the attached order within 25 days of the date this notice was mailed, the order will be confirmed by the court and you will not be able to contest any portion of the order including the amount of arrears as specified in item 1 of the Registration Statement.\u201d There is no indication in the record that any notice was sent to de Leon. Neither Jenkins nor de Leon filed any objection to the registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">On May 21, 2004, Jenkins received a notice from the United States Department of the Treasury indicating that a portion of his federal income tax refund had been intercepted by DCSS. Jenkins filed a motion in the superior court requesting that these funds be returned to him; Jenkins claimed he was not delinquent in his child support payments, and that, in fact, de Leon owed him money. De Leon then filed a request seeking a judicial determination of unreimbursed medical and daycare expenses under the New Mexico judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The trial court held a hearing on the matters on September 16, 2004, and again on October 28, 2004. After the hearings, the court determined that Jenkins owed de Leon $3,145.26 in daycare costs and uninsured medical expenses (a total that included costs incurred prior to the registration of the order), and ordered that those sums be paid from Jenkins\u2019s federal income tax refund.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Jenkins\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in interpreting the governing statutory law\u2014sections 4954, 4955 and 4957\u2014to allow it to adjudicate preregistration arrears despite de Leon\u2019s failure to object within the statutorily prescribed time period to the Registration Statement\u2019s pronouncement that no arrears were owed. We evaluate this argument below after setting out the applicable statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\n<em>Statutory Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), section 4900 et seq., which has been adopted by all 50 states, \u201cgoverns, inter alia, the procedures for establishing, enforcing and modifying child support orders in cases in which more than one state is involved.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Crosby &amp; Grooms </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 201, 206 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 146].) Together with the Federal Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B), \u201cthe UIFSA ensures that in every case only one state exercises jurisdiction over child support at any given time.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Crosby &amp; Grooms, </em>at p. 206.) UIFSA was designed to eliminate the \u201cmultiple support order system\u201d that had evolved under the previous uniform statute, the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (RURESA). (UIFSA Com., 29F West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code (2004) foil. \u00a7 4950, p. 541.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Under UIFSA as enacted in California, a \u201csupport order\u201d of another state may be registered in this state \u201cfor enforcement\u201d (\u00a7 4950) by sending a \u201cletter of transmittal to the tribunal requesting registration and enforcement,\u201d two copies of the order to be registered, \u201c[a] sworn statement by the person requesting registration or a certified statement by the custodian of the records showing the amount of any arrearage,\u201d and the name and other identifying information regarding the obligor and obligee of the order. (\u00a7 4951, subd. (a).) Once registered, the out-of-state order \u201cis enforceable in the same manner and is subject to the same procedures as an order issued by a tribunal of this state,\u201d but may not, absent certain limited circumstances not pertinent here, be modified by the California court. (\u00a7 4952; see <em>Scheuerman v. Hauk </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 1140, 1144 [11 Cal.Rptr.3d 125] <em>(Scheuerman).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">An out-of-state support order need not be registered by the obligee of the order, but may be registered by \u201ca stranger to the litigation, for example a grandparent or an employer of an alleged obligor,\u201d or, as in this case, by a government agency such as DCSS. (UIFSA Com., 29F West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 4955, p. 556.) Under other statutory law, DCSS is authorized to register an out-of-state support order on its own initiative when the subject child \u201cis receiving public assistance, including Medi-Cal,\u201d or after being \u201crequested\u201d to do so when the child is not receiving public assistance. (\u00a7 17400, subd. (a); see <em>Codoni </em>v. <em>Codoni </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 18, 21 [126 . Cal.Rptr.2d 423].)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>UIFSA provides that whenever an out-of-state support order is filed, \u201cthe registering tribunal shall notify the nonregistering party.\u201d (\u00a7 4954, subd. (a).) The notice \u201cshall inform the nonregistering party: (1) That a registered order is enforceable as of the date of registration in the same manner as an order issued by a tribunal of this state; [ft] (2) That a hearing to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order must be requested within 20 days after notice; [f] (3) That failure to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order in a timely manner will result in confirmation of the order and enforcement of the order and the alleged arrearages and precludes further contest of that order with respect to any matter that could have been asserted; and [][] (4) Of the amount of any alleged arrearages.\u201d (\u00a7 4954, subd. (b).) \u201cIf the nonregistering party fails to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order in a timely manner, the order is confirmed by operation of law\u201d (\u00a7 4955, subd. (b)), and such confirmation \u201cprecludes further contest of the order with respect to any matter that could have been asserted at the time of registration\u201d (\u00a7 4957).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\n<em>Under the Statute, a Nonregistering Obligee Is Not Precluded from Objecting to an Understatement of Arrears After Registration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Sections 4954, 4955 and 4957 provide that absent timely objection, the statement of arrears included in a registration statement becomes binding on \u201cthe nonregistering party.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 4954, 4955.) Jenkins contends that the application of these sections to the instant case establishes that DCSS\u2019s registration of the New Mexico support order and the accompanying statement of zero arrears was final as to de Leon because she is literally a \u201cnonregistering party\u201d who failed to object within 20 days of registration. (\u00a7\u00a7 4954, 4955.) Consequently, Jenkins argues, the trial court was precluded from adjudicating the amount of preregistration arrears owed under the order. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Even were we to accept Jenkins\u2019s contention that the statutory references in sections 4954 and 4955 to \u201cthe nonregistering party,\u201d reasonably read, encompass a nonregistering <em>obligee </em>such as de Leon, Jenkins\u2019s argument fails. The statute does not provide that confirmation of the order precludes <em>all </em>later objections raised by a nonregistering party. Rather, it states only that \u201c[confirmation of a registered order . . . precludes further contest of the order with respect to any matter <em>that could have been asserted at the time of </em>registration.\u201d (\u00a7 4957, italics added.) An objection to the statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>arrears in the DCSS\u2019s registration statement is not a matter that de Leon \u201ccould have . . . asserted at the time of registration\u201d (\u00a7 4957), because such an objection is not one of the seven \u201cnarrowly defined defenses to registration\u201d permitted under the statute. (UIFSA Com., 29F West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 4956, p. 559; \u00a7 4956, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Section 4956, subdivision (a) lists the following permissible grounds for objection to registration of an out-of-state child support order: \u201c(1) The issuing tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the contesting party, [f] (2) The order was obtained by fraud. [][] (3) The order has been vacated, suspended, or modified by a later order, [f] (4) The issuing tribunal has stayed the order pending appeal. [&lt;j[] (5) There is a defense under the law of this state to the remedy sought, [f] (6) Full or partial payment has been made, [f] (7) The statute of limitation under Section 4953 precludes enforcement of some or all of the arrearages.\u201d These are the only permitted objections to registration (\u00a7 4956, subds. (a), (c); UIFSA Com., 29F West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 4957, p. 561), and none can fairly be read to encompass an objection that the amount of arrears listed on a registration statement is <em>understated. </em>The only pertinent objection allowed by the statute\u2014that \u201c[f]ull or partial payment has been made\u201d\u2014would only apply to an <em>obligor </em>contending that arrears are <em>overstated. </em>(\u00a7 4956, subd. (a)(6); see also \u00a7 4955, subd. (a) [nonregistering party may contest amount of arrearages \u201cpursuant to Section 4956\u201d].) Thus, even accepting Jenkins\u2019s premise that de Leon is \u201cthe nonregistering party,\u201d the statute by its terms does not bar her postregistration challenge to the understatement of arrears because de Leon could not have objected on that basis at the time of registration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The official comment to UIFSA section 4956, which Jenkins relies on, supports rather than contradicts our analysis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The comment states that \u201cit seems likely\u201d that where a nonregistering obligee fails to object to an order on the grounds that the order is not controlling, \u201cboth the registering and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>nonregistering party . . . will be estopped from subsequently collaterally attacking the confirmed order on the basis that the unmentioned \u2018true order should have been confirmed instead.\u2019 \u201d (UIFSA Com., 29F West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 4956, p. 560.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The clear distinction between the situation addressed in the comment and that at issue here is that an objection that the filed order is not the correct order <em>is </em>one of the seven defenses to registration permitted by the statute. (\u00a7 4956, subd. (a)(3); Sampson, <em>Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (With Unofficial Annotations) </em>(1993) 27 Fam. L.Q. 93, 155, in. 138 [coreporter for UIFSA Drafting Committee notes that term \u201c \u2018nonregistering party\u2019 \u201d was used rather than \u201c \u2018respondent\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018obligor\u2019 \u201d in UIFSA only to allow for \u201ctheoretical[] possibility]\u201d that obligor would seek to register an order, and the obligee would contest registration on the grounds that the order sought to be registered was not the correct order].)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Thus, the official comment to section 4956\u2014the only suggestion in the uniform statute or its comments of a scenario where the absence of a preregistration objection would have preclusive effect on a nonregistering obligee\u2014is consistent with our conclusion that the preclusive effect of registration depends upon the availability of an opportunity to object under one of the \u201cnarrowly defined defenses to registration\u201d provided by the statute. (UIFSA Com., 29F West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 4956, p. 559; \u00a7 4956, subd. (a).) Where a nonregistering obligee is provided a preregistration opportunity to object\u2014such as on the ground that the incorrect order has been filed\u2014the obligee may be precluded from later objecting on that ground. Where a nonregistering obligee is not provided such an opportunity\u2014for example, with respect to an understatement of arrears\u2014the obligee cannot be precluded from later objecting on that ground. (See also <em>Randone v. Appellate Department </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 536, 550 [96 Cal.Rptr. 709, 488 P.2d 13] [\u201c \u2018absent a countervailing state interest of overriding significance\u2019 [citation], due process requires, at a minimum, that an individual be given a meaningful opportunity to be heard prior to being subjected by force of law to a significant deprivation\u201d]; <em>Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323] [\u201cA statute should be construed whenever possible so as to preserve its constitutionality\u201d] ,)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Under this analysis, it is clear that de Leon was not precluded from objecting after registration of the order on the ground that the amount of arrears in the registration statement filed by DCSS was understated. Consequently, the trial court did not err in adjudicating the amount of preregistration day care and medical arrears that Jenkins owed under the child support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\n<em>Reversal Is Not Warranted for Any Error in the Trial Court\u2019s Denial of Jenkins\u2019s Motion to Modify Its Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Jenkins also contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his request under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to modify its order to include an explicit finding that the court had \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to determine arrears.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We need not reach the merits of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>contention, as it provides no basis for reversal in light of Jenkins\u2019s failure to show any prejudice from the trial court\u2019s purportedly erroneous ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Reversal for an abuse of discretion is not warranted absent a showing that \u201ca miscarriage of justice has resulted\u201d from the trial court\u2019s error. <em>(Silver v. Boatwright Home Inspection, Inc. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 443, 449 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 475] [\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe burden is on the party complaining to establish an abuse of discretion, and unless a clear case of abuse is shown and unless there has been a miscarriage of justice a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion and thereby divest the trial court of its discretionary power,\u201d \u2019 \u201d citing <em>Denham v. Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 566 [86 Cal.Rptr. 65, 468 P.2d 193]]; see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 475 [judgment will not be disturbed based on \u201cany error, [or] improper ruling\u201d unless the \u201cparty complaining or appealing sustained and suffered substantial injury,\u201d and it appears \u201cthat a different result would have been probable if such error . . . had not occurred\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Jenkins fails to sustain his burden of demonstrating that a miscarriage of justice occurred from the trial court\u2019s allegedly erroneous failure to modify its order to include a specific finding that it had jurisdiction to determine the amount of arrears. As the trial court stated, a finding to that effect was implicit in its determination of arrears. In addition, the trial court orally considered and rejected Jenkins\u2019s argument that it lacked jurisdiction at the October 2004 hearing, and again made that determination explicit at the March 2005 hearing on Jenkins\u2019s Code of Civil Procedure section 473 motion. Thus, we can see no prejudice to Jenkins, and certainly no miscarriage of justice, that resulted from the trial court\u2019s refusal to modify its order under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. Consequently, we conclude that Jenkins fails to meet his burden of demonstrating an abuse of discretion and reversal is therefore not warranted on this ground.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">McConnell, P.

In that case, an obligee attempted to enforce an Arizona judgment in California after an Arizona court ruled that there were zero arrears due under the order, and child support obligations had otherwise expired. The appellate court ruled that given the Arizona court\u2019s ruling and the California court\u2019s role under UIFSA of simply \u201cenforcing]\u201d the operative out-of-state support order, the California court had no power to further adjudicate arrears due under the order, even though the failure to obtain payment was partially due to negligence of the support agencies involved. <em>(Scheuerman, </em>at p. 1145.) Here, there is no analogous New Mexico court ruling as to the amount of arrears, and thus <em>Scheuerman </em>has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Similarly, Jenkins\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Marriage of Chapman </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 253, 259 [252 Cal.Rptr. 359], is misplaced as it was decided under the previous statutory framework (RURESA) and considered only the binding effect of registration on an <em>obligor, </em>not an obligee. (See <em>In re Marriage of Chapman, </em>at p. 259 [noting that \u201c[t]he pivotal question ... is, \u2018What is \u201cconfirmed\u201d by the operation of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 1699, subdivision (b), <em>when an obligor </em>does not petition within 20 days?\u2019 \u201d and concluding under prior law that solely \u201c[t]he registered <em>order </em>is confirmed, not the registered arrearage statement\u201d (first italics added)].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b150-11\"> Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d) states: \u201cThe court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b150-12\"> Although the trial court orally rejected Jenkins\u2019s argument that it did not have jurisdiction to determine the amount of arrears because that amount had become final under the statute, the court\u2019s subsequent written order did not include a specific finding to that effect. Consequently, Jenkins filed a request that the court \u201ccorrect\u201d its written order to include an explicit jurisdictional finding. The court rejected this request as unnecessary because the finding was implicit in the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\"> We grant Jenkins\u2019s October 14, 2005 amended request that we take judicial notice of a Texas state court decision and certain comments of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws\u2014although we find these items to be of minimal relevance to the issues on appeal.
