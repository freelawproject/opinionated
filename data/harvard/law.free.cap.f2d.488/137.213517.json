The basis for this action was its determination that Bailey\u2019s attorney and the prosecutor jointly coerced him into entering his guilty pleas. Such a determination depends upon evidence not in the record of the state court guilty plea proceedings. Nothing in the record before us discloses that this evidence has ever been presented to the Alabama courts. Bailey appealed his conviction to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals arguing that his guilty pleas were not \u201cunderstandingly and voluntarily\u201d entered, but that court\u2019s opinion indicates that his appeal was based solely on the record of the lower court proceedings. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Bailey v. Alabama, 48 Ala.App. 149, 262 So.2d 636 (1972). The Attorney General of Alabama has represented in his brief before this court that the collateral remedy of coram nobis is presently available to Bailey in state court. We agree. Therefore, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) we must reverse the district court\u2019s decision and remand this case for Bailey to present his de hors the record claim to the state courts of Alabama without prejudice to his right to return to federal court if his exhaustion of existing state remedies does not afford the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
