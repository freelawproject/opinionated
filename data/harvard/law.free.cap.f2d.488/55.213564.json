The district court entered judgment against the SBA. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-26\">In January of 1966, Edwin Rocker gave J. F. Hattaway a $50,000 note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>which included a provision for payment of 15% attorney\u2019s fees for collection of the debt after maturity, a provision which could be enforced only if the creditor complied with Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-506. This statute makes enforcement of such a provision contingent on the creditor\u2019s giving written notice that the debt- or can avoid the added expense of attorney\u2019s fees by paying the principal and interest then due within ten days of receipt of the \u00a7 20-506 notice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Rocker\u2019s note to Hattaway was secured by a mortgage on certain real estate in Wheeler County, Georgia. A second mortgage lien on the same land was granted by Rocker to the SBA through a series of deeds from 1967 to 1969. By 1972, the SBA had foreclosed the second mortgage, purchased the property subject to the Hattaway mortgage, and had decided to buy out Hattaway\u2019s interest by paying off Rocker\u2019s note which had been in default since October 15, 1968. An SBA plan to deliver its check to Hat-taway in early January of 1972 was aborted, however, when it was learned that the Hattaways were being sued by Swift Agricultural Chemicals Corp. to set aside as a fraudulent conveyance a transfer of the note and mortgage by Hattaway to his wife in November of 1970. The SBA concluded that the Swift litigation raised the possibility of double liability if payment were made to the Hattaways, hence the government check was cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Hattaway was present at the SBA foreclosure sale on March 7 and was then advised that the SBA intended to pay off the Rocker indebtedness. An SBA letter to the Hattaways dated March 14 requested an itemization of Rocker's obligation as of March 31, 1972. Another letter from the SBA, received by the Hattaways on March 17, stated: \u201cIt is expected that notice of any action taken with regard to your Deed to Secure Debt or the indebtedness secured thereby, will be directed to the attention of this writer at the offices of Small Business Administration . . . . \u201d However, on March 15 the Hattaways had given Rocker, <em>but not the SBA, </em>notice that unless the debt were paid within ten days a 15% attorney\u2019s fees charge would be added to the amount due. In a letter dated March 29, four days after the expiration of the statutory period, they informed the SBA of having given Rocker the \u00a7 20-506 notice, and, in response to the SBA\u2019s request for an itemization of Rocker\u2019s obligation, included the sum of $5,635.45 for \u201cattorney fees as stipulated in note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Immediately thereafter the SBA filed an interpleader in the Swift-Hattaway litigation and paid into court the principal and interest which Rocker then owed the Hattaways. That sum was ultimately received by Swift under a consent judgment. The district court ordered the SBA to pay the amount of the claimed attorney\u2019s fees into court, and later ordered the $5,635.45 paid to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Hattaways. From that order came this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The only issue is whether the court below was correct in concluding: \u201cThere is nothing in the record which would justify the Court in denying the attorney\u2019s fees to the Hattaways.\u201d The Hat-taways strenuously urge that by giving notice to Rocker, they did all that was required by Georgia law to entitle them to enforcement of the attorney\u2019s fees provision. The SBA counters, however, that the Hattaways had no intention of collecting the debt from Rocker, but rather gave the \u00a7 20-506 notice to the named but nominal debtor in order to enhance their recovery from the SBA as the real party in interest. The government\u2019s position that such a \u201ctactic\u201d constitutes an impermissible use of Georgia law is strongly supported by Security Mortgage Co. v. Powers, 1928, 278 U.S. 149, 49 S.Ct. 84, 73 L.Ed. 236, which considered a predecessor statute to \u00a7 20-506 and in which Mr. Justice Bran-d\u00e9is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">It is asserted that the suit against the [debtor] was brought, not for the purpose of collecting the debt, but solely for the purpose of enhancing the amount which was obtainable without suit . . . . If this is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">true, the statutory provision designed for the protection of the debtor was employed solely as a means of oppression. We will not assume, in the absence of a decision by a Georgia court, that the Legislature intended to permit such use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Id. at 159, 49 S.Ct. at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Cognizant of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that the attorney\u2019s fees statute is not to be given mechanical application, the Hattaways rely on two Georgia cases in support of their contention that notice was required to be given only to the debtor and not to some third party, Woods v. State, 1963, 109 Ga.App. 225, 136 S.E.2d 18, and Guarantee Trust and Banking Co. v. American National Bank, 1915, 15 Ga.App. 778, 84 S.E. 222. It is true that in neither case did the Georgia courts require notice to be given to anyone other than the original debtor even though a third party was required to pay attorney\u2019s fees. The facts in each case, however, can be distinguished from those in the present controversy. In <em>Guarantee Trust, </em>a receiver was appointed for the debtor, but the attorney\u2019s fees notice was given <em>before </em>the appointment and thus before the receiver became the party interested in paying off the debt. From the <em>Woods </em>opinion it is difficult to ascertain whether the \u00a7 20-506 notice was given before or after a receiver became involved, but there is no indication that at the time notice was given the creditor had any knowledge of a third party\u2019s interest in the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\"> By contrast, the record in the case <em>sub judice </em>convinces us that the Hattaways had no hope of collecting the debt from Rocker at the time he was given the \u00a7 20-506 notice. The SBA clearly was the party from whom the Hattaways expected to collect. Apparently not content with their good fortune in finding a party willing to pay a previously uncollectable obligation, they attempted to invoke the statutory provision to entitle them to a bonus of attorney\u2019s fees from the SBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">We entertain no doubt that as soon as it became clear to the Hattaways that the SBA was the real party in interest, they were under an equitable duty to give the \u00a7 20-506 notice not only to the nominal debtor, but to the SBA as well. To hold otherwise would be to condone fraud by silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">A failure to speak is fraud by silence, where one uses silence for the purpose of gaining an unconscionable advantage over another by concealing for his own benefit information which in equity and good conscience should be communicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">Reeves v. B. T. Williams &amp; Co., 1925, 160 Ga. 15, 127 S.E. 293. If there was any doubt about the SBA\u2019s entitlement to notice after it had repeatedly advised the Hattaways of its interest in extinguishing Rocker\u2019s debt, that doubt was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>certainly dispelled when the Hattaways received the letter specifically asking that it be kept posted of any action taken either on the mortgage or on the underlying obligation. Because they were silent when there was an equitable duty to speak, the Hattaways are estopped from taking advantage of the attorney\u2019s fees statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">GODBOLD, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-5\">. The relevant section of Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-506 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">Obligations to pay attorney\u2019s fees upon any note or other evidence of indebtedness, in addition to the rate of interest specified therein, shall be valid and enforceable, and collectible as a part of such debt, if such note or other evidence of indebtedness be collected by or through an attorney after maturity, subject to the following provisions :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">* sk * * !k</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">(c) The holder of the note or other evidence of indebtedness, or his attorney at law, shall, after maturity of the obligation, notify in writing the maker, indorser or party sought to be held on said obligation that the provisions relative to payment of attorney\u2019s fees in addition to the principal and interest shall be enforced and that such maker, indorser or party sought to be held on said obligation has 10 days from the receipt of such notice to pay the principal and interest without the attorney\u2019s fees. If the maker, indorser or party sought to be held on any such obligation shall pay the principal and interest in full before the expiration of such time, then the obligation to pay the attorney\u2019s fees shall be void and no court shall enforce the agreement. The refusal of a debtor to accept delivery of the notice hereinbefore specified shall be the equivalent of such notice.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
