The Tax Court\u2019s opinion is reported at 58 T. C. 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-24\">Gain from the disposition of shares acquired under a restricted stock option plan is treated as ordinary income if the disposition takes place within six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>months of the transfer of shares to the option holder. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 421(b) and 424(a)(1). \u201cTransfer\u201d for this purpose means <em>\u201c </em>. . . the transfer of ownership of such share, or the transfer of substantially all the rights of ownership . . .\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.421-1 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">Under the terms of taxpayers\u2019 employer\u2019s option plan, taxpayers could exercise their options and give promissory notes to cover the purchase price. But the plan provided that the taxpayers acquired no rights in the shares until the amounts owing on the notes were paid in full. Thus the \u201ctransfer\u201d called for by the Code and Regulations did not occur until the amounts owing on the notes were paid. Taxpayers did not pay off their notes until within six months of the subsequent sale, and therefore did not satisfy the holding period required to qualify the gain as long-term capital gain. Swenson v. C. I. R., 309 F.2d 672 (8th Cir., 1972), does not help taxpayers. Under the option plan in that case, the employees acquired substantial ownership rights at the time they exercised their options.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
