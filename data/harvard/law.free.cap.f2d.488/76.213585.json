Prior to merger Local 183 had been an all-white local and Local 204 was its all-black counterpart.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following negotiations between the two locals it was agreed that, the Shop Committee, which was responsible for handling all grievances arising under the collective bargaining agreement and negotiating new collective bargaining agreements with the Company, consist of eleven members, three of whom would be elected from three \u201careas\u201d or groups of workers which were predominantly black and which, before merger, constituted the jobs and departments represented by the all-black local. The other eight members were to come from the traditionally white job groups. Among the three predominantly black areas was Area 3, which at the time of merger consisted of more than 50 persons, only one of whom was white, and which, at the time of the election in question (December 1971) still had more than 50 workers, of whom all but three were black.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">Following the merger, James A. Tucker, who had been president of the black local, was nominated and elected as the representative on the Shop Committee from Area 3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tucker served in that position until 1971 when he was defeated by a white person named Elbert Vaughn. Prior to that election, objections to Vaughn\u2019s eligibility were raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>on the basis that he was not an Area 3 employee; however, upon investigation by the international\u2019s vice-president, the objections were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Plaintiffs urged upon the district court and insist on appeal that Vaughn was allowed to be nominated and elected by the local and the international in violation of the 1964 merger agreement and the local by-laws because he was not in fact eligible under the agreement for the reason that he did not work in any of the Area 3 jobs. Plaintiffs further allege that .these actions resulted in discrimination against the plaintiffs and the class of blacks which they represent on the basis of race and color. Defendants insisted in the district court and contend here that Vaughn was a member of Area 3 and was, therefore, eligible for nomination and election under the merger agreement. Significantly, we think, all parties agree that neither the merger agreement nor the local by-laws nor any other understanding requires that Area 3 be represented by a black person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is further agreed that any one of the three white persons constituting members of Area 3 might have been lawfully nominated and elected. The dispute, therefore, is not whether Vaughn was black or white but rather whether he worked in a job that made him a member of the Area 3 group of employees. It is also significant, we think, that subsequent to the December, 1971 election the plaintiff, James A. Tucker, was again nominated from Area 3, was elected, and is now the representative of Area 3 on the Shop Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The question briefed on appeal is whether the district court erred in dismissing this action on the ground that it was a dispute \u201cover internal union elections\u201d for which an <em>exclusive </em>remedy is provided under Title IV of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 481-483. Plaintiffs urge that the Congress has granted them dual remedies. While they agree with the defendants that, after exhausting remedies under the constitution and by-laws of the union, they might have proceeded under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482 by complaint to the Secretary of Labor who could then have, in his discretion, brought suit on their behalf, plaintiffs insist that where facts are alleged that constitute a prima facie case of racially discriminatory union election practices, then the \u201cexclusive\u201d remedy of Title IV does not apply and instead plaintiffs may proceed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Section I of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">We are inclined to think that there may well be eases of racial discrimination in the conduct of internal union affairs that come within the ambit of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and perhaps Section I of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and that not every case involving the validity of a union election must be prosecuted pursuant to the provisions of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 482 and 483. But we think this is not such a case. Plaintiffs allege only that they are entitled to have someone \u2014 black or white \u2014 to represent the interests of Area 3 and that to assure such representation the merger agreement provides that he must, in fact, be an Area 3 employee. We agree that the district judge properly characterized this allegation as a dispute \u201cover internal union elections\u201d for which 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482 provides the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>appropriate remedy. The particular facts of this case are not sufficient to invoke an additional remedy under \u00a7 703(c) of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-10\">. Local 183, prior to merger, represented some 900 workers in traditionally \u201cwhite\u201d jobs and departments at American Tobacco Company in Durham, N. C. Local 204 was much smaller, representing the 200-300 workers in jobs and departments at American which were, theretofore, customarily all-black. The merger was necessary in order to allow American to continue as a government contractor under the terms of Executive Order 10925, prohibiting a government contractor from engaging in collective bargaining with racially identifiable local unions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-18\">. To be nominated, a candidate was required to work within the area which he was to represent if elected; however, election was by vote of the entire membership of the local.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\">. Indeed, it would appear that they could make no such allegation in light of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(e) which provides: \u201cIn any election required by this section which is to be held by secret ballot a reasonable opportunity shall be given for the nomination of candidates and <em>every member in good standing shall be eligible to be a candidate and to hold offiee. . . </em>. \u201d (emphasis added).

Local 1291, Int\u2019l Longshoremen, 338 F.Supp. 1204 (E.D.Pa.), aff\u2019d 461 F.2d 1262 (3rd Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b140-11\">. <em>See </em>\u00a7 703(c), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(c) which provides: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for a labor organization \u2014 (1) to exclude or to expel from its membership, or otherwise to discriminate against, any individual because of his race. . . .\u201d <em>See also </em>Shultz v.
