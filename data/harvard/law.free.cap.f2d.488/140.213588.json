He contends that evidence introduced at his trial was seized incident to an illegal arrest and that he was interrogated without prior <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-25\"> Upon a complete review of the record we find that appellant\u2019s contentions are without merit. His initial detention was proper because it was based upon specific facts known to the police officer. Between 4:00 and 5:00 o\u2019clock in the morning the officer was searching a residential neighborhood for a black rape suspect driving a Ford. Appellant was a black male driving a Ford in the neighborhood at that time. Probable cause for an arrest, of course, was not needed to momentarily detain the appellant in the course of the officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>investigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently obtained information made an arrest justifiable under the probable cause standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We find the <em>Miranda </em>issue is primarily factual. The material facts were fully developed at a state court hearing on a motion to suppress, and the state\u2019s factual determination was fairly supported by the record. There is no allegation of newly discovered evidence. The district court properly made an independent examination of the file and state court record as well as considering a magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Upon the authority of Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed. 2d 770 (1963), this petition was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-16\">. See, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and United States v. Moreno, 475 F.2d 44 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
