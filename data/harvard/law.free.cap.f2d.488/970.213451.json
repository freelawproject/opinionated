Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1033-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">Appellant Hart pled guilty to an indictment charging him with distribution of heroin. He received a ten-year prison sentence with a three-year special parole term to follow his imprisonment. Subsequently he filed a \u201cmotion for modification or reduction of sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\u201d which sought resentencing under the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4251-4255. The district judge denied his motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">If a defendant is to get NARA rehabilitative sentencing the court must determine that he is an eligible offender and believe that he is an addict; then the court may, in its discretion, place him in the Attorney General\u2019s custody for an examination preliminary to treatment. In the instant ease the district judge did not believe' that Hart qualified for NARA sentencing. In his order denying Hart\u2019s Rule 35 motion the district judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-10\">We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude that prior to and upon sentencing of petitioner we made an affirmative determination that petitioner was not an \u201cEligible offender\u201d in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4251, and in our discretion afforded by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252, did not order an examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-15\">Although the district judge did not elaborate on his view that appellant was not an eligible offender, we presume the basis for ineligibility would be 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4251(f)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That provision disqualifies those convicted of making narcotic sales, unless the sales were made for the purpose of appeasing the seller\u2019s addiction. Unfortunately there is nothing in the record that touches on appellant\u2019s purpose in making the sale that resulted in his conviction. Were his status as an ineligible offender the only basis for the district judge\u2019s decision, we would have to consider remanding this case for an evidentiary hearing. <em>See </em>United States v. Phillips, 6th Cir. 1968, 403 F.2d 963; United States v. Porter, D.Minn.1967, 277 F.Supp. 655. <em>But cf. </em>Ramos v. United States, 9th Cir. 1970, 432 F.2d 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-16\">The district court, however, relied on section 4252 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as section 4251(f). Section 4252 allows a judge to refuse NARA relief if he believes the offender is not an addict or if, after exercising his discretion, he simply chooses not to grant relief. The probation officer\u2019s presentence report provides some support for a belief that Hart was not an addict.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>judge stated that he exercised his discretion at the time of sentencing and consciously chose not to sentence Hart under the NARA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore we must uphold his decision to deny Hart NARA rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1033-17\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4251(f)(2) provides: \u201cEligible offender\u201d means any individual who is convicted of an offense against the United States, but does not include\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-18\">(2) an offender who is convicted of unlawfully importing or selling or conspiring to import or sell a narcotic drug, unless the court determines that such sale was for the primary purpose of enabling the offender to obtain a narcotic drug which he requires for his personal use because of his addiction to such drug.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1033-19\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4252 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-21\">If the court believes that an eligible offender is an addict, it may place him in the custody of the Attorney' General for an examination to determine whether he is an addict and is likely to be rehabilitated through treatment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1033-25\">. The probation officer, in his presentence report, said that Hart advised him he was \u201ccompletely free from physical symptoms of drug addiction at this point\u201d and stated that \u201cthere have been other instances during \u00bfhe last ten years when he has been physically free of Heroin but chose to resume its use.\u201d There is, of course, the possibility that Hart is an addict in the sense that he is one who \u201chabitually uses any narcotic drug . so as to endanger the public morals, health, safety, or welfare . . . \u201d even if he is not physically addicted to heroin. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4251(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1034-17\">. The district judge\u2019s considered rejection of NARA sentencing distinguishes this case from United States v. Hollis, 5th Cir. 1971, 450 F. 2d 1207, which we remanded to the lower court for initial consideration of NARA applicability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
