The order was based on the fact that Man-langit, a native and citizen of the Republic of the Philippines, entered the United States in September of 1969 as a temporary visitor' and had remained beyond the time permitted for his stay in this Country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-24\">Manlangit was born in the Philippines on April 6, 1936, two years after Congress enacted the Philippine Independence Act of March 24, 1934, 48 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) Section 1244. Section 14 of that Act, which became operative upon the Proclamation of Philippine independence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on July 4, 1946, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-25\">\u201cUpon the final and complete withdrawal of American sovereignty over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>the Philippine Islands the immigration laws of the United States (including all the provisions thereof relating to persons ineligible to citizenship) shall apply to persons who were born in the Philippine Islands to the same extent as in the case of other foreign countries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">The Immigration and Naturalization Service takes the position that under the foregoing section Manlangit lost his status as a non-citizen national and became an alien on July 4, 1946, the date of the Proclamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">Petitioner contends that the involuntary change of his status from that of a non-citizen national at the time of his birth in the Philippine Islands to that of a complete alien without giving him the right to make an election as to his allegiance upon attaining his majority is a violation of his constitutional rights as an individual born under the protection of the United States. An argument substantially similar to this was advanced and rejected in Rabang v. Boyd, 353 U. S. 427, 430-431, 77 S.Ct. 985, 987, 1 L. Ed.2d 956 (1957), in which the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-6\">\u201cSection 14 of the Independence Act in clear language applies \u2018to persons who were born in the Philippine Islands.\u2019 This language demonstrates, and we hold, as did the courts below, that persons born in the Islands, and who thereby were nationals of the United States became aliens on July 4, 1946, regardless of permanent residence in the continental United States on that date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">Petitioner\u2019s suggestion that <em>Rabang </em>was diluted by the decision in Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 87 S.Ct. 1660, 18 L. Ed.2d 757 (1967), is without merit for the decision in that case dealt with the rights of a naturalized American citizen, whereas the petitioner\u2019s status was for a brief period of time only that of a non-citizen national.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">We find that the petitioner was properly treated as an alien and, accordingly, the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1135-14\">.
