The principal issue on appeal is whether Section 204 of the Restatement of Restitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entitles appellee to recover not merely the value of the stock at the time it was received by appellant, but rather its value when sold by appellant. The difference amounts to some $14,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">Appellant\u2019s argument arises from the failure of Section 204(b) to specify clearly whether \u201cthe value of the property which he originally received\u201d is determined as of the date of receipt or the date of sale. In supporting the latter interpretation he quotes from Comment a to Section 204: \u201cIf the innocent donee makes a profit, he can keep the profit; if he incurs a loss, he need not make it good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-18\">We think it clear that appellant misreads Section 204(b), and has taken the quoted sentence out of context. As stated in Comment a, the theory of recovery under Section 204 is that an innocent gratuitous transferee should be liable to the extent of his unjust enrichment or the true owner\u2019s loss, whichever is <em>less. </em>Should he be able to compensate the owner for his loss, without exhausting the proceeds of selling the property, he could retain the surplus.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is this \u201cprofit\u201d which is referred to in appellant\u2019s quoted sentence, and not the appreciation in value between receipt and sale.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since no such \u201cprofit\u201d is present in this case, and since the appellant was unjustly enriched to the extent of the sum he received upon sale of the stock, the district court judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">. No Alabama cases control the point in issue here. Thus the district court and the parties looked to the Restatement for guidance in achieving an equitable result consistent with the <em>Erie </em>doctrine. Section 204 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-11\">\u201cGratuitous Transferee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-12\">AVhere a person receives the title to property of which another lias the beneficial interest without notice of the other\u2019s interest but without paying value, and being still without such notice exchanges it for other property, he is under a duty either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-13\">(a) to surrender the property which he acquired in exchange, or, at his option,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-14\">(b) to pay the value of the property which he originally received, the property which he acquired in exchange being subject to an equitable lien for such payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1037-15\">. At time of receipt the stock was worth $10,656. Appellant later sold it for $24,788. Appellee ultimately had to expend $52,260 to replace the stock, but did not seek to recover in excess of the amount of appellant\u2019s unjust enrichment. The district court did not award interest on the $24,788, and appellee has not cross-appealed from this ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1037-22\">. This would occur if, for example, the owner replaced his stock at a price lower than that at which the gratuitous transferee sold it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1037-23\">. We are bolstered in this conclusion by the statement in Comment a that this rule is the same as is applicable where property is transferred by a trustee in breach of trust to an innocent donee. See Restatement of Trusts, Second \u00a7 292, Comment h, which states that the value at date of sale is controlling. Further, this interpretation is consistent with Restatement of Restitution \u00a7 202 (that an owner may recover from a <em>conscious wrongdoer </em>either his own loss or the wrongdoer\u2019s unjust enrichment, whichever is <em>greater), </em>and \u00a7 203 (that an owner\u2019s recovery from an innocent <em>converter </em>is the amount of his loss, regardless of whether this is more or less than the converter\u2019s unjust enrichment).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1037-20\">RONEY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aqf-dedup-0\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"AHn\">A gratuitous transferee must return the original stock if he retained it. Under 204, if he has exchanged the original stock for other property, he may either (a) surrender the property received in exchange, or (b) pay the true owner whatever value the original stock has attained. The choice of repayment method is left in the hands of the gratuitous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>transferee. Thus he does not incur a loss if his exchange worked out badly and the exchanged property is worth less than the original stock. On the other hand, if the exchanged property has increased, and is worth more than the original stock has become worth, he may retain the increase. This is the meaning of Comment a to Section 204: \u201cIf the innocent donee makes a profit, he can keep the profit; if he incurs a loss, he need not make it good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">If indeed Section 204 is applicable at all, the facts must be construed as Clayton\u2019s having \u201cexchanged\u201d the original stock for $24,788. Thus, the Court was correct in permitting Clayton \u201cto surrender the property which he acquired in exchange\u201d for the original stock, the $24,788, rather than the value of the property which he originally received, which had become worth $52,260.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
