In 1966 it purchased seven airplanes and financed them through Cessna Finance Corporation, a Kansas corporation. Cessna Finance loaned $89,687.40 to the Flying Service which, in return, executed installment notes, chattel mortgages and guarantee agreements. The chattel mortgages gave Cessna Finance the right to possession of the airplanes upon a default in payments by the Flying Service. The Flying Service paid $47,784.50 on the notes and then defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-25\">On July 9, 1968, Cessna Finance filed a complaint, affidavit and bond in the Dona Ana County District Court, and obtained a writ of replevin. The sheriff of Dona Ana County executed the writ the same day, seizing the airplanes. The Flying Service answered and alleged a counterclaim for wrongful replevin. Both parties moved for summary judgment, which was granted in favor of Cessna Finance. The Flying Service appealed, and the New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed the decision. Cessna Fin. Corp. v. Mesilla Valley Flying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Serv., 81 N.M. 10, 462 P.2d 144 (1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1076, 90 S.Ct. 1521, 25 L.Ed.2d 811 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">In September, 1970, the president of the Flying Service executed an assignment for the benefit of creditors to Ryan. Ryan subsequently instituted an action in the United States District Court, District of New Mexico, seeking damages against Cessna Finance. This action was based on two claims. The first was for conversion arising out of the alleged wrongful replevin, in which the New Mexico replevin statutes were claimed to be unconstitutional. The second claim sought damages for an alleged deprivation of constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted judgment in favor of Cessna Finance. The trial court held Ryan\u2019s claim for conversion was barred by the doctrine of res judicata and that the claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because it was a claim for the vindication of a property right and not of a personal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">On appeal to this Court, the judgment was vacated and the cause remanded to the district court for consideration in light of Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), and Lynch v. Household Fin. Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972). Ryan v. Cessna Fin. Corp., No. 71-1762 (July 17, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Both parties again moved for summary judgment and the trial court again granted the motion in favor of Cessna Finance. In a memorandum opinion, the trial court held Ryan\u2019s conversion action was barred by the doctrine of res judi-cata. The trial court also held Ryan\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 could not be sustained because good faith compliance with a statute subsequently declared to be unconstitutional negates any claim for damages under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">Rios, substituted for Ryan as successor assignee, appeals the decision to this Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Rios first contends it was error for the trial court to grant summary judgment for Cessna Finance because the conversion action is not barred by the doctrine of res judicata. His position is that the state court judgment resolved only the issue of Cessna Finance\u2019s money damages, and that a state court judgment is an estoppel only as to fact questions in issue in that case which were essential to a decision thereon. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\"> The counterclaim in the state court by the Flying Service was a claim for a wrongful replevin, based on N.M. Stat.Ann, \u00a7 22-17-12 (1953). The statute\u2019s purpose is to settle in one suit all questions that may arise out of the unlawful taking or detention of property. McCallister v. M-A-C Fin. Co., 332 F.2d 633 (10th Cir. 1964). The damages issue must be litigated in the replevin action or be barred thereafter. <em>Id. </em>Although this is an interpretation of state law by a federal district court, the resident judge\u2019s views on the unsettled laws of his state are persuasive and ordinarily accepted. Sade v. Northern Natural Gas Co., 483 F.2d 230 (10th Cir. 1973). For this reason we shall adopt this interpretation of the replevin statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Rios argues, however, that because the claim is not for wrongful replevin but for a conversion that began with replevin, a distinction exists which avoids the interpretation given the replevin statute in <em>McCallister. </em>We can find no such distinction. To constitute conversion in New Mexico there must be proof of a wrongful detention amounting to a repudiation of the owner\u2019s rights, or the exercise of a dominion over the property which is inconsistent with the owner\u2019s rights. Molybdenum Corp. v. Brazos Eng\u2019r Co., 81 N.M. 708, 472 P.2d 971 (1970). We believe that the conversion claim for the wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>detention of property is barred by the doctrine of res judicata because of <em>Mc-Callister.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Rios next contends 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 establishes a claim for violation of property rights. Section 1983 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Because there is no distinction between the protection of personal and property rights under \u00a7 1983, deprivation of a property right is actionable. Lynch v. Household Fin. Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972). However, other facts present in this ease negate a cause of action. Cessna Finance brought the original replevin action before the replevin statutes, insofar as they provided for a prejudgment taking of property without notice and a hearing, were declared unconstitutional in Montoya v. Blackhurst, 84 N.M. 91, 500 P.2d 176 (1972). <em>See also </em>Sniadach v. Family Fin. Corp., 395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969). A statute is presumed to be' constitutional until struck down as unconstitutional. Cessna Finance followed the statutory procedure in bringing its replevin action. We therefore hold that \u00a7 1983 is not applicable because damages are not collectible in a civil right action against one who followed a statutory procedure presumed to be constitutional. Baxter v. Birkins, 311 F.Supp. 222 (D.C.Colo. 1970). And although Rios now questions the good faith of Cessna Finance in proceeding under the replevin laws of New Mexico, we believe no factual issue on the question exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
