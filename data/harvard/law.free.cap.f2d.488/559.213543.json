The purpose of the injunction is to secure compliance by the California Highway Commission with 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4622-4655, Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies for Federal and Federally Assisted Programs; 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968; 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966; 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 138, Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968; and all Federal regulations promulgated under each of these provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The Commission\u2019s position on this appeal is that these provisions are applicable only in the sense that compliance is necessary in order to obtain federal funding. Under this interpretation the Commission would have an option to obtain federal funding by complying with these provisions. Failure to comply merely would deprive the State of federal funds. The determination whether the condition precedent to federal funding had occurred would be appropriate only at the final state of the approval process outlined in 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(a), the so-called \u201cconstruction approval.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>As a consequence, the Commission argues, it would have been appropriate for the District Court to have entered a declaratory judgment that the statutes here involved were applicable if federal funds are to become available and to have enjoined the Federal Government from making funds available to the project \u201cuntil and unless the requirements are met and approved by the Court,\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief, p. 5.) Under no circumstances should a state be <em>enjoined </em>to comply. The carrot of federal funding, not the stick of an injunction, insists the Commission, is the only compulsion authorized by the applicable statutory and regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">We do not agree with the Commission\u2019s interpretation of these provisions. The general purpose of these statutes and regulations is to assure that projects for which federal funding might become available are carried out in a way that will afford the protection both to those displaced that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4622-4655 provides and to the environment, including public parks, that is commanded by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(f) and 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 138. The effectuation of this purpose makes necessary both the carrot and the stick. Without the stick there will be fewer instances in which compliance with these provisions will be achieved. This is true because the Commission under its interpretation would be able to secure the program approval contemplated by 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 105 for a greater number of projects than could be funded by the sums apportioned and made available pursuant to 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 104 and \u00a7 106(a) and to qualify for actual funding only those projects with respect to which compliance proved to be relatively easy and inexpensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">We believe that Judge Peck-ham correctly interpreted the applicable statutes and regulations to require compliance by the Commission with those provisions providing relocation assistance and protecting the environment \u201cbefore location approval, [and] prior to federal funding of a project.\u201d La Raza Unida v. Volpe, 337 F.Supp. 221, 231 (N.D.Calif.1971). Moreover, it is our view that it is much too late for the State to avoid compliance by withdrawing State Project 238 from the Federal-aid system described in 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Whether a withdrawal for this purpose would be effective if attempted subsequent to the program approval of 23 U.

Department of Transportation (1969), is not before us. For present purposes it is enough to observe that such withdrawal must be clear and unambiguous and pri- or to causing significant harm either to those who might be displaced by the project or to the environment in a manner inconsistent with the intent of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(f) and 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Under the facts of the case before us, we see no reason to disturb the.preliminary injunction ordered by the District Court. It is consistent with the position taken by this Circuit in Lathan v. Volpe, 455 F.2d 1111 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-6\">.

Volpe, 337 F.Supp. 221, 234 (N.D.Cal., 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b623-19\">. The Federal-Aid Highway Act, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq., establishes a federal grant-in-aid program whereby the federal government, through the Federal Highway Commission, [FHWA], will assist in funding the construction of highways on the interstate, primary and urban systems of federal-aid highways provided that the State complies with the standards set forth in the Act. The program is administered through the FHWA\u2019s approval of \u201cprojects\u201d submitted by the states to obtain federal reimbursement ; and funding is ultimately dependent upon the successful completion of a series of successive stages at which FHWA reviews and approves the plans for each project which has been submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-20\">Two of. the approvals upon which funding depend are statutorily mandated. These are known as \u201cprogram approval\u201d, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a), and \u201capproval of plans, specifications and estimates\u201d or \u201cP S &amp; E approval\u201d, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(a). Program approval, which is to occur \u201cas soon as practicable after the apportionments for the Federal-aid systems have been made for any fiscal year\u201d, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a), and which is necessary to enable the State to receive any reimbursement for a project, does not impose on the federal government a contractual obligation to pay its share of the project\u2019s costs. It is not until there has been \u201cP S &amp; E\u201d approval, which is normally deferred until the state is actually ready to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ceive reimbursement funds, that any binding obligation arises. 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In conjunction with the required statutory approvals, there are three additional approvals which are mandated by the applicable administrative regulations. Under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 128(a), the state highway department must certify that it has given formal consideration to \u201cthe social, economic, environmental, and other effects\u201d of a proposed route and its alternative possibilities. In order to meet this requirement, where the proposed highway is to pass through a city FHWA regulations require the State to hold a public hearing \u2014 called the \u201ccorridor hearing\u201d \u2014 on the location of the route. Assuming that the State has held such a hearing, and fully complied with all other \u201capplicable laws and regulations\u201d, Policy and Procedure Memorandum (PPM) 20-8 (January 14, 1969), then \u201clocation approval\u201d is accorded the project. The State must then hold a second hearing \u2014 called the \u201cdesign hearing\u201d- \u2014 concerning the proposed engineering design for the project. Again, the State must demonstrate compliance with all federal laws and regulations before \u201cdesign approval\u201d is given. Both location approval and design approval follow program approval of the project but must occur before P S &amp; E approval is given under Section 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">At some point, prior to P S &amp; E approval, the State is required, <em>inter alia, </em>to give \u201csatisfactory assurances\u201d that it can provide prospective displacees with adequate relocation housing and payments. 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 502. <em>See also </em>Information Memorandum 80-1-68. In addition, it must also prepare and submit an environmental impact statement as required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 et seq. <em>See </em>Lathan v. Volpe, 455 F.2d 1111 (9th Cir. 1971). If these requirements are met, together with all other applicable laws and regulations, then P S &amp; E approval is given under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 106 and the federal government becomes bound to contribute to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">Generally P S &amp; E approval leads to right-of-way acquisition and preparation for construction. Assuming that no problems arise, the final FHWA approval, known as \u201cauthorization to proceed with work approval\u201d, PPM 21-1 (April 15, 1950), is then received and actual construction of the project begins.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
