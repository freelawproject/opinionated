This conclusion sustained approval of our resultant holding that the sheriff\u2019s employees were employed by a \u201ccontractor with the United States\u201d, and not therefore employees of a \u201cfederal agency\u201d, Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2671, and our corollary holding, 459 F.2d at 411, that \u201c[t]he deputy marshal accordingly violated no duty of safekeeping with respect to the deceased\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">But, said the Supreme Court, 412 U.S. at page 533, 93 S.Ct. at page 2222, the latter conclusion \u201cappears to us to follow from the court\u2019s discussion of the nature of the intergovernmental relationship and the status of the sheriff\u2019s employees, rather than being a separate rejection of the finding of the District Court that Bowers himself was negligent.\u201d The remand was to permit our consideration of the distinct question regarding the negligence of Bowers. This appears to be based upon the concluding sentence of the district court\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 5: \u201cNo specific arrangements were made by the Deputy Marshal for constant surveillance of the prisoner, and this was negligence.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court made no other finding of negligence on the part of Deputy Marshal Bowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">By an order entered August 1, 1973, we called for supplemental briefs from the parties dealing with the question of liability of the government \u201cinsofar as that liability may be based on the negligence of [U.S.] Deputy Marshal Bowers\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">The supplemental brief of the United States asserts that the portion of the district court\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 5, quoted above, is clearly erroneous for two reasons, (a) because it requires the deputies to do something which they had no power to do, that is to supervise the internal management details of the county jail, and (b) because the testimony shows that Deputy Marshal Jones, Bowers\u2019 superior, had in fact made a request of the county jail employees to place \u00abjail trustees where they could watch the prisoner, which was agreed to, with the knowledge and understanding of Bowers and of Slocomb, the third Southern District of Texas Deputy Marshal involved in the arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-11\">The appellees\u2019 brief argues to the contrary that either Bowers or his superiors in the Marshal\u2019s Office or both knew that it would be unsafe to move Logue from the hospital back to the jail without constant supervision, and that the district court\u2019s finding of negligence is borne out by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-12\">Our review of the district court\u2019s original memorandum and opinion, 334 F.Supp. 322, reinforces the view we had when the appeal came to this panel originally, that the main consideration of the district court\u2019s findings and conclusions centered upon establishing the government\u2019s liability for negligently permitting Logue to take his life in the Nueces County Jail under a theory that the \u201ccontract\u201d exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act, Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2671, was not applicable to the situation present. The quoted concluding sentence from Finding of Fact No. 5 without delineation of supporting facts may well have been no more gratuitous statement made without full consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>its implications. This may also not be the case, but we think, in view of the critical importance it has now taken on, the finding requires explication by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">Further consideration of the negligence vel non of Deputy Marshal Bowers, as well as that of Jones and Slocomb and any other government personnel involved, not limited to the alleged failure to make \u201cspecific arrangements * * for constant surveillance of the prisoner\u201d, should in the first instance be undertaken by the trial court, upon the original or upon a supplemented record. Complete findings of fact and conclusions of law should be entered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">This cause is remanded for further proceedings before the district court consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1152-14\">.

No specific arrangements were made by the Deputy Marshal for constant surveillance of the prisoner, and this was negligence.\u201d Logue v.
