As such, it raises important issues relating to the proper standard to be applied in natural gas abandonment proceedings for the foreseeable future. All parties to this controversy agree that an early determination of the issues is necessary and this court has acted accordingly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-4\">The facts of this ease are fully stated in the Presiding Examiner\u2019s Initial Decision;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we only summarize here those necessary to understand the precise issues decided. Petitioner, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco), and intervenor, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), are natural gas pipelines engaged in the transportation and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Transco and Natural have purchased natural gas production from the La Gloria field area in Texas since the late 1940\u2019s and early 1950\u2019s respectively. In the middle 1950\u2019s, the La Gloria producers contended they could not continue to meet the requirements of both companies and still have adequate gas for other needs. For .this reason the producers attempted to discontinue service to Natural by invoking certain \u201cescape clauses\u201d in their contracts. Pending court review of a Commission decision<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> disallowing the proposed discontinuance, the producers and Natural agreed upon a settlement of the controversy. The settlement agreement, as approved by the Commission,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provided for a substantial reduction in deliveries to Natural and the continued delivery of 81,000 Mcf per day <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to Trans-co until its contract with the producers expired in 1971. The quid pro quo for acceptance by Natural of the reduced deliveries was a contract with the producers that dedicated all the natural gas reserves in the La Gloria Field to Natural and required the producers to seek abandonment of deliveries of the 81,000 Mcf per day to Transco when its contract expired.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although Transco was not a party to the settlement agreement, it had intervened in the original proceeding before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-13\">In early 1971 after Transco\u2019s contract expired, the La Gloria producers filed applications with the Commission to abandon sales to Transco. These applications were consolidated and hearings were held in the fall of 1971. The Commission, reversing the decision of the Presiding Examiner, granted the applications for abandonment and certificated the sale of the abandoned gas to Natural. Thus Natural presently is receiving the 81,000 Mcf per day formerly delivered to Transco. Upon denial of its request for a rehearing before the Commission, Transco filed the instant petitions for review with this court. We vacate the orders of the Commission, restore the parties to the status quo ante, and remand the case to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-15\">Based upon an extensive and careful review of the evidence, the Presiding Examiner found, <em>inter alia, </em>that Transco had greater need for the La Gloria field gas than Natural. Accordingly, he denied the application for abandonment pursuant to the comparative need standard enunciated by this court in Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. v. FPC, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 409, 283 F.2d 204, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 913, 81 S.Ct. 276, 5 L.Ed. 2d 227 (1960). On review, the Commission reversed the Examiner\u2019s decision, ordered abandonment and certificated sale of the gas to Natural. In its decision the Commission stated that the comparative need standard <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was not ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>propriate in the context of this case, which involves: (1) a critical natural gas shortage in all areas of the country, (2) the expiration of Transco\u2019s contract with the La Gloria producers, and (3) Natural\u2019s contract rights to the gas under the 1958 Commission approved settlement agreement. For these reasons the Commission formulated a new standard that would give controlling weight to the settlement agreement absent \u201ccompelling proof\u201d of countervailing \u201cunequivocal public necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-6\">Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(b) (1970), provides that abandonment of natural gas facilities or services subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction can be granted only \u201cafter due hearing, and a finding by the Commission . . . that the present or future public convenience or necessity permit such abandonment.\u201d In <em>Michigan Consolidated, supra </em>at 419, 283 F.2d at 214, this court, in considering the criteria for abandonment under \u00a7 7(b), recognized two important principles: (1) a pipeline which has obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity to serve a particular market has \u201can obligation, deeply embedded in the law, to continue service,\u201d and (2) the burden of proof is on the applicant for abandonment to show that the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d permits abandonment, that is, that the public interest \u201cwill in no way be disserved\u201d by abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-10\">The fundamental tenets established by <em>Michigan Consolidated </em>are that the public interest is the ultimate criterion under \u00a7 7(b) and that all factors relevant to the determination of which course of action best promotes the overall public interest must be fully considered. The Commission there proposed, and this court accepted, a comparative needs test which balanced the relative needs of the competing pipelines and their ultimate consumers as the principal index of the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-11\">Against these principles of statutory and case law, it is clear that the Commission\u2019s orders cannot stand. At bottom, the Commission\u2019s decision stands for the simple proposition that where all parties need contested gas supplies the party having a contractual right to such gas will prevail. This proposition possesses the alluring qualities of simplicity and precision; indeed, it seems to have so mesmerized the Commission that it abdicated its statutory responsibility to guarantee that the overall public interest \u201cwill in no way be disserved\u201d by abandonment. Simply stated, the Commission apparently failed to perceive that the fact that all need gas does not mean that all need it equally.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The approach thus taken failed to consider adequately and fully all the factors relevant to an intelligent determination of the overall public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-12\"> The Commission also erred in according dispositive weight to private, albeit Commission approved,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> contrae-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>tual arrangements absent a showing of countervailing \u201cunequivocal public necessity.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Commission essentially argues that failure to honor long term gas acquisition contracts would be \u201cdisastrous since no pipeline would be able to plan for the future.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Clearly there are advantages to insuring as great certainty in gas acquisition plans as is possible. Moreover, if such plans and contracts are not given significant weight, then a pipeline in Transco\u2019s position might not be inclined, or at least would not have as great an incentive, to seek new sources of supply to replace those lost upon expiration of its contracts. Thus it is conceded that private, long term contracts, at least where they are part of a Commission approved settlement agreement, must be accorded significant weight in the determination of the overall public interest. But to argue that anything less than controlling weight would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d grossly overstates the case. Rigid deferral to contractual arrangements without a searching inquiry into other factors relevant to the public interest as required by \u00a7 7(b) simply is an inadequate means to assure vindication of the transcendant interests of the public. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">It is appropriate to reiterate here the principle that guides our review of abandonment orders as stated in <em>Michigan Consolidated:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-12\">Where, as here, a regulatory agency has ignored factors which are relevant to the public interest, the scope of judicial review is sufficiently broad to order their consideration. These limits are not to be confused with the narrower ones governing review of an agency\u2019s conclusions reached upon proper consideration of the relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\"><em>Supra, </em>108 U.S.App.D.C. at 431, 283 F. 2d at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-14\">We contemplate on remand, therefore, a searching and comprehensive inquiry by the Commission into all factors relevant to determining the overall public interest in this abandonment proceeding. For this purpose it will doubtless be necessary to supplement the record with additional evidence with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>spect to these factors. Primary importance must be given to a broadly conceived<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> comparison of the needs of the two natural gas systems and the public markets they serve. Additionally, the Commission should consider the environmental effects of its decision <em>(See </em>Arizona Public Service Co. v. FPC, 157 U.S.App.D.C. 272, 483 F.2d 1275 (1973)), the economic effect on the pipelines and their consumers, the presumption in favor of continued service and the relative diligence of the respective pipelines in providing for adequate natural gas supplies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As discussed previously, the Commission should also accord significant weight to Natural\u2019s contract rights that resulted from the 1958 Commission approved settlement agreement. For the purpose of judicial review it is, of course, essential that the Commission\u2019s findings with respect to the factors it considered in determining the public interest be apparent from its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">We recognize that the balancing process we impose upon the Commission is a complex one, but we perceive no acceptable alternative that would guarantee that the public interest \u201cwill in no way be disserved\u201d in abandonment proceedings. Accordingly, the orders of the Commission are vacated, the parties are restored to the status quo ante,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the case is remanded to the Commission for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">On Motions for Clarification and Rehearing and for Recall of Mandate and Stay of Reissuance of Mandate</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-11\">On consideration of the petitions for clarification and for rehearing and of the motions for recall of mandate and for stay of reissuance of mandate, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-12\">Ordered by the Court that the aforesaid petition for clarification is granted and the remaining motions are denied in accord with the Per Curiam opinion of this Court attached hereto, to be published at a later date.</p>\n<author id=\"b1392-13\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1392-14\">Intervenor Natural Gas Pipe Line Company of America, in an emergency motion, has petitioned this court to clarify the opinion and order in the above captioned case, and to direct the Federal Power Commission on remand to allocate equitably the remaining supplies of natural gas in the La Gloria Field pending final disposition. It has also filed a petition for rehearing, a motion for recall of mandate and for stay of reissuance of mandate pending action on petition for rehearing. We clarify the opinion and order as hereinafter set forth but decline to enter any further directive to the Federal Power Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-15\">The language of the opinion and order \u201cthe parties are restored to the status quo ante,\u201d as amplified by note 15, means that all parties are now restored to the respective daily volumes of natural gas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>to which they would have been entitled absent the grant of abandonment, with respect to p. 1330, footnote 15 is stricken and the following is inserted in lieu thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-5\"><footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Delivery of the daily volumes of natural gas to which Transco is entitled under the status quo ante shall be restored as quickly as possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">The petition for rehearing, the motion to recall mandate and for stay of reis-suance of mandate pending action on petition for rehearing are all denied. Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1388-11\">.

The situation confronting the Court in <em>Permian </em>involved producers who were dissatisfied with their contract prices which were not as high as would be permissible under the maximum area rates subsequently fixed by the Commission.

The public interest is jeopardized and \u201cunequivocal public necessity\u201d is demonstrated whenever private contracts substantially impair the ability of a pipeline to maintain adequate levels of service to its customers.
