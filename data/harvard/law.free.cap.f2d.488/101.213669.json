Lest we be misled, as the trial court and jury found USMM\u2019s subscribers to have been, the USMM here has no relation to the <em>real </em>United States Merchant Marine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While we accept the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>jury\u2019s finding that the scheme was fraudulent, and conclude the evidence if credited was sufficient to implicate them, the appellants Joseph J. Maggio and William E. Blake were denied a fair trial by the improper admission into evidence of certain telephone business records. Furthermore, we view the evidence as insufficient to support a conviction of appellant James F. Swartz. All three convictions are reversed and we remand for a new trial of Maggio and Blake.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The USMM was the realization of a long-awaited dream of Woodrow Wilson, Jr., a director of the corporation with the corporate endowed personal title of Commandant. Wilson was not present at the trial since as a fugitive he was making an extended stay in Mexico.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The purpose of the USMM was to provide a national computerized registration headquarters in Washington, D. C. for boatowners across the country to facilitate the location of stolen boats and motors.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The corporation conducted mass mailings to boatowners, notifying them that the USMM Office of Marine Registry was presently accepting applications for small craft, boats and motors. The fees were $5.00 for both a boat and motor or $3.00 separately. The cover letter and application, emblazoned with a convincing ensign very similar to that of the United States Coast Guard, listed its Washington, D. C. office as the \u201cHeadquarters Building.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To top off its nautical flavor the transmittal letter was signed by William E. Blake, with the seagoing title of Chief of Operations. The application form bore only one possible indication that the USMM was not a governmental agency. A statement at the bottom of the application form, in small type, stated that \u201cThis form does not exempt applicant from Federal, State or Local Regulations.\u201d Testimony was elicited from witnesses who had received applications, that they had returned them under the impression that it was a govermentally related agency and that registration was mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">In viewing the evidence most favorable to the Government, we discern ample grounds on which the jury could have found the existence of a scheme to fraudulently induce registration. The adoption of the title United States Merchant Marine, use of nautical titles for the officers,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 56placement of an ensign on the letterhead, and a Washington, D. C. address as \u201cHeadquarters\u201d are all indications that the enterprise was established with the purpose of misleading people by instilling the belief that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>USMM was a governmental agency with mandatory registration. The only question left to be answered is whether Mag-gio, Blake, and Swartz were properly shown to have been knowing and willing participants in the USMM scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\n<em>Maggio</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Joseph Maggio was an employee of National Systems and Service, Inc., of Rockford, Illinois, which contracted with USMM to perform the mass mailings.. However, additional evidence was presented which indicated that Maggio was more closely associated with the activities of USMM. He was listed by Commandant Woodrow Wilson as a reference in renting the USMM headquarters, he acquired a bulk mailing permit in the name of USMM, he contacted the International Marine Boating Industry in Chicago claiming he represented the United States Coast Guard, he was seen at the \u201cHeadquarters\u201d in Washington, and telephone records were produced at trial showing an extensive number of calls made between Maggio\u2019s home in Rockford and the USMM \u201cHeadquarters.\u201d This is the rub and nearly everything wrong that could have gone wrong in the proffer and receipt of the telephone records into evidence took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Because it is pertinent to the error in admission of evidence the other side of Maggio\u2019s picture revealed a classic case for jury resolution. On his theory, he was the wholly innocent independent contractor who was merely performing the common service indigenous to today\u2019s mass mailings of unsolicited pieces sometimes referred to as junk.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The records belonged to the Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Company which services the Washington, D. C. area. The records <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> consisted of numerous pages of printouts which listed calls made to and from the headquarters number in Washington and Maggio\u2019s Illinois home phone. In response to a subpoena the C&amp;P records were produced at trial by John W. Davis, Manager of the South Central Bell office in Montgomery, Alabama, site .of the trial and 800 miles from the place where the records were kept. Davis testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>he had obtained the records from his Security Manager, Howard H. Rice, who testified subsequently that he had received the records through the mails from the C&amp;P Telephone Company\u2019s office in Washington, D. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">While Davis stated that the records were similar to those kept by South Central Bell, there was no one present at the trial to explain the system under which the records were made, point out any possible errors, or allow the defense the opportunity to cross-examine. What was allowed at this trial was the admission of business records under the sponsorship of an employee of a subsidiary of a large corporation who had no knowledge as to the record\u2019s preparation. In view of the critical significance of all evidence bearing upon the extent of Maggio\u2019s activities in connection with the operation of USMM as well as the impressive nature and bulk of these records, we find that the Court\u2019s procedure for allowing the records into evidence as failing to comply with the proper rules for authentication of business records.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Liberal as we are to the fullest use of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1732, there are two prerequisites both of which are to be demonstrated to permit admission of business records. First, the Federal Business Records Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> states that the offeror must establish that the records were kept in the regular course of business. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co. v. Knox Homes Corp., 5 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 887; United States v. Barson, 5 Cir., 1970, 434 F.2d 127, 128. Secondly, testimony must be given by a custodian adequately authenticating the record\u2019s accuracy and explaining the efforts employed to ensure this accuracy. United States v. Dawson, 2 Cir., 1968, 400 F.2d 194, 198-199, cert. denied, 1969, 393 U.S. 1023, 89 S.Ct. 632, 21 L. Ed.2d 567; Bridger v. Union Railway Co., 6 Cir., 1966, 355 F.2d 382, 391-392.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">It is the circumstances under which the records are recorded, kept, maintained and used that gives the reliability essential to the law\u2019s conclusion that without any independent recollections by those who made the succession of entries they are reliable, precisely because the business relies on them for important business judgments. This principle of business acceptance was recognized by our Court in Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. Austin, 5 Cir., 1961, 292 F.2d 415, when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">\u201cIn the approach of the Model Act trustworthiness comes from a record (1) regularly made in the course of a business, (2) if it is a part of the regular course of that business to record the event or transaction at or near the time of its occurrence. Most frequently the inquiry concerns the regularity of the making of that record in a particular business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">292 F.2d at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">While the trial court does have wide discretion in determining the admissibility of documents as business records, United States v. Middlebrooks, 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 299, 302, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1009, 91 S.Ct. 569, 27 L. Ed.2d 622; McDaniel v. United States, 5 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 785, 788, cert. denied, 382 U.S. 826, 86 S.Ct. 59, 15 L.Ed. 2d 71, there must be minimal authentication proof to give them reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Over the pointed objection of Maggio\u2019s counsel' not a single legal or factual theory was urged to suggest the admissibility of records whose only claim to authenticity came from the marks on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>them and the corporate relationship between the local voucher\u2019s employer and Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Company. We cannot view this obvious error as harmless and therefore Maggio\u2019s conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\n<em>Blake</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">A review of the trial record shows that there was enough evidence on which the jury could have found that Blake was a participant in the scheme.'<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the C&amp;P telephone records admitted at trial also contained listings of calls from the USMM headquarters to a phone in Indiana registered to appellant Blake.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While Blake\u2019s attorney did not preserve the error by objection, the impressive number of C&amp;P telephone records, 10 from USMM to Blake and 136 to Maggio, and the nature of the crime being a conspiracy in which Maggio had so much to do, we cannot reject the possibility that the erroneous impression created by the records did not affect Blake. Therefore, he must be afforded the benefit of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\n<em>Swartz</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">We find the evidence to be insufficient to justify the conviction of appellant Swartz in the perpetration of the scheme. While the name James Swartz appears on the Articles of Incorporation for USMM, there is only dubious evidence identifying the James Swartz on trial as the same James Swartz whose name appears on the incorporation document. The weakness of the Government\u2019s ease is revealed by the fact that the Government handwriting expert could not even make a comparison of signatures since the Government electrostatic copy of the Articles was of such a poor quality. Only one Government witness identified the appellant at trial and that was John Toner, an employee of the National Bureau of Lathing and Plastering which officed in the same building as USMM. Toner stated that he had seen the appellant in the building where the USMM headquarters were located \u2014 but never in the USMM offices. At most all of the Government\u2019s ease suggests is that Swartz rented some office furniture and hired a secretary \u2014 who could not identify the appellant at the trial as the man who had hired her.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">The most convincing evidence that the appellant was connected with USMM was a record of 11 telephone calls between May and August of 1972. One call from the USMM headquarters went to the appellant\u2019s home and 10 calls were made to or from his place of business, Metro Cable Corporation. While these calls are sufficient to identify the appellant as USMM\u2019s Swartz, there was no other proof that the appellant was a participant in the conspiracy of mail fraud. No evidence was produced which proved that Swartz had any knowledge of the solicitation letter sent out by USMM. Even viewing the facts most favorable to the Government, the case was insufficient to justify a conviction of the appellant James Swartz.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Since Swartz did not file a motion for new trial, we reverse with directions to dismiss the indictment as to him. United States v. Musquiz, 5 Cir., 1971, 445 F.2d 963; United States v. Restano, 5 Cir., 1971, 449 F.2d 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Reversed with directions in part; reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-14\">.

The incriminating entries in the telephone records were summarized in a letter from Government counsel in response to the request made from the bench. He inspected the exhibits after the trial with Mr. Blake\u2019s attorney, James D. Harris, Jr. The exhibits not only contained records from the Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Company but also records from the Illinois Bell Telephone Company and the Indiana Bell Telephone Company which were properly authenticated at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u201cBriefly summarized the telephone records reveal the following: Government Exhibit 52 contains the telephone records of the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company for the listing of the United States Merchant Marine (Area Code 202 785-4587) beginning April 24, 1972, through November 21, 1972. The telephone records have been marked in pencil to indicate calls to Joe Maggio, (M) ; calls to William Blake, (B) ; calls to Metro Cable Company, (MC) and calls to James Swartz, (S). According to my tabulations the records reflect during the time period mentioned above 136 telephone calls from the United States Merchant Marine to appellant Maggio, 10 telephone calls to appellant Blake, 6 telephone calls to Metro Cable and 1 telephone call to appellant Swartz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">\u201cGovernment Exhibit 49 is the records of the Illinois Bell Telephone Company for telephone No. 815 398-8726 with appellant Joe Maggio shown as the subscriber.

As evidence of Blake\u2019s connection to the conspiracy, the Government raised the facts that Blake was shown as a director of USMM in the Articles of Incorporation and held the title of Director of Operations. He signed a request to open a bank account with Riggs Bank in Washington, D. C., for the USMM and personally signed a check to the USMM. His name was affixed to the letter of solicitation sent out for registrations. There were telephone records of calls made between April and September of 1972 from Blake\u2019s phone in Indiana to the USMM headquarters. Finally, the mysterious Woodrow Wilson informed the rental agent that the headquarters would be used by William E. Blake of 2921 Jackson Street, Michigan City, Indiana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b168-13\">.
