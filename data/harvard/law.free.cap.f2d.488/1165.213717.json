The only points on appeal that merit discussion are that testimony by a government witness suggesting Resnick\u2019s involvement in unrelated criminal activity requires a reversal, and that the firearms transaction record-keeping provisions are violative of the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-16\">Resnick was the president-owner of E.B.R. Enterprises, a licensed dealer in firearms, which operated Triggermart, a gun shop in Orlando, Florida. On January 25, 1971, two Georgia residents, Miles and Walker, decided to purchase two pistols at Triggermart. Because, federal law prohibits the sale of firearms to non-residents,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when the men tendered out-of-state checks, Resnick informed them that only in-state checks were acceptable. It was then agreed that the purchasers would arrange to have a check sent to Triggermart from an auto dealership in Cocoa, Florida, in which they were stockholders and officers. The manager of the dealership later mailed the check according to the instructions given by Miles and Walker, but the guns were never inventoried to the corporation. Rather, Resnick delivered the pistols to the two men after paying the purchase price from his own pocket.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He later placed the check from the dealership in Triggermart\u2019s cash register and withdrew the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-17\">After the financial details had been settled, Resniek inquired of those present in the store if any of the Florida. residents would be willing to \u201csign out\u201d the guns.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A Triggermart employee, Nancy Gray, consented and filled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>out the firearms transaction records indicating that she was the transferee of the two pistols. Miles and Walker filled out no forms, apparently unaware of the circumvention of the state residency requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">The second transaction for which Res-nick was prosecuted was initiated on March 18, 1971. On that date, an undercover agent of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the Treasury Department, Lloyd Michael Steele, entered Triggermart and indicated to Res-nick that he wanted to purchase two pistols, but did not want to sign for them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Resnick responded that the problem could be solved by purchasing a hunting and fishing license which could be used as \u201cidentification\u201d for the firearms purchase. Agent Steele gave his name as Michael L. Steed, but told Resnick that the name was fictitious. Not only did Resnick respond that the use of a phony name made no difference to him, but he also suggested that the address Agent Steele gave, 115 Gore Avenue, Daytona Beach, Florida \u2014 which Resnick also knew to be a sham \u2014 be changed to 115 Gore Avenue, Orlando. The bogus hunting and fishing license was then used as identification for the purchase of two pistols on that day and for the purchase of another pistol on April 7, 1971.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">Resniek\u2019s first claim of error stems from the following testimony elicited by the prosecution during direct examination of Agent Steele:</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">Q. Now, sir, after you purchased the weapons, what did you do then?</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">A. We had some conversation. He has a coffee vendor in there. I think I asked him if he had some coffee, and we were drinking coffee, and we had some conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-12\">And he asked me could I handle any hot guns; and I said, \u201cMost likely. All the guns I handle are hot, anyhow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-13\">Well, he says, \u201cIt does not make any difference to me.\u201d And\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-14\">Q. And then what did you say after he said it did not make any difference to him ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-15\">A. That was the end of that part of the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-16\">Q. What happened after that conversation ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-17\">A. After that conversation, he had mentioned something about an AK 180, I think it is, and I asked him if that was the type of weapon \u2014 it had a selector switch on it that did not work, that did not change it from automatic to full automatic \u2014 from a semi-automatic to a fully automatic \u2014 and he stated, yes, it was all that he had to do was remove the spring to make it fully automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-18\">And I asked him would he show me how to do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-19\">And he said, yes, which he did show me that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-20\">Following this exchange, defense counsel moved for a mistrial on the ground that Resnick had been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence of unrelated criminal activity, namely by the implication that the defendant dealt in stolen guns and participated in the unlawful alteration of semi-automatic weapons to fully automatic ones. The trial judge properly denied the motion for a mistrial, and stated that he would instruct the jury to disregard the tainted series of questions and answers. Conner v. United States, 5 Cir. 1963, 322 F.2d 647, cert. denied, 1964, 377 U.S. 907, 84 S.Ct. 1167, 12 L. Ed.2d 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>For reasons entirely unknown to us, the district court did not give the promised curative instructions, and defense counsel made no further reference to the matter. In fact, at the post instruction conference for objections to the charge as given, Resnick\u2019s attorney stated that he had no objection. We need not decide whether defense counsel\u2019s failure to call the district court\u2019s attention to the omission of the promised instructions makes applicable the plain error rule of F.R.Crim.P. 52(b), since the error, if any, is harmless.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-4\">If, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and judgment should stand ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">Kotteakos v. United States, 1946, 328 U. S. 750, 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557; F.R.Crim.P. 52(a). In the circumstances of this case, we are convinced that the substantial rights of Resnick were not affected.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-6\">[W]e have carefully canvassed the entire record and transcript, and are convinced that no prejudice resulted in any wise affecting the verdict of the jury. The evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt is strong, clear and convincing beyond question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">United States v. Christian, 8 Cir. 1970, 427 F.2d 1299, 1303, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 909, 91 S.Ct. 153, 27 L.Ed.2d 148. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Ratner, 5 Cir. 1972, 464 F.2d 169, 172-173.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">The second issue that we must determine is whether the record-keeping provisions of the federal firearms laws are violative of the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In support of that position, Resnick relies on Leary v. United States, 1969, 395 U. S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57; Marchetti v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889; Grosso v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906, and Haynes v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S. Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923. Such reliance is misplaced, however, since the challenged laws <em>sub judice </em>are not directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal acts, as was the situation in <em>Marchetti </em>and its progeny, <em>see e. g. </em>United States v. Walden, 4 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 1109, 1111, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 931, 90 S.Ct. 271, 24 L.Ed.2d 230. Rather the statutes regulate an essentially noncriminal activity, the sale of firearms. Such regulation is permissible under the \u201crequired records\u201d doctrine established by decisions such as Shapiro v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 92 L.Ed. 1787, and United States v. Sullivan, 1927, 274 U.S. 259, 47 S.Ct. 607, 71 L.Ed. 1037, and recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIqo\">[Tjhere is some possibility of prosecution \u2014 often a very real one \u2014 for criminal offenses disclosed by or deriving from the information that the law compels a person to supply. Information revealed by these reports could well be \u201ca link in the chain\u201d of evidence leading to prosecution and conviction. But under our holdings the mere possibility of incrimination is insufficient to defeat the strong policies in favor of a disclosure</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">California v. Byers, 1971, 402 U.S. 424, 428, 91 S.Ct. 1535, 1538, 29 L.Ed.2d 9. We conclude, therefore, that Resnick\u2019s fifth amendment attack on the firearms transaction record-keeping provisions must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-11\">We have fully considered the other points raised on appeal and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(b)(3) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-11\">It shall be unlawful for any ... licensed dealer ... to sell or deliver\u2014 any firearm to any person who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe does not reside in (or if the person is a corporation or other business entity, does not maintain a place of business in) the State in which the licensee\u2019s place of business is located ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1228-12\">.

In early May of 1971, Resnick instructed Nancy Gray to destroy the firearms transaction records which Agent Steele had completed and to make out replacements.
