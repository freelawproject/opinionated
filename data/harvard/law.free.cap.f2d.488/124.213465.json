J. Jameson, United States Senior District Judge for the District of Montana, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">The National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians (NABET) and its Local No. 531, the Association of Film Craftsmen, brought these actions against the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), 13 of its affiliated locals, and ten distributors and producers of motion pictures. In Count I they seek treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15), alleging a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1). In Count II they allege a state claim for breach of contract, relying upon the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction. The district court entered orders dismissing the complaints for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">In summarizing their contentions, appellants state that they have alleged \u201cthe existence of a combination of business and labor interests\u201d which has \u201crestrained trade and stifled competition in the production, sale and distribution of motion pictures\u201d. They contend that \u201cAll participants in the combination, the unions and producers and distributors alike, are liable under the Sherman Act to NABET for the injury done to its members as a direct result of defendants\u2019 concerted activities) to unlawfully exclude NABET from the industry.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-16\">We conclude that the conduct alleged in Count I was activity of the appellee unions in their own lawful self interest, protected under the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 17, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 52, the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 102, and the Labor Management Relations Act and therefore immune from the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">The right of a union to protect employees\u2019 job opportunities and wages from job and wage competition of members of other unions has been recognized repeatedly by the Supreme Court. See, e. g., Federation of Musicians v. Carroll, 391 U.S. 99, 106-110, 88 S.Ct. 1562, 20 L.Ed.2d 460 (1968) and cases there cited. Union activities having as their objective the preservation of jobs and guarding against encroachment of a rival union are immune from the anti-trust laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-18\">It is true, as appellants contend and appellees concede, that the immunity of unions for violation of the anti-trust laws is not automatic or absolute. A union is not exempt when it has \u201cparticipated with a combination of business men who had complete power to eliminate all competition among themselves and to prevent all competition from others,\u201d Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, 325 U.S. 797, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>809, 65 S.Ct. 1533, 1540, 89 L.Ed. 1939 (1945),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or where the union, \u201cby agreement with one set of employers, insists on maintaining in other bargaining units specified wage standards ruinous to the business of those employers\u201d, Ramsey v. Mine Workers, 401 U.S. 302, 313, 91 S.Ct. 658, 665, 28 L.Ed.2d 64 (1971).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">This is not an action where a non-union group complains that a union has conspired with its business competitors to restrain trade or stifle competition in the industry or market. Nor is it alleged that the members of appellant unions are employees of companies against whom a conspiracy is aimed by competing business interests. Rather it is alleged that the \u201cintent, purpose and effect\u201d of the \u201ccombination or conspiracy has been to substantially prohibit the employment of NABET member technicians\u201d in the motion picture industry and to deprive NABET and its members of the ability and right to bargain freely, all for the purpose of maintaining IATSE and its local unions \u201cas the sole and dominant representative of technical employees in the motion picture industry\u201d. Under these allegations the appel-lee unions were acting in their own self-interest rather than conspiring with non-business groups to create a monopoly among fellow conspiratory business interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">This court has held in two prior cases that similar allegations of violations of the Sherman Act by IATSE unions were insufficient to avoid immunity under the labor laws\u2014Schatte v. International Alliance, 182 F.2d 158, 167 (1950), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 827, 71 S.Ct. 64, 95 L.Ed. 608 (1950), reh. den., 340 U.S. 885, 71 S.Ct. 194, 95 L.Ed. 643 (1950) and Conference of Studio Unions v. Loew\u2019s, Inc., 193 F.2d 51, 54-55 (1951), cert. denied, 342 U.S. 919, 72 S.Ct. 367, 96 L.Ed. 687 (1952).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We adhere to the principles followed in those cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">Upon dismissal of Count I the district court properly dismissed Count II under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed. 2d 218 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-13\">. Plaintiffs were given two opportunities to amend their complaints, after which the district court dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b187-14\">. In further explanation of the nature of the action, appellants state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-15\">\u201cThe Complaint charges not that the unions acting in concert with the distributors and producers sought <em>to preserve </em>their jobs; rather the defendant labor unions are charged with conspiring with non-labor groups to prevent NABET members from negotiating for and/or entering into employment with the defendant producers.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-20\">. The Court \u201chas recognized that a legitimate aim of any national labor organization is to obtain uniformity of labor standards and that a consequence of such union activity may be to eliminate competition based on differences in such standards.\u201d Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 666, 85 S. Ct. 1596, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\">. In Bradley, the plaintiffs were manufacturers of electrical equipment who had alleged that the unions conspired with contractors and manufacturers who had \u201cunited with one another to \u2022 monopolize all the business in New York City, to bar all other business men from that area, and to charge the public prices above a competitive level\u201d. 325 U.S. at 809, 65 S.Ct. at 1540. The union, the Court held, \u201caid[ed] and abet[ted] business men to do the precise things which that [the Sherman] Act prohibits\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 801, 65 S.Ct. at 1536.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">. In <em>Ramsey </em>the plaintiffs were coal mine operators who \u201caccused respondent United Mine Workers of America of violating the Sherman Act by conspiring with various coal producers to drive petitioners out of business\u201d. 401 U.S. at 304, 91 S.Ct. at 660.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b188-16\">. The court held in these cases that plaintiffs had not alleged injury to \u201ctheir business or property\u201d by reason of any violation of the anti-trust laws, saying in Conference of Studio Unions v. Loew\u2019s Inc., \u201cThey [plaintiff unions] are not in the business of producing motion pictures; they do not exhibit motion pictures; they neither compete with the Majors nor purchase from them. In fact, they are not employees of the companies whom it is alleged the appellees intend to destroy. The damage alleged to have been suffered by appellants does not flow from any injury to the competitive situation of the motion picture industry, that is, their injury has not arisen from the acts allegedly perpetrated against the Independents.\u201d 193 F.2d at 54.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b188-17\">. The subsequent cases upon which appellants rely are all factually distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
