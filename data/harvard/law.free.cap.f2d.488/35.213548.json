Citizens Casualty Company of New York, 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b98-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">Plaintiff Donald Jolly appeals from the order of the district court dismissing his complaint for lack of jurisdiction. This lawsuit represents plaintiff\u2019s third attempt to obtain relief in state or federal court from the action of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) in suspending him as president of AFGE Local 2206, Birmingham, Alabama, and in imposing a trusteeship on the local union. Plaintiff previously had sought injunctive relief, but both the federal district court and the Alabama circuit court dismissed for want of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-17\">In the instant case, plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment holding Executive Order 11491 \u201cunconstitutional as contravening procedural due process and equal protection under the law\u201d because it requires government employees to exhaust administrative remedies not demanded of private employees. Plaintiff invoked the jurisdiction, of the federal district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 28 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202. Once again the district court dismissed for want of jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-18\">The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202, authorizes federal courts to provide declaratory relief; but it does not of itself confer jurisdiction on the federal courts. Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 1950, 339 U.S. 667, 671-672, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>L.Ed. 1194, 1197-1200; El Paso Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. El Paso Chapter Assoc. Gen. Contractors of America, 5 Cir. 1967, 376 F.2d 797, 799. Consequently, plaintiff\u2019s claim here must rest on the establishment of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Section 1331 confers original jurisdiction on the federal courts over \u201cfederal question\u201d cases provided that \u201cthe matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000 ..\u201d Plaintiff has made no allegation that the matter in controversy here exceeds $10,000, and nothing in the pleadings or record indicates that such an amount is involved. Thus, plaintiff has failed to establish that the federal court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Plaintiff has claimed no other basis for federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-11\">. Though neither court stated its reasons for dismissal, it appears that plaintiff had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under Executive Order 11491 and its. implementing regulations, which provide for resolution of such disputes in administrative proceedings before the Department of Labor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
