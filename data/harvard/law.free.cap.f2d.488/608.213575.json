Part 150, Subpart L, that were then in effect pursuant to the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as amended. On September 10, 1973, the district court denied an <em>ex parte </em>application for a temporary restraining order that had been filed with the complaint. This appeal was taken from that denial of interim relief. However, a denial of an <em>ex parte </em>motion for a temporary restraining order is not an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-23\">We also observe that, during the pendency of this proceeding, the chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>lenged regulations have been amended to relieve retailers of the particular hardships that are alleged as the basis of the appellants\u2019 complaint. Thus, the controversy presented by the September 7 complaint has become moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">For these reasons, this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
