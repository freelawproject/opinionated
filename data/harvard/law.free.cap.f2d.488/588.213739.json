Questions are raised both as to the sufficiency of the evidence and as to the reception of evidence obtained from wiretapped and recorded telephone conversations. A number of the questions of law involved were also <em>sub judice </em>by another panel of this court in United States v. Bynum, 475 F.2d 832 (2d Cir. 1973). There was in that case a remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing in respect to legality of the wiretap evidence; a decision in this case was withheld pending that evidentiary hearing and the opinion of the <em>Bynum </em>panel after remand, which has now been filed. United States v. Bynum, 485 F.2d 490. (2d Cir. 1973). Some of the questions, particularly with respect to the necessity for \u201cminimization\u201d of the wiretaps and of what that minimization should consist were answered by the court in <em>Bynum </em>and in part on the basis thereof we affirm the judgments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">For treatment of the issues involved here, however, we must recount the evidence specifically and in some detail recount the wiretap evidence, that is to say, the evidence obtained by use of the wiretaps and the way in which the wiretaps were conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">A. <em>The evidence prior to the wiretaps. </em>The overall proof of the Government was to the effect that Joseph La-Cosa was the most visible member of a family narcotics business<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> involved in distributing millions of dollars\u2019 worth of heroin and cocaine in the period between April 1970, and April, 1972. His principal, if not sole, source for the heroin was, according to the Government\u2019s ease, his uncle who lived in New Jersey, Joseph Manfredi, and one of his principal assistants was his cousin, the late Philip J. Manfredi. Other family members also convicted include his father, Frank LaCosa, and his cousin Timothy Schrader. All of these defendants and Vincent Yanni, Charles Cassarella and Robert Mayo, all of whom were distributors or dealers who purchased from the LaCosa-Manfredi family, and Anthony Colangelo, a supplier of cocaine, were convicted below on Count I of an indictment alleging a conspiracy to distribute narcotics in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4705(a) and 7237(b) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Joseph LaCosa was charged under Count II of the indictment with, and convicted of, \u201cengages in a continuing criminal enterprise\u201d involving narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848 and under Count III with distribution of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The Manfredi-LaCosa narcotics organization numbered among its customers Horace and William Marble, Herman Grant, Robert Roseboro, Thaddeus Byrd, and Garland Currie (now deceased), in addition to the other convicted defendants. Horace Marble, who was in partnership with Herman Grant in the heroin traffic in Harlem, met Joseph La-Cosa, under the name \u201cJoey,\u201d on April 10, 1970. Commencing with the purchase of one ounee of heroin on the following day, another ounce three days later, and then one-eighth of a kilogram, Horace Marble became a regular purchaser from Joseph LaCosa who, some- \u2022 times accompanied by Philip J. Manfre-di, personally delivered the heroin to Marble until October of 1971 when Marble was arrested. Marble alone purchased between one and two kilograms of heroin per week at prices of $23,500 for one kilogram and $46,000 for two kilograms from the summer of 1970 to October of 1971. Most of the deliveries took place at Third Avenue and 76th or 86th Street in New York after a telephone call from LaCosa to Marble, with payment being made for the preceding shipment each time. William Marble, who was involved in his brother\u2019s distribution organization, sometimes received the telephone calls from LaCosa and relayed messages to his brother or occasionally himself picked up heroin from LaCosa or Philip J. Manfredi, including some smaller amounts for his own use. While it is nothing new perhaps to the avid readers of Second Circuit opinions, it might be mentioned that a purchaser such as Horace Marble with his 20-per-son heroin milling and distribution organization was engaged in an operation so widespread that each of the 17 or so sellers in the group supplied about 50 addicts with heroin. Each kilogram of heroin purchased from LaCosa produced about 600 \u201cbundles,\u201d each bundle consisting of 25 \u201cbags,\u201d the \u201cbags\u201d in turn each selling for five dollars on the street, so that the street value of each kilogram was about $75,000. Joseph LaCosa, who was not one to hide his light under the proverbial basket, identified his heroin connection to Horace Marble as his uncle, who LaCosa said was \u201cbig and in organized crime,\u201d adding that his uncle picked up the heroin from the trunk of a car in New Jersey. LaCosa also told Horace Marble that he had another customer in the District of Columbia who purchased four kilograms of heroin per week, so that Marble was only his second biggest customer. Marble once totaled the bills he received from LaCosa for heroin delivered to him as close to one million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In the latter part of 1970 Joseph La-Cosa, who apparently had access to more narcotics than Horace Marble and his Washington, D. C., customer could buy, asked Horace to locate additional dealers for him. Marble introduced him to Robert Roseboro, who testified for the Government. Roseboro had his own heroin milling operation and purchased half-kilogram packages on a bi-weekly basis with deliveries made at the Gracie Square Hospital where Roseboro was on methadone maintenance. On December 15, 1970, Roseboro delivered a half-kilogram of heroin obtained from LaCosa to Agent White of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) and was then arrested and agreed to cooperate with the Government. After his arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>he met LaCosa while under surveillance and at these meetings LaCosa bragged about his new Cadillac and his new swimming pool and agreed to meet a \u201ccustomer\u201d from Detroit. Roseboro in turn agreed to pay LaCosa $3,000 which he owed him at his (Roseboro\u2019s) apartment. At the apartment LaCosa told Roseboro that his own uncle was his boss and that his uncle\u2019s name was \u201cJoe.\u201d The purchaser from Detroit, who was a Government agent, put $12,700 in the glove compartment of a rented car and, with Roseboro, met LaCosa at Second Avenue and 70th Street. LaCosa took the car to First Avenue and 84th Street where he abandoned it and joined Philip J. Manfredi in a Cadillac registered to Timothy Schra-der. As the Cadillac moved uptown, LaCosa was observed showing a quantity of money to the driver but La-Cosa did not return with the heroin as planned. He later told Horace Marble that he believed (quite correctly) that he was being followed by the police. Through Marble, the half-kilogram of heroin was delivered by LaCosa to the Government agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Moving to the spring of 1971, Thaddeus Byrd, a gas station attendant, was a drug courier for and in the gypsy taxi business with one Garland Currie, a narcotics dealer and another one of Joseph LaCosa\u2019s customers. Byrd, with Currie, met LaCosa, identified as \u201cDuke,\u201d and subsequently picked up heroin from and delivered money to him on Currie\u2019s behalf, generally at 80th Street and Lexington Avenue. LaCosa instructed Byrd to use the code word \u201cshirt\u201d for heroin in telephone conversations \u2014 just as he had done in transactions with Roseboro. Byrd discussed narcotics over the telephone with LaCosa and, working for Currie, often bought up to two kilograms of heroin in a series of purchases. Byrd was stopped on October 17, 1971, by Agent White of the BNDD after he had delivered money to LaCosa for Cur-rie. Currie died before Byrd saw him again, but Currie\u2019s partner, Fred Powell, continued in the business, with Byrd purchasing narcotics twice more from LaCosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">B. <em>The wiretap evidence and accompanying surveillance. </em>On the basis of affidavits by the Rockland County District Attorney, Robert Meehan, State Investigator John Crodelle, and BNDD. Agent Frank White, telephonic interception was requested on a 24-hour-a-day basis at the LaCosa home at 11 Daisey Court, Nanuet, New York, and the Man-fredi-Schrader home at 10 Sable Court, West Nyack, New York.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The affidavit of Crodelle specifically stated: \u201cYour deponent recognized that not all the conversations occurring over the subject telephones will pertain to the said narcotics violations, and accordingly your deponent agrees to limit the seizure of conversations to those specifically pertaining to the aforementioned Penal Law violations.\u201d Justice Sweeney of the New York State Supreme Court issued warrants commencing on September 17, 1971, for wiretaps on both phones permitting law enforcement authorities \u201cto intercept, eavesdrop, listen to and make copies of conversations . . . concerning penal law violations pertaining to the crimes of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the first degree, criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the first degree, and conspiracy to commit violation of the aforesaid sections of law.\u201d There was an extension of these orders to November 14, 1971<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Surveil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>lance was continuous with monitoring agents of the BNDD taking eight-hour shifts, the only exception being when the Daisey Court LaCosa instrument was out of order between September 30, 1971, and October 20, 1971. During this period every conversation was listened to and recorded. Brief notes on the content of the conversations were made in log books maintained by the monitoring agents. Transcription summaries of conversations were then prepared from the tapes; calls thought to be \u201cnon-pertinent\u201d were described only briefly in these transcript summaries. Calls thought by the transcribing agents to be pertinent \u2014 some shrouded in the code language recounted above and below\u2014 were more fully summarized in the transcript sheets. Verbatim transcriptions were prepared of conversations which were obviously pertinent to the case under investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Twenty-seven conversations were offered in evidence and 24 were admitted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Shortly after installation of the interception device at 11 Daisey Court on September 17, 1971, at 5:03 p. m., appellant Cassarella ordered double what he got \u201cthe last time\u201d from Joseph LaCosa with delivery to be that night. Seven minutes later \u201cBenny\u201d spoke with Frank LaCosa and arranged for a delivery the following week, Frank assuring him that, if he got the money on one day, the \u201cstuff\u201d would be available the next day, or \u201cif it\u2019s early enough you can have it the same night. . . . \u201d Three days later at 9:35 a. m. \u201cVinnie\u201d called Philip J. Manfredi at 10 Sable Court, and at 3:27 p. m. ordered \u201ctwo shirts\u201d from Philip which the latter agreed to deliver at 7:00 p. m. After a further conversation at 5:20 p. m. between Vinnie\u2019s man \u201cAlex\u201d and Philip J. Manfredi it was agreed that delivery would be at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>\u201cfrankfurter place\u201d on Third Avenue and 86th Street where the Marble deliveries were generally made. Following that call, Agent White observed Philip J. Manfredi leave 10 Sable Court at 6:10 p. m., enter the Schrader Cadillac and drive to Third Avenue and 86th Street in Manhattan where at 7:10 p. m. he got out of the car. Shortly after that he was arrested. Later that evening Philip\u2019s sister, Josephine, discussed the arrest .over the telephone at 10 Sable Court with \u201cRoe,\u201d, stating that Philip had a \u201cquarter\u201d on him and advising \u201cRoe\u201d to \u201cclean up\u201d her house. Following Philip J. Manfredi\u2019s arraignment on September 21, Timothy Schrader phoned from the courthouse to Joseph LaCosa at 11 Dais-ey Court and instructed him to \u201ctake the money and put it in a suitcase\u201d and to take \u201cthe guns\u201d to his aunt\u2019s house \u201cto be safe.\u201d On September 23, 1971, at 7:47 p. m., \u201cFrankie\u201d called Joseph La-Cosa at 11 Daisey Court and after some preliminary conversation pertaining plainly to Philip's arrest three days before asked him if he had seen his \u201cfriend\u201d the other night, by which it may be inferred he meant his connection for narcotics. LaCosa replied that his friend had told him to \u201cgo over there tomorrow afternoon.\u201d Frankie told him to \u201clet me know .... [Clause ah desperation sitting here.\u201d LaCosa did in fact go to his uncle\u2019s house the following day, September 24, 1971, and left it at 6:00 p. m. whereupon he drove back to 11 Daisey Court, Nanuet, his own house. There, at 8:00 p. m. on the evening of the 24th, he received a phone call from appellant \u201cButch\u201d Yanni who, again after some preliminary talk about Philip\u2019s arrest, asked him \u201cif we can do anything.\u201d LaCosa replied that he \u201cmissed the guy tonight\u201d and that he \u201cjust missed him by five minutes.\u201d Yanni indicated that he might go to \u201cthe guy in the Bronx\u201d (another supplier) but that he didn\u2019t want any \u201chard feelings\u201d on LaCosa\u2019s part. Two days later at 8:10 p. m. Yanni again telephoned Joseph LaCosa to find out \u201cwhat\u2019s happening?\u201d and was told to wait until \u201ctomorrow\u201d when he would be seeing \u201chim\u201d (his connection) at \u201ctwo or. three o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201d The next day, September 27, 1971, Joseph LaCosa left 11 Daisey Court at 1:15 p. m. and drove to Joseph Manfredi\u2019s house at 115 Kipp Avenue, where he arrived 45 minutes later. The surveillance agent, White, passed the house and saw Joseph Manfredi standing in the driveway. White then followed LaCosa toward the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge, whereupon LaCosa, going 85 to 100 miles per hour, lost the agent, who was only doing 75 to 80. The agent, however, went to LaCosa\u2019s residence at 11 Daisey Court and saw him drive a 1971 Cadillac back into his garage at 4:30 p. m. Twenty-five minutes later Joseph LaCosa telephoned Yanni and scheduled a meeting for 11:00 p. m. that night. He later telephoned William Marble also to arrange a meeting and shortly after midnight that night the surveilling agents observed a series of half a dozen cars, including the proverbial late-model Cadillacs and Lincolns, enter the LaCosa garage at 11 Daisey Court at ten-minute intervals, each car staying in the garage for five minutes or so and then leaving the area. A jury might assume that they were not arriving for purposes of oil changes or motor repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">On September 28, 1971, the following day, at 6:55 p. m. Yanni called Joseph LaCosa and confirmed a meeting at 9:00 p. m. that night and asked if he could get an \u201cextra shirt or two\u201d to which Joseph LaCosa replied, \u201cBy tomorrow.\u201d At 8:00 p. m. Joseph LaCosa received a call from an unidentified male telling him to wait \u201cif I am a little late.\u201d At 8:20 p. m. Yanni called and asked \u201chow long it will be before you get another shirt down.\u201d LaCosa replied \u201cthe next day or even tomorrow night,\u201d whereupon Yanni explained \u201c \u2019Cause he asked me for four more.\u201d They agreed to meet the following night. On September 29 at 9:35 p. m. Yanni telephoned Joseph LaCosa to tell him that he was waiting for \u201cthat guy\u201d and invited LaCosa to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>drop by late that night for the money. LaCosa agreed to meet Yanni the following day and said that \u201cthe four shirts\u201d were definite. In the light of the non-wiretap testimony from the Marbles, Byrd and Roseboro, a jury might have assumed that these calls did not have to do with men\u2019s furnishings.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Earlier on September 29, LaCosa had called Thaddeus Byrd setting up a meeting for that night and complaining that Byrd\u2019s last payment of $20,000 was short by $1,000; LaCosa also called William Marble asking for Horace Marble and arranging for a pickup of $1,300 that night from William.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">On September 30, 1971, Agent White followed Joseph LaCosa to Yanni\u2019s house in New City, New York, where he arrived at'12:30 a. m., that is, later the night of the 29th; photographs in evidence showed LaCosa entering and leaving the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">At 8:00 p. m. on October 28, Agent White observed Charles Cassarella enter his residence in Queens. Twenty-five minutes later Cassarella called Philip J. Manfredi at 10 Sable Court to ask Phillip whether LaCosa would \u201cdo that thing for me or not,\u201d complaining that \u201cthese guys keep bothering me every day.\u201d Phillip\u2019s reply was \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll let you know, all right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">On November 6, 1971, at 5:40 p. m. Joseph LaCosa placed a telephone call to appellant Anthony Colangelo. Colangelo insisted on a meeting at 7:45 p. m. that evening to deliver a \u201cpair of pants\u201d which is a commonly used narcotics code word for cocaine. LaCosa agreed and Colangelo told him to bring the price of one pair of pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">C. <em>Additional evidence. </em>On March 14, 1972, searches were conducted pursuant to warrants at the LaCosa home at 11 Daisey Court, the Manfredi-Schrader home at 10 Sable Court, and the Yanni home at New City, New York. Much additional evidence was obtained. This evidence included slips of paper bearing references to the defendants on trial and substantial numerical figures identified by Horace Marble as similar to bills of account he received from Joseph La-Cosa; an address book bearing names and telephone numbers of the conspirators Grant, Marble, Mayo and Byrd at the home of the Schraders; $39,764 in cash in Timothy Schrader\u2019s bedroom; and other miscellaneous items. Three days later, with the use of the address book, Agent Siegel called various telephone numbers found in it. One was that of Herman Grant with whom Siegel as \u201cJoey LaCosa\u2019s cousin Dominick\u201d arranged to deliver a \u201ccouple of shirts.\u201d In return for the \u201cshirts\u201d he received $18,000, following which Grant was arrested. Agent Siegel also called Anthony Colangelo with the use of*the LaCosa address book with the same story. Col-angelo asked the price, to which Siegel replied $12,000. Colangelo said he wasn\u2019t sure and didn\u2019t know whether he would take them. At that point a telephone next to Siegel rang loudly in the BNDD headquarters. Colangelo stated that he didn\u2019t know anyone by the name of Joey LaCosa and that Siegel must have the wrong party and hung up. Siegel also called Robert Mayo with the same story. Mayo \u201cagreed to take them,\u201d that is to say, the shirts, and Mayo said he didn\u2019t owe LaCosa any money and that they should meet at the \u201cusual place\u201d which he defined as 126th Street and Fifth Avenue. Mayo did not show up, so Siegel telephoned him again and Mayo subsequently said he couldn\u2019t handle the shirts.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">On April 30, 1972, Agent White arrested Joseph Manfredi and, after proper warnings, on the way to New York Manfredi stated to White that he thought that the Bureau of Narcotics was going to place him under arrest at the time that Philip J. Manfredi had been arrested in September, 1971. In addition a summary of telephone records was stipulated into evidence which indicated among other things that in the first four months of 1971 there were 64 \u25a0 calls from the Daisey Court telephone to a telephone in the name of Diane Marble, that is to say, her husband, Horace, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>and in 11 days\u2019 time in August and September of 1971, 12 calls from that number to Robert Mayo, four calls from the Nanuet number to Tony Colangelo between November 8, 1971, and November 11, 1971, and 40 calls from Anthony Col-angelo to the Nanuet number between October 29, 1971, and November 8, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">A. <em>Joseph LaCosa. </em>There was ample evidence in the testimony of Horace and William Marble, Robert Roseboro and Thaddeus Byrd, independent of the wiretaps, to show that Joseph LaCosa was selling heroin and cocaine in a continuing series of weekly transactions with several distributors, the primary product pushed being heroin. To Horace Marble alone he sold an estimated one million dollars' worth in 17 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">B. <em>Joseph Manfredi. </em>There was sufficient circumstantial evidence independent of hearsay declarations from which Manfredi\u2019s participation in the conspiracy could be inferred. In United States v. Calabro, 449 F.2d 885, 889-890 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 928, 92 S.Ct. 978, 30 L.Ed.2d 801 (1972), presence of the defendant with a codefendant when the eodefendant was engaged in a criminal enterprise, coupled with the defendant\u2019s \u201cpatting down\u201d an undercover agent, was held to be sufficient independent evidence to permit an inference of the defendant\u2019s having associated himself with the criminal venture. <em>See also </em>United States v. Geaney, 417 F.2d 1116, 1120-1121 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1028, 90 S.Ct. 1276, 25 L.Ed.2d 539 (1970). This independent evidence may be completely circumstantial. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Cassino, 467 F.2d 610, 618 n.21 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 928, 93 S. Ct. 1363, 35 L.Ed.2d 590 (1973). By actual surveillance Joseph LaCosa was seen to try to meet his uncle at the times he told his customers he was going to meet his \u201cfriend.\u201d After he did meet his uncle on one occasion he eluded Agent White on the return to his home and that same night there was a series of visits to his garage that can fairly be described as clandestine. The calls by Joseph LaCosa to his distrubors do not implicate Manfredi as such, but they do shed light on LaCosa\u2019s conduct which in turn is circumstantial proof that Manfredi was supplying him with heroin. <em>See </em>United States v. Ruiz, 477 F.2d 918 (2d Cir. 1973); United States v. Pacelli, 470 F.2d 67, 69-70 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 983, 93 S. Ct. 1501, 36 L.Ed.2d 178 (1973); United States v. Calabro, <em>supra. </em>There was, then, sufficient independent evidence to establish Manfredi\u2019s participation in the conspiracy to warrant introduction of hearsay statements against him. Glas-ser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 74, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). These statements by Joseph LaCosa to Horace Marble and Robert Roseboro, recounted in the recital of facts above, established Manfredi as the supplier of heroin to LaCosa, thereby confirming the circumstantial evidence related above. They were made in the furtherance of the conspiracy, since LaCosa was obviously trying to impress his customers with the importance, connections, wealth and power of his uncle in order to build sound \u201ccustomer relations.\u201d They have a ring of reliability for this very reason. There is no requirement that the trial judge must find, before admitting a co-conspirator\u2019s declaration, that it is neither \u201ccrucial\u201d to the Government\u2019s case nor \u201cdevastating\u201d to the defense. United States v. Puco, 476 F.2d 1099, on petition for rehearing, 476 F.2d 1106, 1107 (2d Cir. 1973). Even if there were such a requirement, the hearsay declarations here were neither more \u201ccrucial\u201d nor more \u201cdevastating\u201d than the declarations in <em>Puco </em>itself. United States v. Puco, 476 F.2d at 1103-1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">C. <em>Frank LaCosa, Timothy Schrader, Charles Cassarella and Robert Mayo. </em>Appellants Yanni and Colangelo do not contest the sufficiency of the evidence against them. Frank LaCosa\u2019s house was used for the operation of the narcotics business, his garage was used as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>delivery point, his Lincoln was used by his son Joseph for deliveries; more importantly perhaps his telephone conversation with \u201cBenny\u201d on September 17, 1971, implicates him clearly \u2014 he could deliver the \u201cstuff\u201d the day following receipt of the money or if it\u2019s early enough in the day \u201cyou can have it the same night . . . this way they don\u2019t think that they\u2019re getting cheated.\u201d Schrader\u2019s house, telephone and cars were used by Joseph LaCosa and Philip J. Manfredi to arrange narcotics trans-' actions and handle deliveries; his telephone call from the courthouse and treasure trove of nearly $40,000 in cash permit the inference of participation and reward in the conspiracy. Cassarel-la\u2019s calls were more guarded, perhaps, even than the others, but were in \u201cnarcotics code,\u201d requesting \u201cdouble\u201d what he got \u201cthe last time,\u201d inquiring whether Joey was \u201cgoing to do that for me or not,\u201d and in an obvious reference to his own customers, complaining that \u201cthese guys keep bothering me every day.\u201d Robert Mayo, who was in Joseph La-Cosa\u2019s address book, was a customer of the ring; Mayo was willing to do business with Agent Siegel masquerading on the telephone as \u201cJoey\u2019s cousin Dominick,\u201d the business being the taking of \u201ca couple of shirts\u201d and at the \u201cusual place\u201d; that he had done a considerable amount of business was indicated by the numerous calls from 11 Daisey Court to Mayo at the end of August, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">III. THE WIRETAP QUESTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b659-15\">We omit reference to the question of constitutionality of the federal wiretap statute, Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, since United States v. Tortorello, 480 F. 2d 764 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 866, 94 S.Ct. 63, 38 L.Ed.2d 86 (1973), and United States v. Bynum, <em>supra, </em>485 F.2d at 499-500, have dealt with that issue adversely to appellants, noting that the very issue is before the Supreme Court in United States v. Giordano, 469 F.2d 522 (4th Cir. 1972), cert. granted, 411 U.S. 905, 93 S.Ct. 1530, 36 L.Ed.2d 194 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-16\">The principal attacks made on the wiretapping here are (1) an omission in both the original and renewal warrant orders to require \u201cminimization\u201d under state law, CPL \u00a7 700.30, and (2) an alleged failure to minimize the interception of innocent conversation on the two telephones tapped, contrary to state law, CPL \u00a7 700.30, and federal law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(5).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number> In dealing with the question of the validity of the warrants themselves, clearly a question of state law,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it will be recalled that the Crodelle affidavit submitted to the state court judge in support of the petition seeking the wiretap order contained an agreement \u201cto limit the seizure of conversations to those specifically pertaining to the aforementioned Penal Law violations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Neither the original nor renewal warrant orders, however, contained any directive to this effect. \u2022 CPL \u00a7 700.30 specifically says that \u201cAn eavesdropping warrant must contain: . \u25a0 . . 7. A provision that the authorization to intercept . . . shall be conducted in such a way. as to minimize the interception of communications not' otherwise subject to eavesdropping under this article. . . . \u201d New York state judges have construed this requirement in different ways, Justice McGrover in People v. Solomon, 74 Misc.2d 926, 346 N.Y.S.2d 938, 941 (Sup.Ct.1973), holding that omission of that specific directive was \u201cnothing more than a \u2018de minimis\u2019 oversight,\u201d which would not vitiate an eavesdropping order, while Judge Werken in People v. Kennedy, 75 Misc.2d 10, 347 N.Y.S.2d 327 (Greene Cty.Ct. 1973), held a wiretap order fatally defective for failure to comply with the 700.30 requirement. <em>Compare </em>People v. Sher, 68 Misc.2d 917, 329 N.Y.S.2d 2 (Greene Cty.Ct. 1972), <em>with </em>People v. Heuston, 42 A.D.2d 860, 347 N.Y.S.2d 78 (1973) (3-2 decision) (re notice), <em>and </em>People v. Palozzi, 74 Misc.2d 774, 346 N.Y.S.2d 595 (Monroe Cty.Ct. 1973). No New York case, however, involves reliance in the order upon supporting affidavits which contain an agreement to \u201cminimize.\u201d In this case we feel free to analogize from United States v. Tortorello, 480 F.2d at 781, which, while it apparently did not consider the matter as controlled by state law, held that a New York state judge\u2019s authorization order was sufficient to establish probable cause on the basis of facts alleged in the supporting affidavits. We feel it proper to read both the orders themselves and the minimization language of the supporting affidavits in \u201ca commonsense and realistic fashion.\u201d <em>See </em>United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965) (probable cause); United States v. Desist, 384 F.2d 889 (2d Cir. 1967), aff\u2019d, 394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969). We read CPL 700.30(7) also as a summation of the more specific requirements of 700.30 subd. 1-700.30 subd. 6, all of which lead to \u201cminimization.\u201d So reading the state statute and the orders and affidavits, we do not find the orders vitiated by virtue of omission of the talismanic minimization language.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\"> We turn now to the more difficult question whether, in this case, the eavesdropping was conducted so \u201cas to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to eavesdropping\u201d under CPL \u00a7 700.30 subd. 7. This question is, like that of the facial validity of the warrant, one to be determined by reference to state law. Assessment of the minimization question necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ultimately depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">As previously stated, <em>see </em>text following note 4 <em>supra, </em>all calls incoming or outgoing over the two telephones involved were monitored and recorded irrespective of the identity of the parties engaged in the conversations. After the transcription of the conversations was accomplished in either summary or verbatim fashion, the tapes themselves were kept under lock and key. The court has examined both the monitor logs and the transcription sheets with some care in order to appreciate more fully the claims made by both the defendants and the Government with respect to minimization.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Our examination of state court decisions construing and applying CPL \u00a7 700.30 subd. 7 leads us to conclude that none of them is either dispositive or particularly indicative of how the New York courts would rule on the facts before us. The New York Court of Appeals has yet to consider this question. In People v. Holder, 69 Misc.2d 863, 331 N.Y.S.2d 557 at 569-571, the two defendants were under indictment for conspiracy to cause the felonious death of a third party. In that quite simple conspiracy, the fact that fewer than 10 per cent of the conversations recorded were relevant to the conspiracy appears to have been determinative of the court\u2019s decision to suppress. In People v. Castania, 73 Misc.2d 166, 340 N.Y.S.2d 829, 833-836 (Monroe Cty.Ct. 1973), the court was faced with a gambling conspiracy more complex than the conspiracy in <em>Holder </em>but which cannot be equated with the conspiracy before this court. In <em>Castania </em>the court took account of the fact that only slightly over one-half of the conversations had been monitored, which, coupled with the court\u2019s assumption that non-pertinent calls could have been recognized as such and not intercepted, dictated a finding that minimization had not been achieved. It is precisely that assumption made by the <em>Castania </em>court which cannot be made in this case. In People v. Kennedy, defendants were under indictment for <em>possession </em>of dangerous drugs and associated paraphernalia. The court, in dicta, indicated its disapproval of a practice under which only 10 per cent of the calls recorded were actually monitored, thereby virtually negating the possibility of minimizing the interception of calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">These state cases, since they do not deal with complex, far-flung narcotics conspiracies, are not dispositive of the case before us. We feel free, in these circumstances, to consider the question of minimization under the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(5) and decisions thereunder, noting that the language of CPL \u00a7 700.30 subd. 7 virtually tracks that of the federal statute. We also note that in considering the question of minimization, the <em>Holder </em>court, 331 N.Y.S.2d at 571, and the <em>Castania </em>court, 340 N.Y.S.2d at 836, both appear to incorporate by reference lower federal court decisions addressed to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">We are aided by the trial court\u2019s finding that the law enforcement agents here made a \u201cgood faith effort to minimize to the extent practical and electronically possible, within the peculiar circumstances of a narcotics conspiracy\u2014 which is one of the most difficult things to surveil and obtain evidence on that I can think of in modern law enforcement . . . \u201d We held in <em>Bynum, </em>485 F.2d at 500, that \u201cthe mere fact that every conversation is monitored does not necessarily render the surveillance violative of the minimization requirement of the statute.\u201d What Judge Tyler was talking about here was doubtless that in a narcotics conspiracy the use of code words and cover-up jargon and methods of dealing make investigation most difficult. Here, as in <em>Bynum, </em>\u201cit is . obvious that no electronic surveillance can be so conducted that innocent conversation can be totally eliminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500. Here there was testimony that \u201cmost\u201d of the 1,595 calls intercepted were deemed to be \u201cgermane\u201d to the narcotics investigation. In all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>candor, our examination of the logs and transcription sheets does not lend credit to that testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the same time, here as in <em>Bynum, </em>the conspiracy unveiled was a huge business involving millions of dollars\u2019 worth of narcotics, numerous distributors and highly complex, surreptitious telephone calls, with numerous callers, male and female, both in and out of the surveilled homes, occupied by persons at least one of whom was openly claiming to be connected with organized crime in the operation of the business. We too fail to see how any detailed screening instructions which could effectively minimize licit telephone interceptions could be devised under these circumstances. Here no claim is made that the Government could have formulated a pattern of innocent calls by which it could have avoided intercepting those. Here no claim is made that any privileged calls were intercepted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Calls dealing with the narcotics conspiracy were made at all hours of the day or night, so that no minimization by non-use in certain time periods could be attempted. In the sampling of about 100 calls listened to by Agent White, he heard \u201cvery few\u201d \u2014 indeed he did not remember hearing any \u2014 that did not relate to drugs or the proceeds obtained from drugs. Moreover, it is perfectly clear from the record that some seemingly innocuous calls were in fact related to the drug conspiracy; evidentiary significance could be ascertained only by comparison with other conversations involving the same persons or in the light of facts ascertained either independent of or as a result of the conversation. Finally, it was obvious that the purpose of the wiretaps was not simply to obtain evidence against the telephone subscribers but rather to ascertain the scope and extent of the drug conspiracy under investigation. Given all these facts, we believe that the Government made a pri-ma facie showing of compliance with the minimization provision, and we have the trial court\u2019s finding of good faith, in monitoring all the calls from the two key numbers. While it may be that, as Judge Miller said in United States v. Focarile, 340 F.Supp. 1033, 1047 (D. Md.1972), aff\u2019d sub nom., United States v. Giordano, <em>supra, </em>\u201c[sjection 2518(5) requires the intercept procedure to be conducted so as to reduce to the smallest possible number the interception of \u2018innocent\u2019 calls,\u201d in this instance the burden clearly shifted to the defendants to make some showing as to how this could be done. They make no suggestion even now. Here, as in <em>By-num, </em>there was no way to frame screening instructions so as to accomplish any non-recording of \u201cinnocent\u201d calls. We do not believe that the statute goes further than to require that the methods used to effect minimization be in good faith and reasonable. <em>Cf. </em>Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 53, 87 S.Ct. 1873, 18 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>2d 1040 (1967), and Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 355, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). It thus becomes unnecessary for us to determine whether a failure adequately to minimize requires suppression of all the conversations overheard, United States v. Focarile, 340 F.Supp. at 1047; United States v. Scott, 331 F.Supp. 233 (D.D.C.1971), or only nonincriminating conversations. United States v. Cox, 462 F.2d 1293, 1301-1302 (8th Cir. 1972); United States v. King, 335 F.Supp. 523, 543-544 (S.D.Cal.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">While appellants do not challenge the wiretaps on the basis of lack of probable cause, certain appellants argue that the application for the wiretap orders must be made by the district attorney in person appearing before the judge. While under CPL \u00a7 700.05 subd. 5 the \u201capplicant\u201d has to be a district attorney or the attorney general, and under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(2) the applicant must be the \u201cprincipal prosecuting attorney\u201d of any state or political subdivision thereof, this court held in United States v. Tortorello, <em>supra, </em>that the requirement of former \u00a7 794 of the CPL (now \u00a7 690.35, omitting the very language discussed in Tortorello) that \u201c[t]he person seeking the warrant shall appear personally before the judge . \u201d related only to the law enforcement officers with personal knowledge who signed the supporting affidavits. Not only does <em>Tortorello </em>seem to us to make good sense, but the appellants fail to point to any language in the New York statutes in effect at the time of the issuance of the warrants here that would require any such personal appearance even of the law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The argument that only the district attorney\u2019s staff and the state police were authorized to monitor the wiretaps, but in fact federal narcotics agents did so, thus subjecting the wiretaps to attack under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10) (a) (iii), is without substance. This was at all times a joint investigation, as found by Judge Tyler, and the Rockland County District Attorney specifically relied on BNDD Agent White\u2019s affidavit in his application for the original authorizing warrant. It is beyond dispute that, whether decided as a matter of federal or state law, both statutory schemes specifically allow for the disclosure of evidence gained from an authorized wiretap by those authorized to appropriate law enforcement officials not mentioned in the wiretap order. The federal provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517, and the New York state provision, CPL 700.65, both contemplate the type of cooperation among law enforcement officials which occurred in this case. <em>See </em>United States v. Forlano, 358 F. Supp. 56, 59 (S.D.N.Y.1973). If such information may be exchanged after the termination of the surveillance, we perceive no reason why that information may not be disclosed to cooperating agencies contemporaneously with its interception.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Finally, appellants argue that the postponement of notice of the surveillance to those persons named in the warrants until on or about June 3, 1972, some six months after the termination of the surveillance, was violative of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8) (d) and CPL \u00a7 700.50 subd. 3, 700.50 subd. 4. No state cases having been brought to our attention on this point, we think that the proper perspective for viewing this question is correctly stated by the Third Circuit: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>United States v. Cafero, 473 F.2d 489, 500, petition for cert. filed, 42 U.S.L.W. 3018 (U.S. Mar. 26, 1973) (No. 72-1304). Given the complexity of the investigation that continued up until the moment that notice was given in this case, we are extremely reluctant to disturb Judge Tyler\u2019s determination below that the postponement authorized by Justice Sweeney was reasonable under all the circumstances. It may be that this holding stretches the interpretation of the statutory provisions to constitutional limits, but if so, we note that none of the appellants have made or attempted to make any showing of preju-. dice to them as a result of the delay here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>If, in a given case, there is undue delay [in giving notice], that contention may be pressed in an appropriate averment alleging non-compliance with the statute. The vice of unreasonable delay is a factor to be measured within the contours of the statute, and should not be used to shape those contours into an unconstitutional form. Simply stated, the Congressional mandate places a premium on reasonable notice of the inventory. [C]ourts should exercise great care in granting extensions beyond the ninety-day period for the filing of inventories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>IV. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Appellant Joseph LaCosa\u2019s conviction under Count II of the indictment was for \u201cengaging in a continuing criminal enterprise\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and resulted in a 30-year sentence and $100,000 fine thereunder. He argues that the statute is void for vagueness. <em>See, e. g., </em>Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939) (disorderly person); Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 162, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972) (vagrancy). While it may be true, as the Government argues, that only very infrequently has a <em>federal </em>statute been declared unconstitutional on vagueness grounds, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U.S. 81, 41 S.Ct. 298, 65 L.Ed. 516 (1921), this does not answer the basic question whether 21 U.S. C. \u00a7 848(b) is constitutionally vague. As Mr. Justice Douglas noted in <em>Papa-christou, </em>however, \u201cIn the field of regulatory statutes governing business activities, where the acts limited are in a narrow category, greater leeway is allowed.\u201d 405 U.S. at 162, 92 S.Ct. at 843. In this respect \u00a7 848 is in a very real sense a regulation \u2014 a very severe one, to be sure \u2014 of the business of selling drugs. To constitute a \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise\u201d there must be a felonious violation of the chapter which is a part of a \u201ccontinuing series of violations\u201d of Title II or Title III of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. 91-513 (Oct. 27, 1970), 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq. &amp; 951 et seq. In addition, the violator must have been acting \u201cin concert with five or more persons\u201d and as to them occupy \u201ca position of organizer, a supervisory position, or any other position of management.\u201d Beyond this the violator, or person charged under \u00a7 848, must obtain \u201csubstantial income or resources\u201d from the enterprise. Section 848 then goes to the business of trafficking in the prohibited drugs on a continuing, serious, widespread, supervisory and substantial basis. The conduct reached is only that which the violator knows is wrongful and contrary to law. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 102, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 1035, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945) (\u201cBut where the punishment imposed is only for an act knowingly done with the purpose of doing that which the statute prohibits, the accused cannot be said to suffer from lack of warning or knowledge that the act which he does is a violation of law\u201d). Prerequisite to conviction under \u00a7 848 is the commission of a series of felonies, each involving specific intent; that LaCosa did not suspect that his conduct was criminal and violative of law would be risible. <em>See also </em>United States v. Ragen, 314 U. S. 513, 524, 62 S.Ct. 374, 86 L.Ed. 383 (1942) (income tax evasion \u2014 element of bad faith avoids indefiniteness question in deducting of more than \u201creasonable\u201d allowances for salaries). <em>Cf. </em>Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, 266 U.S. 497, 45 S.Ct. 141, 69 L.Ed. 402 (1925); Omaechevarria v. Idaho, 246 U.S. 343, 38 S.Ct. 323, 62 L.Ed. 763 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">There is no doubt whatsoever that LaCosa was charged and tried for conducting what must be one of the biggest operations in hard drugs in the New York area; here, as in Williams v. United States, 341 U.S. 97, 104, 71 S. Ct. 576, 580, 95 L.Ed. 774 (1951), it \u201cstrains at technicalities to say that any issue of vagueness ... as construed and applied is present in the case.\u201d <em>See also </em>United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 7, 67 S.Ct. 1538, 91 L.Ed. 1877 (1947). That is to say, it is irrelevant that a case may be hypothesized where it is difficult to determine whether a particular defendant were engaged in a \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise\u201d under \u00a7 848. This serves to distinguish this case from cases like United States v. Singleton, 460 F.2d 1148 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 984, 93 S. Ct. 1506, 36 L.Ed.2d 18 (1973), in which a statute penalizing \u201corganized criminal activity\u201d without further definition was, despite doubts from the dissenter, upheld. Here, as in <em>Petrillo, </em>the statute might have been more artfully drawn, but no language has occurred or has been suggested to us that better expresses the congressional purpose. To sustain appellant LaCosa\u2019s position would force us to hold that words cannot be devised to make it an offense to engage in the continuous sale and trafficking in heroin with a number of other people and with substantial sums of money changing hands; we feel that not to be the case and that, as applied to the conduct with which Joseph LaCosa was charged, <em>see </em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973), the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. United States v. Collier, 358 F.Supp. 1351 (E.D.Mich.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">V. PRETRIAL PUBLICITY</p>\n<p id=\"AHA\">Approximately two weeks prior to the commencement of.this trial, two nephews of Joseph Manfredi \u2014 Philip J. Man-fredi, who had previously been charged in the indictment under which this ease was brought, and Philip D. Manfredi\u2014 were executed in a vacant lot in Bronx County. The various media gave these executions extensive coverage. In the headlines of several New York newspapers 10 to 12 days <em>before </em>the trial there appeared such items as \u201cTWO HOODS KILLED; FEAR DRUG WAR\u201d and \u201cSIX DRUG DEALERS VANISH, GANG WAR, SIX DRUG DEALERS MISSING.\u201d There also appeared references to appellant Joseph Manfredi as a member of \u201corganized crime\u201d and a caption under a photo \u201cTWO NEPHEWS BUMPED OFF; COPS THINK MAYBE FIGHT FOR DRUG BUSINESS.\u201d Apparently television referred to a \u201c$25 million narcotics ring.\u201d The trial court refused to grant a continuance and conducted a voir dire, inquiring of the jurors whether- they had heard either on the radio or television or read any newspaper or printed account of \u201canything having to do with this case.\u201d Only one of the jurors replied affirmatively, but she could not recall what she read; one other juror thought he might have read something, but wasn\u2019t sure. The appellants argue that reference to Philip J. Manfredi\u2019s name, coupled with his ab-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>senee from the trial and references to certain locations in the Bronx, \u201cvery likely supplied the catalyst for association by jurors\u201d with what had been earlier disseminated by the media. It is the failure of the trial court to grant a continuance in view of the pre-trial publicity that is said to constitute prejudicial error, and it is argued that this case is one of such extreme \u201cinherently prejudicial publicity\u201d that the actual existence of prejudice in the jury box need not be shown. <em>Cf. </em>Hale v.

Joseph LaCosa, his wife, Madelyn, and his parents, Frank LaCosa and Mary Manfredi LaCosa, lived at 11 Daisey Court, Nanuet, New York. Philip J. Manfredi, now deceased, his sister, Josephine Manfredi Schrader, and her husband, Timothy Schrader, lived at 10 Sable Court, West Nyack, New York. Joseph\u2019s mother, Mary, is the sister of Joseph Manfredi whose home was 115 Kipp Avenue, Lodi, New Jersey. Philip J. Manfredi\u2019s second sister, Dianne, is married to appellant Charles Cassafella, and their home is 2262 33rd Street, Astoria, Queens. Josephine Schrader, Dianne Cassa-rella and Philip J. Manfredi were the children of Urbano Manfredi, a deceased brother of Joseph Manfredi and Mary LaCosa. From time to time, the evidence discloses, Joseph Manfredi drove a 1970 Thunderbird registered to Frank LaCosa but at Joseph Manfredi\u2019s New Jersey address, while Joseph LaCosa and/or Philip J. Manfredi often drove two Cadillacs registered to Timothy Schrader.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b652-14\">. There were 13 other original defendants.

While we encourage cooperation between federal and state law enforcement agencies, we note that the Government, in allowing a joint investigation to proceed through the use of a state warrant, subjects itself to the risk that state courts may impose on such warrants and the evidence obtained under those warrants a higher standard than would a federal court dealing with interpretation of the federal wiretap statutes, <em>Cf. </em>California v. Jones, 30 Cal.App.3d 852, 106 Cal.Rptr. 749, appeal dismissed (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b662-5\">. For example, the court\u2019s examination of the Sable court transcript sheets revealed that over 800 of the more than 1,000 calls placed during the period in question were either designated as \u201cnon-pertinent\u201d by the transcriber (s) or were calls to which there was either no answer or a busy signal. Only 150 or so calls were designated to be of possible interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b662-6\">. Section 2510(4) defines \u201cintercept\u201d to mean \u201cthe aural acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device.\u201d Section 2518(8) (a) requires that \u201c[t]he contents of any wire or oral communication intercepted . . . shall, if possible, be recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device.\u201d The recordings in turn must be kept under seal until authorized to be opened by court order. In this case, all conversations recorded were also monitored, so, as in <em>Bynum, </em>at 502 &amp; n. 6, we need not reach the question whether the statute was intended to apply solely either to aural intrusion or mechanical recor-dation. Indeed, were all the calls not recorded, ingenious counsel might be claiming that exculpatory conversations or conversations that would place seemingly incul-patory conversations in context were omitted and Brady v. Maryland would be invoked. We also see no reason why, upon proper application by affected parties, subject to order of the court to which returns on the authorizing warrants were made, so-called \u201cnon-pertinent\u201d calls could not be erased from the tapes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">(a) (1) Any person who engages in a continuing criminal enterprise shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years and which may be up to life imprisonment, to a fine of not more than $100,000, and to the forfeitm-e prescribed in paragraph (2) ; except that if any person engages in such activity after one or more prior convictions of him under this section have become final, he shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years and which may be up to life imprisonment, to a fine of not more than $200,000, and to the forfeiture prescribed in paragraph (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">(b) For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, a person is engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">(1) he violates any provision of this sub-chapter or subehapter II of this chapter the punishment for which is a felony, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-11\">(2) such violation is a part of a continuing series of violations of this subchapter or- subchapter II of this chapter\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-12\">(A) which are undertaken by such person in concert with five or more other persons with respect to whom such person occupies a position of organizer, a supervisory position, or any other position of management, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-13\">(B) from which such person obtains substantial income or resources.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
