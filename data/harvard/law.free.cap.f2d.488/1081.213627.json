This appeal followed pursuant to the jurisdiction granted this court by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-19\">On April 7, 1971, there was delivered to the Shermans\u2019 New Jersey residence a demand for payment of taxes and notification that the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) had seized their home and cars and had levied upon their bank accounts. This apparently was the first notification sent to the Shermans informing them that the IRS considered the tax liability reported on their tax return for the years 1965 to 1969 to be incorrectly computed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-20\">On April 30, 1971, the Shermans filed a claim for abatement of the jeopardy assessment, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6861(g).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, the IRS on June 4, 1971 sent a deficiency letter as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6861(b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on August 12, 1971 forwarded new notices and demands for payment. The asserted deficiencies in these subsequent notices were of different amounts and were considerably less than the amount originally demanded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-21\">After receipt of these notices, the Shermans petitioned the United States Tax Court for a redetermination of their tax liability. This action is presently pending before that court. Not having received a reply to their claim for abatement, the Shermans on October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>8, 1971 brought suit in the district court seeking a review of the District Director\u2019s action. The Shermans\u2019 complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the assessment was impairing Mr. Sherman\u2019s personal credit, resulting in great harm to his business ventures which were largely dependent on his credit; that this further impaired his ability to meet personal debts and provide for his family; and that the assessment was arbitrary and unreasonable, lacking any justification and imposed solely to harass and coerce plaintiffs for improper purposes. In support of this latter allegation, the Shermans argue on this appeal that the IRS was assisting the Justice Department in an attempt to force Mr. Sherman to appear before a grand jury investigating various criminal activities in Hudson County, New Jersey.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Initially, we emphasize that the only question before us is whether and to what extent a district court has jurisdiction to review a decision of the District Director imposing a jeopardy assessment. We are therefore concerned sole-</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">ly with interpreting those statutes which grant or limit the jurisdiction of the district court over the issues raised by the Shermans.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">For many years under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421 and its predecessors, Congress has withheld from courts jurisdiction to enjoin the \u201cassessment or collection\u201d of \u201cany tax.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This restraint against injunctions has given rise to what has been commonly referred to as the \u201cpay and sue\u201d doctrine, the essence of which is that before a taxpayer may resort to the courts for a review of a tax assessment, he must first pay the assessment. After much criticism of this doctrine, Congress recognized the harshness and inadequacy of granting judicial review only through a suit for refund,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213 and its predecessors,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provided a broad exception to section 7421 by giving the taxpayer the right of judicial review <em>before </em>any assessment and collection of a deficiency \u201cin respect of any tax imposed by subtitle A or B or chapter 42\u201d may be \u201cmade, begun or prosecuted.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the present case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>taxes allegedly owed by the Shermans were imposed under subtitle A (income taxes) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and the Shermans have sought in the Tax Court a redetermination of their tax liability. Thus, pending a Tax Court decision which has become final, section 6213 clearly grants the district court jurisdiction to enjoin the assessments and levies imposed by the District Director on the Shermans and their property, <em>unless </em>such assessment was imposed in accordance with the authority granted in the jeopardy assessment provisions of section 6861.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 6861 by contrast reflects the Congressional recognition that in the limited circumstances where the collection of revenue seems to be in jeopardy, any hardship resulting from levying on a taxpayer\u2019s assets prior to judicial review is outweighed by the Government\u2019s need to protect revenue which would otherwise be lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">Our decision today in no way deviates from this Congressional policy, for we fully concur with those courts which have concluded that Congress withheld jurisdiction from the district courts to review the sufficiency of the facts relied upon by the IRS to support a belief that jeopardy exists. <em>E. g., </em>Transport Manufacturing &amp; Equipment Co. v. Trainor, 382 F.2d 793 (8th Cir. 1967); United States v. Bonaguro, 294 F.Supp. 750, 753 (E.D.N.Y.1968). This does not mean, however, that Congress intended that by merely following th'e formal procedures of section 6861, the IRS should have thereby complete license to act arbitrarily and in bad faith and for other than the purpose of preserving revenue. <em>See </em>Iannelli v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 487 F.2d 317 (3d Cir., filed June 29, 1973); <em>Bonaguro, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-9\"> When the IRS has acted ostensibly under section 6861, but in fact has used the jeopardy assessment as a device to harass a taxpayer or as a leverage to exert pressure on a taxpayer for nontax purposes, it has exceeded its statutory authority. Section 7421 does not shield such unauthorized acts from judicial review; since they are not authorized by section 6861, they are prohibited by the general provisions of section 6213 and are subject to the injunction authorized therein. For these reasons we conclude that the allegations in the Shermans\u2019 complaint to the effect that the only reason the IRS imposed the jeopardy assessment was to harass and coerce the plaintiffs for improper purposes are sufficient to give the district court jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-10\">In remanding to the district court, we note briefly that a jeopardy assessment, imposed in good faith, may have a myriad of incidental effects on a taxpayer, some of which may beneficially inure to other departments of government. So long as the IRS, however, acts from a good faith concern that its revenue interest is in jeopardy, its actions are shielded from injunctions by section 7421.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>Finally, since an action of this nature seeks equitable relief, the district court should consider possible equitable defenses, such as laches, and should insure that the taxpayers seek promptly and without delay final judicial determination of their tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">The order of the district court shall be vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1144-12\">.

On April 7, 1971, when the jeopardy assessment was imposed, the IRS asserted a deficiency in the amount of $1,542,133.71 of which $639,862.38 was for penalties and interest.

The record on this appeal reveals that a government agent, whose connection with the IRS is unclear, had served a subpoena on Mr. Sherman on March 30, 1971 in the Bahamas, where Mr. Sherman alleges he was vacationing from early February until April 13, 1971. A memorandum prepared by the agent following his encounter with Mr. Sherman discloses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-9\">\u201cMr. Sherman stated that he had been in the Bahamas since early February, 1971, to avoid service of process.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 487 F.2d 317 (3d Cir., filed June 29, 1973). In finding the actions of the IRS to' be bona fide, the court in <em>Iamnelli </em>noted that the taxpayers had not disputed that they may have owed the government taxes which were unpaid and that in the aggregate the property levied upon would probably yield substantial revenue. While these were factors in the court\u2019s analysis, it is important to recognize that <em>Iannelli </em>did not hold that by merely denying that one owed any taxes, could one prevent a district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>from finding that the IRS had acted in good faith. To so conclude would be inconsistent with the rationale of Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., Inc., 370 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962). Also, while a jeopardy assessment imposed upon property which will yield little or no revenue is evidence of bad faith by the IRS, <em>Iannelli </em>did not hold that merely because the property levied upon will probably yield substantial revenue, a court must then <em>always </em>find that the IRS had acted in good faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1147-9\">VAN DUSEN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A66\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">Since the majority opinion seems to me inconsistent with this court\u2019s recent decision in Iannelli v. Long, 487 F.2d 317 (3d Cir. 1973), as well as with the great majority of federal cases <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> considering 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6861(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 26 U.S. C. \u00a7 7421,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I respectfully dissent. In <em>Iannelli, </em>Judge Hastie recognized a narrow exception to the prohibition of suits restraining the assessment or collection of taxes in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421, using this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-7\">\u201c . . . if a levy on property is in formal guise an effort to collect taxes but in fact is only a device for harassing and punishing a wrongdoer without honest anticipation that the levy may yield money owed for taxes, it is arguable that a suit to restrain the tax collector\u2019s enterprise is not in reality a suit to restrain the collection of taxes. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-11\">\u201cThough one of the government\u2019s objectives in this undertaking to seize all of the taxpayers' discoverable property may have been to put economic pressure upon persons believed to be engaged in large scale criminal activities, the jeopardy assessment and consequent levies also appear to have been bona fide and potentially productive attempts to collect revenue. And bona fide efforts to collect taxes through lawful procedure are the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>undertakings that Congress has protected through the enactment of section 7421(a) against frustration or delay by litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">The majority relies on the conclusory allegations in paragraph 19 of the complaint<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the jeopardy assessment \u201cis illegal, arbitrary and unreasonable\u201d and that \u201cthe only reason\u201d for such assessment \u201chas been an attempt to harass and coerce the plaintiffs for improper purposes.\u201d Contrary to these general allegations, the record contains the memorandum of an interview by Richard T. Phillips with the husband taxpayer on March 30 and 31, 1971, in Nassau, Bahamas, quoted in note 5 of the majority opinion, in which such taxpayer conceded that \u201che was aware of the income tax investigation being conducted and thought he could be financially ruined by the results of this investigation.\u201d Further, he stated that \u201che was contemplating moving himself and his family to the Republic of Ghana, Africa, where, he stated, he would be safe from any further proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">On such a record, the income tax authorities were, at the least, entitled to issue the prompt jeopardy assessment of early April 1971. The good faith of the authorities is indicated by the decrease of the amount of the assessment several times since early April 1971. The failure of the authorities to withdraw the jeopardy assessment because the husband taxpayer returned to this country in mid-April 1971 and filed in November 1971 an affidavit saying he \u201cstood ready to pay any deficiency properly determined to be due from me\u201d (16a) but that his tax returns were correct as filed, does not justify the issuance of an order vacating the jeopardy assessment, which is what appellants seek. This is particularly true where the district court made a finding that \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any irreparable injury here\u201d (20a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-9\">I would affirm the district court order of April 18, 1972, dismissing the action insofar as it was 'brought by the husband and wife plaintiffs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1147-13\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Enoch v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., 370 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962) ; Flora v. United States, 362 U.S. 145, 175-177, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed. 2d 623 (I960) ; Transport Manufacturing and Equipment Co. v. Trainor, 382 F.2d 793, 799 (8th Cir. 1967) ; Johnson v. Wall, 329 F.2d 149 (4th Cir. 1964). In the <em>Transport Manufacturing case, </em>the court said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-14\">\u201c . . . we believe that the same principles that govern the validity of the District Director\u2019s imposition of a jeopardy assessment should also apply to and control his refusal to abate that assessment. Under Section 273(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which gives to the District Director broad discretionary power to make jeopardy assessments, the single limitation on the exercise of the Director\u2019s authority is that he must believe that the ultimate collection of the tax will be jeopardized by delay. For this reason the courts have refused to scrutinize the grounds underlying the Director\u2019s determination of jeopardy and have accordingly declined to substitute their judgment for that of the Director. Field v. United States, 263 F.2d 758, 763 (5th Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 360 U.S. 918, 79 S.Ct. 1436, 3 L.Ed.2d 1534 (1959) ; Lloyd v. Patterson, supra, 242 F.2d [742] at 744 [5th Cir. 1957] ; Publisher\u2019s New Press, Inc. v. Moysey, 141 F.Supp. 340, 343 (S.D. N.Y.1956) ; Communist Party, U. S. A. v. Moysey, 141 F.Supp. 332, 336 (S.D.N.Y. 1956). The corresponding authority to abate jeopardy assessments, conferred upon the District Director under Section 273 (k) of the 1939 Code, is of a similar discretionary character, and does not impose a mandatory duty on the Director to abate a particular jeopardy assessment. Cf. Poretto v. Usry, 295 F.2d 499 (5th Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 810, 82 S.Ct. 687, 7 L.Ed. 2d 612 (1962). Absent some patent showing of illegality and other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, we will not intercede to compel the abatement of an otherwise proper jeopardy assessment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1147-17\">.
