We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">On the morning of September 7, 1972, a man dressed as a postman obtained entry to the Jefferson Bank &amp; Trust Company in Metaire, Louisiana, before the bank had opened for business for the day on the pretext of delivering a certified letter to the bank\u2019s president. The postman-impersonator promptly produced a pistol and admitted two other armed accomplices to the bank. Some of the bank\u2019s employees were already present when the robbers entered and during the course of the robbery which lasted approximately ten minutes, more of the employees arrived. Several times the postman-impersonator who spoke with a heavy \u201cforeign\u201d accent<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> threatened to kill the bank employees if they did not get the money quickly or if they did not turn around.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-19\">Eight months after the robbery, three of the employees who had observed the postman-impersonator at close range and who had heard him speak during the course of the robbery attended a lineup sponsored by the FBI. Each of the six participants in the lineup was required to say \u201cTurn around or I will shoot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Appellant apparently speaks with a rather thick Hungarian accent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The other five participants in the lineup, who were all members of the FBI, did not speak with any discernable non-New Orleans accent. Each of the three witnesses identified appellant as the postman-impersonator.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Appellant sought to have evidence of the lineup as well as any subsequent in-eourt identification arising from the lineup suppressed as unduly suggestive and therefore violative of his right to due process of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">The District Court while acknowledging that appellant spoke with a non-New Orleans accent found that in view of the totality of circumstances surrounding the lineup, the dissimilarity in accents was not likely to present any great threat of misidentification.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">The three witnesses were permitted to testify concerning the lineup identification and all three provided in-court identifications of appellant. The admission of this identification evidence is challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Of course, in-court identification from a lineup may be \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d Simmons v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247. This past term m Neil v. Biggers, 1972, 409 U.S. 188, 198-199, 93 S.Ct. 375, 381, 34 L. Ed.2d 401, 409-410, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-13\">\u201cSome general guidelines emerge from these cases as to the relationship between suggestiveness and misidentifi-cation. * * * It is the likelihood of misidentification which violates a defendant\u2019s right to due process. * * * Suggestive confrontations are disapproved because they increase the likelihood of misidentification. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-16\">[T]he factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidenti-fication include the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-17\">In light of these principles as well as the particular factual circumstances presented by cases of the Supreme Court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and this Circuit,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we are convinced that the lineup identification in issue was not \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-18\">From the outset appellant concedes that the only irregularity in the police lineup which might support a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>suggestiveness was the dissimilarity between the accent of appellant and the accents of the other lineup participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">In identification cases, dissimilarity should not automatically be equated with suggestiveness. Indeed it is the often inarticulable dissimilarities between one individual and the next which make identification possible. A dissimilarity is suggestive only to the extent that it singles out and focuses the attention of the witness on a suspect before the witness has been able to make an independent determination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">All three witnesses testified that prior to and during the lineup, the police made no suggestions concerning any, of the lineup participants nor did they indicate that they believed that one of the participants was in fact the criminal. There was testimony that the witnesses were physically separated during the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">It is a matter of record that the six participants in the lineup bore a substantial resemblance to each other both in terms of build and facial characteristics. All were dressed the same, all made the same motions, all spoke the same words.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">All three of the witnesses who identified appellant testified that they had an opportunity to observe the postman-impersonator face to face at close range during the robbery. One of the witnesses testified that he had been able to view the robber for as long as five minutes while another viewed him for two minutes. It is undisputed that the bank was well lit. One of the witnesses testified that he had previously been instructed to take careful notice of bank robbers and that he did so on this occasion. The postman-impersonator wore sunglasses but no mask during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">Of the three witnesses, two testified both at the lineup and at the trial that they were absolutely certain that appellant was the postman-impersonator. The third witness testified that he was not positive but \u201creasonably sure\u201d that appellant was the man.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">All of the Supreme Court cases and the vast majority of Fifth Circuit cases, see notes 4 and 5, <em>supra, </em>which have failed to find \u201ca very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification\u201d in challenged identification procedures have involved an identification by only one witness. By way of contrast, appellant was identified by three witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">While the eight month lapse between the robbery and the lineup is a factor which must be considered, we do not believe that it significantly detracts from the reliability of the identifications in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">The dissimilarity in accents does not\u2019 significantly increase the risk of misi-dentification in this case. The participants in the lineup were asked to speak near the end rather than the beginning of the lineup. Although each witness did not tell the police that appellant was the man until after the participants had spoken, all three testified that they were definitely convinced that appellant was the postman-impersonator before any of the participants spoke.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>tinctive quality of appellant\u2019s voice only served to reinforce the initial identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Appellant and four of the five FBI agents who participated in the lineup testified before the District Judge. The District Judge found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-5\">\u201cWhile he [appellant] does possess what might be said to be a non-New Orleans accent, I dare say that his accent doesn\u2019t differ more from the average English accent than I could find in New Orleans in different neighborhoods .... In fact, I dare say the accents of Mississippians and some northern Louisianaians, and Texans differ far more from the New Orleans accent than his accent differs from the average New Orleans accent. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s overly suggestive, * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-6\">I think he speaks clearly. In fact, he speaks excellent English. I think, in fact, that there is really less difference in his accent than perhaps it would be a difference if the man were of French or Cajun descent. * * * I don\u2019t think it should necessarily mislead any person who is attempting to \u25a0 act in good faith in connection with the identification of this defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"axg-dedup-0\">Needless to say, the District Judge was in a far better position to examine the alleged dissimilarities in accents than are we. Under the circumstances of this case it is highly improbable that the dissimilarity in the accents of the lineup participants \u2014 despite any possibility of suggestiveness \u2014 was likely to precipitate a substantial risk of mis-identifieation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">It has necessarily been recognized that a unique accent or quality of voice may often be helpful if not essential to the proper identification of a criminal suspect. See Roper v. Beto, 5 Cir., 1971, 454 F.2d 499. We do not intimate that under no circumstances might the presentation of a vocal dissimilarity in an identification procedure be so suggestive as to constitute a denial of due process.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">We are compelled to conclude, however, that in view of the totality of circumstances, the District Judge properly admitted the identification evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-12\">. Two of the three witnesses testified that after the robbery they had told the police that the postman-impersonator spoke with a Spanish accent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b964-8\">. Prior to the lineup, appellant\u2019s counsel requested that the police refrain from requiring any of the participants to speak because of appellant\u2019s accent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b964-9\">. Since appellant was represented by counsel at the lineup this case does not involve the Sixth Amendment right to the presence of counsel established by United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed. 2d 1149.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b964-10\">. See Neil v. Biggers, 1972, 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401; Coleman v.

California, 1969, 394 U.S. 440, 89 S.Ct. 1127, 22 L.Ed.2d 402 (the only case to date in which the Court has found the identification to be impermissibly suggestive) ; Simmons v.

This is the danger when a one man showup (as opposed to the lineup) is held, or where one black is placed in an otherwise all white lineup when the victim has previously stated that the criminal was black, or where the witness sees one of the lineup participants singularly in the custody of the police prior to identification. See United States v. Johnson, 5 Cir., 1972, 461 F.2d 1165.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b965-10\">. In <em>Biggers, </em>while holding that an identification which occurred seven months subsequent to the crime comported with due process, the Supreme Court noted that a lapse of seven months \u201cwould be a seriously negative factor in most cases.\u201d 409 U.S. at 201, 93 S.Ct. at 383, 34 L.Ed.2d at 412. The Court seemed to find, however, that the absence of any prior identifications by the victim during this period preserved the victim\u2019s \u201crecord for reliability\u201d and counter-balanced the time lapse. In the present case only one of the three witnesses was able to identify a photograph of appellant at a photograph showing preceding the lineup. The other two witnesses did not select any of the photographs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b965-17\">.
