While summary judgment is granted sparingly and with caution, it is our conclusion that Lester has failed to demonstrate to this court that error was committed in granting the motion. Indeed it appears that the trial judge was both patient and lenient with Lester.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-22\">The facts were rather fully developed during extensive discovery and the submission of affidavits. The appellant was unable to add substance to the conclusory allegations of his complaint. Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact to be resolved. <em>Cf. </em>Owens v. Diamond M Drilling Company, 487 F.2d 74 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
