The district court, after an extensive trial, made a number of rulings. Since these are cross appeals, we shall refer to plaintiff below in the major action, Dale Electronics, Inc., simply as Dale, the owner of the patents, and defendant, the original defendant and counterclaimant, R.C.L. Electronics, Inc., as R.C.L. Since we do not reach many of the rulings, we shall not list them here but shall indicate our holding under each heading and shall indicate the rulings in the court below which are not reached. At the conclusion of the opinion we shall summarize our holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The electrical resistors involved in these patents consist of an initial resistor wire wound around a ceramic core. Their purpose is to conduct electricity in an electrical circuit while converting part of the electricity to heat. The quality of \u201cresistance\u201d is the ability of the wire to use up electricity. The function of the core, whether a tube or cylinder, is to support the coiled wire, without taking electricity from the wire. The core, in other words, must be an insulator. But, since much heat is associated with resistance, a resistor core also must be able to absorb and dispose of heat through terminals at its ends. In short, a core should not only be a good insulator; it should be a good conductor. Generally, a good conductor of heat is also a good conductor of electricity; and a poor conductor of electricity, 1. e., a good insulator, is a poor conductor of heat. The ceramic known as beryllium oxide (BeO), has the distinction of being both a good electrical insulator and a good thermal conductor. Herein lies much of our story.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The '090 Patent</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The district court, 356 F.Supp. 1117, characterized the essence of this patent as \u201cthe use of beryllium oxide of at least ninety percent purity as the core of the resistor.\u201d This is consistent with Dale\u2019s description in its brief: \u201cThe single claim of this patent sets forth the BeO core in combination with the conventional resistor components, and requires further that the BeO comprise at least 90 percent by weight of the core to insure that the requisites of certain load life test be met.\u201d The court fully acknowledged the fact that the use of BeO as a core in electrical resistors, first devised by Dale\u2019s assignor and employee, Hay, was eminently successful, enabling resistors, avoiding concentrated build-up of heat by BeO\u2019s high conductivity, to achieve longer life at higher temperatures than traditional ceramic cores and to be produced in smaller size, fitting \u201cthe miniaturization revolution\u201d. Nevertheless, the court held the patent invalid for obviousness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">In so doing the court relied, in varying degrees, on several sources of prior art. The first, and the only prior art referred to in the file wrapper, consisted of two patents: the Von Wedel Patent (No. 2,075,876) granted April 6, 1937, which observed that BeO, when mixed with materials such as fluorides, made an admirable insulating coating for twisted wires operating at high temperatures; and the Lindenblad Patent (No. 2,734,344), granted February 14, 1956, which used BeO as rings or sleeves around banks of thermo-couples, because they were both thermally conductive but electrically insulating, thus giving excellent heat transfer from one bank of thermo-couples to another. The court cited these patents as bearing \u201cdirectly on the issue\u201d, but did not rely heavily on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">The court then referred, without further exegesis, to a number of scientific articles published in the 1950\u2019s explaining the use of BeO as a combination in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>sulator and conductor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It then went on to what it termed more \u201ccrucial\u201d aspects of the prior art which it said lay not in the patents or scientific articles but in the \u201cmanner\u201d in which the inventor, Hay, came to use BeO. The court noted that Hay\u2019s acquaintance with BeO resulted from a conversation with a salesman of a company supplying ceramic cores to Dale, leading to an order for BeO which was never fulfilled. Next came Hay\u2019s visit to a trade show in August of 1961 where Hay ordered sample cores of BeO from National Beryllia Corporation. National Beryllia, the court observed, had, in 1959, advertised in a trade journal the availability in quantity of \u201cBer-lox\u201d (pure BeO), \u201cextremely high in thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity\u201d, in various shapes and forms for insulators and other uses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court found that in 1961 Hay himself received a graph, prepared by National Beryllia, illustrating a dramatic exponential increase in thermal conductivity for materials comprising a BeO component of at least 90 per cent in weight. The court concluded that \u201cthe adaptation by Hay of beryllium oxide was obvious to him and would have been to anyone skilled in the art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We agree. We begin with observing that the file wrapper history leaves us somewhat puzzled. The thrust of Dale\u2019s effort before us, and before the district court has been the uniqueness of using 90 per cent BeO as the core of a resistor. Yet this application required almost five years of siege before the Patent Examiner yielded. He had firmly, up to almost four years after filing, resisted a positive reeommen-dation, saying knowledge of the properties of 90 per cent BeO was old in the art. Finally, the examiner, while rejecting all of the structural claims, stated that a new claim, describing the performance of the core at maximum temperature for a fixed period of time, specifying a maximum temperature and a minimum deviation in resistance value for the resistor, would be acceptable. Whereupon without explanation for the about-face, all the previously rej'ected structural descriptions, conj'oined with the new performance assurance, gained a favorable decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">We therefore face a Patent Office ruling that approaches the point where \u201c[w]e are at a loss to explain the Examiner\u2019s allowance on the basis of such a distinction.\u201d Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 34, 86 S.Ct. 684, 702, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). While the grant of a patent carries with it a presumption of validity, we tend to view the strength of the presumption in this case as minimal. <em>See </em>Hawley Products Co. v. United States Trunk Co., 259 F.2d 69, 72, 74 (1st Cir. 1958). On the other hand, we deal with a decision made by a district court in a field which lends itself to several \u201cfactual inquiries\u201d: \u201cthe scope and content of the prior art\u201d, the \u201cdifference between the prior art and the claims at issue\u201d, and \u201cthe level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art\u201d. 383 U.S. at 17, 86 S.Ct. at 694. These factual determinations are entitled to weight in our deliberations. <em>See </em>discussion <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Dale does not challenge reference to the VonWedel and Lindenblad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>patents and the scientific articles we have referred to in n. 3. As we have implied, these are more than insubstantial bases for a finding of obviousness, particularly when coupled with the 1959 National Beryllia advertisement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dale concentrates its fire on the propriety of the court\u2019s heavy reliance on Hay\u2019s conversation with the salesman, his attendance at the trade show, and the National Beryllia graph. Preliminarily, Dale argues that none of these can constitute prior art because they are not or have not been proven to be \u201cpublications\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dale seems to be seizing on one category of prior art as exclusive. In <em>Graham, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 15, 86 S.Ct. at 692, the Court refers to the Congressional reports in relation to \u00a7 103 defining the condition of obviousness as referring to \u201cthe difference between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art, meaning what was known before as described in section 102.\u201d Section 102 refers to the conditions which foreclose invention. Among them are that the invention was known ... by others\u201d, \u00a7 102(a), and that the supposed inventor \u201cdid not himself invent the subject matter\u201d, \u00a7 102(f). Since \u00a7 102 is the referent for \u00a7 103, we draw the conclusion that if the facts that the whole of an invention was known to others or that none of the invention was created by the patent applicant bar entitlement under \u00a7 102, the condition of knowledge by others or the borrowing by the applicant of a sufficient body of lore to make the invention obvious bars entitlem\u2019ent under \u00a7 103. General Instruments Corp. v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 399 F.2d 373, 384 (1st Cir. 1968) (notebooks recording experimental work were accepted as evidence of prior art); <em>see </em>Colourpicture Publishers v. Mike Roberts Color Productions, 394 F.2d 431, 434-435 (1st Cir. 1968) (common objects were contemplated as eligible prior art).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Coming to the facts, the whole significance of Hay\u2019s conversation with the salesman is muted somewhat by the fact that Dale could not find a copy of Hay\u2019s letter to the salesman following the conversation. But enough remains. Hay testified that, had it not been for his conversation with the salesman, in which the latter suggested BeO as a core material with high thermal conductivity, the idea of making a resistor core from BeO \u201cwouldn\u2019t come up in my mind\u201d. He also testified that the salesman, whose company was already selling Dale a material for a capacitor product, did not mention BeO for that use and that the only product Dale was making to which the salesman\u2019s suggestion could be relevant was a resistor.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Hay\u2019s subsequent visit to a trade show, where he inquired of National Beryllia about the availability of BeO, does not seem significant. But flowing from this contact, was Hay\u2019s receipt of samples of BeO rods in November, 1961, from National Beryllia. Before that time he had received data sheets. Asked if the graph showing the remarkable conductivity of BeO exceeding 90 per cent purity had come with the data sheets, Hay replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it came in that particular group of mail.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In any event, it was this graph, which Hay referred to as a \u201cpublication\u201d of National Beryllia, which told him not only that the thermal conductivity of BeO was related to its purity but that at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>around 90 per cent purity there was a sharp increase in such conductivity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On receipt of the BeO rods, Hay wound resistor wires around them, thus making his first resistors. This took place in mid-November. In December temperature rise tests were run, showing excellent conductivity. In January of 1962 load life tests showed that the resistors proved more stable, with smaller resistance deviations, than Dale\u2019s standard resistors made with aluminum cores. On January 26, 1962, Hay signed a patent disclosure which essentially described his concept as that of using BeO as a core. No reference to the required relative purity of BeO was made. On February 15, 1962 Hay signed the patent application which was filed on February 26. It summarized the temperature and load life tests, described his method of preparing his core material \u201cby mixing substantially 95 per cent by weight of beryllium oxide with substantially 5% by weight of earth clay.\u201d One of the claims specified that BeO must be approximately 90 per cent by weight of the core.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The record reveals, despite some initial testimony to the contrary, that no tests showing the critical necessity for BeO of approximately 90 per cent purity were conducted prior to the filing of the patent application. Hay testified that the National Beryllia graph would tell one looking for a core material of high thermal conductivity to pick BeO of more than 90 per cent. Three years later, in buttressing efforts in the Patent Office, Hay included, without attribution to National Beryllia, a replica of its graph as an exhibit illustrating BeO\u2019s conducting properties, calling particular attention to the sharp changes in the slope of the curve at the point where the concentration of BeO is at least 90 per cent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">It seems abundantly clear to us that, given the latitude possessed by the district court in resolving the \u201cfactual inquiries\u201d required in determining the issue of obviousness, the record supports the court\u2019s conclusion. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 5, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966); Nashua Corp. v. RCA Corp., 431 F.2d 220, 222 (1st Cir. 1970); Columbia Broadcasting Sys. v. Sylvania Electronic Prod. Inc., 415 F.2d 719, 728 (1st Cir. 1969); General Instrument Corp. v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 399 F.2d 373, 384 (1st Cir. 1968); Koppers Co. v. Foster Grant Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>396 F.2d 370, 372 (1st Cir. 1968). The allowance of the patent, after a long and arduous process, on the basis of a description of performance <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the structure which had steadily been rejected, renders more significant in our eyes any idea sources which were not revealed to the examiner. The existence of widespread literature in the 1950\u2019s and early 1960\u2019s including advertisements, concerning the increasing feasibility for many uses of the highly conductive and insulative BeO would have suggested to a wider reader than Hay what in fact he learned from the salesman \u2014 that BeO had arrived at the point where it might be excellent material for a resistor core. The National Beryllia graph, described constantly by Hay as a publication, provided Hay with the precise information as to purity required in a high performance resistor. Hay struck a rich lode only after all of the technology had led him to the marked spot. The knowledge of BeO\u2019s qualities and the new processes that made it more readily available combined in drawing the map. Hay needed only the knowledge of one skilled in the art to come upon the discovery. His advantage was only one of time. That is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">So holding, we do not have occasion to review the court\u2019s conclusion that Hay had met the novelty requirement of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(f); that '090 contained sufficient instruction to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 112; or that, were the patent valid, R.C.L.\u2019s BeO core resistors infringe \u2019090.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The \u2019704 and '855 Patents</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">These patents concern the method (\u2019855) of producing a resistor inbedded in a metal housing (\u2019704). Both relate to an insulative fluid injected under pressure between the resistor core and the housing. Both patents refer to the recommended hardenable insulative material as \u201cmaterials in the classification of epoxys, phenolics or silicones.\u201d To find a particular material which would work, according to Hay, the inventor, one would have to experiment. He also testified that at the time he filed his applications, he knew a specific material that worked very well, Rogers RX 600.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, he had failed to make work many other materials in the classes described.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The district court held that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s desire to bring all types of insulating material within the scope of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>patent claim without disclosing the one material that worked effectively has resulted in a description too vague for an accurate and effective disclosure of the invention\u201d and ruled the patent invalid-under the \u201cbest mode\u201d language of \u00a7 112.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Dale\u2019s major argument is that the nondisclosure of Rogers RX 600 was not intentional. We do not accept the proposition that where an inventor, as here, clearly knows a specific material that will make possible the successful reproduction of the effects claimed by his patent, but does not disclose it, speaking instead in terms of broad categories, he may nevertheless be considered as having described the best mode contemplated by him. The statutory language seems to contemplate precisely this situation. In Indiana General Corp. v. Krystinel Corp., 297 F.Supp. 427 (S.D. N.Y.1969), aff\u2019d, 421 F.2d 1023 (2d Cir. 1970), the court upheld a finding of failure to disclose best mode, but at the same time refused to order attorney\u2019s fees, finding no deliberate fraud. Unintentional obtuseness or obfuscation might be a reason not to penalize someone; we do not see it as a reason for granting a seventeen year monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">This holding makes unnecessary any review of the court\u2019s holding that these two patents met the nonobviousness requirement of \u00a7 103; that \u2019704 met the no-public-sale-for-a-year requirement of \u00a7 102(b); that, if \u2019855 and \u2019704 are valid, R.C.L.\u2019s in-house molding process and resulting product infringe; or that R. C.L.\u2019s resistors made by the \u201cstuffing\u201d method do not infringe \u2019704.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Dale\u2019s Rule 59 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"AcH\">Dale challenges the district court denial of its Rule 59(e) motion to amend the judgment to read: \u201cNothing in this Opinion or Judgment shall be prejudicial to plaintiff\u2019s right to obtain and bring suit for infringement of reissue patents emanating from Patent 3,201,855 and U.S. Patent 3,206,704.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">This, Dale suggests, was \u201cnot typical of the usual motion to amend judgment\u201d. This seems to us an understatement, the motion not being aimed at the judgment but at implications which might be drawn from it. Upon the district court\u2019s denial, Dale insisted on digging itself in deeper by asking if the denial was \u201con the merits\u201d, to which the court gave an affirmative answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">It seems to us that the parties are trying to litigate something that as yet does not exist. We do not know whether or not Dale may be able to obtain a reissue patent, or, if it may, on what grounds. The eases cited by R.C.L. to support the district court ruling are appeals from denials of the reapplications or claims of infringement with counterclaims of invalidity of reissue patents. Application of Hafner, 410 F.2d 1403 (Cust. <em>&amp; </em>Pat.App.1969); Application of Nelson, 280 F.2d 172, 47 C.C.Pa. 1031 (1960); Bendix Corp. v. Balax, Inc., 421 F.2d 809 (7th Cir. 1970); Maxant Button &amp; Supply Co. v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., 388 F.2d 912 (7th Cir. 1968). They are distinguishable from this case where there is no challenge to a reissue patent nor a claim that a reissue has been improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">We think it inappropriate that the court\u2019s decision be construed as wider than the issues which were before it. We accordingly hold that the court\u2019s denial of the motion was within its discretion, Walker v. Bank of America Nat\u2019l Trust &amp; Saving Ass\u2019n, 268 F.2d 16 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 903, 80 S.Ct. 211, 4 L.Ed.2d 158 (1959); Boaz v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, 146 F.2d 321 (8th Cir. 1944), but has no broader substantive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>R.C.L.\u2019s Counterclaim</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">R.C.L. challenges the court\u2019s dismissal of its counterclaim seeking an affirmative ruling that the \u2019356 patent be declared invalid. This counterclaim was interposed to Dale\u2019s claim of infringement. Before trial, Dale moved to withdraw its claim of infringement of the \u2019356 patent and for dismissal of R.C.L.\u2019s counterclaim alleging invalidity. The court reserved judgment on this motion until after trial at which time it granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion and dismissed the counterclaim on the theory that there was no longer a justiciable controversy. R.C.L. cites several cases for the proposition that a counterclaim in a patent suit which seeks a declaration of invalidity of a patent can remain for independent adjudication, notwithstanding a stipulation of noninfringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In response, Dale claims that R. C.L. waived the right to proceed on the basis of a letter dated almost a year before trial began and well before Dale moved to drop its claim of infringement. The letter, on another point entirely, does not affect R.C.L.\u2019s rights. Legal authorities support R.C.L.\u2019s position that it was entitled to a decision on the validity of the \u2019356 patent. Hawley Products Co. v. United States Trunk Co., 259 F.2d 69, 75-76 (1st Cir. 1958); Trico Products Corp. v. Anderson Co., 147 F.2d 721, 722 (7th Cir. 1945); Marshall v. RCA Corp., F.Supp., 177 U.S.P.Q. 426, 430 (S.D.Ind.1973); International Min. &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Golding-Keene Co. (W.D.N.Y.1958), 164 F.Supp. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Accordingly, this issue must be remanded, and, if R.C.L. wishes to pursue it, the district court has discretion to consider it on the record made to date or may receive further evidence if it sees fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The \u2019884 Design Patent</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">This patent described an ornamental design for a housed resistor of the kind shown in the \u2019855 and \u2019704 patents. Housed resistors do not have much opportunity for originality of basic design. They must cover the core and wire. They require external ribbing to help dissipate heat. They also need a flat surface on which a manufacturer\u2019s label can be imprinted. Prior patents, one of which was not disclosed to the Patent Office, had the ribs running along the top of the housing. \u2019884 had the ribs on the sides and the flat surface for the label on top. The court held that \u201cIt was not only the prior art, but the dictates of the manufacturing process that made the design obvious.\u201d It also held that \u2019884 did not describe \u201cany new, original and ornamental design\u201d, as required by \u00a7 171. Despite the Patent Office\u2019s approval and the testimony of a hostile witness that somehow the virtue of \u2019884 lay in a design consistent with other computer equipment, we cannot bring ourselves to say that the district court overlooked \u201csome exceptional talent beyond the skill of the ordinary designer\u201d. G. B. Lewis Co., et al. v. Gould Products, Inc., 436 F.2d 1176, 1178 (2d Cir. 1971). \u201cIt seems to us at the most to call only for such routine skills as might be expected of any designer in the field . . . .\u201d The design patent shows \u201csome minor variation of the prior art well within the competence \u2018of an ordinary practitioner of the craft exercising merely the skill of his calling\u2019 \u201d. Hawley Products Co. v. United States Trunk Co., 259 F.2d 69, 74 (1st Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Unfair Competition</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Dale had merchandized its panel housed resistors, using the letters PH. Dale\u2019s Vice President disavowed any trademark claim. Dale\u2019s products had been used for years with panel housed (or mounted) resistors. One of Dale\u2019s customers asked R.C.L. to copy Dale\u2019s units. R.C.L. supplied its own resistor, noting thereon \u201cRCL PH-10-150\u201d. The customer returned some of these units to Dale. The court held that only the buyer was confused, that any prospective buyer could ascertain the source by looking at the marking, that \u201cPH\u201d was a generic term, meaning \u201cpanel housed\u201d, that R.C.L. attempted to sell to no one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>but the customer who asked R.C.L. to manufacture to Dale\u2019s specifications. It concluded that Dale had not proven a case of unfair competition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Costs and Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Dale seeks fees and costs in connection with the class action phase of this litigation. The complaint, filed in March of 1971, naming R.C.L. as representative of a class including twelve other alleged infringers. Expensive, court-approved notices were prepared and published. Finally, the court dismissed the action as to the class. Dale claims that R.C.L. sat back in bad faith and that the court abused its discretion in refusing to approve Dale\u2019s request. R.C.L. denies any bad faith alleging that it could care \u201cless if it was led to the courthouse as a lone sheep or as part of a herd\u201d. R.C.L. for its part claims an abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s refusal to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and taxing certain costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">As to Dale\u2019s claims for class action related fees and costs and R.C.L.\u2019s claim for fees, we see no basis for concluding that the court abused its discretion. In such a trade-off situation it would be particularly difficult to try to second guess the district court. The taxing of the prevailing party\u2019s deposition costs in his favor is also a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. The trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion will normally not be interfered with by an appellate court. Emerson v. National Cylinder Gas Co., 251 F.2d 152 (1st Cir. 1958). We readily recognize that daily copy in such a long and complex trial as this may be deemed essential by the parties. Their agreement to share the costs witnesses their similar belief. The court apparently felt that each side had realized benefit from the agreement and decided to allow the burdens to rest where they lay. We cannot say the court abused its discretion in denying reimbursement of some of R.C.L.\u2019s costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">We therefore summarize our holdings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\"><em>\u2014We </em>affirm the judgment of invalidity of the \u2019090 patent for obviousness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">\u2014We affirm the judgment of invalidity of the \u2019855 and \u2019704 patents for failure to describe the best mode of implementation, in violation of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">\u25a0 \u2014 We affirm the judgment of invalidity of the \u2019884 patent for obviousness and failure to meet the standard of originality of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 171;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-14\">\u2014We affirm the judgment for defendant in plaintiff\u2019s claim of unfair competition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-15\">\u2014We affirm the denial of plaintiff\u2019s Rule 59 motion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-16\">\u2014We reverse the judgment dismissing defendant\u2019s counterclaim and remand for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-17\">\u2014We affirm the court\u2019s denial of fees and costs requested by plaintiff in connection with the class action; we also affirm the court\u2019s denial of counsel fees requested by defendant and its denial of costs of defendant\u2019s share of court reporters\u2019 fees and deposition.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-16\">.

Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\">. Much more could he said about these articles, roughly a dozen in number. Covering the period from 1947 to 1961, they demonstrated continuing and increasing interest in BeO as an excellent heat conductor, over a wide temperature range, with increased supply being noted in 1957, and with control of the toxicity problem being noted in 1961.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\">. The court also referred to other promotional material, beginning in the late 1950\u2019s, published by National Beryllia to promote BeO. While we do not consider all these materials, because they are unnecessary to our conclusion and because the dates are contested by Dale, we do note that three of these publications were admitted by Dale to have been received by Hay prior to the patent date, with or shortly after a letter from National Beryllia dated September 19, 1961. These pamphlets, entitled \u201cBeO Booms in Space Age\u201d, \u201cBeryllia Aids Equipment Cooling\u201d, \u201cBelox \u2018Off the Shelf\u2019 Transistor Heat Sinks\u201d, were submitted into evidence by both parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b448-4\">. The latter is challenged on the procedural ground of lack of notice, in violation of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282, a challenge which the district court rejected. We do not disturb its ruling. <em>See </em>n. 11, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b448-5\">, The premise does not, on scrutiny of the record, apply to the graph. This was referred to by Hay as one of the National Beryllia\u2019s \u201cpublications\u201d and was sent to Hay with other publications. Dale\u2019s speculation in the brief that it could have been specially prepared for Hay\u2019s private use might be considered a good college try at the trial level. In the face of an adverse factual ruling below, it is less than that here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b448-11\">. At another point he said that he believed that he received the graph prior to the filing of his patent application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\">. Hay\u2019s precise testimony on this point is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">\u201cA. Did I realize that the thermal conductivity was dependent on the purity prior to looking at a publication from National?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Q. Yes. Did you?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">A. I don\u2019t recall any other publication. The one that National Beryllia put out is the only one that I recall at the present time that did show this.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">Q. Did you independently make this determination, or did you get this information from that publication?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">A. From that publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">\u00ed\u00a1\u00ab sjs }{* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">Q. Do you recall if this publication had a chart or indication showing the exact relationship of the purity of Beryllium Oxide to its thermal conductivity?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-18\">!\u00ab! S\u00bbS S{i * *</p>\n<p id=\"b449-19\">Q. And this is what told you that the thermal conductivity of Beryllium Oxide increases with its purity?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-20\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-21\">Q. And did this chart also tell you that around 90 per cent you get a sharp increase in the thermal conductivity?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-22\">A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b449-23\">. Hay\u2019s affidavit contained other exhibits based on tests conducted at Dale. Counsel\u2019s written remarks to the Patent Office and, subsequently, to the Board of Appeals, referred to the \u201caffidavit pertaining to certain tests and data [sic] conducted\u201d, without revealing that Exhibit A (the graph) was a copy of National Beryllia\u2019s graph, the experimental basis for which was not known to Hay. B..C.L. contends that the court should have held the patent unenforceable because of nondisclosure and misrepresentation to the Patent Office. The court did not deal with Dale\u2019s failure to disclose some published materials and, as to the graph, found no deliberate misrepresentation. We are not sure that an innocent but not insignificant misleading, in a Patent Office proceeding so long contested and so narrowly decided, would not compel invalidation. We do not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b450-4\">. This description made central to the performance \u201cthe operative engagement between said terminal elements and the surface of said insulative core\u201d. Nothing in the testimony revealed to us any importance stemming from the engagement between terminals and the core.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b450-5\">. Implicit in our holding is affirmance of the court\u2019s overruling of Dale\u2019s objections under 35 U.S.O. \u00a7 282 that R.C.L. failed to give thirty days\u2019 written notice of the June, 1959, National Beryllia advertisement, the conversation with the salesman, and Hay\u2019s visit to the trade show. The statute gives the court discretion. We have reviewed the evidence as to those items, none of which we deem of dispositive significance to our holding, and conclude that the court was well within its discretion. Also implicit in our affirmance of the court\u2019s conclusion of obviousness is our rejection of Dale\u2019s argument that the court violated that provision of \u00a7 103 forbidding the negativing of a patent because of the \u201cmanner\u201d in which the invention was made. The court began its discussion of the specific sources which influenced Hay by using the word \u201cmanner\u201d. \u201cManner\u201d is a blanket word. The court was clearly using it to connote \u201cevents which led up to\u201d, not as a characterization of the efforts of the inventor in making his discovery. Indeed, the court was narrating the contribution of others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b450-11\">. \u201cQ.
