Roth, 1972, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548; Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570; Fuentes v. Shevin, 1972, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556. Any injunction, negative or positive, would have the effect of mandating that the university officials not follow the procedures expressly prescribed by a statute of statewide application.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is enough to deprive a single District Judge of jurisdiction. See our extensive opinion in Sands v. Wainright, 5 Cir. (en banc), 1973, 491 F.2d 417; see also Hall v. Garson, 5 Cir., 1970, 430 F.2d 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We vacate and remand to the District Court for the appropriate proceeding for convening*a three-judge court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Vacated and remanded</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-13\">.
