PECK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b956-22\">This is an appeal from an order granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff-shipper, S. S. Kresge, in an action against A &amp; B Transfer, Inc., and a number of other motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce. In the District Court, Kresge sought enforcement of an Interstate Commerce Commission refund order, upheld by a three-judge district court in Admiral-Merchants Motor Freight, Inc. et al. v. United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission, 321 F.Supp. 353 (D.Colo.1971), aff\u2019d mem., 404 U.S. 802, 92 S.Ct. 51, 30 L.Ed.2d 37 (1971), reh. denied, 404 U.S. 987, 92 S.Ct. 443, 30 L.Ed.2d 371 (1971). It alleged that the decision in <em>Admiral-Merchants, supra, </em>was res judicata on all issues except the amount of damages. Because of the complexity of this case, we set out the facts in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-23\">The defendants-appellants, all motor carriers in interstate commerce, are members of the Middlewest Motor Freight Bureau<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and participate in its published tariffs. In early 1968 the Bureau published new rates to be effective in thirty days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Initially, the Commission raised no objection to the increased rates and allowed them to take effect on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>April 1, 1968. But after receiving complaints from shippers, the Commission scheduled a hearing on the lawfulness of the rates for May 20, 1968. The Department of Transportation and the General Services Administration, both of which had opposed the rate increases, requested that the Commission postpone the hearing for ninety days so that each agency could adequately prepare for the proceedings. The carriers later joined in that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The Commission by its order of April 25, 1968, granted the request but conditioned the extension on the agreement of the carriers to comply with a refund provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-6\"><em>\u201cIt is further ordered, </em>That the time for filing the requested information and supporting data be, and, it is hereby extended to August 5, 1968; that the hearing be, and, it is hereby postponed to August 19, 1968, conditioned upon respondents compliance with the refund provision ordered below * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-7\"><em>\u201cAnd it is further ordered, </em>That respondents be and, they are hereby, ordered to make refunds to the shippers on any shipment moving after May 20, 1968, to the extent that the increases or any portion thereof under investigation herein are not approved by the Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">On May 1, 1968, the carriers petitioned the Commission to reconsider the refund portion of the order of April 25, and raised several objections to its legality. However, the carriers later withdrew their objections, apparently because they needed the ninety-day extension to compile the necessary data for the hearing. Admiral-Merchants Motor Freight, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 356. As a result, the order of April 25 stood without protest. The Commission held the hearing on August 19, 1968, and issued its findings on June 5, 1969. It found that the carriers had not shown the increased rates to be \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d ordered them cancelled and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-9\"><em>\u201cfurther ordered, </em>That, in accordance with the order entered herein on April 25, 1968, the respondents be, and they are hereby, required to refund to shippers the charges on shipments moving after May 20, 1968, to the extent that such charges included the increases herein found not shown to be just and reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">The Bureau then petitioned the Commission either to vacate or reconsider its refund order or to reopen the proceedings for a further hearing. At the same time that the carriers notified the Commission that they would cancel the disputed rates as of August 31, 1969, they also gave the Commission notice of new increased rates to take effect on September 1, 1969. On August 29, 1969, the Commission declined to suspend or investigate the new increases and also denied the carriers\u2019 petition to reconsider the refund order. Furthermore, the Commission ordered;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-11\">\u201cthat the respondents will hereinafter, in accordance with the said decision of June 5, 1969, make refund to shippers presenting their claims to the carriers supported by paid freight bills or other appropriate evidence.\u201d I.C.C. Docket No. 34,971, Order of August 29, 1969.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">Finally, on October 27, 1969, the Commission denied the carriers\u2019 second petition for reconsideration of the refund order.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">The carriers then sought an injunction against enforcement of the refund order. <em>(See </em>Interstate Commerce Act, \u00a7\u00a7 17(9) &amp; 205(h), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 17(9) &amp; 305(h) ). A three-judge district court was empaneled to hear the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2325 and 2284. <em>(Admiral-Merchants, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">The three-judge district court found that although the refund order was valid, it was nevertheless not based on the Commission\u2019s statutory authority, but rather constituted a procedural device\u2014 a condition which the Commission could lawfully append to its grant of a post<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>ponement of the hearing. Since the carriers had impliedly agreed to this procedure \u2014 by withdrawing their objections \u2014they were estopped from later contesting the validity of the order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-4\">\u201cIt is abundantly clear, therefore, that Congress has not authorized the Commission to order refunds as a generally accepted procedure. It is also clear, however, that the Commission did not undertake to exercise any such power nor is this a reparations proceeding such as that which was condemned in the T.I.M.E. ease. Indeed, we do not view the present action of the Commission as an effort to exercise any general authority. The order in question was instead issued incident to a request for a continuance and indeed was not unlike the exercise of the suspension power which the Commission has and had under 49 U. S.C. \u00a7 316(g). No doubt the Commission could have ordered the rates suspended at least for a period of time (seven months).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-5\">\u201cAn even stronger argument for refusal to annul the Commission\u2019s order is the doctrine of equitable estoppel. We have in mind the principle which imposes an obligation on a person to live up to his representations or conduct in circumstances where inequitable consequences would result to persons having the right to rely, and who in good faith did rely on the representations made. Applied to the ease at bar the Commission certainly relied on the carriers\u2019 withdrawal of their jurisdictional objection to the refund condition. The Commission\u2019s reliance was evidenced by its failure to vacate the order. It did not have to anticipate that the carriers would renege. The carriers\u2019 withdrawal of their timely objection was a positive act which evidenced willingness to go along with the condition imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-6\">\u201cWe are unable in good conscience, in view of the circumstances presented, to annul the order of the Commission. The Commission was acting in good faith in granting the extension, and the carriers were at the time agreeable to acceptance of the benefits of such an extension order. Their present posture appears to us to be grossly inequitable and not deserving of court intervention. While we do not commend the procedure as one which should be or could be practiced, we do hold that the peculiar facts of this case, arising as they did, are such as to not justify the granting of the relief requested, namely annulment of the Commission\u2019s order and approval of the carriers\u2019 conduct.\u201d [Footnotes omitted.] 321 F.Supp. at 359-360.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">The present action for refunds was brought by Kresge against those members of the Middlewest Motor Freight Bureau with whom it did business between May 20, 1968, and June 5, 1969. Kresge moved for summary judgment, contending that since the Supreme Court had affirmed the opinion of the three-judge district court, nothing remained for the District Court here but to order enforcement and determine the amount of damages. The District Court found no \u201csignificant or material factual disputes\u201d between the parties, granted the motion for summary judgment, citing <em>Admiral-Merchants </em>as res judicata on the question of whether the cause of action asserted by the plaintiff properly entitled it to the relief sought. As a result the defendants were ordered to examine the plaintiff\u2019s freight invoices and make a refund in accordance with the ICC order of June 5, 1969. The present appeal by the defendant carriers is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">To resolve the instant appeal we turn to a recent Seventh Circuit case which resolved similar appeals before it regarding enforcement proceedings founded on the same Colorado three-judge district court\u2019s judgment and affirmed those cases in favor of the plaintiff-shipper by holding that the shipper did have a statutory cause of action under \u00a7\u00a7 16(2) and 205(g) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16(2) and 305(g). Aluminum Company of America v. Admiral Merchants Motor Freight, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>Inc., 486 F.2d 717 (7th Cir. 1973). We are persuaded by that Court\u2019s opinion and adopt its reasoning as dispositive of the issues presented by the appeal before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-16\">.

Section 217 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 317(c), requires interstate motor carriers to notify the Commission 30 days prior to any change in rates.

MILLER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AuY6\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Respectfully, I must dissent. The Interstate Commerce Act, as originally passed in 1887, established a scheme for the regulation of the nation\u2019s railroads. 24 Stat. 379. In 1935 the Act was amended to give the Commission regulatory authority over motor carriers as well. 49 Stat. 543. At the time of the 1935 amendment, Congress labeled the sections regulating railroads as Part I, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., and the sections regulating motor carriers as Part II, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301 et seq. Though many sections of Parts I and II are parallel, there are significant differences, particularly with reference to the private remedies available to shippers.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">Part I provides for both refunds, \u00a7 15(7), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(7), and reparations,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 16, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 16. Part II, on the other hand, contains no statutory refund procedure and was only recently amended (in 1965) to permit reparations. Interstate Commerce Act \u00a7 204a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 79 Stat. 651, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 304a. Moreover, the remedies of the shipper seeking reparations under \u00a7 204a are more limited than those available under its Part I counterpart, \u00a7 16(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For example, only \u00a7 16(2) per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>mits a successful plaintiff to recover attorney\u2019s fees. Although the original purpose of \u00a7 16(2) was to provide a right of action for shippers by railroad to obtain reparations, T.I.M.E. v. United States, 359 U.S. 464, 79 S.Ct. 904, 3 L.Ed.2d 952 (1959), the language of the section is broad and refers to \u201can order for the payment of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">The appellees argue that the cause of action granted by \u00a7 16(2) to any person for whose benefit the Commission has ordered the payment of money is incorporated into Part II of the Act by \u00a7 205(g).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, since the refund order of June 5, 1969, was a final order under Part II, the beneficiaries of that order should have a cause of action for enforcement under \u00a7 16(2). In response, appellants contend, firstly, that the United States Supreme Court in T.I.M.E. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>held that \u00a7 16 was not applicable to the Motor Carrier Act and, secondly, that no action since that time, either judicial or legislative, has altered that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">In T.I.M.E. an interstate shipper contended that the rates it paid, even though in accordance with the published tariffs, were unreasonable because the through rate exceeded the sum of the rates charged for the shorter trips along the route. Two theories were advanced by the shipper: first, it was argued that the statutory duty of a motor carrier to establish reasonable rates, Interstate Commerce Act \u00a7\u00a7 216(b), (d), 49 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 316(b), (d), implies a private right of action for those persons damaged by unreasonable rates; and second, that the Act preserves the common law action for the recovery of exorbitant rates charged by common carriers. Under both theories the question of the reasonableness of the rates would be referred to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">The Supreme Court rejected both theories. What the shippers requested through their alleged statutory cause of action was, in effect, reparations \u2014 a remedy expressly provided for in Part I but not then in Part II:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-11\">The very provisions of Part I, and their counterparts in Part. Ill, which give a right of action to shippers against carriers for damages incurred by carrier violations of the Act and provide the mechanics for the enforcement of that right are conspicuously absent in the' Motor Carrier Act. Thus, where \u00a7 8 of Part I provides that \u201cany common carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter [who] shall do any act in this chapter . . . declared to be unlawful . . . shall be liable to the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of the damages sustained . . .,\u201d Part II has no comparable provision. Again, whereas \u00a7 9 of Part I gives an injured shipper the right to sue in the I.C.C. or in the Federal District Court, Part II contains no comparable provision. <em>In addition, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 <em>13(1) and 16 of Part I give a shipper claiming reparation the right to proceed in the Commission and to enforce his reparation award in the courts, and Part II contains no comparable provisions. </em>359 U.S. at 470-471, 79 S.Ct. at 908 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-16\">The Court decided that these omissions manifested Congress\u2019s intent not to provide shippers by motor carrier all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>remedies enjoyed by railroad shippers. Further support for this conclusion was seen by the Court in consistent rejection by the Congress of legislation that would have added to Part II sections similar to 8, 9, 13 and 16. 359 U.S. at 471-472, 79 S.Ct. 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">No common law action for recovery of unreasonable rates was found to survive adoption of the Motor Carrier Act because such a remedy would have been inconsistent with the statute. Since the question of whether the rates were unreasonable would have to be referred to the Commission, <em>see </em>Texas &amp; Pacific R. C. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 27 S.Ct. 350, 51 L.Ed. 553 (1907), a common law action for recovery would have permitted in two steps what Congress prohibited in one.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The import of T.I.M.E. to the present case is apparent. The Supreme Court found that the remedies available to shippers by rail under \u00a7 16(2) were not present in the Motor Carrier Act. Consequently, any suggestion that \u00a7 16(2) is incorporated into Part II must fail unless, subsequent to the decision, Congress has provided for such incorporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">I am aware that the Seventh Circuit in Aluminum Company of America v. Admiral Merchants Motor Freight, Inc., 486 F.2d 717 (7th Cir. 1973) and district courts in the Eighth Circuit, <em>see </em>Land O\u2019Lakes, Inc. v. United-Buckingham Freight Lines, Inc., 351 F.Supp. 102 (D.Minn.1972); Western Electric Co. v. Burlington Truck Lines, No. 18,471-4 (W.D.Mo. March 6, 1973), have considered claims brought by shippers to enforce the ICC order of June 5, 1969 and have held that the shippers do have a statutory cause of action under \u00a7\u00a7 16(2) and 205(g). These decisions have attempted either to distinguish <em>T.I.M.E. </em>or hold it inapplicable in light of Congress having added a reparations section to Part II.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">As indicated, in 1965 the Motor Carrier Act was amended by adding \u00a7 204a, thereby giving shippers by motor carrier a cause of action for reparations. There is no doubt that Congress was cognizant of the T.I.M.E. decision, and that the decision was one of the factors that finally prompted the Congress to make an addition to the Act that the Commission had long requested.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See 2 </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2931 (1965). But Congress did not choose to add this remedy by incorporating into Part II sections of Part I. Instead, it added to Part II a distinct section on reparations \u2014one that is considerably more limited in scope than its Part I counterpart, \u00a7 16(2). T.I.M.E. was, therefore, left undisturbed in its holding that \u00a7 16 could not be read into Part II. On the contrary, Congress\u2019s action would suggest that \u00a7 204a is the sole remedy under Part II for the enforcement of Commission orders for the payment of money.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">In Aluminum Company of America v. Admiral Merchants Motor Freight, Inc., <em>supra, </em>the court found T.I.M.E. \u201cclearly distinguishable since it involved the shippers\u2019 right to reparations not their right to enforce a valid refund order.\u201d 486 F.2d at 721. It is true that in T.I.M.E. the Court did not have before it a valid order of the Commission; however, it considered the broad question of what remedies were available under Part II and used unequivocal language in stating that the remedies of \u00a7 16 were not contained in Part II.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">Unfortunately, there is no clear legislative history demonstrating the intent of Congress when it passed \u00a7 205(g) as a part of the original Motor Carrier Act in 1935. Senator Wheeler, Chairman of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee, simply pointed out the language of the section when he described the entire bill to the Senate. 79 Cong.Rec. 5653 (1935). Had Congress desired to incorporate into the Motor Carrier Act the broad statutory remedies under \u00a7 16(2), it is reasonable that there would have been some specific explanation of what was intended. Appellants submit that by \u201crelief\u201d in \u00a7 205(g), Congress meant \u201cjudicial review.\u201d See Charles Nolding Trucking Co. v. United States, 29 F.Supp. 537, 543 (D.N.J.1939). It is a plausible explanation, though certainly not conclusive. I only know that nothing in the Act itself, its legislative history, or its subsequent interpretation by the Supreme Court persuades me that Congress incorporated \u00a7 16 into the Motor Carrier Act via \u00a7 205(g). On that issue T.I.M.E. is as valid today as it was in 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Finally, it is important to note that the refund order which the shippers are attempting to enforce did not stem from any statutory power of the Commission. Instead, principles of equitable estop-pel and waiver were invoked to uphold its validity. Admiral-Merchants Motor Freight v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Nor has it been suggested that the Commission has the statutory authority under Part II to order refunds. In fact, with the exception of \u00a7 204a which has its own provisions for enforcement, Part II does not even hint that the ICC may make an order for the payment of money. What the majority has done, therefore, is to breathe into Part II a statutory cause of action to enforce an ICC order which was not issued pursuant to \u201cany general authority.\u201d Admiral-Merchants Motor Freight, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 359 of 321 F.Supp. Such a remedy certainly was not anticipated by Congress and this Court should leave to that body the determination of whether the rights and remedies of carriers and shippers under the Motor Carrier Act are to be changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">The absence of a statutory cause of action would not necessarily leave the shippers without a remedy. The equitable doctrine of institution seems a more appropriate vehicle for enforcing an order based on waiver and equitable estop-pel. The courts of common law and equity have spent centuries fashioning remedies for injustice, and it is to that body of law that the shippers should have turned.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By creating a statutory cause of action for the appellees, this Court may have opened a Pandora\u2019s box that could be difficult to close.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-8\">. \u201cRefunds\u201d and \u201creparations\u201d, as they are used in the Interstate Commerce Act, are words of art. Under \u00a7 15(7), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(7) the Commission may require a carrier which has increased its rates to keep accurate accounts of \u201call amounts received by reason of such increase.\u201d After the hearing the Commission may order the carrier \u201cto <em>refund, </em>with interest, to the persons in whose behalf such amounts were paid, such portion of the increased rates or charges as by its decision shall be found not justified.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">Under the reparations procedure any aggrieved party may make a complaint to the ICC \u201cof anything done or omitted to be done by any common carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter . . . .\u201d49 U.S. C. \u00a7 13(1). The Commission may then investigate and, if it finds a violation by the carrier, it will \u201cmake an order directing the carrier to pay to the complainant the sum to which he is entitled on or before a day named.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(1). There are a number of illegal activities that will give rise to a complaint for reparations, including: unreasonable charges, Lewis-Simas-Jones Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., 283 U.S. 654, 51 S.Ct. 592, 75 L.Ed. 1333 (1931), and discrimination by a carrier against or in favor of certain shippers, Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Weber, 257 U.S. 85, 42 S.Ct. 18, 66 L.Ed. 141 (1921).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b959-11\">.
