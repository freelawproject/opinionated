Because \u00a7 245 is not a law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens within the meaning of the removal statute, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-25\">Appellants are black citizens of Vicksburg, Mississippi who organized a boycott of local businesses for the purpose of gaining equal employment opportunities in the privately owned stores and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>city government and its agencies, and to publicize other civil rights grievances. Picketing and leafleting began in late March of 1972 and continued until early May of the same year when the forty-nine appellants were arrested and charged with criminal restraint of trade and criminal conspiracy in restraint of trade. In an attempt to utilize the removal statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1443(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellants assert that the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 245,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is a pre-emptive statute which granted the right to be free from harassment, such as subjection to spurious criminal charges, for having engaged in constitutionally protected activity. Therefore, they assert that they are entitled to have their prosecutions removed from the state court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>At the outset, we note that there is no question of appellants\u2019 right to engage in peaceful picketing. Machesky v. Bizzell, 5 Cir. 1969, 414 F.2d 283; Smith v. Grady, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 181; Kelly v. Page, 5 Cir. 1964, 335 F.2d 114. Although the state contends that the arrests were predicated not on peaceful protest, but on acts of intimidation and coercion, the question in this appeal is not whether appellants had a constitutional right to engage in the activity for which they are now being prosecuted, but whether they are entitled to invoke the extraordinary protection of the removal statute. The key to removal under \u00a7 1443(1) is whether there exists a law \u201cproviding for . . . the equal civil rights of citizens.\u201d Unlike all previous cases which have interpreted the phrase and which have focused on whether a particular statute meets the \u201cequal civil rights\u201d test, the essential inquiry here is whether \u00a7 245, which clearly deals with equal civil rights, meets the requirement that the law be one <em>providing </em>such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Our consideration of whether \u00a7 245 is within the contemplation of \u00a7 1443(1) begins with Georgia v. Rachel, 1966, 384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925, in which the Supreme Court gave careful consideration to the legislative history of the removal statute. The Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 1443(1) encompasses \u201cany law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality\u201d must be read in conjunction with the Court\u2019s reference to the Civil Rights Act of 1866 as the \u201cmodel\u201d of a law within the meaning of \u00a7 1443(1). The 1866 Act, the substantive provisions of which are now codified as 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1982,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> bestowed certain basic rights regardless of race. The <em>Rachel </em>Court concluded that the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which <em>granted </em>the right to racially nondiscriminatory service in places of public accommodation, was also within the compass of the removal statute. In explicating the rationale for its determination that the 1964 Act, like the model of 1866, was within \u00a7 1443(1), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">That Act [the Civil Rights Act of 1964] is clearly a law <em>conferring </em>a specific right of racial equality, for . <em>it guarantees </em>to all the \u201cfull and equal enjoyment\u201d of the facilities of any place of public accommodation without discrimination on the ground of race.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">Id. at 792-793, 86 S.Ct. at 1790 (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">Unlike the defendants in <em>Rachel, </em>the defendants in City of Greenwood v. Peacock, 1966, 384 U.S. 808, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944, were unsuccessful in their effort to remove their state prosecutions. The Court in <em>Peacock gave </em>two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>reasons for reaching a result opposite that of <em>Rachel:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">First, no federal law confers an absolute right on private citizens \u2014 on civil rights advocates, on Negroes, or on anybody else \u2014 to obstruct a public street, to contribute to the delinquency of a minor, to drive an automobile without a license, or to bite a policeman. Second, no federal law confers immunity from state prosecution on such charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Id. at 826-827, 86 S.Ct. at 1812.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Focusing on the first point, that is, the absence of a federal law which granted a right to engage in acts which would otherwise be in violation of state law, this Court in Whatley v. City of Vidalia, 5 Cir. 1968, 399 F.2d 521, concluded that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 granted the specific civil right found lacking in <em>Peacock. </em>Section 11(b) of the 1965 Act, now 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1973i(b) specifically forbade any \u201cattempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any person for urging or aiding any person to vote or attempt to vote.\u201d Although phrased in prohibitory language, the law <em>created </em>a new legal right, and was, therefore, held to be one which provides for equal civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Appellants contend that the proscriptions of \u00a7 245 must lead to the same legal conclusion as that reached in <em>What-ley. </em>In other words, since \u00a7 245, like \u00a7 1973i(b), forbids certain forms of harassment such as the bringing of spurious criminal charges, the appellants in the case <em>sub \u00edndice </em>have a right of removal equivalent to that accorded the appellants in <em>Whatley. </em>This argument, however, misses an essential distinction between the two statutes. Unlike \u00a7 1973i(b), \u00a7 245 is exclusively a criminal statute. While a variety of acts which interfere with the exercise of civil rights are made criminal by \u00a7 245, that statute confers no rights whatsoever. When compared to the \u201cmodel\u201d of 1866 cited by the Supreme Court in <em>Rachel, </em>and to the laws since held to be within \u00a7 1443(1), \u00a7 245 cannot be characterized as a law which <em>provides </em>for the equal civil rights of citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Because of our determination that appellants cannot rely on \u00a7 245 as a basis for seeking removal, the order of the district court remanding these cases to the state court must be</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-4\">. The relevant provision of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1443(1) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">Any of the following civil actions or criminal prosecutions, commenced in a State court may be removed by the defendant to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">(1) Against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\">.
