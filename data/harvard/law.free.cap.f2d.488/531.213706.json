Vicars, 467 F.2d 452 (CA5, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-23\">The allegation of appellant that he was taking (undescribed) drugs during the trial which rendered him incompetent to assist his counsel in his defense was merely general and conclusory, see United States v. Rice, 420 F.2d 863 (CA5), cert. den., 398 U.S. 910, 90 S.Ct. 1705, 26 L.Ed.2d 70 (1970), and the judge below was the judge who had conducted the merits trial and during the lengthy trial (at which appellant was represented by retained counsel) no mention had been made of incapacity to assist in defense, and, over an extended period, the trial judge had observed appellant\u2019s demeanor and appearance, see Smith v. United States, 431 F.2d 565 (CA5, 1970). It was not error to deny an evidentiary hearing on this contention. In United States v. Collier, 399 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>2d 705 (CA7, 1968), relied upon by appellant, the trial judge had notice at trial that there was a question of the defendant\u2019s competency, raised by the introduction of documents that tended to show that at an earlier time he suffered a mental disorder or disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Several other grounds are presented in brief that were not raised with the court below, and we will not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
