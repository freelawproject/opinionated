No specific administrative determination has been made of whether appellants are or are not \u201cinno-. cent spouses\u201d and each now seeks a judicial determination of that issue as a premise for the granting of injunctive-relief. The trial court in each case dismissed the actions for lack of jurisdiction, holding, in effect, that \u00a7 6013(e)\" provides no specific grant of special jurisdiction to the courts and that appellants\u2019 relief is limited to Tax Court procedure or to district court action for refund after payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">We affirm. Jurisdiction to restrain the assessment or collection of taxes is denied to the courts under the mandate of \u00a7 7421 which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-15\">(a) Tax. \u2014 Except as provided in sections 6212(a) and (c), 6213(a), and 7426(a) and (b)(1), no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">The prohibition of \u00a7 7421 is broad, Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., 370 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292, and judicial intervention is not allowable simply upon claim of potential hardship, \u201cwrongfulness,\u201d or difficulties encountered in procedures other than injunctive relief. We must, therefore, reject appellants\u2019 arguments that it is the court\u2019s duty to assume jurisdiction because of the claim that appellants are, in fact, \u201cinnocent spouses\u201d and are not getting the relief that Congress intended for such persons. The court can grant injunctive relief if, and only if, a legislative or judicial exception to \u00a7 7421 exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-17\">None of the legislative exceptions to \u00a7 7421 establishes grounds for jurisdiction in these cases. The exceptions provided in \u00a7 6212(a) and (c)(1) and \u00a7 6213(a) . allow injunctions to prohibit assessment of deficiencies, levies, and collection suits unless and until the plaintiff lias been sent a notice of deficiency and allowed the statutory time to file a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>tion for redetermination with the Tax Court. Appellants neither claim nor allege any facts which would place them within these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The exceptions provided in \u00a7 7426(a) and (b)(1) do not allow jurisdiction to be exercised here since the section applies only to wrongful levies and does not allow litigation of the assessment itself. In fact, \u00a7 7426(c) expressly bars actions concerning the validity of an assessment. Appellants contend only that the levy is wrongful and not that it is defective itself as is required by the statute. Further, the section is available only to persons \u201cother than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose.\u201d Here appellants are the persons against whom the tax is assessed; accordingly, the exception does not exist. Nor'can appellants properly assert that they are not taxpayers by the expedient of boot strapping their yet unestablished claim to be \u201cinnocent spouses\u201d as a jurisdictional basis for a judicial determination of fact perhaps leading to an adjudication that they should not be considered taxpayers. As this court has previously held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-5\">The assessment of the tax is, of course, presumptively correct and in order to establish federal court jurisdiction for injunctive relief, more is required than bare allegations of illegality, even though such allegations may ultimately be sustained. Williams v. Wiseman, 10 Cir., 333 F.2d 810, 811.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Appellants\u2019 contentions fall under the category of \u201cbare allegations of illegality\u201d and, therefore, do not come within the judicial exception to \u00a7 7421(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Nothing in \u00a7 6013(e) or its legislative history indicates any intent by Congress to create a new exception to \u00a7 7421 or a new procedure for litigating tax questions as the appellants contend. The subject section provides only for a new substantive tax relief element.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-9\">.
