MORGAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b738-22\">The question presented to us for review in this case is whether the district court erred in ordering the Secretary of the Army to issue a permit to fill navigable waters to Di Vosta Rentals, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Di Vosta). To answer the question, we must examine the scope of authority granted to the Secretary by \u00a7 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 403,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the scope of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>which the district court should have used to test the validity of the Secretary\u2019s refusal to issue a permit. After receiving stipulated evidence and trial briefs from the parties, the district court ordered defendants to issue a permit to the plaintiff. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">On February 3, 1967, Di Vosta acquired title to a parcel of land fronting on Lake Worth, Florida. On September 10, 1969, having paid $18,221 to the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund of the State of Florida, Di Vosta acquired title to .614 acres of submerged land adjoining its lakeside property. Di Vosta\u2019s purpose, which did not become known to the government agencies involved until much later, was to build an apartment building on the property. To make the land suitable for this project, Di Vosta had to obtain fill permits for the submerged land from both the state and federal governments. Di Vosta first applied to the Trustees for a permit. They refused. Di Vosta successfully sued in the state courts of Florida to compel issuance of the permit, which was issued July 23,1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Di Vosta applied to the Corps of Engineers for a dredge and fill permit on July 31, 1970. After distributing public notice of the request, the Corps received objections from private citizens, the Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners and several federal agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The Corps informed Di Vosta of the objections and offered the opportunity to present arguments in support of the project. Di Vosta did so in late January, 1971. This information was sent to the objecting federal agencies, and in March, the Corps was informed that these agencies remained opposed to the permit. Negotiations continued throughout 1971, but all parties held staunchly to their positions. The District Engineer informed Di Vosta on April 19, 1972, that its application for a permit had been denied because the permit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-12\">1. Is not believed to be consistent with current public interest in the preservation of man\u2019s natural environment as enunciated in Public Law 91-190,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-13\">2. Would not involve, a water-dependent development, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-14\">3. Is opposed by the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency and was approved by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund only after an order from circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">Di Vosta filed suit in district court on May 25, 1972, and the court entered its final judgment March 16, 1973, requiring the federal defendants to issue the fill permit to Di Vosta. The defendants filed a notice of appeal April 19, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b739-17\">The Secretary\u2019s decision to deny the permit must be examined in relation to the applicable institutional framework. Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 403, is a total ban on all obstructions of navigable waters, subject only to exceptions specifically authorized by the Secretary of the Army. The Act allows the Secretary wide discretion in deciding whether to issue a permit. In fact, it places no restrictions on the decision at all. Nevertheless, the authority of the Secretary to grant or deny permits is not unlimited. His decision may be reviewed by a court. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. Zabel v. Tabb (5 Cir. 1970) 430 F.2d 199, cert. denied, 401 U.S. 910, 91 S.Ct. 873, 27 L.Ed.2d 808 (1971). See, Association of Data Processing Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Organization, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 156-157, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"> A reviewing court is limited in its review of an agency decision, however. Its function is not to determine the <em>correctness, </em>in some ultimate sense, of an agency\u2019s actions. A reviewing court is limited to determining only the <em>legality </em>of the challenged action. If an agency acts within the scope of its authority, and if that authority is consistent with the Constitution, then a court may not overturn the agency\u2019s decision. St. Joseph Stock Yards Company v. United States, 298 U.S. 38, 51, 56 S.Ct. 720, 80 L.Ed. 1033 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In \u00a7 10, Congress has left certain decisions within the discretion of the Secretary of the Army. A court may review the legality of the Secretary\u2019s exercise of discretion, American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 108, 23 S.Ct. 33, 47 L.Ed. 90 (1902), but may not substitute its judgment for that of the Secretary. Federal Reserve System v. Agnew, 329 U.S. 441, 444, 67 S.Ct. 411, 91 L.Ed. 408 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Congress has codified the rules which control court review of agency action. In the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq., Congress set forth specific guidelines which courts are obliged to use in reviewing agency decisions. The primary question before this court is one of the applicability of the various subsections of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> setting standards for the judicial review of administrative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-15\">The district court held 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (E) to be applicable to the Secretary\u2019s decision to refuse a permit. That section allows a court to set aside agency action found to be \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to sections 556 and 557 of this title or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute</p>\n<p id=\"b740-17\">The defendants argue that subsection (E) is not applicable because the proceedings herein do not fall into either of the two categories of that subsection. They further argue that the only relevant subsection of \u00a7 706(2) is \u00a7 706(2) (A), providing that agency action may be set aside if found to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law</p>\n<p id=\"b740-20\">Defendants\u2019 position is unexceptionable. At no time has Di Vosta argued that the Secretary\u2019s actions fall into either of the two categories of subsection (E), proceedings under 5 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 556 and 557, or decisions \u201cotherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute.\u201d Actions which do not fall within either of these categories are not subject to the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test. Camp v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L. Ed.2d 106, 111 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Di Vosta\u2019s citation of General Motors Corporation v. United States, (6 Cir. 1963) 324 F.2d 604, is unavailing, since that case involved a tariff-setting proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission. The G.M. case was based on the landmark case of Universal Camera Corporation v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Concededly, proceedings before both the I.C.C. and the N.L.R.B. are subject to the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d requirement. But decisions of the Secretary of the Army under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 403 are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Di Vosta argues that the following language in Zabel v. Tabb, <em>supra, </em>indicates that the Secretary\u2019s decision is subject to \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d review.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The question presented to us is whether the Secretary of the Army can refuse to authorize a dredge and fill project in navigable waters for factually substantial ecological reasons even though the project would not interfere with navigation, flood control, or the production of power. 430 F.2d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The question of the proper standard of review was not before the court in <em>Zabel. </em>The only question presented was whether the Secretary could consider ecological factors in making his decision on the granting of a permit. <em>Id. </em>The court answered this question in the affirmative. The <em>Zabel </em>opinion cannot be read to include any holding with respect to the proper <em>scope </em>of judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Di Vosta also argues that by submitting the case to the district court on stipulated evidence, the defendants agreed to <em>de novo </em>review of the Secretary\u2019s decision. This contention is totally without merit. Parties may not agree to expand the jurisdiction of the federal courts. American Fire &amp; Casualty Company v. Finn, 341 U.S. 6, 71 S.Ct. 534, 95 L.Ed. 702 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Under different circumstances, it might be advisable to end the opinion at this point and simply remand the case to the district court for a determination of the issue of whether the Secretary\u2019s action in denying the permit was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (A). We feel, however, that additional litigation in the district court would be a waste of resources for all concerned. This case was submitted to the district court on stipulated documentary evidence and written trial briefs. Although this circumstance does not change this court\u2019s scope of review, it does affect our disposition of the case. For the reasons explained below, we are convinced that the Secretary\u2019s action was not arbitrary or capricious. Believing that nothing that might happen in the district court on remand could change our view of the case, we reverse, not for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, but with directions to dismiss the complaint. Because we are making a final disposition of this case in this opinion, it is necessary to deal with several other points raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\"> Appellants point out that the United States has been included as a defendant in this case, and that this inclusion is improper under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 83 S.Ct. 999, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963). Di Vosta fails to present any argument or authority to the contrary. It is well established that the United States may not be made a defendant without its consent. There is no consent here. Therefore, the district court had no jurisdiction to bind the United States in its decree. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. (19 U.S.) 264, 411-412, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">DiVosta appears to argue that the Secretary improperly considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>objections from other government agencies in making his decision on a permit. Although Di Vosta\u2019s brief is not as lucid as it might be, this argument is apparently based on two grounds: the objections of other agencies were too vague to allow Di Vosta to respond properly and the receipt of written objections from other agencies violates the hearsay rule. Both of these arguments are without merit. An examination of the record reveals that the objections from other agencies were put in terms sufficiently explicit to give Di Vosta an opportunity to try to refute them. At every turn, Di Vosta was given sufficient opportunity to communicate with these agencies in an effort to change their recommendations. In no respect can Di Vosta be said to have been deprived of its right to due process of law. As to the apparent hearsay objection raised in Di Vosta\u2019s brief, we have been cited to no case which holds that in a proceeding such as this, the Secretary is to be held to the rigid formalities of the hearsay rule. Nor do we think such a citation exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Having determined that the proper standard, for review of the Secretary's decision is whether it was arbitrary or capricious, we turn to a review of the record. This review demonstrates that the Secretary\u2019s action may not be set aside under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">After receiving Di Vosta\u2019s application for a permit, the Corps made a public announcement of the application. This it was required to do by 83 C.F.R. \u00a7 209.120(f)(1). Several replies indicated no objection to the project. But the opinion was not unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Three bureaus of the Department of the Interior opposed the permit application. The Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife of the Fish and Wildlife Service objected for three reasons: (1) \u201cLake Wqrth has been severely damaged by dredging and filling in the past and will be a prime candidate for possible habitat rehabilitation studies in the future. Further filling and destruction of submerged marine bottoms will not be of any benefit to Lake Worth.\u201d (2) \u201cTo preserve esthetic qualities and to allow for future restoration of the marine biological environment, further unnecessary filling in Lake Worth should be prohibited.\u201d (3) Having been advised that Di Vosta had no plans to construct a building on the fill, the bureau felt that the fill project \u201cwould be an unnecessary and irretrievable commitment of the marine environment involved and should not be allowed.\u201d (Appendix page 77). The Bureau of Outdoor Recreation stated that, \u201cAlthough this application for permit to fill does not specifically allow the development of appurtenant structures, it is felt that it will nevertheless encourage this kind of development at some future date; should this happen, the existing aesthetic qualities of Lake Worth would be degraded and any attempts to restore the lake to its natural condition would become increasingly difficult.\u201d Also, the Federal Water Quality Administration opposed the project \u201cbecause it consists of the destruction of a natural shoreline and shallow water areas.\u201d (Appendix pp. 78-79). The field representative to the Secretary of the Interior for the Southeast Region transmitted these objections to the District Engineer of the Corps of December 21, 1970, adding that, based on the objections of the three bureaus, the department itself recommended that the permit application be denied. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">In addition to these objections by federal agencies, several objections from private citizens were received, as well as an objection from the Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County. In accordance with' the policies set forth in a memorandum of understanding between the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army promulgated July 13, 1967, (see 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 209.-120(d) (11)), the Corps attempted to mediate the differences between the Department of the Interior and Di Vosta by acting as a conduit for information. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>It forwarded the objections of the Department of the Interior to the plaintiff, received arguments in support of the permit application from the plaintiff, and forwarded these arguments to the Department of the Interior. This exchange occurred during December, 1970, and January, 1971. In a letter dated February 24, 1971, the Environmental Protection Agency stated that it opposed the application for the following reasons: (1) The lake is a \u201cvaluable estuarine area\u201d that \u201chas some signs of degradation\u201d but \u201cis not beyond recovery.\u201d Granting of the fill permit \u201cwill make that recovery more difficult and protracted.\u201d (2) \u201cIt is the opinion of the Environmental Protection Agency that the only way in which water quality values and the water use classification of Lake Worth can be preserved is to prevent any further development of land within the Lake below the mean high water line.\u201d (3) The portion of the Lake to be filled is without vegetation, but it may be of some value to the marine ecosystem. (4) \u201cThe development by Di Vosta Rentals is only a part of an overall encroachment on the shallow water areas of Lake Worth and it is to this overall encroachment that EPA objects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">After receiving plaintiff\u2019s written arguments in favor of its application, the Department of the Interior replied that it remained opposed to the project. The field representative to the Secretary for the Southeast Region reiterated his position and added that, having learned that an apartment building was planned for the area, the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife concluded that such a project would put a further strain on already heavily overloaded sewerage facilities in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">A meeting was held between Di Vosta and a representative of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife in October, 1971, but in January, 1972, the bureau indicated that it was unconvinced that the permit should be granted. It added the following objection: \u201cThis Bureau strongly objects to the filling of bay bottoms for residential purposes where there is no demonstrated overall public need, where acceptable alternatives are not considered, and where the proposed works are not water dependent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">We are unable to find fault with the Corps\u2019 processing of Di Vosta\u2019s application. It was consistent with the applicable regulations, 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 209.120, and with the three major pieces of legislation which set policy in this area, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331-4347, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1934, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 661-666c, and the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899. The Corps properly considered environmental factors in making its decision. Zabel v. Tabb, <em>supra. </em>It properly consulted other agencies in making its decision. United States v. Moretti, 5th Cir. 1973, 478 F.2d 418. See also Bankers Life and Casualty Company v. Village of North Palm Beach, 469 F.2d 994 (5 Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">For these reasons, we do not feel that the Secretary\u2019s denial of Di Vosta\u2019s permit application can be said to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). We have not, in this opinion, reiterated all the evidence in support of Di Vosta\u2019s application. Evidence to support a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Secretary was present in the record. But we do not feel that the evidence in opposition was so overwhelming as to make the Secretary\u2019s decision unreasonable. Whether or not the objections from other agencies qualify as \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S. \u00a7 706(2) (E), they are sufficient to shield the Secretary\u2019s decision from attack under \u00a7 706(2) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">Sufficient evidence has been presented to us that, under the provisions of \u00a7 706(2) (A), the Secretary\u2019s order denying the permit was lawful. In such a situation, we see no need to burden the parties with further litigation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>district court.

Village of North Palm Beach, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The judgment of the trial court is vacated and the case is remanded to the trial court with directions to dismiss the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Vacated and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-14\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 403 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-15\">\u00a7 403.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-16\">The creation of any obstruction not affirmatively authorized by Congress, to the navigable capacity of any of the waters of the United States is prohibited; and it shall not be lawful to build or commence the building of any wharf, pier, dolphin, boom, weir, breakwater, bulkhead, jetty, or other structures in any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, canal, navigable river, or other water of the United States, outside established harbor lines, or where no harbor lines have been established, except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army; and it shall not be lawful to excavate or fill, or in any manner to alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>or modify the course, location, condition, or capacity of, any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, canal, lake, harbor of refuge, or inelosure within the limits of any breakwater, or of the channel of any navigable water of the United States, unless the work has been recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army prior to beginning the same.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">\u00a7 706.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">\u25a0 To the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.
