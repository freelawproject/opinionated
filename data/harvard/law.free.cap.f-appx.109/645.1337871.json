The district court sentenced him to sixty-five months in prison. Murry appeals his sentence, challenging the district court\u2019s decision to enhance his sentence under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) (2002), on the ground that he possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-28\">Murry, a convicted felon, was a passenger in a car that police officers stopped for reckless driving. Officers found a pistol in a case under Murry\u2019s seat. In addition, Murry possessed a distributable quantity of cocaine base. Murry objected to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation for a four-level enhancement because Murry possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense, namely possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>contended that there was insufficient evidence that the firearm and the drug offense were related. On appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Section 2K2.1(b)(5) provides for a defendant\u2019s offense level to be enhanced by four levels if he used or possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d The government bears the burden of proving the necessary facts by a preponderance of the evidence, and we \u201creview the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, giving due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In this Circuit, \u201cin connection with\u201d is treated as analogous to \u201cin relation to,\u201d as used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000). <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 411 (4th Cir.2003). In other words, the firearm must facilitate or have the tendency to facilitate another offense. <em>Id. </em>at 411 (citing <em>Garnett, </em>243 F.3d at 829). \u201c\u2018[T]he firearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the ... crime; its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 238, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)) (modification in original). However, the government has met its burden of establishing that the firearm was used or possessed in connection with another felony if it shows that the gun was \u201cpresent for protection or to embolden the actor.\u201d <em>United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 266 (4th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Here, Murry was traveling in a car with a distributable quantity of cocaine base on his person and a firearm he admitted was his within his reach under his seat. Under the facts of this case, we find that the district court did not clearly err in determining that the enhancement applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
