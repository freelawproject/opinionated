A certificate of appealability mil not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Green has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis, and dismiss the appeal. To the extent that Green\u2019s notice of appeal and appellate brief could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2254 motion, we deny authorization. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395, 2003 WL 22232622 (U.S. Nov. 3, 2003) (No. 03-6548). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\"> By order filed January 6, 2004, this appeal was placed in abeyance for <em>Jones v. Braxton, </em>No. 03-6891. In view of our recent decision in <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363 (4th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>2004), we no longer find it necessary to hold this case in abeyance for <em>Jones.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
