For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-20\">Awel asserts that her testimony was credible and corroborated, and was therefore sufficient to establish her eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Awel fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-22\">Accordingly, we grant the motion to file a supplemental appendix but deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
