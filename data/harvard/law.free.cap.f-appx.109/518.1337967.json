See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b547-5\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Tennyson Harris appeals his conviction of a single count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">On appeal, Harris first asserts that the district court erred in denying his request that the jury be instructed on the definition of reasonable doubt. We have held that \u201cit is improper for a district court to define reasonable doubt for a jury unless the jury itself requests a definition.\u201d <em>United States v. Najjar, </em>300 F.3d 466, 486 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1094, 123 S.Ct. 705, 154 L.Ed.2d 641 (2002). Harris acknowledges the rule in this circuit, but suggests that this precedent be reconsidered. Because a panel of this court may not overrule a prior published decision of the court, Harris\u2019 assertion of error is baseless. <em>See United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Harris also argues that the district court erred in refusing to give an instruction he proffered on multiple conspiracies, and improperly responded to a question from the jury. \u201cA multiple conspiracy instruction is not required unless the proof at trial demonstrates that appellants were involved <em>only </em>in separate conspiracies <em>unrelated to </em>the overall conspiracy charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Squillacote, </em>221 F.3d 542, 574 (4th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>32 F.3d 876, 884 (4th Cir.1994)). Our review of the record convinces us that the district court properly refused to give the requested instruction. We have also reviewed the district court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s request for clarification concerning its consideration of the evidence of conspiracies, and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in its response. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>62 F.3d 641, 646 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">We therefore affirm Harris\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AGc\"> Counsel for Harris has filed a motion seeking permission to provide supplemental argument so as to challenge certain aspects of his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The motion is hereby granted, and the motion to file supplemental argument is deemed to provide the supplemental argument regarding the effects of <em>Blakely. </em>After consideration of the order issued by the <em>en hanc </em>court in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 S.Ct. \u2014, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (U.S. Aug. 6, 2004) (No. 04-193), we find no error in Harris\u2019 sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
