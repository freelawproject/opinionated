For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">Yang challenges the immigration judge\u2019s findings that his testimony was incredible and that he failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). Moreover, credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">We have reviewed the immigration judge\u2019s decision and the record and find that Yang failed to establish his eligibility for asylum on a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that burden of proof is on alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). As the immigration judge\u2019s decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief Yang seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Yang\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen, </em>195 F.3d at 205. To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 </em>U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Yang fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-18\">Finally, we conclude that Yang has failed to prove that it is more likely than not that he would be subjected to torture upon his return to the People\u2019s Republic of China, in violation of the Convention Against Torture. Based on our review of the record, we find that Yang has failed to show a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d or to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would face torture if deported. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003) (stating that to qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, an alien must show \u201cit is more likely than not that he ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
