The magistrate judge sentenced Sherman pursuant to the court\u2019s authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402 to one year of probation, a $300 fine, and a $10 special assessment. As a special condition of probation, the magistrate judge ordered that Shaw\u2019s hunting privileges were suspended during the probationary term. The district court affirmed the MJ\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">Shaw argues that the imposition of probation and the loss of his hunting privileges are inherently unfair. Shaw faced a maximum sentence of six months in prison, a $15,000 fine, or both. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 707. Shaw admitted at his rearraignment that he knowingly violated the requirements of 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 703 and 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21(b). We conclude that the MJ\u2019s sentence was not plainly unreasonable or an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Sandle, </em>123 F.3d 809, 810 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Merritt, </em>639 F.2d 254, 256 (5th Cir.1981); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
