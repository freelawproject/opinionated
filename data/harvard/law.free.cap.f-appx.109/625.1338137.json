The notice of appeal in this case was received in the district court after expiration of the appeal period. However, Garcia dated his notice of appeal prior to the expiration of the appeal period. Under <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), the notice is considered filed as of the date Garcia delivered it to prison officials for forwarding to the court. Because the record does not reveal when Garcia delivered his notice of appeal to prison authorities, we cannot determine whether the notice of appeal is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-20\">The record is similarly unclear as to the date Garcia filed his motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s order. Under <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>the motion to reconsider also is deemed filed as of the date the petitioner delivered it to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See United States v. Duke, </em>50 F.3d 571, 575 (8th Cir.1995). Although Garcia\u2019s motion to reconsider was received by the district court clerk more than one month after the district court\u2019s entry of judgment, the date on the motion is within ten days following entry of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a) (computation of time). The date Garcia delivered the motion to reconsider to prison officials must be ascertained by the district court because the timing of the filing of that motion determines whether it is properly considered under Fed R. Civ. P. 59(e) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). <em>See In re Burnley, </em>988 F.2d 1 (4th Cir.1992). Accordingly, we remand the case for the district court to determine the timeliness of the filing of the notice of appeal under <em>Houston v. Lack. </em>In the event that the court concludes that Garcia\u2019s notice of appeal was timely filed, it must then determine whether Garcia\u2019s motion to reconsider was delivered to prison officials for mailing no later than the tenth day following the entry of the court\u2019s April 27, 2004 order. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-21\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
