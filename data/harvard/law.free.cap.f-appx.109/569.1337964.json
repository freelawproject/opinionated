We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-16\">Fisher argues the district court erred when it prohibited him from cross-examining a police investigator about his alcohol use. The investigator testified he did not drink on the day of Fisher\u2019s arrest and that he does not drink on duty. The district court found that further evidence of the witness\u2019s drinking habits was not probative, and to the extent that it might be probative, it should be excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403 because its value was substantially outweighed by its danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, and misleading the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-17\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Leftenant, </em>341 F.3d 338, 342 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 1183, 157 L.Ed.2d 1215 (2004). We will defer to the balancing engaged in by the district court under Rule 403 \u201cunless it is an arbitrary or irrational exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Heater, </em>63 F.3d 311, 321 (4th Cir.1995). Accordingly, because we conclude that the district court\u2019s finding that the probative value of the witness\u2019s drinking habits was substantially outweighed by its danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury was not arbitrary or irrational, we hold the district court did not abuse its discretion by precluding further questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-20\">Fisher also argues it was reversible error for the Government not to provide him a copy or transcript of a tape recording of a conversation of a confidential informant setting up a drug transaction with Fisher, and a copy of a witness\u2019s criminal record. Fisher contends the Government\u2019s failure to disclose this evidence violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>To prove a <em>Brady </em>violation, Fisher must show he requested the undisclosed evidence and it was (1) favorable; (2) material; and (3) that the prosecution had it and failed to disclose it. <em>See Moore v. Illinois, </em>408 U.S. 786, 794-95, 92 S.Ct. 2562, 33 L.Ed.2d 706 (1972); <em>United States v. Stokes, </em>261 F.3d 496, 502 (4th Cir.2001). Evidence is \u201cfavorable\u201d not only when it would tend to exculpate the accused, but also when it can be used to impeach government witnesses. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); <em>United States v. Trevino, </em>89 F.3d 187, 189 (4th Cir.1996). Evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability its disclosure would have produced a different outcome. <em>See Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682; <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>35 F.3d 929, 936 (4th Cir.1994). A \u201creasonable probability\u201d of a different result is shown when the government\u2019s failure to disclose evidence \u201cundermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Under the Jencks Act, a defendant has a right to inspect, for impeachment purposes, prior statements made to government agents by government witnesses, which are in the government\u2019s possession. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(b) (2000). A statement by a government witness must be produced after the witness\u2019s direct examination at trial, if the statement relates to the witness\u2019s testimony. A \u201cstatement\u201d is defined as the witness\u2019s written statement or an oral statement that was transcribed \u201csubstantially verbatim.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(e) (2000). Violations of the Jencks Act constitute harmless error when no prejudice results to the defense. <em>United States v. Schell, </em>775 F.2d 559, 567 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Because Fisher has not demonstrated the undisclosed information was material, we conclude the Government did not violate <em>Brady. </em>Furthermore, we conclude no violation of the Jencks Act occurred. Accordingly, we affirm Fisher\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
