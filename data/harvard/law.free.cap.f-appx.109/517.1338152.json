We deny the motion and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Wilkerson has not filed a timely notice of appeal. When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-26\">The district court\u2019s order denying Wilkerson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was entered August 19, 2002. Wilkerson\u2019s next filing was a letter dated April 7, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Construing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>letter as a notice of appeal, it is clearly untimely. In a May 7, 2004, order responding to the April 7 letter, the district court instructed Wilkerson to file in this court a motion for a certificate of appealability and implicitly denied Wilkerson\u2019s request in his April 7 letter to give him permission to appeal. Wilkerson adhered to the court\u2019s instruction and filed the petition in this court on May 31, 2004. Construing this filing as a notice of appeal from the August 19, 2002, order, it is also untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and deny as moot the petition for a certificate of appealability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-17\">. For the purpose of this appeal, we assume the date appearing in the letter is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>U.S. 266, 108 S.ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-17\">. Construing the petition for a certificate of appealability as a notice of appeal from the May 7 order is also without merit. The district court\u2019s implicit denial of permission to file a notice of appeal is without error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), (6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
