Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(2), we have construed his notice of appeal as a request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 claims. Allen asserts that he has sought relief from prison authorities without success and argues the merits of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 claims. He continues to seek release from incarceration and monetary damages for his allegedly illegal confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">As Allen has not challenged the district court\u2019s determination that his claims were not cognizable in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, he has waived any such challenge. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). To the extent that Allen seeks monetary damages for his allegedly illegal incarceration, his claims are barred because he has not yet had his confinement declared unconstitutional in a habeas corpus action or other proceeding. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-16\">This court may grant a COA \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When a district court\u2019s ruling is based on a procedural ground, a COA will issue only if the applicant shows \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-17\">The district court correctly determined that Allen could raise his claims in a state habeas corpus petition. <em>See </em>Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-5(l)(g). As Allen has not raised his claims in a state habeas corpus proceeding, he has not exhausted his state remedies. <em>See Days v. Johnson, 322 </em>F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003). Therefore, Allen has not shown that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>ruling debatable or wrong. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Allen\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims is AFFIRMED, and Allen\u2019s request for a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b707-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
