In No. 03-7622, Jones appeals from the district court\u2019s October 10, 2003, order denying Jones\u2019 motion to alter or amend its April 23, 2003, order, and denying Jones\u2019 \u201cMotion for Court Ordered Subpoenas,\u201d his \u201cMotion for Judicial Notice of Undisputed Facts,\u201d and his \u201cMotion to Strike or Opposition to the Government\u2019s Response.\u201d By order filed January 30, 2004, Jones\u2019 appeals were placed in abeyance for <em>Jones v. Braxton, </em>No. 03-6891. In view of our recent decision in <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363 (4th Cir.2004), we no longer find it necessary to hold this case in abeyance for <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-19\">As to No. 03-6998, Jones cannot appeal the April 23, 2003, order unless a circuit judge or justice issues a certificate of appealability, and a certificate of appealability will not issue absent a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A habeas appellant meets this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 326, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have reviewed the record and conclude the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was proper; the court did not err in dismissing Jones\u2019 motion challenging his sentence as a successive and unauthorized 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion; and Jones has not made the requisite showing for a certificate of appealability. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. As to No. 03-7622, in which Jones challenges only the court\u2019s denial of his request for subpoenas, we affirm the district court\u2019s October 10, 2003, order, to the extent it denied Jones\u2019 motion for subpoenas. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>No. CR-96-79-BO (E.D.N.C., Oct. 10, 2003). We deny Jones\u2019 motion to deconsolidate his appeals. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">No. 03-6998 <em>DISMISSED</em></p>\n<p id=\"ASd\">No. 03-7622 <em>AFFIRMED</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
