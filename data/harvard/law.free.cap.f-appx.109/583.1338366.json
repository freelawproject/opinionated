He received a 96-month sentence. On appeal, he challenges his conviction, arguing that the district court erred in not allowing him to pursue testimony from Magistrate Clifton Brummitt that would impeach the testimony of Deputy Wade Woody, a Government witness. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Leftenant, </em>341 F.3d 338, 342 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 1183, 157 L.Ed.2d 1215 (2004). Having reviewed the material submitted in the joint appendix, particularly the trial transcript, in light of Harris\u2019 argument, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-25\">Accordingly, we affirm Hams\u2019 conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-26\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
