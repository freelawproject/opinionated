We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Faty\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). As found by the Board, the new documents submitted by Faty fail to resolve the credibility problems that were present at his immigration hearing and fail to establish his eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
