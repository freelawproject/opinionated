The district court denied Edwards\u2019 petition. This court has previously denied Edwards\u2019 request for a stay of extradition pending this appeal, both initially and on rehearing. Edwards is currently in the custody of the Santa Clara County Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-18\">This court is obligated to address issues of jurisdiction, including mootness, prior to addressing the merits of an appeal. <em>Goldin v. Bartholow, </em>166 F.3d 710, 714 (5th Cir.1999). Because Edwards has already been extradited to California, there is no relief this court can grant, and Edwards\u2019 appeal is dismissed as moot. <em>See Schlang v. Heard, </em>691 F.2d 796, 799 &amp; n. 6 (5th Cir.1982). His pending motion for the expedited consideration of his appeal is also denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS MOOT; MOTION DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b732-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
