Hernandez raises two issues on appeal. He argues that the district court erred: (1) by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and (2) in its determination of the amount of drugs for which he was held responsible at sentencing. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-22\">We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hernandez\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). The court properly conducted Hernandez\u2019s plea hearing under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir.1995). In addition, the court carefully and correctly analyzed the motion, using the relevant factors articulated in this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, this claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-23\">The court did not clearly err in determining the quantity of drugs attributable to Hernandez for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999). The court\u2019s drug quantity findings were supported by testimony at the sentencing hearing, <em>United States v. Falesbork, </em>5 F.3d 715, 722 (4th Cir.1993), and by amounts listed in the presentence report. <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998). Accordingly, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-24\">Hernandez has moved for leave to file a supplemental brief addressing the impact of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), on this case. The motion is both granted and deemed to be the supplemental brief. In light of our recent order in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426, No. 03-4253, 2004 WL 1730309 (4th Cir. Aug.2, 2004) (order), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 S.Ct. \u2014, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (U.S. Aug. 6, 2004) (No. 04-193), relief under <em>Blakely </em>is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Hernandez\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
