Accordingly, we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Marshall v. Abbasi, </em>No. CA-02-517GBL (E.D. Va. Sept. 17, 2003 <em>&amp; </em>June 3, 2004).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-9\">. Marshall\u2019s failure to present argument in his informal brief as to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against Ms. Stazewski results in waiver of those claims on appeal. <em>See </em>Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\">. While the district court applied the standards governed by the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, as a pretrial detainee, Marshall's claim of inadequate medical care is governed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 535 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). However, with respect to claims of deliberate indifference to medical needs, a pretrial detainee\u2019s due process rights are coextensive with a convicted prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights. <em>Hill v. Nicodemus, </em>979 F.2d 987, 990-92 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b638-25\">. To the extent Marshall seeks to raise claims on appeal not first presented to the district court, we decline to consider those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
