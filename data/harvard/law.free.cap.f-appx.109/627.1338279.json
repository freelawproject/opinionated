An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Phillips has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Phillips\u2019s motion to recall the mandate and amend the appeal in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\"> The Supreme Court has not made <em>Blakely </em>retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>See In re Dean, </em>375 F.3d 1287, No. 04-13244 (11th Cir. July 9, 2004). Moreover, this court has concluded that <em>Blakely </em>does not impact the federal sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. \u2014, \u2014 S.Ct. \u2014, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014(U.S. Aug. 6, 2004) (No. 04-193).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
