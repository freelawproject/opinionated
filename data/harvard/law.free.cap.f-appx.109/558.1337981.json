Richburg contends on appeal that the district court clearly erred in finding that, in his attempt to avoid arrest, he assaulted the arresting officer in a manner that created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3A1.2(b)(l) (2003). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-25\">During a traffic stop of the car in which Richburg, a convicted felon, was a passenger, the police officer learned that there was an outstanding probation violation warrant for Richburg. The officer told Richburg that he was under arrest, noticed a gun in Richburg\u2019s waistband, and attempted to handcuff him. Richburg turned around and tried to punch the officer in the face, but missed. The two struggled and Richburg\u2019s gun fell to the ground. The struggle continued, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>officer punching Richburg in the face and spraying him in the face with cap-stun, until other officers arrived. At Richburg\u2019s sentencing, over his objection, the district court determined that Richburg had assaulted the officer in a manner that created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury and gave him a three-level adjustment under \u00a7 3A1.2(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The district court\u2019s factual finding that Richburg assaulted the officer in a manner that created a risk of serious bodily injury is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>272 F.3d 220, 223 (4th Cir.2001), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>537 U.S. 839, 123 S.Ct. 162, 154 L.Ed.2d 61 (2002). Richburg argues that his conduct did not create a substantial risk of serious bodily injury. He attempts to distinguish his case from <em>Harrison, </em>where the defendant\u2019s accomplice shot at pursuing police officers,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 222, and from <em>United States v. Sloley, </em>19 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir.1994), in'which the defendant resisted arrest by struggling with the officer and grabbing his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Application of \u00a7 3A1.2(b) usually is based on some actual injury to the law enforcement officer or a clear attempt by the defendant to inflict serious injury, as in <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Sloley. See, e.g., United States v. Zaragoza-Fernandez, </em>217 F.3d 31, 33 (1st Cir.2000) (defendant drove his car at military policeman who suffered glancing blow on knee as he jumped clear); <em>United States v. Ashley, </em>141 F.3d 63, 69 (2d Cir.1998) (minor injuries suffered by four officers in subduing defendant). However, circumstances alone that presented a risk of injury have been held to warrant the adjustment. <em>See United States v. Waldman, </em>310 F.3d 1074, 1079 (8th Cir.2002) (defendant pointed loaded gun at back of officer\u2019s head and threatened to kill him); <em>United States v. Bowie, </em>198 F.3d 905, 913 (D.C.Cir.1999) (defendant\u2019s attempt to pull gun from waistband as officer tried to handcuff him posed risk of serious bodily injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Clear error occurs when the court, upon reviewing the record as a whole, is left with the \u201c \u2018definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>124 F.3d 655, 667 (5th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)). Although the circumstances in this case are less egregious than those in other decisions, we are satisfied that a circumstance where, as here, an armed officer has a physical fight with an armed suspect he is attempting to arrest, presents a risk of serious bodily injury. We cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that the adjustment was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> In <em>Harrison, </em>the appellant received adjustments under \u00a7 3A1.2(b) and \u00a7 3C1.2 (Reckless Endangerment during Flight). He did not contest the applicability of \u00a7 3A1.2(b), but argued that USSG \u00a7 3C1.2 alone should have been applied, and that applying both sections constituted double counting. 272 F.3d at 223.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
