The court properly noted that Farmer\u2019s complaint was filed in the wrong district and he could not seek punitive damages against a municipality under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>reviewed the record and dismiss the appeal as frivolous. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal con-. tentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
