Bailey\u2019s motion challenges the district court\u2019s jurisdiction at the time of his conviction. Because Bailey timely objected to the district court\u2019s recharacterization, Bailey was entitled to have the district court \u201crule on the merits of [his] motion as filed.\u201d <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644, 649 (4th Cir.2002). Although the district court erred in converting the motion in the face of Bailey\u2019s objection, it is clear from the record that the motion as characterized by Bailey was without merit. Because we are able to affirm the judgment of a district court on any basis supported by the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Bailey\u2019s motion. <em>See Eisenberg v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., </em>301 F.3d 220, 222 (4th Cir.2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
