Gesford, Jr., a state prisoner, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Gesford has not made the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>showing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AkW4\"> One of the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel Gesford asserts on appeal, as well as his claim of improper interrogation and judicial misconduct, were not raised before the district court. As Gesford has offered no exceptional circumstances justifying this failure, we are foreclosed from considering these claims on appeal. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that claims raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
