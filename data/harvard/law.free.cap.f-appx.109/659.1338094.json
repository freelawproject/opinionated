Queen claimed that Houston police officer W.B. Purser illegally stopped him, illegally seized contraband from his clothing, and falsely arrested him. Queen\u2019s complaint also asserted a claim for loss of familial association on behalf of his minor daughter, Sabrina Nicole Goeddertz, based on Queen\u2019s arrest and subsequent incarceration following Queen\u2019s conviction for possession of controlled substances. The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because Queen\u2019s conviction had not been invalidated and because a favorable judgment on Queen\u2019s claims that the search and arrest had been unlawful would imply the invalidity of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">Queen argues that the \u201cfavorable termination\u201d requirement of <em>Heck </em>does not apply because he had completed his sentence before he filed his complaint and thus could not challenge his conviction by means of a federal habeas petition. Queen\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Randell v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir.2000), in which this court determined that it was bound to apply <em>Heck\u2019s </em>\u201cfavorable termination\u201d requirement to custodial as well as released inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">One panel of this court is bound by the precedent of previous panels absent an intervening Supreme Court case overruling that prior precedent. <em>See Martin v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>254 F.3d 573, 577 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-15\">Queen contends that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his unlawful arrest claim under <em>Heck </em>because the claim does not necessarily implicate the validity of his conviction. In order to prevail on his claim, Queen must show that Purser lacked probable cause to arrest him. <em>See Wells v. Bonner, </em>45 F.3d 90, 95 (5th Cir.1995). Queen\u2019s false arrest claim necessarily challenges whether the evidence seized by Purser, which led to his conviction, supplied probable cause for his arrest. Queen\u2019s false arrest claim is therefore barred by <em>Heck. See Jackson v. Vannoy, </em>49 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-16\">Queen argues that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing as frivolous the claim of his minor daughter. Because his daughter\u2019s claim is derivative of his constitutional claims, and because Queen\u2019s claims are barred, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the claim asserted on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Queen\u2019s daughter. <em>See Benavides v. County of Wilson, </em>955 F.2d 968, 975 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Queen\u2019s remaining argument is that the district court erred in dismissing his action before the defendant answered the complaint. The district court\u2019s dismissal of the action was in accord with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, which requires dismissal \u201cat any time\u201d if the court determined that the action is frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Queen\u2019s action as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Queen is hereby CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes,\u201d he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b688-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
