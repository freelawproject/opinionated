Thames seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders remanding this action to state court for lack of federal jurisdiction and denying his subsequent motion to reconsider the remand order. The district court\u2019s remand order is not reviewable. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (2000). Therefore the appeal in No. 03-2036 must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-22\">In No. 04-1097, Thames seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-23\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on December 3, 2003. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>notice of appeal was filed on January 9, 2004. Because Thames failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss his appeal from the denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss both appeals for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
