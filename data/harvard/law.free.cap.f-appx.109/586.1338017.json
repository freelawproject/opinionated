This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation that Lamb seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-12\"> Even if Lamb\u2019s notice of appeal was construed as appealing the district court\u2019s final order, entered on January 22, 2004, dismissal would be appropriate. Despite being warned of the consequences of failing to file timely objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, Lamb failed to file timely objections and therefore has waived this court\u2019s review of the claims asserted in his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas </em>v. <em>Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
