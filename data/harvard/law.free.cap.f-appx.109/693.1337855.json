Dockeray, Jr., Texas prisoner # 563359, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit in which he asserted that various prison officials violated a plethora of his constitutional rights. Docker-ay has moved for leave to supplement his appellate brief with a one-page omission. That motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-21\">Dockeray argues that his original complaint, filed in the Southern District of Texas, was improperly severed. The issue of the propriety of that order is not properly before the court. Dockeray also asserts that his claims are not untimely. We will not address this assertion because it stems from Dockeray\u2019s mistaken belief that his claims were dismissed as time-barred. Nor will we address Dockeray\u2019s assertion, not contained in his original complaint, that prison officials have blocked his access to the courts during the pendency of this action. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). The court would note, however, that this claim is refuted by the fact that Dockeray filed numerous documents in this matter before the trial court, and that most of these documents were irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Dockeray also challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims based on his failure to comply with court orders that he file an amended complaint. The district court\u2019s order dismissing Dockeray\u2019s claims due to his failure to prosecute was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b); <em>McNeal v. Papasan, </em>842 F.2d 787, 789 (5th Cir.1988); <em>see also Salinas v. Sun Oil Co., </em>819 F.2d 105, 106 (5th Cir.1987). Rather than comply with the court\u2019s order, Dockeray filed numerous documents not responsive to the court order. Even after the second order was entered, Dockeray did not comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Accordingly, that order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Dockeray is reminded that this court has already imposed the three-strikes bar pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Dockeray v. Ozz, </em>105 Fed.Appx. 609 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished). Accordingly, Dockeray may no longer proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b721-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
