To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Woldemichael fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Woldemichael\u2019s request for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Woldemichael fails to show she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. We further find Woldemichael failed to show eligibility for relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
