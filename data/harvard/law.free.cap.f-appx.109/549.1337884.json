For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-24\">Kyi asserts that she established her eligibility for asylum by showing past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Kyi fads to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Kyi seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-25\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Kyi\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Kyi fails to show she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>higher standard for withholding of removal. Finally, we uphold the denial of Kyi\u2019s application for relief pursuant to the Convention Against Torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 16(c) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">We thus deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
