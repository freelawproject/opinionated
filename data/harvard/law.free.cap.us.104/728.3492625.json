This appeal was delivered' to the: collector in time to have reached Washington by due course of mail on the 10th of July, if it had been promptly forwarded; but it w\u00e1s retained until the 15th, when it was sent to the commissioner, with an indorsement by the collector that he had investigated the facts, and found the statements of the claimant were in all respects true. The papers reached-the commissioner on the 17th of July, and he, on the 13th of October following, submitted them to the Secretary of the Treasury, as required- by the regulations, for his consideration and advice. On the 18 th of October the secretary signified to the commissioner his approval of the payment of the claim, and on the 21st the commissioner certified its allowance. On the presentation of this certificate through the accounting officers of the Treasury Department payment was refused. The certificate has never been revoked by either the secretary or the commissioner, but it is still in force so far as the action of these officers is concerned. After payment was refused, suit was brought on the certificate in the Court of Claims, where judgment was given for the claimant. From this judgment the United States appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b758-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number><em>The Solicitor- Q-eneral, Mr. William- Lawrence, </em>and <em>Mr: John S. Blair </em>for the United States.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b758-3\">\u25a0 The following points are taken from Mr. Lawrence\u2019s brief:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b758-4\">I. The claim is barred because not presented at the office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in Washington within two years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b758-5\">1. The statute says such claim \u201c must be presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\u201d Rev. Stat., sect. 3220. The commissioner'has an office \u201cin the Department of the Treasury\u201d (id., sect. 319), and this- \u201cshall be at the seat of government.\u201d Id., sect. 233. The claim is to be \u201csettled and adjusted in the Department of the Treasury.\u201d Id. 236. Effect is to be giyen to the words as they are, \u201c not importing . . . words . . . not found there.\u201d- <em>Leavenworth, &amp; c. Railroad </em>Co. v. <em>United States, </em>'92 U. S. 733, 751. A- presentation at Pittsburgh is not a presentation \u201cin the-Department of the Treasury.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b758-6\">The.- \u201c treasury of the United States \u201d is \u201c in the treasury building,\u201d and there the treasurer performs his duties. Rev. Stat., sect. 3591. . ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b758-7\">Banks are required to make returns for taxation \u201c to the treasurer.\u201d Id., sect. 5215.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b758-8\">If for the convenience of the banks a .\u2022 regulation is'made (id., sect. 161) permitting them to make reports \u201c through \u201d a sub-treasurer, are the banks relieved from the duty to still make them \u201c to the treasurer \u201d ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b758-9\">2. The \u201cregulation\u201d does not change this. It says claims \u201cshould be presented through the collector.\u201d \u201cShould\u201d is not \u201c shall,\u201d and if so, \u201c through \u201d is not \u201c to.\u201d This permits presentation through a collector, but contemplat.es presentation to the commissioner. The regulation is to be construed in harmony with the statute, which gives the claimant a right to present' directly to the commissioner, but permits a collector to aid him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b758-10\">3. The commissioner had no power to receive the claim after two years, and any action thereon was <em>ultra vires. </em>An officer cannot waive a right denied by statute. <em>Andrae </em>v. <em>Redfield, </em>12 Blatchf. 407; <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>98 U. S. 179. The claim is, as said in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kaufman </em>(96 id. 367, 570), \u201cimpeached for . . .. mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>4. The duty imposed by statute on the. commissioner, cannot be delegated to a collector. <em>Delegata potestas non potest delegad.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-4\">It is the right of the claimant to have the privilege of pre- \u25a0 senting his claim at the office of the commissioner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-5\">5. A claimant cannot impose a duty on a collector to repeive a claim. Official duties are fixed by-law. <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Huron, L. &amp; B. Co., </em>11 Mich. 147; Cooley, Const. Lim. 363, 451.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-6\">II. The allowance of the commissioner does not give a <em>prima fade </em>right of action. Rev. Stat., sect. 1059.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-7\">The test, whether such allowance gives such right, is this: Is it evidence of a \u201c promise on the part of the United States to pay\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Kaufman, Supra), </em>or an award showing a debt due; that is, does it <em>per se </em>so operate ? If it does <em>not,. per se, </em>impose a duty-on all officers charged with duties in relation to it to make payment without examining the evidence on which it is based, how can it be said that it is the evidence which the law requires of a right to payment? If other steps are by law required to secure'payment, how. can it be, <em>per se, prima fade </em>evidence of a right to payment ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-8\">1. It is \u201ca'mere step in the system of internal revenue.\u201d House Ex. Doc. No. 27, 2d Sess. 45th Cong., p. 43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-9\">2. The whole power of the commissioner is found in the words \u201c to refund and .pay back.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-10\">These had a meaning when first used in the act of June SO, 1S64, c. 173. The commissioner did literally \u201c refund and pay back,\u201d \u201c by drafts drawn on collectors of internal revenue.\u201d This power was taken away by the third section of the act of March 3,1865, c. 78, and the w^rds to \u201c refund and pay back \u201d became inoperative, \u2014 they ceased to have a meaning. The commissioner coiild- no longer literally \u201c pay back.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-11\">Such claim cannot be paid unless it has been \u201c settled and adjusted in the Department of the Treasury.\u201d Rev. Stat., sects. 181, 187, 236, 248, 269, 277, 305, 313; <em>McKnight's Case, </em>13 Ct. Cl. 302 ; 1 Op; Atty.-Gen. 624, 680; 2 id. 507 ; 10 id. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-12\">The claimant must \u201c pursue \u25a0 the statutory remedy to the end.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kaufman, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-13\">3. To hold that these words authorize the commissioner to give evidence \u00f3f <em>&amp; prima fade </em>right of action seems objection<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>able. The law (Rev. Stat., sects. 989, 3226, 3227) recognizes a remedy by action against a collector. It would' seem improbable that Congress intended to give a duplicate remedy by action on the allowance of the commissioner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-3\">If the allowance of the commissioner gives <em>prima facie </em>right of action against the United States, it is -.not barred until six years (id., sect. 1069), when the government may have lost the means of impeaching it, whereas Congress seems to have intended to limit the remedy by requiring a presentation within two years to the commissioner (id., sect. 3228), and for a short period against the collector. Id., sects. 983, 3226, 3227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-4\">The approval of the commissioner has no element.of a contract. . He is not authorized to contract. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-5\">\u25a0 4. It will enable a claimant to withdraw from the government the benefit of an examination by the proper accounting officers. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-6\">It should require clear language to produce such a result.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-7\">Whenever.. Congress has intended to withdraw from this supervision any class of cases, it has been done in very explicit language. Rev. Stat. sects. 48, 1089, 1911.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-8\">III. Congress having given another judicial remedy, it is to be deemed exclusive. Rev. Stat,, sects. 846, 989, 8226, 3227; <em>State </em>v. Marlow, 15 Ohio St. 114; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Garrigues, 28 Pa. St. 9; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Baxter, 35 id. 263; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Leech, 44 id. 332..</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b760-9\"><em>Mr. George L. Douglass </em>for th\u00f3 appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b760-10\">Mr. Chief Justice Waite,</author>\n<p id=\"A--\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">\u25a0 The objections made to the recovery are, in substance: 1, That the Court of Claims had no jurisdiction of the suit, because \u2019the claim sued for was not founded ion any law of Congress, or upon contract; and, 2, That the appeal to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was not taken within two years after the cause of action accrued, and that consequently the allowance by that officer was without any authority of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">The first of these objections is, we think, disposed of by <em>United States </em>v. Kaufman, 96 U. S. 567. That ease arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>under sect. 3426, Rev. Stat., which is as follows: \u201c The Commissioner of Internal Revenue may, from :time to time, .make regulations, upon proper evidence of facts, for the allow\u00e1nce of such of the stamps issued under the provisions of this chapter, or any internal revenue act, and may have been spoiled, . . . and such allowance shall be made either by giving other stamps in lieu of the stamps so allowed for, or by repaying the amount or value, after deducting therefrom, in ease of repayment, the sum of. five per cent, to the owner thereof. . ,. .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">And we held that the allowance of a claim by the commissioner under this section was equivalent to an account stated between private parties, and binding on the United States, until in some appropriate form it was impeached for fraud or mistake, and that, if not paid on proper application through the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, an action might be maintained on it in'the Court of Claims, because it raised an implied promise on the part of. the United States to pay what might actually be due the. claimant, and also because the claim therefor was founded on 'a law of Congress within the meaning of that term as used in defining the jurisdiction of th,e court. We-cannot'discover any material difference between the powers of. the commissioner under . sect. 3426, and., those \u2022 which he has under sect.' 3220. Under' sect. 3426 he is to \u201c allow-\u201d the claim, which is done either by giving other stamps in' lieu of those that have been spoiled, &amp;c., or by repaying the amount or value. Under sect. 3220 he is to \u201c refund \u201d and \u201c pay back.\u201d His payments of money . in both cases must be made through the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, as he is not himself a disbursing officer. Whether his. allowance is conclusive on the other officers, through .whose hands it must'.necessarily pass before it can be paid by the treasurer, we did not then, and. \u25a0need not now decide. - All we said then, and all we say now is, that if payment is not made by reason of' tlie refusal of any of the officers of the department to pass or pay the claim after it has once been allowed by the commissioner, the allowance maybe used as the basis of an action against the United States in the Court of Claims, where it will be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the amount that is due, and put on the government' the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>of showing fraud or mistake. This burden is not. overcome by, proving that some other officer in the subsequent . progress of the claim through the department declined to do what the law or treasury regulations required of liim before payment could be obtained. The fact of fraud or mistake must be established by competent evidence, the same as any other fact in issue. An allowance by the commissioner in \u25a0 this class of cases- is not the simple passing of an ordinary claim by an ordinary accounting officer, but a statement of accounts by one having authority for that purpose under an act of Cotigress. Until an appeal is taken to the commissioner no suit whatever can be maintained-to recover back taxes illegally assessed of erroneously paid. \u2022 If on the appeal the claim is rejected, an action lies against the collector .(Rev.- Stat., sect. 3226), and through him, on establishing the error or illegality, a recovery can be had. If the claim is allowed, and payment for any cause refused, suit may be brought directly against the government in the Court of Claims. This, as it seems to us, is the logical result of the legislation of Congress upon the subject. A rejected claim may be prosecuted against the collector, and an allowed claim, not paid, may be sued for in the Court of Claims. To say the least, the decision of the commissioner on the appeal is sufficient to determine whether one form of remedy shall be resorted to by the claimant, or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Upon the other branch of the case we are entirely satisfied with the conclusions reached by the court below, and that the lodging of the appeal made out in due form with the pi-oper collector of internal revenue for the purpose of transmission to the commissioner in the usual course of business, under the requirements of the regulations of the secretar}1-, was in legal effect a presentation of the appeal to the commissioner. The effect of the regulation was to designate the office of the collector of internal revenue as a proper place for the presentation of the appeal. The whole subject is so fully and satisfactorily considered in the opinion below, that we deem it unnecessary to do more than refer, to what is there said.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.
