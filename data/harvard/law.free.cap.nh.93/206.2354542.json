J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATD\">As a general rule, questions of law once decided in a particular case will not be re-examined upon a subsequent transfer. <em>Vallee </em>v. <em>Company, </em>89 N. H. 558; <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>84 N. H. 124, 126; <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>80 N. H. 258, 264; <em>Whittemore </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>77 N. H. 61, 62; <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Company, </em>75 N. H. 154, 158, and cases cited. This rule applies to many of the questions presented by the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The defendant requested the Court to instruct the jury that the value of the services which the plaintiff rendered the decedent was not to be determined by the benefit which the decedent derived therefrom but by the detriment which the plaintiff suffered in rendering those services; that in determining the reasonable value of the services the jurors were to consider the amount and kind of work the plaintiff performed and the rate customarily paid for similar services at that time and in that locality, and that they were not to consider on the issue of value the personal relationship existing between the plaintiff and the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Cases which adopt the detriment rule for which the defendant contends treat the party who relies on the Statute of Frauds as if he were a contract-breaker (Williston &amp; Thompson, Contracts, <em>s. </em>536) and permit the plaintiff to recover for his loss even though the actual benefit conferred upon the defendant has been negligible. See note on <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Castle, </em>190 Ky. 776, in 5 Minn. Law Rev. 567; 71 C. J. 166, s. 142. The Presiding Justice did not deny the defendant\u2019s requests altogether but instructed the jurors that in determining the reasonable value of the plaintiff\u2019s services they were to consider \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>detriment and inconvenience she incurred and the responsibility she assumed of which the decedent was relieved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The measure of damages commonly applied in cases of this kind is the fair price it would have cost to obtain the service in question from a person in the plaintiff\u2019s position. Restatement, Contracts, s. 348, <em>Comment a. </em>But the plaintiff\u2019s position here was not that of an ordinary domestic servant or nurse, and it could well be found that her work, because of its high quality, was reasonably worth more than the rate customarily paid for the type of service she performed. As indicated in the last opinion, the fact that she occupied the position of a foster daughter was a circumstance to be considered with other evidence as tending to prove that her services were especially valuable.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">It should be borne in mind that the end sought to be attained in this class of cases is restitution for benefits received, the term \u201creceived\u201d not being \u201cnarrowly defined\u201d (Restatement, Contracts, s. 348, <em>Comment a), </em>and although there may be no precise commercial standard by which to measure the value of a particular service in view of the individual qualities of the person who performs it (see Wig. Ev., 3d <em>ed., s. </em>715), this does not mean that its value cannot be fairly appraised. The usual rules for determining what a person\u2019s services are reasonably worth govern, so far as applicable, and the jury in deciding the question of value is entitled to consider the situation and relationship of the parties as well as the nature and extent of the services rendered. <em>Ham </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>37 N. H. 185, 190; Sutherland, Damages (4th <em>ed.), s. </em>679, <em>p. </em>2474; 2 Sedgwick, Damages (9th <em>ed.), s. </em>664a; Annot., 69 A. L. R. 14, 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u201cThe ascertainment of the fair market value of services so unusual in nature and so uncommon in ordinary experience is doubtless a matter of some difficulty, but the problem lies primarily in the domain of fact and its solution must to a large extent be left to the good sense, practical wisdom and sound judgment of the trier of fact, mindful of the evidence and guided by the correct principles of law.\u201d <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Company, </em>312 Mass. 405, 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The defendant is of course correct in his contention that the value which the decedent placed upon the companionship and affection of the plaintiff is not an element of recoverable damage. But the Court did not advise the jury that it was, and no request for an instruction on the subject was made other than the request that the jury be instructed not to give any consideration at all to the \u201cpersonal relationship of Sadie and Mr. Haley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>This request was properly denied. In the event of its denial the defendant requested an alternative instruction to the effect that the jury in determining the \u201cadditional value\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s services because of the personal relationship should consider \u201cthe loss or detriment to Sadie in rendering such services, as well as the benefits arising to Mr. Haley.\u201d Since that part of the charge relating to detriment and benefit was a substantial compliance with this request, the defendant cannot now challenge the correctness of the instructions in those particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel, computing the value of the plaintiff\u2019s services on the basis of definite rates, contend that any sum in excess of $3,532 is unwarranted. This is not true, however, as a matter of law, and the Presiding Justice was not asked to set the verdict aside as excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The Court declined to grant the defendant\u2019s motion, made in advance of trial, that plaintiff\u2019s counsel be told to refrain \u201cfrom refering to or offering to introduce\u201d in evidence \u201cany detailed recital of the relationship of Sadie and the Haleys, other than that she came to them as a little girl, grew up in their family and facts which tend to show that both she and the Haleys had a relationship or love, affection and confidence in each other.\u201d The extent to which these matters required consideration before any offer of proof had been made was determinable by the trial Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The denial of the request that the jury be cautioned not to consider the fact that the case had been previously tried was likewise within the trial Court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his argument to the jury called attention to the fact that the decedent \u201cstood in the same position to Sadie Lemire as if he was her own father,\u201d the only difference being that \u201cwhen he died Sadie wouldn\u2019t inherit his estate.\u201d The defendant objected to the argument, and the Court then stated to the jury that the case was being tried on the basis of fair compensation for the services which the plaintiff had rendered the decedent and that the jury in determining the amount of the verdict was not to consider \u2018' the question whether she is an heir or who is an heir. \u2019 \u2019 The defendant\u2019s exception \u201cto that line of argument\u201d is unavailing in view of the Presiding Justice\u2019s instructions and his subsequent assertion that it seemed to him that his remarks to the jury had taken care of the matter. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>79 N. H. 474, 477, 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The jurors-!were told not to include interest in the amount of the verdict they might render. After the verdict was returned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>plaintiff moved for judgment on the verdict with interest from November 8, 1938, the date of the original demand, to the date of final judgment. There was no error in the denial of this motion. If a plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages in <em>quantum meruit </em>is based on established market values or other generally recognized standards, interest is recoverable. <em>Dame </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>75 N. H. 38. But where, as here, the plaintiff\u2019s demand is not so based, interest is not usually allowed. <em>Faber </em>v. <em>New York, </em>222 N. Y. 255, 262; Sutherland, Damages (4th <em>ed.), s. </em>347; 1 Sedgwick, Damages (9th <em>ed.), s. </em>312, <em>p. </em>614. See, also, Williston &amp; Thompson, Contracts, s. 1413.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Furthermore, where recovery is sought both on a <em>quantum meruit </em>and for breach of an express contract, in no event will interest run until an election has been made. See Sutherland, Damages (4th <em>ed.), s. </em>324, <em>p. </em>1016. In the present case it is doubtful if the plaintiff, in view of her continued insistence on the right to recover on the special contract, has ever elected to proceed in <em>quantum meruit. </em>Certainly no such election was made at the time of the original demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The questions of law presented by the remaining exceptions have been decided on previous transfers of this case. All exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-12\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
