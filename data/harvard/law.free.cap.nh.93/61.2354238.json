The motorcycle and the automobile came together in the intersection and the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was killed. Fitzpatrick testified that he entered the intersection at a speed of 35 miles per hour and that he saw the motorcycle thereafter when it was 225 feet away. He was unable to fix his own position at this time. Thus it might be found that the defendant\u2019s car proceeded without reference to the provisions of R. L., <em>c. </em>106, s. 3, which provides as follows: \u201cIf a person traveling on a highway with a vehicle approaches an intersecting way ... he shall grant the right of way, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the point of intersection, to vehicles approaching from his right, provided that such vehicles are arriving at the point of intersection at approximately the same instant.\u201d A finding that the defendant was at fault was, therefore, clearly sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Defendant\u2019s claim that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence is based largely upon Fitzpatrick\u2019s testimony that the motorcycle entered the intersection at a speed of 60 miles per hour. Other testimony of the same witness upon cross-examination indicated that the motorcycle traveled approximately the same distance as the car, after its discovery by the witness, before the collision, which would indicate that they were proceeding at about the same speed. Obviously the jury was not bound to accept the estimate of the defendant\u2019s driver. Under the statute (R. L., c. 384,- s. 13), which places the burden of proving contributory negligence upon the defendant, if the conduct of a plaintiff \u201cadmits of any reasonable and nonculpable explanation, the question of his due care is for the jury.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 73, 78; <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>82 N. H. 236, 240. Both the issue of the defendant\u2019s fault and that of the decedent\u2019s contributory negligence were properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b88-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
