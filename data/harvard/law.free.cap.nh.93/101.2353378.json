J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6Z\">The findings of fact are unquestionably warranted by the evidence. All exceptions thereto are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">The Court could properly find not only that Bilodeau had authority to permit Cyr to take the 1940 car for trial purposes but that Towle knew and approved of what he had done. Towle testified that Bilodeau took the car on Saturday night with his permission to try to sell it to Cyr; that Bilodeau came to his house at two o\u2019clock Sunday afternoon \u201cto talk terms\u201d with him \u201cabout selling the car to Mr. Cyr\u201d; that he (Bilodeau) was then driving Cyr\u2019s 1936 car; that he (Towle) informed Bilodeau of the terms on which he \u201cthought he should do business with Mr. Cyr\u201d and that Bilodeau left saying that he was going back to see Cyr, and that he returned about five or six o\u2019clock and told him that Cyr had bought the car. In view of all the evidence in the case, the Court was not obliged to accept this last assertion at its face value.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Towle also testified that on the day following the accident he returned the ten-dollar deposit and the 1936 car to Cyr and later sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the wrecked car to a junk dealer. Although the Court ruled that this evidence was not binding upon the Liberty Mutual company, that company now contends that all evidence of Towle\u2019s conduct subsequent to the accident, though \u201cvery properly\u201d restricted in its application under the rule of <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>89 N. H. 95, 99, 100, was prejudicial. The simple answer to this contention is that no prejudicial use of the evidence has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The other evidence to which the Liberty Mutual company excepted all had reference to the extent of Bilodeau\u2019s authority or to Towle\u2019s knowledge of the situation. It was clearly admissible. See <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>90 N. H. 112, 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">At the time of the trial Bilodeau was working in Ohio and was not available as a witness. One of Towle\u2019s salesmen testified that Towle permitted his salesmen \u201cto let customers try out the cars\u201d for \u201chours at a time\u201d and for a longer period \u201cif the occasion necessitated it\u201d; that they were not \u201cgiven any specific instructions\u201d as to allowing the prospective purchaser to let others, such as wife, son, or daughter, drive the car but used their \u201cbetter judgment because of the fact\u201d that they \u201cwere selling automobiles for a living\u201d and knew their customers. On cross-examination Towle was asked, \u201cActually, Mr. Towle, you didn\u2019t have much objection as to who drove those cars so long as it was in your business in an effort to make a sale of the automobile?\u201d He answered, \u201cWell, only that they had to have a license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">This evidence renders unexceptionable the Court\u2019s conclusion that the use of the 1940 car by Daggett was within the terms, express or implied, of the bailment to Cyr, and within the scope of the use permitted by Towle. It follows that the extended coverage of Towle\u2019s policy is available to Daggett. Hence the insurance afforded Dag-get by his own policy \u201cwith respect to the operation of any other automobile\u201d does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The plaintiffs in the actions at law as well as the Liberty Mutual company excepted to the second paragraph of the decree, claiming that if the \u201climits\u201d of Towle\u2019s policy \u201care insufficient to satisfy the damages recovered,\u201d Daggett\u2019s insurer, the American Employers\u2019 Insurance Company, is bound to defend and to pay the excess within the limits of Daggett\u2019s policy. We do not so construe the language of the provision relating to the \u201coperation of any other automobile.\u201d Inasmuch as an amount of insurance equal to that provided by his own policy is available to Daggett under Towle\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>policy, he is not entitled, we believe, under a reasonable interpretation of the provision in question, to the additional coverage furnished thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b132-6\">Johnston, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
