J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4S\">During the year 1942 the defendant was \u201cdoing work incident to the war,\u201d and because of that fact he increased the regular hours of labor for his employees from forty-five to fifty hours a week. There were some weeks, however, in which the plaintiff and certain of the other operatives did not work the required length of time. In each of these instances an investigation was made to ascertain the reason for the absence of the particular workman.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">Concerning the plaintiff\u2019s employment record, the general manager of the defendant\u2019s plant testified: \u201cIt was reported to me that he [the plaintiff] was unable to work a full week of fifty hours. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>would have trouble with his legs and feet. . . . Report was always the same, he was unable to stand the strain of the fifty hours a week. . . . He had trouble with his legs.\u201d This testimony was introduced without objection or exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">After the conclusion of the general manager\u2019s testimony, the superintendent was called to - the stand. He stated that in the course of his duties he had had \u201coccasion to check up to find out\u201d why the plaintiff \u201cdid not work regularly.\u201d On proof of the death of Myron Bolian, a foreman of whom he had made inquiry, he was permitted to testify, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception, that Bolian had reported to him in the regular course of business that the plaintiff\u2019s feet and legs bothered him and for that reason \u201che was not able to put in a fifty-hour week,\u201d and that this information came \u201cfrom Mr. Geralds through Mr. Bolian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The contention that the foreman\u2019s report was inadmissible because the fact reported was not within the foreman\u2019s personal knowledge is untenable. The fact reported was not literally the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s feet and legs bothered him but rather the fact that he so stated to the foreman as the reason for his absence. The foreman, if living, could have testified directly to this admission on the plaintiff\u2019s part. See <em>Lebrun </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 293, 301. See, also, <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Company, </em>78 N. H. 491, 493, 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The further contention that the report was a casual or isolated one is met by the evidence that the system of \u201ccheckups\u201d and reports was inaugurated \u201cas far back as December, 1940.\u201d The mere fact that the report in this particular instance happened to be made to the superintendent rather than to the general manager does not mean that it could not be found on all the evidence to have been made in the regular course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">In short, there was sufficient evidence to sustain the preliminary findings of fact on which the admissibility of Bolian\u2019s report depended. See <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>45 N. H. 355, 360; <em>Lebrun </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 293, 300; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>87 N. H. 430, 432. Facts of this character need not be expressly found but will be implied from the ruling of the Court admitting the hearsay statement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>90 N. H. 438, 439, 440. See Am. Law Inst., Model Code of Evidence, <em>p. </em>273.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The essential question presented by the plaintiff\u2019s exception is whether a report made in the regular course of business by a foreman since deceased to his superintendent, which would have been admissible if written, is inadmissible because stated orally. \u201cThat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the statement . . . must be a <em>written </em>statement has been generally assumed in the United States in the judicial phrasings of the rule. In England, however, it seems to be settled that an oral statement is equally admissible.\u201d Wig., Ev. (3d <em>ed.), s. </em>1528, citing <em>Sussex Peerage Case, </em>11 Cl. &amp; F. 85, 113; <em>Reg. </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>13 Cox Cr. 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">But statements of this kind, whether written or oral, in order to be admissible under the English rule, must have been made in the discharge of a duty imposed upon the declarant \u201cby some superior authority\u201d (Chamb., Ev., ss. 2873, 2876), whereas, under the rule generally prevailing in this country as to written statements, no such limitation obtains <em>(Lebrun v. Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 293, 300, 301, and authorities cited; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Company, </em>78 N. H. 491, 496). Where, however, \u201cthe element of duty (as required in England) does in fact exist,\u201d as, for example, \u201cin the actual conduct of business by subordinates in mercantile or industrial houses,\u201d Wigmore deems the case to be \u201ca proper one for the adoption of the broader English rule admitting oral statements.\u201d Wig., Ev. (3d <em>ed.), s. </em>1528.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Chamberlayne discusses the subject, in part, as follows: \u201cThe form of statement is important on the question of weight rather than on that of admissibility where the other conditions exist for receiving the evidence. . . . The admissibility of the oral declaration ... is well established in England. The application of the rule to oral statements is not, however, frequently referred to in the American cases; though there is no apparent reason for making any distinction between oral and written statements in this connection. In mercantile and business houses oral reports are regularly made and a duty undoubtedly exists for making them and with correctness. No element of trustworthiness is, therefore, lacking.\u201d Chamb., Ev., s. 2897.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In the case of <em>Fennerstein\u2019s Champagne, </em>3 Wall. 145, 149 (referred to by both Wigmore and Chamberlayne), Mr. Justice <em>Swayne </em>declares: \u201cWe think the letters in question in this case were properly admitted. . . . The rule rests upon the consideration that the entry, other writing, or parol declaration of the author, was within his ordinary business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Company, </em>9 Hous. (Del.) 322, so far as it concerns the admissibility of an oral report, closely resembles the present case on its facts. In that case, which was an action brought by an administratrix to recover for the death of her husband, alleged to have been caused by the unsafe condition of the defendant\u2019s premises, an oral report made in the regular course of business by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>deceased foreman to the superintendent of the defendant\u2019s plant was held to be admissible. The case is reviewed in 9 Harv. Law Rev. 288, and is cited with apparent approval in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Company, </em>33 Del. 497, 503, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Questions concerning the weight of evidence are usually for the jury or other triers of fact, and, apart from statute, no distinction, so far as admissibility is concerned, is ordinarily drawn between evidence that is oral and that which is in written form. A \u201cliberal rule in regard to the admissibility of entries made in the regular course of business prevails in this jurisdiction\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>87 N. H. 430, 431, citing <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 538; <em>State </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>82 N. H. 189, 192; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Company, </em>78 N. H. 491), and, in our opinion, the Presiding Justice in holding admissible the evidence excepted to merely sanctioned a logical extension of this liberal rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
