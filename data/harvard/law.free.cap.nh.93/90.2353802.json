The libelee denied no one of the specific facts thus testified to. He simply denied that he ever married the libelant. The master found that the parties were married, and found the facts necessary for a divorce. As to the latter there was clearly sufficient supporting evidence. As to the marriage, R. L., c. 338, <em>s. </em>40, provides: \u201cIn all civil actions, except actions for criminal conversation, evidence of acknowledgment, cohabitation, and reputation is competent proof of marriage.\u201d The master could disregard the libelee\u2019s testimony, believe the libelant\u2019s, and find as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b117-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
