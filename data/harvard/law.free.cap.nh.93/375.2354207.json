Defendant\u2019s counsel in his argument to the jury said: \u201cI say that justification extends not only to what was taken that day but whatever might have been taken before.\u201d And the Court informed the jury that the defendant \u201csays that it was justified in restraining her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">It is the general rule that in the case of detention without a warrant, the defendant, in order to avoid liability, has the burden of justifying his act by showing that he had probable cause for imposing the particular restraint. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Knowlton, </em>173 Mass. 94.
