Co. </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>91 N. H. 368, 371, this court had occasion to consider the meaning of the words \u201clegal representatives\u201d as used in Laws 1937, c. 161, s. 17, <em>par. </em>IV, and it was there said: \u201cThe words \u2018legal representatives\u2019 have no fixed meaning in the law. Their significance varies according to the circumstances of their use. \u2018The term \u201clegal representatives\u201d is not necessarily restricted to the personal representatives of one deceased, but is sufficiently broad to cover all persons who, with respect to his property, stand in his place and represent his interest, whether transferred to them by his act or by operation of law.\u2019 <em>New York Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>117 U. S. 591, 597.\u201d It was accordingly held in that case that the words \u201clegal representatives\u201d should be construed to mean heirs. We think that, under the circumstances of the present case, we should give them a similar interpretation, and the plaintiffs are accordingly advised that, as argued by the Brewer life tenants, the words \u201clegal representatives\u201d should be construed to mean the heirs-at-law of the deceased life tenant. Who these persons are is to be determined by the law of his domicile at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>of his death. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>French, 77 </em>N. H. 509, 513, and cases cited. It is alleged in the petition that \u201csaid Malcolm T. Curtiss, Senior, died on the sixteenth day of November, 1942, and is survived by a widow, Alice B. Curtiss, and two children, Charlotte Curtiss Addoms and Malcolm T. Curtiss, Junior, his sole heirs-at-law.\u201d Assuming the truth of this allegation under the law of Massachusetts, the income from the interest of Malcolm Curtiss in the trust fund should be paid to the above-named persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b426-13\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
