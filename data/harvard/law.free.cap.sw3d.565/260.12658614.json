Lee, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A rehabilitation hospital hired a medical transportation company to take a patient to a doctor's appointment. Before the transport, the company's driver required the patient to sign an agreement that, in part, released the company from any liability. After the appointment, the patient fell as he was getting into the company's van. He sued the medical transportation company, which moved to dismiss based on the exculpatory provisions of the agreement. The trial court and the Court of Appeals ruled that the exculpatory provisions were enforceable. We hold that to determine the enforceability of an exculpatory agreement, a court should consider the totality of the circumstances and weigh these non-exclusive factors: (1) relative bargaining power of the parties; (2) clarity of the exculpatory language, which should be clear, unambiguous, and unmistakable about what the party who signs the agreement is giving up; and (3) public policy and public interest implications. We hold that the exculpatory provisions in the agreement between the medical transportation company and the patient are unenforceable based on the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the overly broad and unclear language of the agreement, and the important public interest implicated by the agreement. Thus, the exculpatory language in the agreement does not, as a matter of law, bar the patient's claim. We vacate the judgment of the trial court, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Frederick Copeland was a patient at HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital North Memphis (HealthSouth or the hospital) after having knee replacement surgery. On December 2, 2014, Mr. Copeland had an appointment to see his orthopedic surgeon. The hospital had contracted with MedicOne Medical Response Delta Region, Inc. (MedicOne), a medical transportation company, to provide transportation services for its patients, including Mr. Copeland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the day of Mr. Copeland's appointment at his orthopedic surgeon's office, a\n   MedicOne employee driving a wheelchair van\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   arrived at the hospital to take Mr. Copeland to and from the appointment. After the driver pushed Mr. Copeland in a wheelchair from his room to the entrance of the hospital, Mr. Copeland got out of the wheelchair, walked to the van using a walker, and climbed into the front passenger seat. Before leaving HealthSouth, the MedicOne driver gave Mr. Copeland a pre-printed two-sided document that contained on one side a Wheelchair Van/Transportation Run Report (Run Report) and on the other side a Wheelchair Van Transportation Agreement (Agreement). The Run Report provided that HealthSouth was responsible for MedicOne's charges. The Agreement consisted of nine single-spaced paragraphs, including three paragraphs of exculpatory language. The exculpatory language provided that Mr. Copeland was releasing MedicOne from any and all claims arising from or in any way associated with any transportation services provided by MedicOne. After Mr. Copeland signed the Run Report and the Agreement, the MedicOne driver took him to his doctor's appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the appointment, the MedicOne driver returned to the doctor's office to take Mr. Copeland back to the hospital. As Mr. Copeland was getting into the van, he lost his footing on the running board, fell, and was injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Copeland sued MedicOne for negligence in the Shelby County Circuit Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   MedicOne moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment based on the exculpatory language in the Agreement. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of MedicOne.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court found that the Agreement was not a contract of adhesion and that the services provided by MedicOne were not professional services, but merely transportation services, and so, the exculpatory provisions were enforceable. The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the case involved non-professional transportation services and presented no significant public interest considerations.\n   <em>\n    Copeland v.

The totality of the facts and circumstances of each case will dictate the applicability of and the weight to be given to each of these factors. The factors need not be weighed equally in any given case - rather, the analysis should involve balancing each of these considerations given the facts and circumstances surrounding the formation of the agreement.

Mr. Copeland was a seventy-seven-year-old hospital patient recovering from knee replacement surgery who needed to go to a follow-up appointment at his doctor's office. Mr. Copeland did not select, hire, or pay MedicOne. Instead, the hospital where Mr. Copeland was a patient arranged for his transportation with MedicOne. The MedicOne driver presented Mr. Copeland with a pre-printed, two-sided document containing two different forms - the Run Report and the Agreement - which Mr. Copeland had limited time to review and sign before being transported to his doctor's appointment. The Agreement consisted of nine single-spaced paragraphs, including three paragraphs of exculpatory language. The MedicOne driver spent only nineteen minutes at the hospital, which began with his arrival, and included going to Mr. Copeland's room, pushing Mr. Copeland in a wheelchair to the hospital entrance, getting him into the van, loading his walker into the back of the van, and having Mr. Copeland review and sign the two forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The MedicOne driver presented the Agreement to Mr. Copeland on a take-it-or-leave-it basis with the expectation that he would sign it. The driver did not understand the implications of the Agreement, could not have explained it if asked, had no authority to alter it, and would not have transported Mr. Copeland to his appointment if he had not signed the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mr. Copeland had a practical necessity to get to his medical appointment. He had the difficult choice of signing the Agreement or delaying or forgoing his medical care that day. Mr. Copeland's situation was analogous to the difficult choice presented to the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Wofford v. M.J. Edwards &amp; Sons Funeral Home, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797806\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/800/\">\n    490 S.W.3d 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. Ct. App. 2015). There, a funeral home presented the plaintiff with a contract for funeral services after her father's body had been embalmed. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Buraczynski v. Eyring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10007618\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/919/314/\">\n    919 S.W.2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. 1996), the\n   <em>\n    Wofford\n   </em>\n   court ruled that the arbitration clause in the contract was unenforceable because it was a contract of adhesion, offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, and the plaintiff's failure to sign the agreement would have interrupted the rendition of services and caused delay, resulting in a \"difficult choice.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797806\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/800/\">\n    490 S.W.3d at 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Recognizing that the\n   <em>\n    Buraczynski\n   </em>\n   analysis rests on the critical finding of a unique relationship built on trust (such as the doctor-patient relationship in\n   <em>\n    Buraczynski\n   </em>\n   ), the\n   <em>\n    Wofford\n   </em>\n   court found that the plaintiff had no realistic choice other than to sign the contract, and that asking her to stop the funeral services at that point would be like asking her \"to swap horses midstream.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797806\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/800/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797806\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/800/\">\n    at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Copeland may not have had a preexisting relationship with MedicOne that was \"unique and built on trust,\" but he did have a hospital-patient relationship with HealthSouth, the entity that had arranged for his transportation by MedicOne. Mr. Copeland also faced the same kind of difficult choice - refusing to sign the Agreement, offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis that would have potentially interrupted and caused a delay in his medical care by requiring him to reschedule his appointment or, as the Court of Appeals suggested, calling a taxi. In our view, asking Mr. Copeland to make such a choice would be like asking him to \"swap horses in midstream.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797806\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/800/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is ample evidence in the record of relative disparity in the parties' bargaining power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We now turn to the second factor - the clarity of the Agreement's exculpatory language. Much of the exculpatory language appears in bold print and all capital letters. Even so, although portions of paragraphs three and four purport to limit the exculpatory language in those paragraphs to simple negligence by expressly excluding gross negligence and willful misconduct, this limiting language begins by stating, \"WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING....\" The \"foregoing\" in paragraph three reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Client does hereby release and forever discharge MedicOne... from any and all claims, suits, rights, interests, demands, actions, causes of action, liabilities, accident, injury (including death), costs, fees, expenses and any and all other damages or losses of any kind whatsoever, whether to person or property ... arising out of, incidental to, associated with, or in any way related to any transportation services provided to Client by MedicOne.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Similarly, the \"foregoing\" in paragraph four reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   CLIENT WILL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS MEDICONE RELATED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ASSERTED BY CLIENT, ANY PERSON OR ENTITY RELATED TO CLIENT OR ASSERTING A CLAIM BY OR THROUGH CLIENT, OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTIES OR ENTITIES WHICH, IN ANY WAY, ARISE OUT OF, ARE INCIDENTAL TO, ASSOCIATED WITH, OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO ANY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES PROVIDED TO CLIENT BY MEDICONE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Paragraph six contains no limitation for claims of gross negligence or willful misconduct, but purports to release MedicOne from \"any liability, damage or expense arising out of any claim in any way associated with or relating to any transportation services provided to Client by MedicOne.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Courts in many jurisdictions, including Tennessee, have found such unlimited language to be so overly broad as to render the provisions unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11888495\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/958/773/#p777\">\n    958 S.W.2d at 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding release \"from any and all liability claims, demands, actions or causes of action whatsoever, arising out of or any injury, illness loss or damage including death relating to participation in these events\" unenforceable because it would \"extend its exculpation to unbounded limits\");\n   <em>\n    Fisher v.

Although the Agreement also contains a severability clause,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   the three paragraphs containing broad, all-encompassing exculpatory language combined with the severability paragraph do not make it clear and unmistakable what Mr. Copeland was giving up by signing the Agreement, especially during the limited time he was given to read and comprehend the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, we turn to the third factor - public policy and public interest implications. Mr. Copeland's appointment with his doctor was a medical necessity. That practical necessity distinguishes this case from those involving purely voluntary or recreational activities, which generally do not affect the public interest or raise public policy concerns.\n   <em>\n    Maxwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092682\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/404/469/#p474\">\n    404 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   475 ;\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8909149\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/174/730/#p732\">\n    174 S.W.3d at 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although public policy and the public interest are difficult concepts to define, some relationships require greater responsibility of one of the parties.\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9939689\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/558/429/\">\n    558 S.W.2d at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . MedicOne was in a position of greater responsibility when it undertook to transport Mr. Copeland to and from his doctor's office. Mr. Copeland had limited time to read and comprehend the overly broad and ambiguous Agreement and the Run Report. Under these circumstances, it is not reasonable to conclude that Mr. Copeland could have just called a taxi or rescheduled his appointment. Our public policy protects patients and clients of professionals, residential tenants, employees, bank customers, and homebuyers from exculpatory provisions. It only makes sense that our public policy should also protect a hospital patient under the circumstances faced by Mr. Copeland when he signed the Agreement. Based on the circumstances of the parties, including contemporary societal expectations, we conclude that enforcement of the Agreement against a member of the public in Mr. Copeland's position would be contrary to the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In sum, after considering the totality of the circumstances and weighing the inequality\n   in the relative bargaining power of the parties, the lack of clarity of the exculpatory language, and the public policy and public interest implications, we hold that, as a matter of law, the exculpatory provisions in the Agreement signed by Mr. Copeland are unenforceable and do not bar his claim against MedicOne. We vacate the judgment of the trial court, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We tax the costs of this appeal to MedicOne Medical Response Delta Region, Inc., for which execution may issue if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The MedicOne wheelchair van had no seats in the rear compartment, but was equipped with a mechanical wheelchair lift and safety restraints to secure the wheelchair and its occupant after being loaded into the van.

Under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 12.02, if a motion to dismiss based on 12.02(6) is supported by matters outside the pleading and those matters are not excluded by the court, the court treats the motion as one for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    <em>\n     Adams v.

In\n    <em>\n     Stewart\n    </em>\n    , the Court of Appeals applied the\n    <em>\n     Olson\n    </em>\n    analysis, holding that an exculpatory clause in a short-term vacation rental agreement was unenforceable because it affected the public interest and was contrary to public policy.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *6. This Court, in an opinion designated not for publication under Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 4, agreed that an analysis under\n    <em>\n     Olson\n    </em>\n    was appropriate, but reversed and remanded the case to the trial court because the trial court had failed to apply the\n    <em>\n     Olson\n    </em>\n    factors and this Court's application of the\n    <em>\n     Olson\n    </em>\n    factors was hampered by an incomplete record.\n    <em>\n     Stewart v.
