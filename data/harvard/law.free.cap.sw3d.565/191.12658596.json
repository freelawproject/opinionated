On July 12, 2016, Richardson was arraigned and entered his initial plea of not guilty in Cause No. 16SL-CR04006-01. Following Judge Goldman's retirement, Respondent was assigned by administrative order to preside over Cause No. 16SL-CR04006-01 effective November 7, 2016. In July 2017, Respondent set the case for a jury trial to begin on April 2, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 29, 2018, the state filed a superseding indictment in Cause No. 16SL-CR04006-01, charging Richardson with two counts of possession of a controlled substance, \u00a7 195.202, in addition to the charges in the original indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 12, 2018, Richardson waived arraignment and pleaded not guilty to the charges in the superseding indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 16, 2018, Richardson filed an application for change of judge pursuant to Rule 32.07.

Following the plain language of Rule 32.07(b), the \"initial plea\" is the first plea \"in felony and misdemeanor cases.\" By definition, there can be only one \"initial plea\" in a criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Richardson entered the initial plea in his criminal case on July 12, 2016, when he pleaded not guilty. Richardson filed his application for a change of judge on April 16, 2018, more than 600 days after he entered \"the initial plea\" in his criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Like the dissent, Richardson argues he entered an \"initial plea\" to the new charges in the superseding indictment, triggering a second opportunity to file an application for change of judge pursuant to Rule 32.07. Rule 32.07(b), however, expressly refers to \"cases,\" not \"charges.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Rule refers singularly to \"the application\" and requires it to be filed within 10 days of the single \"initial plea\" in the case. Richardson's plea of not guilty to the new\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     charges\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was not \"the initial plea\" in his criminal\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This conclusion is confirmed by the 1993 amendment to Rule 32.07. In addition to shortening the time period for filing an application for change of judge, the amendment eliminated \"arraignment\" as a triggering event for an application for change of judge and replaced it with \"the initial plea.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The clear intent of the amendment was to require the application for change of judge to be filed at the outset of the case to avoid undue delay in the resolution of criminal cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fact Richardson waived arraignment on new charges in a superseding indictment in April 2018 does not negate the fact he previously entered \"the initial plea\" in his criminal case in July 2016. Richardson did not file his application for change of judge within 10 days of \"the initial plea\" in his criminal case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Designation of the Trial Judge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Alternatively, Richardson asserts his motion was timely filed within 10 days of \"the designation of the trial judge.\" Richardson argues the April 12, 2018, arraignment memorandum designated Respondent as the trial judge because it states \"Cause assigned to Division 1 for hearing and determination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The relevant definition of the word \"designate\" is \"to name esp. to a post or function.\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam Webster 3\n    <sup>\n     rd\n    </sup>\n    New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   612 (2002). Therefore, \"the designation\" of the trial judge is completed when the judge is \"named\" or assigned to perform a judicial function in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Respondent was designated as the trial judge in November 2016, when he was first assigned to preside over Richardson's criminal case. Nothing shows Respondent's designation as the trial judge was rescinded. Instead, Respondent continued to preside over the case, conferring with counsel just days prior to the superseding indictment. Further, St. Louis County Local Rule 36.1 provides \"All civil and criminal jury cases will be set for trial by the judge of the division to which the case [is] assigned.\" Respondent was assigned as the trial judge in November 2016 and set the case for a jury trial to begin in April 2018. Richardson's April 2018 application for change of judge was not filed within 10 days of the November 2016 designation of\n   Respondent as the trial judge for Richardson's criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Richardson did not file his application for change of judge within 10 days of \"the initial plea\" or \"the designation of the trial judge.\" Respondent properly denied Richardson's application for change of judge.

Russell, Judge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Respectfully, I dissent. The \"initial plea\" language in Rule 32.07 refers to the first plea to each\n   <em>\n    charge\n   </em>\n   rather than to the case as a whole. A defendant cannot enter a plea to a count for which he has not yet been charged. Accordingly, Richardson's application for change of judge was timely. I would make the preliminary writ permanent and require Respondent, as a result of the later-added charges, to grant Richardson's application for change of judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This Court is to liberally construe Rule 32.07 in favor of the right to disqualify a judge.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

App. 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   I disagree with the principal opinion's interpretation that \"initial plea\" refers only to the case as a whole rather than to the charge itself. The principal opinion emphasizes the language introducing Rule 32.07's subdivision (b), which begins: \"In felony and misdemeanor cases....\" Rule 32.07(b). But the introductory language in Rule 32.07(b) merely indicates the 10-day time limit for filing an application for change of judge applies both to felony cases\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   misdemeanor cases. This is evidenced by the 1993 amendment to Rule 32.07. Prior to the amendment, Rule 32.07 provided two different timelines for filing an application for change of judge, depending on whether the defendant was charged with a misdemeanor or felony offense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    In misdemeanor cases\n   </em>\n   the application must be filed not later than ten days before the date set for trial....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    In felony cases\n   </em>\n   the application must be filed not later than thirty days after arraignment if the trial judge is designated at arraignment....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Rule 32.07(b)-(c) (1982) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The language in this older version of Rule 32.07 clearly provided that \"cases\" signified which of two deadlines the defendant had to meet to file an application based on whether the defendant was charged with a misdemeanor or felony offense. And when the rule was amended, sections (b) and (c) were essentially combined to provide for one 10-day deadline, regardless of the nature of the case: \"In felony\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   misdemeanor cases....\" Rule 32.07(b) (emphasis added). The drafters kept this language as they combined the two subsections with the intention of streamlining the rule's timelines. Nothing\n   in the plain language indicates that this merger was intended to create limiting language. This Court \"interprets its rules by applying the same principles used for interpreting statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Spence v. BNSF Ry. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656576\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/547/769/#p774\">\n    547 S.W.3d 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774 (Mo. banc 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In looking at the evolution of the language of Rule 32.07 with this Court's 1993 amendment and in the context in which the amendment was made, there was no intent to limit a defendant's \"virtually unfettered\" right to a change of judge in a case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   If the drafters of Rule 32.07 intended to limit \"initial plea\" to the first plea occurring in any given case, they could have simply done what the principal opinion has done and placed the language \"in felony and criminal cases\" after the phrase \"initial plea.\" Such a placement would indicate \"initial plea\" referred simply to the first plea occurring in the case as a whole. But this language was not placed after \"initial plea\" and does not have the limiting effect the principal opinion purports to assign to it. Accordingly, I do not agree with the principal opinion's conclusion that \"initial plea\" refers only to the very first plea entered in a criminal case, regardless of what occurs after that very first plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   To ascertain the meaning of \"initial plea,\" a full reading of Rule 32.07 is required. The rule provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (a) Except as provided in Rule 32.06, a change of judge shall be ordered\n   <em>\n    in any criminal proceeding\n   </em>\n   upon the timely filing of a written application therefor by any party. The applicant need not allege or prove any reason for such change. The application need not be verified and may be signed by any party or an attorney for any party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (b) In felony and misdemeanor cases the application must be filed not later than ten days after the initial plea is entered. If the designation of the trial judge occurs more than ten days after the initial plea is entered, the application shall be filed within ten days of the designation of the trial judge or prior to commencement of any proceeding on the record, whichever is earlier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Emphasis added). Simply put, subdivision (a) provides\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   a change of judge shall be ordered - in any criminal proceeding upon a timely application - and subdivision (b) defines when an application for change of judge\n   <em>\n    is timely.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   With no definition of \"criminal proceeding\" in Rule 32.07, the dictionary definition is enlightening. \"Criminal proceeding\" is defined as \"One instituted and conducted for the purpose ... [of] fixing the guilt of a crime already committed and punishing the offender;\" \"some step taken before a court against some person or persons charged with some violation of the criminal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   at 374 (6th ed. 1991).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When new charges are added to an existing case, a new arraignment is necessary and the defendant must enter a plea as to the new charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Sexton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022167\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/929/909/#p918\">\n    929 S.W.2d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918 (Mo. App. 1996) (\"[A] remand to the Circuit Court does not constitute the filing of a new charge\n   <em>\n    requiring appellant to be arraigned and an\n   </em>\n   '\n   <em>\n    initial' plea to be entered to a new charge.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added). If a proceeding may be defined as \"some step taken before a court\" against a criminal defendant, Richardson's required additional\n   arraignment and entering of pleas on the new charges would be considered a new \"proceeding\" within the action as a whole. It follows that the addition of the new charges, which triggers a new, distinct \"proceeding\" under Rule 32.07, would allow a criminal defendant an opportunity to file a timely application for a change of judge within 10 days from that new arraignment and the accompanying new initial plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The critical characteristic is the addition of new charges to the indictment. If the superseding indictment had not added any new charges but, instead, had simply made a mere\n   <em>\n    amendment\n   </em>\n   to the indictment, keeping the charges intact, no further arraignment would be required on the superseding indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In other words, there would be no additional necessary step - no additional necessary criminal proceeding -to continue with the criminal case, and no need for a renewed 10-day window to file an application for a change of judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Indeed, Missouri courts have consistently noted a distinction between a mere amendment to an indictment and the addition of new charges to a case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sexton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022167\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/929/909/#p918\">\n    929 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   918 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10170733\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/396/563/#p566\">\n    396 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   566 ;\n   <em>\n    Bass v.

This Court's rules mirror this distinction, allowing an information to be amended \"at any time before verdict or finding if (a)\n   <em>\n    no additional or different offense is charged,\n   </em>\n   and (b) a defendant's substantial rights are not thereby prejudiced.\" Rule 23.08 (emphasis added).

Richardson's plea to the first set of charges was separate and distinct from his initial plea to the later charges and should be treated as such when applying Rule 32.07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The principal opinion, in effect, may result in prosecutors filing minor charges against a defendant, waiting for the time to file an application for change of judge to expire, and then filing a superseding indictment adding more serious offenses, leaving the defendant with no option to change judge even though the nature of the case may be very different than it was at its outset. In contrast, the State\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   have an opportunity to obtain a change of judge, as it can often dismiss nolle pros and refile a case in the hopes of having a different judge assigned to the case. This imbalance would not be eliminated by this dissent's interpretation of Rule 32.07, but would, at the very least, offer more assurance to defendants of their ability to exercise their right to change of judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The principal opinion perpetuates an unlevel playing field in favor of the State as the State will continue to have the right to a change of judge by nolle prossing the charges while the defendant's hands are tied when new charges are filed. Allowing a defendant to seek a change of judge after new charges are filed will level the playing field, as that opportunity is already available to the State. It would promote fairness to litigants, one of the core purposes of Rule 32.07. For these reasons, I believe \"initial plea\" cannot be limited to the very first plea in each criminal case, regardless of subsequent events, as the \"initial plea\" refers to the first plea as to each count with which the defendant is charged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As such, a new 10-day window was created for filing an application for change of judge upon the filing of the superseding indictment with the new charges, which required further necessary proceedings in the form of a new arraignment. Richardson's application, filed four days after his initial plea on the new charges, was well within this requisite timeframe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   When the judge fails to grant a timely filed application for change of judge, prohibition is the proper remedy.\n   <em>\n    Raack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9990731\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/720/941/#p943\">\n    720 S.W.2d at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The filing of a timely application for change of judge deprives the court of further authority to do anything in the case other than grant the application.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The right is \"unfettered\" only if it attaches in the first place. Because Richardson did not file his application for change of judge within 10 days of his initial plea in the criminal case, he has no \"unfettered\" right to a change of judge pursuant Rule 32.07(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    \"When interpreting a statute, the primary goal is to give effect to legislative intent as reflected in the plain language of the statute.\"\n    <em>\n     Stiers v.
