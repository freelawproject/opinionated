Because we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by sustaining Kindred's objection, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Roger J. Young, Roger Jackson's father and Misty Jackson's father-in-law, was 79 years old when he was admitted to Kindred-a long-term care facility-in January 2015. Young stayed at Kindred for a few months before being transferred to Plaza Hospital for critical care. Young died six days later on April 16, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Jacksons assert that while Young was at Kindred, he received insufficient monitoring from Kindred's nursing and medical staff and that Kindred's staff failed to adequately treat and report changes in his medical condition, which caused his death. Specifically, the Jacksons contend that during Young's stay at Kindred, he developed several pressure ulcers and abscesses on his scrotum and lower back\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the Jacksons contend caused him to develop sepsis, septic shock, and metabolic encephalopathy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Jacksons filed a healthcare liability claim (HCLC) against Kindred and Dr. Muhammad Naveed Siddiqi-Young's treating physician-and timely served both with separate expert reports from Dr. Manuel Eskildsen.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2074.351\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 74.001(a)(13), .351(a) (West 2017). Kindred and Dr. Siddiqi filed objections to the expert reports. After granting Kindred's objections and allowing the Jacksons to cure the deficiencies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2074.351\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 74.351(c), the Jacksons served amended expert reports. Kindred again filed objections, and the trial court sustained Kindred's objections and dismissed Kindred from the lawsuit; but the trial court ordered that the Jacksons' lawsuit against Dr. Siddiqi could proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Siddiqi then filed a motion for leave to designate Kindred as a responsible third party. The Jacksons filed a response and motion to reconsider the order dismissing Kindred. After the trial court denied the Jacksons' motion to reconsider and granted Dr. Siddiqi's motion, the trial court granted the Jacksons' motion to sever and rendered final judgment in favor of Kindred. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the Jacksons raise two issues: First, that the trial court abused its discretion by sustaining Kindred's objection\n   to Dr. Eskildsen's expert report, and second, that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The gravamen of Kindred's response is that the predicate factual statements in Dr. Eskildsen's report addressing Dr. Siddiqi's actions (the Siddiqi Report) as compared to the factual statements in the Kindred Report \"seemingly concede[ ] the [Kindred] nursing staff did, in fact, do what they were supposed to do.\" Kindred argues that while \"[s]tanding alone,\" the factual statements in the Kindred Report \"might be sufficient,\" \"Dr. Eskildsen's own report as to Dr. Siddiqi, as well as underlying facts, indicate otherwise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   But in an HCLC expert-report challenge, a trial court's job is to be a gatekeeper-not to determine the truth or falsity of an expert's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mettauer v.

Properly documented skin assessment would allow the staff to assay any improvement in his affected areas of skin;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 that Kindred assess Young's condition and continue to change his treatment on ongoing bases until signs of healing occurred;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 that Kindred clearly document its monitoring, assessing, and treating of Young's infection in the medical record;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 that Kindred evaluate and closely monitor Young's skin for any signs and symptoms of infection and implement interventions to address risks of further infection;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 that Kindred develop plans of care documenting the implemented interventions designed to minimize any infection;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 that the facility properly treat any infections that Young had upon admission or developed during his residency at the facility by following all physician orders and evaluating the outcome of those orders;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 that the facility treat any infection with the appropriate antibiotics as ordered by the physician, monitor the infection to determine if the treatment plan was successfully treating the infection, obtain laboratory testing of the infection to determine the effectiveness of the treatments, and continually monitor Young until all laboratory testing confirmed that the infection was fully treated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 that the staff monitor Young's vital signs during each shift until all of his infection symptoms had resolved and the antibiotic treatment plan was completed; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 that the facility perform continuing assessments of Young, including an evaluation by a physician to establish a baseline, clearly document in the medical record a specific diagnosis of the infection, develop and document a treatment and care plan to address the infection, document a list of medications prescribed to treat the infection, develop a plan to reassess the condition with a specific timetable, and document any additional treatment notes or requirements needed to address the specific condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Kindred Report identified two ways that Kindred breached the standard of care and then provided numerous specific examples under each heading. Dr. Eskildsen also broadly stated the two identified breaches:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Kindred failed to ensure Mr. Young received the necessary medical care and treatment to maintain his skin integrity and failed to ensure that the signs and symptoms of infection and abscess exhibited by Mr. Young were assessed by his physician[; and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   ... Kindred failed to timely and properly treat Mr. Young's infection prior to the infection progressing to him going into septic shock and developing endocarditis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Under the first alleged breach, Dr. Eskildsen further elaborated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 Kindred did not write new orders after Young developed an abrasion and drainage on his penis;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 Young had a scrotal excoriation and abscess, which Kindred left uncovered and untreated; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 Kindred did not order antibiotics to treat Young's urinary tract infection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Regarding the second alleged breach, Dr. Eskildsen asserted more specifically that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   there continued to be no attempt by Kindred's nurses and clinical staff to address [Young's] scrotal abscess. Kindred's nurses did not make any documentation or any attempts to notify the attending physician that Mr. Young needed skin and scrotal assessment and at the very least, further orders and diagnostic testing to rule out his abscess as the causative factor causing his change of condition and infection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In its appellate brief, Kindred acknowledges that \"[s]tanding alone\" Dr. Eskildsen's identified breaches of the standards of care \"might be sufficient,\" but that \"Dr. Eskildsen's own report [as] to Dr. Siddiqi, as well as underlying facts, indicate otherwise.\" If indeed the Kindred Report is sufficient \"[s]tanding alone,\" then it is sufficient pursuant to section 74.351.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained above, it is an abuse of discretion for a trial court or a reviewing court to act as a factfinder and look beyond the four corners of the expert report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810110\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/485/236/#p242\">\n    485 S.W.3d at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting defendant's invitation to look \"beyond the four corners of the report and consider extrinsic evidence, or at the very least the actual records [the expert] relied on, to determine if his opinion is worthy of credence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Kindred also asserts that the Kindred Report does not provide standards of care related to Young's specific injuries because Dr. Eskildsen does not provide a standard of care for wound care \"despite his criticisms [that] the staff failed to properly cover the scrotal wound, which Dr. Eskildsen opines led to infection.\" The Jacksons argue that such a level of specificity is not required by section 74.351.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We agree with Kindred's observation that the standard for wound care recited by Dr. Eskildsen is not extremely detailed. For example, Dr. Eskildsen generally states that Kindred was required to \"properly treat\" any infections that Young had upon admission or that may have developed during his stay at Kindred. Likewise, Dr. Eskildsen alleges that Kindred was required to administer \"appropriate\" antibiotics as ordered by the physician, \"monitor the infection,\" and \"determine if the treatment plan was successfully treating the infection.\" However, \"[a] 'fair summary' of the standard of care is 'something less than a full statement of the applicable standard of care and how it was breached.' \"\n   <em>\n    Fagadau v.

Specifically, the nurses' failure to properly treat his abscessed wound, which did not heal, thus allowing a mode of transmission for the bacteria to proliferate and spread the infection in Mr. Young's body. His endocarditis was caused by sepsis. The onset of sepsis occurs only after an infection. Between January 29, 2015 and April 10, 2015, Mr. Young developed a serious infection that showed symptoms of infection by delivering pus from his scrotum which had created an abscess. This is further confirmed by blood cultures that confirmed Mr. Young had Enterococcus faecalis bacteria, which are found in wound infections and is a cause of endocarditis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Had Kindred properly monitored and assessed Mr. Young during this period of time, clinical findings would have indicated signs and symptoms of an ongoing infection process. Specifically, had the nurses informed Mr. Young's attending physician of the changes to his condition, and his abnormal lab results in a timely\n   manner, this would have provided a window of opportunity in which assessment and treatment could have, and based on reasonable medical probability would have, been implemented before sepsis developed. Thus, had Kindred properly evaluated, assessed, and monitored Mr. Young from January 29, 2015 through April 10, 2015, Mr. Young would have received treatment for his infection. Unfortunately, these opportunities were missed due to Kindred's failure to ensure he was timely assessed and treated. As a direct result of not identifying and receiving timely treatment for his infection, Mr. Young developed bacterial endocarditis as a result of infection in his blood (sepsis), had an acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock resulting in his untimely death on April 16, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Similar to Kindred's assertions regarding the standard of care and breach, its assertions concerning causation center on Kindred's belief that Dr. Eskildsen's statements are \"contradicted by the facts and Dr. Eskildsen's own report\" as to Dr. Siddiqi. And just as we explained in those instances, it is not proper for the trial court or a reviewing court to act as a factfinder by going outside of the four corners of the expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The allegations within the four corners of the Kindred Report provided fair notice to Kindred of the Jacksons' allegations that Kindred's staff's failure to assess, monitor, and treat Young's infection and failure to notify the attending physician of Young's changed condition and abnormal lab results, caused sepsis, leading to endocarditis, an acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, and Young's death. Accordingly, we hold that the Kindred Report satisfied section 74.351 's requirement of providing Kindred with fair notice of its specific breaches of the applicable standards of care and how those breaches were linked to Young's injuries and death.\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   , 387 S.W.3d at 923 (rejecting appellants' contention that the expert's \"opinion on causation is insufficient because it conflicts with matters contained in other expert reports and the facts in the case\" because \"[t]he inquiry at the report stage focuses on whether the information within the four corners of the report meets the good faith requirement of the statute\" and \"[i]f the facts do not support a plaintiff's claim, summary judgment procedures provide a remedy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Thus, in limiting our review to the allegations in the four corners of the Kindred Report, we hold that the report satisfied the fair-notice requirements of section 74.351 and that the trial court abused its discretion by sustaining Kindred's objection.

Indeed, Dr. Eskildsen relied upon some of Kindred's notes in compiling the Kindred Report. But the Kindred Report also alleges that Kindred's staff was deficient by failing to document the extent and increasing severity of Young's skin infection, failing to properly examine Young, failing to try different treatments when one treatment plan did not lead to improvement, failing to properly monitor Young after noting his skin infection, failing to notify the attending physician of Young's worsening condition and abnormal lab results, and failing to follow up with the attending physician after noting the onset of Young's skin infection.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    We recognize that when a plaintiff sues multiple defendants for an HCLC, as in this case, the plaintiff may need to file multiple expert reports, in which case courts may read the reports together for certain purposes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abilene Reg'l Med.
