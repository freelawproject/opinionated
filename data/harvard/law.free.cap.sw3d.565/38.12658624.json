CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.014(a)(6) (West Supp. 2016). D Magazine raises three issues in this Court, arguing the trial court should have granted summary judgment dismissing Reyes's claims for defamation per quod, negligence, gross negligence, and conspiracy. In two issues, DSO contends the trial court erroneously denied its motion for summary judgment on Reyes's claims for conspiracy and tortious interference with his employment relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We dismiss DSO's appeal of Reyes's claim for tortious interference with employment\n   for lack of jurisdiction. We reverse the trial court's orders denying appellants' motions for summary judgment on Reyes's claims for defamation per quod, negligence, gross negligence, and conspiracy to defame Reyes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2013, Jose Reyes worked for Bank of America and enjoyed volunteering for a number of civic enterprises, including DSO. Reyes was a member of the Vivaldi Patron Circle of the DSO, and he served the DSO in a number of capacities over approximately a ten-year period. However, some number of people associated with DSO developed issues with Reyes, and DSO received complaints about him from other volunteers and sponsors. On July 9, 2013, Jenny Shephard, vice president of development at DSO, called Reyes and terminated his position as a volunteer. She gave two reasons: Reyes's overstepping his boundaries in dealing with the press and his attending parties to which he was not invited. Reyes steadfastly denied both charges. Jonathan Martin, the DSO's president and CEO, approved the discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A little after three o'clock on the morning of July 10th, Reyes emailed Martin from his computer at Bank of America. In this email (the Martin Email), Reyes referred to his lengthy service on behalf of DSO, stating that he had raised thousands of dollars for the organization over the years. Reyes reminded Martin that Bank of America was a major donor of DSO, and he stressed that \"[w]e take our volunteer service, community involvement, and non-profit support of organizations very seriously here at Bank of America.\" Reyes went on to inform Martin of Shephard's call, saying he was \"shocked and highly offended\" by her comments, and Reyes warned that he would not \"go quietly.\" Reyes asked for Shephard to be replaced and for his ouster to be reversed; he demanded a written apology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Later that same day, Reyes's termination was made public when Chris Shull, DSO's manager of public relations, sent the following message to eighteen media outlets and sponsors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The Dallas Symphony Orchestra would like to inform its sponsors and media partners that as of July 9, 2013 Jose Reyes is no longer affiliated as a volunteer with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra or with any of its volunteer organizations and/or organizing committees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   One recipient was D Magazine, which printed the message on its blog that afternoon. D Magazine also began to follow up on the story; a reporter, Jeanne Prejean, began looking into the reason why DSO had terminated Reyes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Later that day, Kerri Cleghorn Lai-DSO's director of institutional giving-forwarded the Martin Email to Gillian Breidenbach, who served as a DSO contact at Bank of America. Breidenbach then forwarded the Martin Email to Scott Prince, Reyes's supervisor at the bank. She also told Prince that D Magazine was planning to write a story about Reyes. The bank initiated an investigation, and at some point Reyes was placed on administrative leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prejean continued working on her story for D Magazine. On July 16th, she interviewed Reyes. The following day, Bank of America terminated Reyes's employment, stating the Martin Email violated company policy. The Prejean article was published in September 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Reyes sued D Magazine and DSO. The defendants both filed motions for summary judgment, which were granted in part and denied in part. They appeal all grounds of the motions that were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    THE MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   D Magazine filed a motion for summary judgment on both traditional and no-evidence grounds. The trial court granted the motion on Reyes's claims for defamation per se, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and tortious interference with prospective business relationships. This appeal addresses the claims on which the trial court denied summary judgment: defamation per quod, negligence and gross negligence, and conspiracy to defame.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to Reyes's surviving defamation claim, D Magazine argued in its motion that (1) the statements on which Reyes's claim was premised were true or were non-actionable statements of opinion and, therefore, were incapable of defamatory meaning; (2) the statements were not made negligently; and (3) Reyes had suffered no damages from publication of the statements. The magazine argued further that Reyes's negligence and gross negligence claims should be dismissed because they were based on the same facts as the defamation claim. And the conspiracy claim, according to D Magazine's motion, must fail for lack of a substantive tortious act as well as a meeting of the minds between D Magazine and DSO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   DSO also filed a traditional and no-evidence summary judgment motion. The trial court granted DSO's motion on Reyes's claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation per se, defamation per quod, negligence, and tortious interference with prospective business relationships. DSO appeals the denial of its motion on grounds of conspiracy to defame Reyes and tortious interference with Reyes's employment relationship with Bank of America. According to DSO's motion, Reyes's conspiracy claim fails for lack of evidence that DSO conspired with D Magazine to publish any defamatory statements or otherwise commit any tortious conduct. And Reyes's interference-with-contract claim fails because: (i) Bank of America terminated his employment solely due to his poor employment history and various policy violations, and (ii) Reyes has no evidence that the DSO willfully or intentionally interfered with that relationship or caused Bank of America to fire him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We apply well-known standards in our review of traditional and no-evidence summary judgment motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Timpte Indus., Inc. v.

It is undisputed that the statements were published by D Magazine. Our first task, therefore, is to determine-as a matter of law-whether these statements are reasonably capable of a defamatory meaning from the perspective of an ordinary reader in light of the surrounding circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hancock v.

D Magazine responds that the elements of the headline are no more than unverifiable opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To determine whether a statement is fact or opinion, we focuses our analysis on the statement's verifiability and the entire context in which it was made.\n   <em>\n    Bentley v.

Employing that standard, we agree with D Magazine that a reference to meager means is a subjective opinion, given that an income one person views as meager may be substantial to another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Accordingly, the description is not capable of a defamatory meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As to the remainder of the headline-assertions that Reyes had a mysterious past and that he duped Dallas society-we conclude the headline writer was employing rhetorical hyperbole, an exaggeration employed for rhetorical effect.\n   <em>\n    Backes v.

Although the Article appears to chastise Reyes for describing his work in a call center as \"marketing,\" to move from that characterization to descriptions of mysteries and trickery can only be seen as extravagant exaggeration. And that kind of rhetorical flourish is not actionable as defamation.\n   <em>\n    Backes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802040\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/486/7/#p26\">\n    486 S.W.3d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We acknowledge that the headline and many other statements within the Article could be interpreted as criticism of Reyes, and they undoubtedly hurt his feelings. However, to the extent the statements amount to opinions that Reyes did not \"fit\" within Dallas society, they are not actionable. \"[A] communication that is merely unflattering, abusive, annoying, irksome, or embarrassing, or that only hurts the plaintiff's feelings, is not actionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Better Bus.

Whether we accept Reyes's definition or accept his admission that the term may have many meanings, we must conclude that the caption merely expresses an opinion about him. Different people may consider the term positive or pejorative based upon their own preferences for social activity. Again, when a statement represents a personal judgment that \"rests solely in the\n   eye of the beholder,\" it is not actionable as defamation.\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094845\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/394/646/#p659\">\n    394 S.W.3d at 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) \"It seemed strange that so many people on the party circuit knew him, but none could say where he'd come from or what, precisely, he did for a living.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Reyes argues that this statement-that it was somehow \"strange\" that others involved with the DSO did not know his origins or his precise occupation-suggested \"something undesirable or objectionable\" about him. He objects further to the notion that his employment was of consequence to his volunteer work for the DSO. Matters of background and employment, he argues, should not impact his volunteer efforts. But this statement is not about verifiable qualifications to volunteer with the DSO. Instead, it is an opinion that Reyes lacked a well-known pedigree among those with whom he was socializing. Again, the question raised is whether Reyes \"fit\" on that \"party circuit.\" The author's statement that it was unusual or \"strange\" for Reyes to travel on the circuit without such a pedigree is mere opinion.

Moreover, the language of \"crashing\" parties and \"blustering\" into photos certainly includes some rhetorical flourish. But the significant underlying premise here, and through much of the Article, is that Reyes was not welcome. That is an opinion, not a verifiable fact. Indeed, even in the circumstance where Reyes produced an invitation to a particular event he had attended, summary judgment evidence indicated that others associated with the DSO were unhappy-even \"incensed\"-at his presence. It is undisputed that complaints of this type were made within the DSO, and in context the Article was reporting that fact, not that the complaints were valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We conclude this statement, when viewed in context as an ordinary person would, is not capable of defamatory content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    (5) \"For AT &amp; T and then, later for Bank of America, he worked in a call center. Entry level for such a position would pay about $30,000 per year, making a $500 ticket a real sacrifice. Reyes did pay to get into some events, including the recent Young Friends spring party sponsored by the Ronald McDonald House of Dallas. And awhile back, he bought a ticket to the Art Ball, the annual Dallas Museum of Art fundraiser.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Reyes contends this statement demeans his position with Bank of America\n   because it suggests he was an \"entry level\" employee. He also argues the statement that he \"did pay to get into some events\" implies he improperly attended others for which he did not pay. Reyes explained in his deposition that by paying to become a member of the Symphony's Vivaldi Circle, he actually was a sponsor of certain events and could attend without further payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We understand each of the statements in this portion of the opinion to be statements of fact, but Reyes offers no evidence to prove they are false. Instead he argues that the remark leads to inferences that are demeaning concerning his position, income, and attendance at events. We are not persuaded that an ordinary reader would have found these statements demeaning. Likewise an ordinary reader would not have understood the remark that identified events for which Reyes had purchased tickets to accuse him of any improper conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    (6) \"An organizer who worked on the reservation committee recalls that Reyes bought the least-expensive ticket and then stood at the front door greeting guests, as if to 'appear that he was a huge sponsor.' \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    (7) \"More than once, Reyes was portrayed as having a grander role in these events than he actually had.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We address these statements together because they amount to the same substantive remark: sources associated with the DSO told the author that Reyes behaved in a manner that exaggerated his importance to the organization. The statements are unquestionably the opinions of those DSO associates concerning whether Reyes was playing out his social role properly. While potentially embarrassing, these statements of opinion are not actionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    John Moore Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6909111\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/345/#p356\">\n    441 S.W.3d at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinions that are merely abusive or embarrassing are not actionable).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    (8) \"As for the photo ops, Reyes'[s] efforts to have himself pictured with big names became problematic.

It just got pathetic.' \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    (9) \"This past spring, for instance, Reyes rushed up to one event photographer and said breathlessly, 'Come over here. Peggy Sewell wants to have her picture taken with me.' \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    (10) \"Eventually, PR people were told not to release photos to the media that had Reyes in them. One media type says she grew 'weary from people calling in, asking us not to run their picture ... when [Reyes] huddled up next to them.' \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   These three statements describe the same perception: DSO associates preferred not to have their picture taken and released with Reyes, and they disapproved of his repeated efforts to be included in those photos. Once again, it was the opinion of these associates that Reyes was unworthy to be included in group photographs of DSO events. We need not approve of the opinions to determine they are not actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    (11) \"Still, most non-profits were not inclined to sever ties with someone who offered free help and donations that in some cases were matched by his employer.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Reyes pleaded that this statement suggested he \"was only allowed to volunteer so that the charity could take advantage of his employer's generosity.\" In deposition testimony he acknowledged that the facts included within the statement are true as to him, but he argued the statement was not necessarily true of all nonprofit organizations. We conclude the\n   statement is fact-based, rather than opinion, but Reyes failed to bring forward evidence that it was false. Accordingly, the statement is not defamatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    (12) \"But while Reyes was scoring points with them, the jig was just about up at the DS[A]. A highly placed source within the organization says Reyes crossed the line on two sensitive fronts. First, one of Jaap van Zweden's family made a formal complaint about Reyes. A member of the DS[A]'s elite Elan Circle agreed to check with others regarding their feelings about Reyes. Yes, they, too, had grown tired of his 'lurking and hanging around.' \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Initially, Reyes contends the statement's references to the \"jig [being] up,\" to \"cross[ing] the line,\" and to \"lurking and hanging around\" indicate he \"was engaging in illegal or nefarious conduct.\" As we have stated, we lack jurisdiction in this case to evaluate whether a statement accuses Reyes of illegal conduct. That issue was decided against him when the trial court granted summary judgment to both defendants on defamation per se grounds, and Reyes has no right to appeal that decision as an interlocutory matter. As to the remainder of the statement, the article is reporting (1) an undisputed fact (that Reyes had been the subject of a complaint by Anna-Sophia van Zweden) and (2) the opinions of some members of the Elan Circle that they had grown tired of Reyes's presence at DSO events. Neither can form the basis of a successful defamation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    (13) \"One person in the crowd stuck out: Jose Reyes. No one claimed to have invited him, and one key DS[A] sponsor was incensed by his presence.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This statement appears in the article's discussion of the DSO's 2013 Gala Launch Party, which is described as an invitation-only affair held at the private estate of symphony supporters. Prejean testified she was unable to identify anyone who had invited Reyes. Reyes testified he was invited by Tab Boyles, DSO's director of event planning, but Boyles testified he sent Reyes an email identifying details of the party after Reyes called and represented that he had lost his invitation. DSO staff testified that Reyes was not invited and indeed that a representative of an important corporate sponsor had specifically requested that Reyes not be invited. Therefore, we conclude the article's statement that no one claimed to have invited him was in fact true. Likewise, the summary judgment record supports the statement that the corporate representative was annoyed when Reyes showed up at the party when she had specifically requested he be excluded. Because the statement is true, it cannot support a defamation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    (14) \"Asked how things are going with his job at the bank, he replies that everything is fine, that the bank's main concern is how the DS[A] has mistreated him. The next morning, Bank of America fired Reyes.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Reyes concedes that the first sentence of this statement correctly quotes what he told the article's author. Likewise, he acknowledges being fired by the Bank. Reyes's own statement cannot form the basis of his defamation claim. Nor can a true statement of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    (15) Photo caption: \"Balling on a Budget: No one knew Reyes worked at a Bank of America call center. He told people he worked in 'marketing.' \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Although Reyes's summary judgment evidence includes his deposition testimony that he does not recall telling people he was in marketing, he goes on to testify that his call center division at the bank was called Direct Marketing, so that this\n   statement-if he had made it-was true. Once again, the statement could be read by an ordinary reader as critical of Reyes and demeaning to call-center employment. But that criticism is merely the opinion of those who believed Reyes did not belong in their social set; it is not actionable as defamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We conclude that none of Reyes's fifteen statements qualifies as a false statement of verifiable fact. While it is apparent that the Article repeated many personal criticisms of Reyes in a manner that undoubtedly hurt his feelings, we conclude none of these statements can support a defamation claim against D Magazine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Allegedly Defamatory \"Gist\" of the Article\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Reyes pleaded further that-even if none of the individual statements were adjudged defamatory-the article taken as a whole is defamatory. It is true that we construe an allegedly defamatory publication \"as a whole\"; we view the publication in light of the surrounding circumstances, and we attempt to discern how a person of ordinary intelligence would perceive it.\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

Nevertheless, we do not consider a claim that the \"gist\" of an article-rather than specific statements within it-is defamatory unless the publication omits material facts or juxtaposes facts in a misleading way.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11121123\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/38/103/#p114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11121123\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/38/103/#p114\">\n    at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Moreover, if we were to address whether the gist of the Article was defamatory, and we accepted Reyes's own statement of the gist as accurate, we could not come to a different conclusion than we do after addressing each of Reyes's fifteen allegedly defamatory statements individually. Reyes contends that as to the issues in this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   the \"gist\" of the Article was that Jose Reyes was fired as a volunteer by the DSO in a very public way because he was a party-crasher/trespasser, deceived people, blustered his way into photographs and misrepresented his role with charities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We have addressed these allegations individually and determined they are not defamatory; stating them in concert does not change their meaning. Nor do we discern any evidence of missing or \"juxtaposed\" facts that would alter our analysis of the statements if taken together.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11121123\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/38/103/#p114\">\n    38 S.W.3d at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We conclude Reyes has failed to bring forward evidence establishing a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether D Magazine published a defamatory statement about him. As a result, D Magazine was entitled to summary judgment on Reyes's defamation per quod claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We sustain D Magazine's first issue. Because we have concluded that Reyes did not carry his burden to raise a fact issue on the existence of a defamatory statement, we need not address D Magazine's alternative grounds for summary judgment on this claim, namely Reyes's failure to bring forth evidence of a fact issue on the elements of negligence and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    Conspiracy to Defame\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In its second issue, D Magazine challenges the trial court's denial of\n   its motion for summary judgment on Reyes's claim for conspiracy to defame. A civil conspiracy involves a combination of two or more persons to accomplish an unlawful purpose or to accomplish a lawful purpose by unlawful means.\n   <em>\n    Tilton v.

We have now concluded that D Magazine is entitled to judgment on Reyes's defamation per quod claim as well. In the absence of a viable claim for defamation against a named defendant (i.e., either D Magazine or DSO), Reyes's claim for conspiracy to defame must fail.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ernst &amp; Young, L.L.P. v.

The magazine argues Reyes's negligence and gross negligence claims were all based upon the same publication as his defamation claims, so they should have been treated as defamation claims and dismissed. Although we can posit a case in which a plaintiff could properly plead both a defamation and an independent negligence claim, we agree with D Magazine that the negligence claims in this case fail to state an independent theory of recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In fact, Reyes's pleading of his negligence claims does no more than state that D Magazine and DSO were negligent, or grossly negligent, in publishing the defamatory statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather than stating the\n   elements of an independent claim, the pleading sets forth Reyes's contentions as to the negligence element of his defamation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McLemore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11675407\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/978/568/#p571\">\n    978 S.W.2d at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defamation plaintiff must prove defendant was acting with \"negligence, if the plaintiff was a private individual, regarding the truth of the statement\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neely v.

He failed to carry his burden to come forward with evidence of such a separate claim.

As a threshold issue, however, we address Reyes's contention that this Court lacks jurisdiction over DSO's interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Both appellants bring their interlocutory appeals pursuant to the civil practice and remedies code's authorization of an appeal from an order that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   denies a motion for summary judgment that is based in whole or in part upon a claim against or defense by [a] a member of the electronic or print media, acting in such capacity, or [b] a person whose communication appears in or is published by the electronic or print media, arising under the free speech or free press clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Article I, Section 8, of the Texas Constitution, or Chapter 73.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.014(a)(6). Reyes has challenged this Court's jurisdiction over DSO's appeal. He contends his conspiracy and tortious interference claims-and DSO's defenses to those claims-do not arise under free speech or press guarantees but are \"separate from the defamation claim\" and, therefore, do not fall within the scope of section 51.014(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   At the outset, we reject Reyes's argument that his conspiracy to defame claim is \"separate from\" his defamation claim. The conspiracy claim is rooted in the defamation facts and, indeed, can only survive in the presence of a claim for the underlying tort.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10019745\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/925/672/#p681\">\n    925 S.W.2d at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we conclude Reyes's\n   claim for conspiracy to defame is within the scope of section 51.014(a)(6), and we have jurisdiction to address DSO's arguments concerning that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   But DSO contends section 51.014(a)(6) allows interlocutory appeal of all claims decided by the summary judgment order, not merely those implicating rights of free speech and press.

Reyes pleaded that DSO and D Magazine \"engaged in a conspiracy to defame [Reyes] with the defamatory communications.\" Conspiracy to defame is reviewable because it is based, in part, upon the defamation claims Reyes urged against both named defendants.\n   <em>\n    Vice v.

In its first issue, DSO argues that because all of Reyes's claims for defamation against DSO were dismissed by the trial court, there is no underlying tort on which to predicate any conspiracy liability. However, as long as Reyes's claim against D Magazine for defamation per quod survived the magazine's summary judgment motion, there was still an underlying tort for which Reyes seeks to hold one named defendant (i.e., D Magazine) liable. \"[C]ivil conspiracy 'came to be used to extend liability in tort ... beyond the active wrongdoer to those who have merely planned, assisted, or encouraged his acts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hong Kong Dev., Inc. v.

Stated differently, a party may be liable for conspiracy even if it did not commit the underlying tort itself, so long as another named defendant is found liable for the tort. Therefore, so long as Reyes had a claim for defamation, he could urge a conspiracy claim against both defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In the course of this appeal, though, we have concluded that D Magazine was entitled to summary judgment on the final pending defamation claim.

The panel concluded that section 51.014(a)(6) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code did not grant appellate jurisdiction to review all of DSA's grounds for summary judgment that were denied in the interlocutory order but required a claim-by-claim analysis to determine which summary judgment grounds were based on a free-speech claim or defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The panel concluded the denial of summary judgment on Reyes's claim for tortious interference with employment did not pertain to a free-speech claim or defense for which reason this Court lacked jurisdiction for appellate review of the trial court's denial of summary judgment as to that claim. DSA contends (1) the plain meaning of section 51.014(a)(6) grants jurisdiction to review all summary judgment grounds denied in an interlocutory order so long as at least one ground was based on a free-speech claim or defense, (2) the appellate courts in Texas have split over this question, the majority of which have concluded section 51.014(a)(6) grants jurisdiction to review all grounds when at least one denied ground of summary judgment was based on a free-speech claim or defense, and (3) this Court has authority favorable to DSA on this issue.

Therefore, under section 51.014(a)(6) an order denying a motion for summary judgment that in its entirety (\"in whole\") is based on a free-speech claim or defense is subject to appeal, but so is an order denying a motion that does so to some degree (\"in part\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   So subsection (a) does not limit \"may appeal from an interlocutory order\" and subsection (a)(6) authorizes such an appeal if the denied motion for summary judgment was based to some degree on a free-speech claim or defense. A multiple-ground motion for summary judgment that includes one ground based on a free-speech claim or defense is a motion for summary judgment that to some degree (\"in part\") is based on a free-speech claim or defense. Accordingly, the plain meaning of section 51.014(a)(6) authorizes appeal of an interlocutory order that denies a motion for summary judgment so long as at least one ground is based on a free-speech claim or defense.

Nothing in the language of section 51.014(a)(6), however, suggests to us that there is a legislative intent to permit an interlocutory appeal from summary judgment\n   rulings on non-free speech claims and defenses simply because they happen to be included in the same motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312929\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/616/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312929\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/616/\">\n    at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ellipses in original; footnotes omitted).

DSA's reliance, therefore, is on the summary of\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   in the\n   <em>\n    New Times\n   </em>\n   opinion. DSA also argues the\n   <em>\n    New Times\n   </em>\n   opinion resolved the appellate issue without considering any argument based on a free-speech claim or defense. The panel opinion concedes DSA's argument about the basis of the disposition of the appeal in\n   <em>\n    New Times\n   </em>\n   , but the panel opinion distinguishes\n   <em>\n    New Times\n   </em>\n   because the claims that were resolved there did involve free speech raised in another appellate issue so jurisdiction fell within the panel opinion's view of the limited appellate jurisdiction authorized by section 51.014(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Even if the panel is correct about its distinction,\n   <em>\n    New Times\n   </em>\n   clearly did not articulate the panel's view of limited jurisdiction, so the panel cannot and did not rely on\n   <em>\n    New Times\n   </em>\n   for its conclusion. In my view, therefore, the panel opinion is this Court's first expressed conclusion on this important issue of the scope of review under section 51.014(a)(6). Every subsequent panel of this Court-including this dissenting author-will be bound thereby.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Signature Mgmt. Team, LLC v.

On the merits of the jurisdictional issue, I would conclude section 51.014(a)(6) authorizes appeal from an interlocutory order that denies a motion for summary judgment containing at least one ground that is based on a free-speech claim or defense. Because the interlocutory order denying DSA's motion for summary judgment falls within the scope of section 51.014(a)(6), I conclude it was appealable, including the ground that challenged Reyes's claim for tortious interference with employment. I would consider the merits of DSA's appeal from the trial court's denial of its motion for summary judgment challenging that claim rather than dismiss the appeal of that issue for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Bridges, Lang, Whitehill, Schenck, and Boatright, J.J., join this dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The Hon.
