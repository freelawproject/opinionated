Finding that Defendant has failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion or that Defendant was prejudiced as a result, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, we have provided the parties a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed under Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
