The Defendants allege multiple errors occurred at trial involving questioning of the venire panel about issues of law, the admission of irrelevant evidence, the submission of punitive damages, the amount awarded in punitive damages, and the amount awarded for attorneys' fees. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January 2012, Terpstra filed suit against the Defendants. After years of discovery, Terpstra was granted leave to file\n   an amended petition in March 2016. The amended petition alleged in Count One that the Defendants engaged in age discrimination in violation of the Missouri Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\"), section 213.010\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   by failing to promote Terpstra, age 55, to the position of senior claims supervisor at the Jefferson City Regional Claims Center (\"JCRCC\") in August 2010 when two openings existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended petition alleged in Count Two that the Defendants retaliated against Terpstra in violation of the MHRA by prematurely terminating her temporary position as senior claims supervisor in March 2011 after Terpstra filed age discrimination complaints with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights (\"MCHR\") and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Terpstra's claims were tried to a jury beginning in November 2016. Terpstra presented evidence that she was denied two promotions to senior claims supervisor in 2010, and that the Defendants promoted two younger, less qualified persons to the positions. Terpstra presented testimony from other employees, over the Defendants' objection, suggesting that the Defendants engaged in a scheme of promoting younger, less qualified applicants over older, more qualified applicants. Terpstra also presented evidence that three employees who had been promoted to senior claims supervisor were later demoted due to inappropriate email use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The jury found in favor of Terpstra on Count One, and awarded her $20,000 in actual damages against DES and Lambert; $260,000 in punitive damages against DES; and $20,000 in punitive damages against Lambert. The jury found in favor of the Defendants on Count Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Terpstra filed a motion asking the trial court to award reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and post-judgment interest (\"Terpstra's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs\"). Terpstra's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs sought an award of attorneys' fees in the amount of $1,175,248.90; costs and expenses in the amount of $27,200.26; and post-judgment interest at 5.5 percent on the total judgment. Terpstra later amended her request for costs and expenses to $15,000. Terpstra also filed a motion asking the trial court to conform the judgment and to enter judgment against the LIRC on Count One (\"Terpstra's Motion to Conform the Judgment\"). Terpstra's Motion to Conform the Judgment asserted that, because Lambert is an employee of the LIRC, and because DES is a division of the LIRC, the LIRC was legally responsible for the acts of age discrimination attributed by the jury to DES and Lambert on Count One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 5, 2017, the trial court issued its judgment (\"Judgment\") in conformance with the jury's verdicts, and ruling Terpstra's motions. The Judgment found that the jury's finding in favor of Terpstra and against Lambert and DES on Count One, the age discrimination claim, also bound the LIRC. Thus, the Judgment awarded Terpstra actual damages in the amount of $20,000 from the LIRC, DES, and Lambert. The Judgment awarded Terpstra punitive damages in the amount of $20,000 from Lambert, and in the amount of $260,000 from DES, as set forth in the jury's verdicts. The Judgment awarded Terpstra $731,562.30 in reasonable attorneys'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   fees and $15,000 in costs and expenses, from the LIRC, DES, and Lambert. Finally, the Judgment awarded post-judgment interest at 5.75 percent on all amounts awarded to Terpstra.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the entry of Judgment, Defendants DES and Lambert filed a motion titled \"Defendants' Motions and Suggestions in Support of Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict or, in the Alternative for a New Trial, or in the Alternative for an Elimination and/or Reduction in Fee Awards\" (\"Post-Trial Motion\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Post-Trial Motion argued that entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial was required because the trial court erred in admitting testimony from \"me-too\" witnesses about discriminatory statements, actions, or conduct unrelated to the instant action; because Terpstra improperly instructed the venire panel on the law during voir dire; because the trial court erroneously admitted emails which led to the demotion of three employees that were not relevant; and because the trial court's award of attorneys' fees was based on a misapplication of the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Post-Trial Motion alternatively argued that, because the trial court's award of attorneys' fees was based on a misapplication of law, the trial court should eliminate or reduce the attorneys' fees award. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the Post-Trial Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Defendants appeal.

App. E.D. 1986) ). Here, the Defendants contend that the trial court abused its discretion during voir dire on three occasions when it permitted Terpstra's counsel to violate this principle. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, the Defendants complain that Terpstra's counsel was permitted, over the Defendants' objection, to ask whether members of the venire panel believed a person was required to file an internal grievance before filing suit for discrimination. After the Defendants' objection was overruled, Terpstra's counsel briefly explained the process for filing a complaint with the MCHR. The next morning, the Defendants moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the Defendants' motion for a mistrial noting that \"a short explanation of the law, just to clarify the jurors' bias, is appropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, the Defendants do not claim error in the denial of their motion for a mistrial. Instead, they argue that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting Terpstra to discuss the procedure for filing a discrimination lawsuit. This claim of error is not preserved for appellate review. The Post-Trial Motion did not address this aspect of voir dire. The Post-Trial Motion's discussion of voir dire was limited to the contention that Terpstra was erroneously permitted to discuss \"the definition of discrimination and the burden of proof,\" and in so doing, made incorrect statements about the law. [Doc. 94, p. 2] \"Rule 78.07(a) requires\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   allegations of error ... 'to be included in a motion for new trial in order to be preserved for appellate review.' \"\n   <em>\n    Goudeaux v.

App. W.D. 2013) (quoting Rule 78.07(a) ). We will not address a claim of error on appeal that has not been raised in a timely filed post-trial motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7088647\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/409/508/#p514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that the failure to include a claim of error in a motion for new trial preserves nothing for appellate review).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Next, the Defendants complain that Terpstra's counsel was permitted to instruct the venire panel about the law regarding whether and how employers can take age into account when making hiring decisions. The record does not support this assertion. When Terpstra's counsel was addressing whether the venire panel believed an employer could consider age when making hiring decisions, the Defendants objected that Terpstra was asking the venire panel to opine on the ultimate issue to be determined by the jury. The trial court effectively\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     sustained\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   this objection, as it directed Terpstra to rephrase her voir dire questions as to avoid seeking a commitment from the venire panel. The Defendants do not explain how a sustained objection can support a finding of an abuse of discretion, even presuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   that Terpstra's inquiry of the venire panel could be considered instruction on the law. In any event, the objection the Defendants' made at trial was not that Terpstra was instructing the venire panel on the law. \"A 'point on appeal must be based upon the theory voiced in the objection at trial and an appellant cannot expand or change on appeal the objection as made.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kline v. City of Kansas City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321132\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/334/632/#p647\">\n    334 S.W.3d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647 (Mo. App. W.D. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Carroll v. Kelsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8345397\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/234/559/#p563\">\n    234 S.W.3d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563 (Mo. App. W.D. 2007) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After the Defendants' objection was sustained, Terpstra's voir dire continued. The Defendants again objected, and this time asserted not only that Terpstra was seeking a commitment from the venire panel on an ultimate issue, but also that Terpstra was instructing the venire panel on the law. The Defendants also moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the request for a mistrial, but once again effectively sustained the Defendants' objection by advising Terpstra to \"clean up\" the questions of the venire panel. The Defendants do not explain how a sustained objection can support a finding of an abuse of discretion in permitting allegedly improper voir dire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Later, during the Defendants' voir dire, counsel advised the venire panel that it was the Defendants' position that the most qualified person could be hired for a job for any reason, so long as it is not \"because of that person's age, gender, [or] race.\" A member of the venire panel asked for clarification, noting that the day prior, there had been discussion about sole versus contributing factors in making hiring decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants' counsel responded that \"The law says because of their age. You cannot discriminate against someone because of their age.\" Terpstra's counsel objected and, outside the hearing of the jury, complained that the Defendants were misstating the law. The trial court agreed, and advised that references to age as a factor needed to refer to age as a \"contributing factor.\" When the Defendants' voir dire continued, the Defendants responded to the venireperson's request for clarification by stating that age could not be a contributing factor in a hiring decision and that the trial court would later instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. Terpstra did not instruct the venire panel on the law regarding this subject during the Defendants' voir dire. Rather, the Defendants did as instructed by the trial court, rendering the Defendants' discussion of this portion of voir dire irrelevant to the Defendants' point on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, the Defendants complain that Terpstra's counsel improperly instructed the venire panel about the burden of proof. However, it was the Defendants, during their own voir dire, who made the statement that the Defendants did not have the burden of proof. When Terpstra objected, the trial court instructed the venire panel that \"the burden of proof to prove age was a contributing factor to the adverse employment action is on the plaintiff, not the defendant, [which] will be subject to any additional instructions that I will give you later.\" It was thus the trial court, not Terpstra, who addressed (correctly, we observe)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   the subject of the burden of proof with the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The record simply does not support the premise of the Defendants' point on appeal. However, even were we were to conclude (which we do not) that Terpstra improperly discussed the law with the venire panel in any of the aforementioned respects, we would not find reversible error. The Defendants bear the burden of establishing not only an abuse of discretion in permitting voir dire, but that they were prejudiced by the error. At the end of the argument portion of their brief addressing the first point on appeal, the Defendants devote a single sentence to the subject of prejudice, summarily asserting: \"By allowing Terpstra's counsel to explain the law and then shut down the [Defendants'] counsel when she tried to follow up, the trial court gave the impression that Terpstra's counsel was the only one who could explain the law to them.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Appellants' Brief, p. 30]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When viewed in light of the entire record, the Defendants' summary allegation of prejudice is disingenuous and inaccurate. We have already explained that the Defendants' assertion that Terpstra instructed the venire panel on the law is not supported by the record, and that instead, it was the trial court who either addressed legal issues with the venire panel, or advised the parties how to do so. In addition, before voir dire began, the trial court told the venire panel, \"It is my job to instruct you in the law which you are to apply to those facts,\" and cautioned the venire panel not to \"discuss or attempt to research what the law may be in this case.\" Both of those instructions made clear that the trial court, not counsel for the parties, would be providing instruction about the applicable law. Once voir dire was complete and the jury was sworn, the trial court advised the impaneled jury that the instructions provided by the trial court \"will direct you concerning the legal rights and duties of the parties and how the law applies to the facts that you will be called upon to decide.\" These instructions from the trial court collectively demonstrate that the venire panel, and later the jury, was advised to look to the trial court, not the parties, for guidance on the legal principles governing disposition of the case. The Defendants' bare assertion that the trial court gave the impression that Terpstra's counsel was the one who could explain the legal principles governing Terpstra's claims is baseless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, the Defendants have not identified any legal discussion that allegedly occurred during voir dire that was inconsistent with the instructions later given to the jury by the trial court. Those instructions informed the jury of the burden of proof, instructing that \"[t]he party who relies upon any disputed fact has the burden to cause you to believe that such fact is more likely true than not true.\" Those\n   same instructions informed the jury that the standard of causation for Terpstra's claim of age discrimination was that \"Terpstra's age was a contributing factor in her being denied promotion,\" and that the standard of causation for Terpstra's claim of retaliation was that \"[Terpstra's] filing a complaint with the [MCHR] was a contributing factor to her being demoted.\" A comparison of these instructions to the aspects of voir dire about which the Defendants complain on appeal reveals that the venire panel was not misled during voir dire. The Defendants have failed to demonstrate a real probability that they suffered prejudice based on an alleged (but ultimately undemonstrated) assertion that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting Terpstra's counsel to inform the venire panel of the applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Defendants' first point on appeal is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Point Two: Admission of Emails that Resulted in the Demotion of Three Employees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Defendants' second point on appeal argues that the trial court erred in admitting emails that resulted in the demotion of three DES employees who had been previously promoted to the position of senior claims supervisor. The Defendants describe the emails as \"inappropriate\" because they contained \"some obscene language, [and discussions regarding] drinking outside work, and having hangovers at work.\" [Appellants' Brief, pp. 15, 35 n.2] The Defendants assert that the emails were not logically relevant to Terpstra's claim of employment discrimination in August 2010 because they resulted in demotions in September 2012. The Defendants further assert that the emails were not legally relevant because the subject matter of the emails served solely to prejudice the jury against the employees who were demoted and, by extension, the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Despite asserting that \"[t]he trial court improperly admitted e-mail evidence that lacked relevance ... [and] that served only to demonstrate that other employees had, in the past, engaged in prior bad acts that were not at all relevant to Terpstra's claims,\" the Defendants do not indicate where in the record this alleged error was preserved for appellate review. [Appellants' Brief, p. 32] Rule 84.04(e) requires appellants to include in the argument \"a concise statement describing whether the error was preserved for appellate review; if so, how it was preserved; and the applicable standard of review\" for each claim of error. Compliance with Rule 84.04 is mandatory.\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

App. E.D. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Defendants' brief cites to a location in the transcript where they claim to have objected to admission of the emails based on Terpstra's failure to exhaust discovery remedies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This reference in the\n   brief is not cited for the proposition that an objection to logical or legal relevance was preserved at trial. Our independent review of the cited objection, located at Vol. 9, pp. 127-28 of the transcript, reveals that the Defendants did make a cursory objection to the logical and legal relevance of the emails. However, when the emails were later discussed at trial during the testimony of several witnesses, no objection to discussion or admission of the emails on the basis of relevance was made by the Defendants. In the statement of facts, the Defendants' brief cite to nearly seventy pages spanning three volumes of the transcript where Terpstra's counsel asked the three DES employees who were demoted about the content of the emails, but the Defendants have not advised us where, during this extended testimony, an objection to the admission of the testimony or the emails on the basis of relevance was ever made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While our Supreme Court's preference is for cases to be decided on the merits, we will not comb the record to locate when, if at all, the Defendants preserved their objection to the admission of emails, as that would result in this court \"becom[ing an] advocate[ ] by inferring facts and arguments that the [Defendants] failed to assert.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374267\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/887/#p891\">\n    510 S.W.3d at 891-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is for this very reason that Rule 84.04(e) mandates that an appellant inform this court whether and how claimed error was preserved on appeal.

The Defendants assert that contrary to\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   , the trial court made a blanket ruling that all \"me-too\" testimony was admissible. They base this conclusion on the fact that when the trial court denied their objection to Berendzen's testimony, the trial court stated that it believed the \"\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   case allows that evidence to come in.\" Of course, this on-the-record statement is susceptible to a different conclusion than that reached by the Defendants. The trial court's reference to\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   can as easily be read to suggest that the trial court understood it was required to make an individualized assessment of the logical and legal relevance of Berendzen's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We comfortably reach the conclusion that the trial court properly relied on\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   to overrule the Defendants' objection to Berendzen's testimony based on the trial court's reference to\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   at other times during the proceedings. When the trial court denied the Defendants' motion in limine seeking exclusion of \"me-too\" testimony, it did so for the express reason that\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   required an individualized assessment of the relevance of \"me too\" evidence--an assessment that could not be made without the benefit of hearing the testimony in the context of a trial record. In fact, when the Defendants' motion in limine was denied, the trial court told the Defendants that they would be required to make an objection to each \"me-too\" witness's testimony, addressing on each occasion the individualized basis for objecting to relevancy. In keeping with this guidance, when the Defendants objected to Stimson as a \"me too\" witness before his testimony began, the trial court overruled the objection because it was not yet clear what Stimson would say, making it impossible for the trial court to conduct the individualized relevancy assessment required by\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   . It is plain, in light of these rulings and comments, that the trial court's reference to\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   when it overruled the Defendants' objection to Berendzen's testimony reflected an accurate understanding and application of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Defendants alternatively argue that even assuming the trial court\n   properly applied the law as described in\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   , it abused its discretion in doing so because an individualized assessment of Berendzen's testimony did not establish logical or legal relevance. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Berendzen was 58 years old at the time of trial, and like Terpstra, she worked for DES in the JCRCC. Berendzen testified that, while she had been promoted to senior claims supervisor approximately two months before trial, in 2015, she had applied for a promotion as a senior claims supervisor which she did not receive though a younger person was selected. Because Terpstra and Berendzen both worked for DES in the JCRCC, and because both applied for the same position for which they were rejected in favor of younger applicants, Berendzen's testimony was logical relevant as it corroborated Terpstra's claim of age discrimination and suggested that the Defendants possessed discriminatory intent. The difference in time and circumstance is not so significant as to render the probative value of Berendzen's testimony outweighed by its prejudicial effect, and would instead go to the weight of the testimony.

No claim of error is asserted on appeal with respect to the $20,000 award of punitive damages against Lambert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   DES asserts that it \"argued ... in its post-trial motion\" that remittitur was appropriate because the punitive damages award was excessive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Appellants' Brief, p. 49] Later in the brief, however, DES asks us to review the issue of remittitur for plain error because the claim of error \"was not included in the [Post-Trial Motion].\" DES does not explain the contrary positions taken in its brief with respect to preservation of the claim of error relating to remittitur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We have already explained,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , that the Post-Trial Motion sought, \"in lieu of JNOV or new trial, and pursuant to [Rule 78.10], ... an elimination of punitive damages.\" Rule 78.10(a) provides that a party \"requesting ... remittitur shall file a motion for such relief within the time prescribed by Rule 78.04 for filing a motion for new trial.\" Rule 78.10(a) does not describe what must be included in a motion requesting remittitur, and we have located no case law addressing the subject. However, as a general matter, Rule 78.09 requires a party, \"at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, [to make] known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or objections to the action of the court\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and grounds therefor\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" The failure to do so\n   \"precludes a party from obtaining appellate review of error in the trial court's ruling or order.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Nonetheless, Terpstra's Motion for Attorneys' Fees asserted that the application of the lodestar factors would support a trial court setting a reasonable hourly rate for attorney Roger Brown at $475.00, for attorney Hong Chen at $300.00, for attorney Jason McClitis at $210.00, and for paralegals at $125.00. To support her request to use an hourly rate higher than the one customarily charged by her attorneys, Terpstra's Motion for Attorneys' Fees attached affidavits from other attorneys with similar experience and similar knowledge of employment discrimination claims regarding their rates; billing statements showing the hours expended on the case; and judgments awarding attorneys' fees in similar cases in Cole County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Judgment found that Terpstra's request to set an hourly rate above counsel's usual and customary rate was a reasonable\n   request, as: litigation of the case took over four years, and involved fifteen days of trial over several weeks; billing statements revealed that Terpstra's counsel committed substantial time to the case without compensation; counsel expended $20,000 of his own funds in expenses that would not be reimbursed; the case was in the public interest; the contingent nature of the case meant that Terpstra's counsel risked no compensation for either hours or costs expended; and Terpstra's counsel ultimately achieved a compensatory damages verdict and two punitive damages verdicts. The trial court did not use the hourly rates suggested by Terpstra's Motion for Attorneys' Fees. Instead, the Judgment set an hourly rate for attorney Roger Brown at $405.00, for attorney Hong Chen at $250.00, for attorney Jason McClitis at $210.00, and for paralegals at $100.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Defendants argue that these hourly rates \"are not reflective of rates awarded to other attorneys who have similar experience and expertise in employment litigation.\" To support their claim, the Defendants refer to two Cole County and one DeKalb County employment cases wherein plaintiff's counsel was awarded attorneys' fees. The Defendants presented the same argument, including citation to the Cole County and DeKalb County employment cases, to the trial court, and the trial court accepted it in part, setting hourly rates lower than those requested by Terpstra's Motion for Attorneys' Fees. The Defendants argue on appeal that, in those cases, the total attorneys' fees awarded were much less than those awarded by the trial court's Judgment. However, only one of those cases includes the hourly rates used by the trial court to calculate the total award. In that case, while the total attorneys' fees awarded is lower than the trial court awarded in this case, the hourly rates are greater than the ones set by the trial court's Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Given the trial court's consideration of all the factors necessary for determining the lodestar, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in its determination of reasonable hourly rates. The trial court is considered the expert in the determination of attorneys' fees, given its familiarity with Terpstra's case and the character of legal services provided by Terpstra's counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoeper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385775\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/527/151/#p158\">\n    527 S.W.3d at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the trial court could have made the determination without the aid of evidence, the trial court had before it affidavits from other attorneys with similar experience and similar knowledge of employment discrimination claims regarding their rates; and judgments awarding attorneys' fees in similar cases in Cole County and DeKalb County. The Judgment's analysis of the factors necessary for determining the hourly rates used to calculate the lodestar demonstrates that the trial court did not arrive at the hourly rates arbitrarily or without proper judicial consideration. As such we cannot say that the trial court's calculation of the lodestar was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Defendants also complain about the trial court's use of a multiplier. After the trial court calculates the lodestar, it may also make \"a finding that a multiplier [is] necessary to ensure a market fee that compensated ... counsel for taking this case in lieu of working less risky cases on an hourly basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093550\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/397/425/#p431\">\n    397 S.W.3d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, though, the court \"should avoid awarding a multiplier based upon facts that it considered in its initial determination of the lodestar amount.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093550\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/397/425/#p431\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093550\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/397/425/#p431\">\n    at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Defendants argue on appeal that usual hourly rate charged by Terpstra's counsel was adequate so that the trial court's use of the multiplier was unnecessary. The Defendants argue that Terpstra's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and\n   Costs failed to prove that the lodestar failed to provide the Defendants with adequate compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Terpstra's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs requested that the trial court apply a 2.0 multiplier, but suggested that if the trial court found the 2.0 multiplier too high under the circumstances, a multiplier between 1.25 and 2.0 would be appropriate. The trial court's Judgment concluded that a multiplier of 1.5 was appropriate. The Judgment reasoned that, in working on this type of public interest case on a contingent fee basis, Terpstra's counsel took the risk of not prevailing and endured the delay of payment for his services until the conclusion of litigation. The Judgment concluded that, in representing Terpstra in this litigation, Terpstra's counsel fronted expenses and turned down other cases that would generate an hourly fee due to time constraints. The Judgment further concluded that a multiplier was appropriate in order to encourage private attorneys to take these kinds of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   While the trial court also considered the contingent nature of the case in its determination of the lodestar, the trial court's consideration of other factors support application of the multiplier and demonstrate that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting a multiplier of 1.5. The trial court's conclusion that Terpstra's counsel declined representation of other cases that would generate hourly fees and its conclusion that a multiplier was appropriate to encourage private attorneys to take these kinds of cases is indicative of its careful consideration of whether a multiplier was necessary to ensure that Terpstra's counsel was compensated for representation of Terpstra. The Judgment's analysis demonstrates that the trial court did not arrive at the multiplier arbitrarily or without proper judicial consideration. As such we cannot say that the trial court's calculation of the multiplier was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Defendants' sixth point on appeal is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The trial court's Judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   All concur\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    We view the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict.\n    <em>\n     Beverly v.

The Defendants failed to preserve their challenge to either witness's testimony on the basis of relevance by making a timely and appropriate objection. Before Stimson testified, the Defendants asserted that Stimson was not a proper \"me-too\" witness in that his claims of discrimination did not stem from the same period of time as Terpstra's claims of age discrimination and retaliation, and that, because Stimson was promoted to claims supervisor, he could not make a claim of discrimination. The trial court overruled the Defendants' objection, explaining that because \"we don't know what [Stimson's] going to say yet,\" it could not make a ruling as to whether Stimson was an appropriate \"me-too\" witness. The trial court instructed the Defendants to make their evidentiary objections \"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      at the appropriate time\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.)
