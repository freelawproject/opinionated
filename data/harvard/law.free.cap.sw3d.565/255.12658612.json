Wilson, deceased (collectively the \"Wilsons\") appeal the trial court's judgment dismissing their petition, pursuant to a motion to dismiss filed by New Prime, Inc. (\"New Prime\"). On appeal, the Wilsons assert the trial court erred in sustaining New Prime's motion to dismiss. We agree and reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court's succinct factual summary gives appropriate context for the instant appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts underlying the issue are not in dispute. The case involves the alleged wrongful death of Kelli A. Wilson [Decedent] who died in 2016 as a result of a traffic accident on an interstate highway in Oklahoma. [Decedent] is survived by the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are all residents of Oklahoma, and the personal representative of the estate of [Decedent] serves pursuant to her appointment by the Probate Court in Oklahoma. Defendant New Prime, Inc. is a Nebraska corporation, with offices in Greene County, Missouri.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of the accident, [Decedent] was a passenger in an automobile operated by Jennifer T. Bizeau (Bizeau). The collision occurred between the automobile operated by Bizeau and a truck operated by Defendant's employee. The collision was also complicated, and perhaps contributed to, by poor visibility on the interstate highway as a result of smoke from a fire set by James L. Kafer (Kafer). Bizeau and Kafer are also Oklahoma residents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs ... chose[ ] to file their Petition in Greene County, Missouri seeking damages against Defendant only. Plaintiffs claim[ed] Defendant's actions caused or contributed to cause the death of [Decedent]. Plaintiffs ... chose[ ] not to include as persons with potential responsibility either Bizeau or Kafer.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 20, 2017, New Prime filed a motion to dismiss the Wilsons' petition. Relying on Rule 52.04(b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   New Prime's motion argued that: \"complete relief cannot be accorded unless all possibly negligent parties are before the court[ ]\"; \" 'someone or some combination of people will almost certainly be found responsible for [Decedent's] death[ ]' \"; and \"any judgment rendered in [Kafer] and [Bizeau]'s absence would be prejudicial to [New] Prime ... [because they] cannot be assigned any causal responsibility for the accident because they are not parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 24, 2017, the Wilsons filed a response opposing the motion to dismiss, arguing that \"Missouri courts have divested [sic] power in plaintiffs to file suit against any and/or all potential wrongdoers under Missouri's wrongful death statute (\u00a7 537.080),\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and ... Plaintiffs have the right to bring suit against the party or parties of their choosing.\" In addressing Rule 52.04(b), the Wilsons indicated that \"Bizeau and Kafer are not 'necessary' for complete relief to be available. Plaintiffs are allowed to fully recover for the wrongful death action against New Prime ... if they prove their case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court granted New Prime's motion to dismiss on October 16, 2017. In its \"Order of Dismissal,\" the trial court found that Bizeau and Kafer were necessary parties because New Prime could not, \"\n   <em>\n    as a practical matter\n   </em>\n   \" be accorded complete relief in their absence. The trial court directed the Wilsons to the alternative forum of Oklahoma, and dismissed their petition for the reason that New Prime had no \"opportunity or legal ability to bring into court either Bizeau or Kafer, as third-parties to Plaintiffs' claim, because ... [a] Missouri [c]ourt cannot exercise jurisdiction over Bizeau and Kafer.\" This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 22, 2018, this Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   issued an Order directing \"the parties to file written suggestions as to whether choice-of-law considerations affect a proper Rule 52.04 analysis herein.\" The parties duly filed such suggestions. We now examine the choice-of-law issue before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Missouri cases have consistently held that \"the substantive law of the state in which the fatal injury occurred should apply to the cause of action for wrongful death.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thompson v. Crawford\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9988923\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/833/868/#p870\">\n    833 S.W.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 870 (Mo. banc 1992). In this case, the accident and death occurred in Oklahoma, therefore, the law of Oklahoma applies pursuant to the general rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <strong>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9988923\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/833/868/#p870\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ; Rule 52.03(a) (allowing a civil action to be brought in Missouri \"[w]henever a claim exists under the law of another state[.]\"). The parties have a least tacitly admitted Oklahoma law applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Only in \"exceptional cases\" will Missouri courts apply the Missouri wrongful death statute extraterritorially.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Nelson v.

To make that determination, Missouri courts are guided by the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONFLICT OF LAWS \u00a7 145 (\"the Restatement\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Thompson\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9988923\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/833/868/#p870\">\n    833 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   870 ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kennedy v.

The Restatement contemplates application of numerous factors deriving from matters of both fact and policy. A lengthy digression on this issue is unnecessary, however, because the only relationship Missouri has to the case is the fact that New Prime's principal place of business is located in Missouri. This is simply not enough-Oklahoma law applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court dismissed the Wilsons' petition because it reasoned that New Prime would be deprived, under Missouri law, of the opportunity to apportion the appropriate degrees of fault (and liability) to Bizeau and Kafer. However, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Oklahoma law applied, not\n   Missouri law. Under Oklahoma law, \"a tort defendant may predicate its defense on a non-party's negligence. This is known as 'ghost tortfeasor' liability.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thomas v. E-Z Mart Stores, Inc.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9170218\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/102/133/#p138\">\n    102 P.3d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 138 (Okla. 2004). This defense represents substantive law and not a procedural rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Ernst v. Ford Motor Co.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9991135\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/813/910/#p921\">\n    813 S.W.2d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 921 (Mo.App. W.D. 1991) (\"A fundamental principle of conflicts is that a forum state will always apply forum procedure, but it will choose the applicable substantive law according to its own conflicts of law doctrines.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Restatement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Missouri case law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Oklahoma case law\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   all recognize this distinction. The potential Rule 52.04 harm to New Prime-on which the trial court premised its dismissal of the Wilsons' petition-would have been remedied had the trial court (properly) applied Oklahoma law instead of (improperly) applying Missouri law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Oklahoma's \"ghost tortfeasor\" defense was a matter obliging judicial notice,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the trial court was required to apply it to the question presented by New Prime in its motion to dismiss. The trial court failed to do so. That liability could\n   (potentially or theoretically) be apportioned to non-parties was, therefore, insufficient legal justification for a Rule 52.04 dismissal under these facts, and the trial court committed prejudicial error in dismissing the Wilsons' petition on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   JEFFREY W.
