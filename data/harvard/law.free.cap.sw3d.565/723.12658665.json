Loutzenhiser filed a three-count petition in the Circuit Court of Callaway County against Kathleen Best alleging money had and received, unjust enrichment, and seeking a constructive trust relating to money transferred by Best from a joint bank account to an account in her name only. Best counterclaimed, seeking attorneys' fees.

Loutzenhiser lived in Callaway County and owned a successful business. Best lived in St. Louis where she was employed and owned a home. The two would visit each other on weekends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Best became pregnant shortly after they began dating. In the fall of 2009, she left her job, sold her home, and moved to mid-Missouri. Loutzenhiser paid Best's moving expenses and rent for an apartment in Columbia where she lived for a few months. Loutzenhiser and Best agreed that Best would keep the proceeds from the sale of her home as well as her other savings. Best gave birth to the couple's child in December 2009 and, in January 2010, the three moved into a residence in Auxvasse that Loutzenhiser had built for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 27, 2010, Loutzenhiser added Best to his checking account at Callaway Bank that he had opened in 2007. This was a joint account with rights of survivorship. According to Best, she was added to the checking account so that she could \"use the funds in there to make sure all the bills were paid, and then whatever was left was what I could do with as I chose.\" Best indicated that this understanding was the product of giving their child Loutzenhiser's name, quitting her job in St. Louis and moving to Auxvasse, and agreeing to stay at home to raise their child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Best paid bills and other expenses out of the joint checking account. Best also printed the bank statement each month and provided it to Loutzenhiser for his review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In November 2012, Best opened a separate checking account in her name at Callaway Bank. From April 2013 through December 2015, Best transferred $13,625.00 from the joint account to her individual account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, from January 14, 2015\n   through January 25, 2015, Best made seven additional transfers totaling $33,400.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 26, 2015, while Loutzenhiser was at a trade show in Tennessee, Best packed her belongings and moved with the couple's daughter back to St. Louis. On January 27, 2015, Best transferred $2,000.00 from the joint account to her individual account, and on January 30, 2015, transferred the remaining $3,871.67 left in the joint account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Loutzenhiser filed suit against Best asserting counts for money had and received and unjust enrichment, and seeking a constructive trust. Best counterclaimed for attorneys' fees. Following a bench trial, judgment was entered in favor of Best on each claim alleged in Loutzenhiser's petition and in favor of Loutzenhiser on Best's counterclaim. Loutzenhiser appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In cases tried without a jury, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court \"unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, unless it is against the weight of the evidence, unless it erroneously declares the law, or unless it erroneously applies the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

App. W.D. 1993) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Loutzenhiser raises three points on appeal. In his first point, Loutzenhiser asserts the trial court erroneously applied the law because the intent of the parties cannot be used as evidence to prove ownership of funds in a statutory joint account. In his second point, Loutzenhiser claims the trial court's judgment was against the weight of the evidence because the evidence adduced at trial did not establish that Best had a 100-percent ownership interest in the money held in the joint account. Finally, in his third point, Loutzenhiser alternatively argues the trial court's judgment was against the weight of the evidence because, even if there existed an agreement between Loutzenhiser and Best regarding the money in the joint account, Best breached that agreement when she moved back to St. Louis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The trial court did not misapply the law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his first point, Loutzenhiser asserts that the trial court misapplied the law, arguing that an agreement between owners of a joint account is irrelevant to the issue of ownership of the funds held in the account. Loutzenhiser relies on section 362.470, RSMo,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a series of cases to\n   support this argument, none of which we find to be relevant to the resolution of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For example, Loutzenhiser relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    In re LaGarce's Estate\n   </em>\n   , in which the Missouri Supreme Court announced that the presumption of survivorship provided by the joint-account statute, now section 362.470, RSMo,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   is not rebuttable absent fraud, undue influence, mental incapacity, or mistake.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10123154\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/487/493/#p500\">\n    487 S.W.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500 (Mo. banc 1972). This case is not on point. Loutzenhiser also relies on\n   <em>\n    Blue Valley Federal Savings and Loan v. Burrus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9952627\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/637/737/\">\n    637 S.W.2d 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. 1982), which simply confirmed the statutory right of survivorship in a joint bank account is not affected by any agreement or understanding among the owners prior to an account owner's death. Both\n   <em>\n    LaGarce\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Burrus\n   </em>\n   stand only for the straightforward proposition that the statutory right of survivorship is not overcome, following the death of one of the account owners, by a previously entered into agreement among the joint owners. Significantly, the instant case does not concern rights of survivorship in a joint bank account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Instead, we are asked to resolve a different question - the rights of two owners to the use of funds in a joint bank account during the lifetime of the owners. On this point, the rule is that \"during the lives of the parties the joint interest 'readily yields' to the real intention of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Carroll v. Hahn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10129531\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/498/602/#p607\">\n    498 S.W.2d 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607 (Mo. App. E.D. 1973) (citing\n   <em>\n    Ambruster v.

Missouri law does not, as Loutzenhiser argues, render agreements between owners of a joint account ineffective or irrelevant during the owners' lifetimes. Rather, a court is to be guided by and give effect to the parties' intent just as the trial court did in deciding this case. Point I denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The trial court's judgment was not against the weight of the evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In his second point, Loutzenhiser argues that the trial court's judgment was against the weight of the evidence because the evidence, viewed in its entirety, showed that he maintained at least partial ownership of the money in the account, making it unjust for Best to retain the money she withdrew. He also argues that the evidence supports, and we should find, that Best's actions constituted conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[A] claim that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence presupposes that there is sufficient evidence to support the judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    In re J.A.R. v.

Loutzenhiser and Best were both owners of the joint account and were both authorized to withdraw funds from the account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 362.470, RSMo (stating that funds in a statutory joint account may be paid to any of the account owners during their lifetime). Loutzenhiser and Best had an agreement that Best would pay all of the household bills out of the joint account and any remaining funds could be used at her discretion. Best paid all of the household bills out of the joint account during Best and Loutzenhiser's relationship. During the early part of the relationship, Best opted to keep the remaining money in the joint account. In April 2013, however, Best began transferring some of the excess funds from the joint account into an individual account created in only her name. These transfers were not concealed from Loutzenhiser because Best printed the bank statements on a monthly basis for him to review. Loutzenhiser never inquired about the transfers or took any action to stop them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Best was authorized as an owner of the joint account to withdraw any or all of the funds in the joint account and she did so consistent with her agreement with Loutzenhiser. Loutzenhiser's subsequent misgivings about this agreement after the failure of the relationship does not serve as a basis to retroactively invalidate it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Turning now to Loutzenhiser's conversion argument, Loutzenhiser acknowledges that he did not raise a conversion claim before the trial court, but argues that he can do so now because the\n   elements of conversion\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   were pleaded in facts common to all counts. Arguments not raised before the trial court, however, are not preserved for review on appeal. \"Parties are bound by the position they took in the trial court and will not be heard on a different theory on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Barner v. Mo. Gaming Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085407\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/48/46/#p50\">\n    48 S.W.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50 (Mo.

Breach of contract argument was not raised before the trial court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, in his third point, Loutzenhiser claims that the trial court's judgment was against the weight of the evidence because Best breached any existing agreement entered between them when she moved back to St. Louis in January 2015 with the couple's child. However, Loutzenhiser's theory at trial was that there could be no agreement of this nature as a matter of law and that, even if permitted, none existed between him and Best. Loutzenhiser did not assert a breach of contract claim before the trial court, nor did he ask for plain error review here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, we will not find trial court error when an issue was not placed before the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085407\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/48/46/#p50\">\n    48 S.W.3d at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
