Oliver Jr. during his marriage to Elizabeth Oliver. Appellants Richard O. Weed, Timothy A. Weed, and Rees R. Oliver III (\"the Weed Appellants\"), who are all beneficiaries named in Rees's will, contend the oil and gas interests were Rees's separate property as a matter of law. Frost Bank, the independent executor of Rees's estate, argues the oil and gas interests were community property as a matter of law. Because we conclude the oil and gas interests at issue in this appeal were community property as a matter of law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2011, Rees R. Oliver Jr. died and was survived by his wife of twenty-one years, Elizabeth Oliver. In his will, Rees made\n   several bequests to his wife, including his Bexar County real estate, his interest in a San Antonio partnership, and several bank accounts that were styled as his sole and separate property. He left the residue of his estate in the following percentages: 20% to his son Rees R. Oliver III; 10% to each of his nephews, Richard O. Weed and Timothy A. Weed; and the remaining 60% to Keystone School and his step-grandchildren from his first marriage. Before his marriage to Elizabeth, Rees worked as a stockbroker, managed other people's investments, graduated from law school, owned a 25% interest in a storage business, and had a partnership with his sister. Rees also owned multiple real property interests, including some oil and gas interests. After his marriage to Elizabeth, Rees continued investing in multiple mineral interests, both in Texas and in other states. According to Elizabeth, throughout their marriage, Rees was a sole proprietor engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At issue in this appeal are multiple oil and gas interests acquired by Rees during his marriage to Elizabeth. The deeds of each of these oil and gas interests specify that the grantor had conveyed the oil and gas interest to \"Rees R. Oliver, Jr., as his sole and separate property and estate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In attempting to characterize whether these oil and gas interests were community property or Rees's separate property, Frost Bank, the independent executor, attempted to locate financial records to trace the source of funds used to purchase the oil and gas interests. Unable to locate the financial records necessary to trace the source of funds used in the transactions, Frost Bank relied on the community property presumption and concluded the oil and gas interests should be characterized as community property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Frost then filed a declaratory judgment action naming the beneficiaries of the will as defendants and requesting the probate court to declare the oil and gas interests to be community property. The Weed Appellants filed counter-petitions for declaratory judgment and counterclaims against Frost Bank for breach of fiduciary duty. Both the Weed Appellants and Frost Bank filed motions for partial summary judgment on the characterization issue, which were both denied by the probate court. Later, before a trial setting, Frost, in its dual capacities, moved again for partial summary judgment on the characterization issue. This time, the probate court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Frost Bank, declaring the oil and gas interests to be community property and denying the Weed Appellants' request that the oil and gas interests be declared Rees's separate property. The probate court then severed \"Frost's claim for declaratory judgment on the nature of the [oil and gas interests] and the counter claims for declaratory judgment on the [oil and gas interests] asserted by [the Weed Appellants]\" and assigned them a new cause number, making the partial summary judgment a final, appealable judgment. The Weed Appellants appealed, arguing the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the characterization issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To obtain a traditional summary judgment under\n   Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c), a party moving for summary judgment must show that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Oliver, Jr., as his sole and separate property and estate\" create a separate property presumption that replaces the community property presumption. Thus, they argue the burden shifted to Frost Bank to produce evidence that the oil and gas interests were, in fact, community property. And, because it is undisputed the financial records necessary to trace the source of funds used to purchase the oil and gas interests no longer exist, the Weed Appellants contend the trial court should have declared the oil and gas interests were Rees's separate property. Alternatively, they argue issues of material fact exist that prevent summary judgment being granted in favor of Frost Bank. In response, Frost Bank argues no separate property presumption applies to this case. According to Frost Bank, because the oil and gas interests were acquired during Elizabeth and Rees's marriage, the community property presumption applies. Therefore, because the tracing of funds is not possible in this case, Frost Bank contends the probate court correctly applied the community property presumption and declared the oil and gas interests to be community property as a matter of law. Alternatively, Frost Bank argues that even if the deed recitals created a separate property presumption, then the oil and gas interests should still be characterized as community property because the summary judgment evidence shows Rees used his time, toil, and talent to acquire the oil and gas interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    A. Separate and Community Property Defined\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   All property owned by either party to a marriage is either separate property or community property. A spouse's separate property consists of (1) the property owned or claimed by the spouse before marriage, (2) the property acquired by the spouse during marriage by gift, devise, or descent, and (3) the recovery for personal injuries sustained by the spouse during marriage, except any recovery for loss of\n   earning capacity during marriage.

In determining whether property is \"owned or claimed\" by a spouse prior to marriage, the doctrine of inception of title may be applicable. Under the doctrine, the character of the property is generally determined not by the date of acquisition of final title, \"but by the origin of title to the property.\"\n   <em>\n    Roach v.

Community Property Presumption vs. Separate Property Presumption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In this appeal, Frost Bank argues the community property presumption applies because it is undisputed that the oil and gas interests were acquired by Rees during his marriage to Elizabeth. And, because it is also undisputed no financial records exist to trace the source of funds used to purchase the oil and gas interests, Frost Bank argues that the Weed Appellants cannot overcome the community property presumption, and the trial court correctly characterized the oil and gas interests as community property. In contrast, the Weed Appellants argue because the deeds recited the oil and gas interests were conveyed to Rees as his sole and separate property, the community property presumption is replaced by a separate property presumption. Thus, they contend the burden shifted to Frost Bank to bring forth evidence that the oil and gas interests were purchased with community funds. And, because it is undisputed no financial records exist to make tracing possible, they argue Frost Bank cannot meet this burden as a matter of law. Given that the parties argue two different presumptions apply, we must first address whether the community property presumption or a separate property presumption applies to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    1. Separate Property Presumption Based on Implied Gift\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In researching this issue, we have found supreme court precedent dating to the late\n   1800s. In 1892, the supreme court considered whether the community property presumption applied where the wife acquired the land in question during her marriage and the deed recited that the consideration \"was paid by her out of her separate property and that the land was conveyed to her as her separate property.\"\n   <em>\n    McCutchen v.

Whether the appellate record contains evidence of Rees's time, toil, and talent sufficient to rebut the prima facie evidence of the deed recital depends on the circumstances of Rees's oil and gas business and his acquisition of oil and gas interests during his marriage.

Weed affirmed that Rees \"owned, bought, and sold real property and personal property that consists of mineral interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, working interests, and other assets related to the oil and gas business.\" Jon Daubert with Frost Bank agreed that Rees's primary business was oil and gas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The record further reflects that from 2000 to the time Rees died in 2011, Rees acquired during their marriage, almost sixty oil and gas interests. Over fifty of those interests are at issue in this appeal and contain the deed recital \"sole and separate\" property language. Given the amount of oil and gas interests acquired, the testimony that oil and gas was Rees's primary business, the testimony that Rees spent his time researching possible acquisitions and negotiated the terms of the sale, the testimony that Rees used his oil and gas business to support the family, we hold that there is evidence in the record from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that, even if the oil and gas interests at issue were purchased with Rees's separate funds, the degree to which Rees used his time, toil, and effort to acquire the oil and gas interests impressed a community character upon the oil and gas interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10185028,2246237\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/260/676/\">\n    260 S.W.2d at 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because of the now applicable community property presumption, the Weed Appellants would have the burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the oil and gas interests at issue were Rees's separate property. It is undisputed in this case, however, that no financial records exist to trace the funds used by Rees to purchase the oil and gas interests. Thus, the only evidence supporting the Weed Appellants' assertion that the oil and gas interests were Rees's separate property is the language in the deeds themselves. These deed recitals, however, by themselves, are not sufficient evidence to overcome the community property presumption as a matter of law. Summary judgment was therefore correctly granted in favor of Frost Bank. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The probate court identifies these oil and gas interests by attaching two exhibits to its order granting summary judgment. Exhibit A lists over fifty oil and gas interests conveyed by deed. Exhibit B includes an operating agreement from which Rees acquired an oil and gas interest. The probate court's order declared the oil and gas interests specified in Exhibits A and B to be community property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In their brief, the Weed Appellants argue the probate court based its summary judgment on the wrong standard of review by applying an abuse of discretion standard to Frost Bank's characterization decisions. However, because we review a trial court's summary judgment under a de novo standard of review, whether the probate court applied an erroneous standard does not matter for purposes of this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Since the supreme court's holding in\n    <em>\n     Henry S.
