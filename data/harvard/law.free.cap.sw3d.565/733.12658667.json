While it appears Movant's pro se motion lists this date as June 23, 2017, the amended motion says June 25, 2017. Nevertheless, we find that even calculating the deadline by which Movant's pro se motion was due from the earlier date, Movant's pro se Rule 24.035 motion was filed sixty-three days after the date she was delivered to the custody of the department of corrections, and was therefore filed within the 180-day time limit set forth in Rule 24.035(b).\n      <em>\n       See\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819294\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/482/464/#p465\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label=\"4\">\n     <p id=\"p-25\">\n      Our Court has acknowledged an exception to this rule applies where all of the claims in a movant's pro se motion for post-conviction relief have been incorporated into and fully adjudicated along with the amended motion for post-conviction relief.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Guerra-Hernandez v.

(2) [a]n entry of appearance is filed by any counsel that is not appointed but enters an appearance on behalf of movant.\" Rule 24.035(g).

BACKGROUND\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      Movant was charged with one count of the class B felony of distribution of a controlled substance relating to an incident that occurred on or about June 19, 2013. Movant appeared in court with plea counsel on February 2, 2017 to enter a guilty plea not pursuant to an agreement or based on a sentencing recommendation from the State.\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n      On that date, the plea court accepted Movant's guilty plea and ordered a sentencing assessment report. The plea court subsequently sentenced Movant to fifteen years of imprisonment.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      Movant timely filed a pro se Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief on August 25, 2017.\n      <footnotemark>\n       3\n      </footnotemark>\n      On August 28, 2017, the motion court appointed the office of the public defender to represent Movant. Then, on October 4, 2017, an assistant public defender (\"Counsel\") entered his appearance on behalf of Movant and filed a request for a thirty-day extension of time to file Movant's amended motion for post-conviction relief. The parties agree there is nothing in the record indicating that the motion court ever ruled upon Counsel's request for a thirty-day extension. The transcript of Movant's guilty plea and sentencing hearing was then filed with the motion court on October 13, 2017.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      Counsel filed an amended Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief on January 10, 2018, alleging Movant's plea counsel was ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence at sentencing. The motion court subsequently entered a judgment considering the merits of the claim in Movant's amended Rule 24.035 motion and denying the motion without an evidentiary hearing. Movant appeals.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      In this case, Movant raises one point on appeal arguing the motion court clearly erred in denying her amended motion for post-conviction relief because her\n     plea counsel was ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence at Movant's sentencing hearing.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      Before considering the merits of a movant's amended motion for post-conviction relief, we are required under\n      <em>\n       Moore v.

App. E.D. 2016). If we find an amended motion for post-conviction relief filed by appointed post-conviction counsel was untimely, but there has been no independent inquiry into whether movant was abandoned by post-conviction counsel, we must reverse and remand the case to the motion court for such an inquiry.\n      <em>\n       Moore\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876396\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/458/822/\">\n       458 S.W.3d at\n      </extracted-citation>\n      825-26 ;\n      <em>\n       Rice\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819294\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/482/464/#p465\">\n       482 S.W.3d at 465\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n      <footnotemark>\n       4\n      </footnotemark>\n      If, after making an independent inquiry into abandonment, the motion court determines the movant was not abandoned by post-conviction counsel, the court should adjudicate the movant's initial pro se motion for post-conviction relief.\n      <em>\n       Staten v.

App. W.D. 2018). If, on the other hand, the motion court concludes the movant was abandoned by post-conviction counsel's action in untimely filing the amended motion for post-conviction relief, the court must adjudicate the amended motion.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655793\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/540/873/#p875\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      Rule 24.035(g) governs the filing of an amended motion for post-conviction relief. The Rule provides that where, as in this case, a movant files a motion for post-conviction relief after a guilty plea from which no direct criminal appeal was taken and does not retain private counsel, the amended motion must be filed within sixty days of \"the date both a complete transcript consisting of the guilty plea and sentencing hearing has been filed in the trial court and: (1) [c]ounsel is appointed[.]\" Rule 24.035(g).\n      <footnotemark>\n       5\n      </footnotemark>\n      In addition, \"[t]he court may extend the time for filing the amended motion for one additional period not to exceed [thirty] days.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655793\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/540/873/#p875\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      In this case, the motion court appointed the office of the public defender to represent Movant on August 28, 2017. Thereafter, the complete transcript of Movant's guilty plea and sentencing hearing was filed with the motion court on October 13, 2017, which triggered the time limits for the filing of Movant's amended motion under Rule 24.035(g). As such, Movant's amended Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief was due on or before December 12, 2017 but was not filed until January 10, 2018. Although Counsel filed a request for a thirty-day extension of time pursuant to Rule 24.035(g), the parties agree there is nothing in the record indicating that the motion court ever ruled upon the request for a thirty-day extension. \"[E]xtensions will not be presumed to\n     have been granted without a record thereof.\"\n      <em>\n       Staten\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655793\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/540/873/#p875\">\n       540 S.W.3d at 876\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . Accordingly, our Court cannot find that the sixty-day deadline of Rule 24.035(g) had been extended in this case, and without such an extension, Movant's amended motion filed on January 10, 2018 was untimely.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655793\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/540/873/#p875\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655793\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/540/873/#p875\">\n       at 875-76\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (similarly holding).
