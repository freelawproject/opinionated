CHW also contends the trial court erred in granting the City's objections to the affidavit of William W. Ochse, the manager of CHW's general partner. We affirm the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Effective January 8, 2013, CHW and the City entered into a Development Agreement. The Development Agreement recites CHW owns 352.753 acres of land in Jim Wells County, Texas (the \"Developer Property\"), and the purpose of the agreement is \"to promote economic development as contemplated by Chapter 380 of the Texas Local Government Code whereby [CHW] will sell 22 acres of land and dedicate 18 acres of land to the City and the City will, in turn, construct a multi-use complex, including but not limited to an\n   outdoor amphitheater, an Aquatic Center [as defined in the agreement] and a conference center, and will facilitate the construction of a hotel within said 40 acres.\" The Development Agreement further recites the parties \"have in the manner provided by Tex. Loc. Gov't Code 271.151 et seq. entered into a written contract for providing goods and services to the local governmental entity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under the terms of the Development Agreement, CHW agreed to sell the surface estate of 22 acres of the Developer Property to the City for a purchase price of $7,000 per acre (the \"Purchased Property\"). CHW also agreed to dedicate the surface estate of 18 acres of the Developer Property to the City (the \"Dedicated Property\"). Finally, CHW agreed to dedicate the surface estate of 30.38 acres of the Developer Property to the City (the \"Park Land Property\"). The Purchased Property, Dedicated Property, and Park Land Property are collectively defined as the Conveyed Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With regard to the Purchased Property, the agreement provided the conveyance was contingent upon: (1) the City completing construction of the Aquatic Center (as defined in the agreement) within thirty-six months; and (2) substantially completing an amphitheater as described in a master plan on file with the City's secretary. Absent substantial completion of those structures, all or a portion of the Purchased Property was subject to being re-conveyed to CHW at the same per acre price paid by the City. Similarly, although the City was only required to facilitate the construction of a hotel by a third party, if the hotel was not constructed, CHW was granted a right of first refusal to purchase the lot or lots on which the hotel was to be constructed in the event the City sought to sell the lot or lots. The Park Land Property was limited to use as a city park but was not subject to re-conveyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the Development Agreement, CHW and the City agreed the Conveyed Property would be developed in phases \"commencing with the construction of the City Utility Improvements, City Road Improvements, and the Aquatic Center.\" With respect to the City Utility Improvements, the City agreed to extend water lines and sanitary sewer mains from their existing termination points to other points that would facilitate the development of the Developer Property. With respect to the City Road Improvements, the City agreed to construct two roads to facilitate the development. CHW and the City agreed to work together to develop a schedule for each phase of the construction, and the City agreed to commence construction of the Aquatic Center, City Utility Improvements, and City Road Improvements within 120 days after the closing on the Purchased Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Also in the Development Agreement, CHW agreed to submit a petition for the voluntary annexation of the Developer Property within 120 days from the effective date of the Development Agreement. CHW and the City agreed to the regulations and zoning that would govern the development of the Developer Property which the agreement contemplated could involve multiple subdivisions. CHW and the City acknowledged their desire and intent \"to provide for the planning, development and construction of a first of its kind Master Planned Community providing for a mix of uses and designs\" and that CHW and the City would \"work together to prepare a mutually acceptable Planned Unit Development plan for the Property to permit a mix of compatible land uses.\" Finally, the agreement contained the following provision entitled \"Waiver of Immunity\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties expressly agree that this Agreement is made and is subject to the requirements of Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. Chapter 271, Subchapter 1 and that the City is authorized to enter into this Agreement and expressly waives sovereign immunity to suit for the purpose of adjudicating a claim for breach of contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 6, 2017, approximately four years after the effective date of the Development Agreement, CHW sued the City alleging the City \"failed to construct roads of such specifications so as to adequately take care of Plaintiff's subdivision and has failed to increase the much needed water pressure to serve Plaintiff's development lots and subdivision, and has failed to construct the amphitheater required by the Agreements.\" CHW alleged claims for breach of contract, declaratory relief and fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The City filed a plea and amended plea to the jurisdiction asserting immunity from suit. First, the City asserted the Development Agreement was not a contract for providing goods and services to the City as required for immunity to be waived under section 271.152 for a breach of contract claim. Second, the City asserted section 271.152 does not waive immunity for a claim for declaratory relief. Finally, the City asserted the fraud claim is an intentional tort for which immunity is not waived. In support of its plea, the City attached excerpts from the deposition of William W. Ochse, the manager of CHW's general partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CHW filed a response to the City's amended plea asserting immunity was waived for its breach of contract claim under section 271.152 because the Development Agreement was a contract for services. CHW further responded immunity was waived because the City was engaged in proprietary functions in executing the Development Agreement. Finally, CHW responded the City was estopped from claiming its immunity was waived. In support of its response, CHW produced an affidavit signed by Ochse and the complete transcript of Ochse's deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The City filed a reply to CHW's response asserting it was not estopped from claiming immunity from suit and objecting to Ochse's affidavit. After CHW filed a sur-response, the trial court held a hearing on the City's amended plea and took the matter under advisement. The trial court subsequently entered orders granting the City's objections to Ochse's affidavit and deposition, granting the City's amended plea, and dismissing the underlying cause for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. CHW appeals; however, CHW only challenges the trial court's order with regard to its breach of contract and declaratory relief claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We review a trial court's ruling on a plea to the jurisdiction de novo.\n   <em>\n    Sampson v.

However, courts have found them to be proprietary (i.e., discretionary), resulting in unlimited liability for the municipality. Consequently, lawsuits against municipalities relating to community development activities diminish the funds available for projects within the municipality. The designation of community development activities as a governmental function should provide reasonable limits on recoveries in this arena and avoid the potential of major losses which would reduce funding of community development projects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    E.

The City filed objections to virtually every statement contained in the affidavit. Among the City's objections were objections that the statements in the affidavit were conclusory, violated the best evidence and parol evidence rules, were not within Ochse's personal knowledge, and provided opinions on the legal effect of the agreement which is a question of law. The trial court sustained all of the City's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In its brief, CHW generally challenges the trial court's ruling on the City's objections without relating the objections to the specific statements made in the affidavit. These general challenges are not sufficient to preserve CHW's complaints regarding the evidentiary rulings for our review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruffin v. Sanchez\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-16-00759-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204014651\">\n    2017 WL 4014651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Tex.

P . 38.1(i) (\"The [appellant's] brief must contain a clear and concise argument for contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Furthermore, Ochse's affidavit primarily attempts to explain his understanding of the Development Agreement and the services CHW provided to the City in an effort to establish the agreement waived the City's immunity under section 271.152. The interpretation of an unambiguous contract, however, is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    URI, Inc. v. Kleberg Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656122\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/755/#p763\">\n    543 S.W.3d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763 (Tex. 2018). In construing a contract, we consider the intent of the parties as expressed in the written agreement.\n   <em>\n    Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9010190\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/164/656/#p662\">\n    164 S.W.3d 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 662 (Tex. 2005). \"Only where a contract is first determined to be ambiguous may the courts consider the parties' interpretation, and admit extraneous evidence to determine the true meaning of the instrument.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10013321\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/907/517/#p520\">\n    907 S.W.2d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 520 (1995) (internal citation omitted). Because the Development Agreement is unambiguous, the trial court properly sustained the objections to the portions of the affidavit providing Ochse's interpretation. And, because the only issue to which Ochse's affidavit was relevant was whether CHW was obligated to provide services to the City which presents a question of law for this court's consideration, CHW does not explain how the exclusion of the affidavit harmed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   CHW also contends the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining\n   the City's objection to Ochse's deposition transcript, asserting the City objected on the grounds that offering the entire deposition transcript was unfair. The City's objection, however, was that CHW attached the entire deposition transcript without referring to any particular page or portion of the testimony. The City asserted, \"It is not feasible or fair to require the Court to comb through the entire deposition transcript to look for some testimony that might be relevant to the issues raised by the Amended Plea to the Jurisdiction.\" Neither the trial court nor this court is required to wade through an entire deposition transcript; instead, a party must specifically identify the supporting proof the party seeks to have the trial court consider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.
