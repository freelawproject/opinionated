A jury apportioned most of the fault for the accidents to Rhoads, though it also apportioned some to the other two drivers, Chasity Gordon and Sean Abraham. Rhoads's estate and the City of Nicholasville Police Department (collectively Appellants) claim the trial court erred by refusing to give a sudden emergency instruction and by limiting the testimony of an expert witness, Richard Parkos. Appellants also raise several arguments about the collateral source rule. We\n   agree with Appellants regarding the refusal to give a sudden emergency instruction and the limitation on Parkos's testimony but cannot grant relief on the basis of their collateral source rule arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the morning of March 11, 2015, Rhoads was driving his police cruiser southbound on US 27 while Gordon was approaching US 27 from a side street. It is uncontested that Rhoads had the right of way. Intending to proceed north, Gordon turned left across US 27's southbound lanes. Rhoads swerved left, toward the center turn lane/median, whereupon he collided with Gordon's vehicle. Rhoads's cruiser then began to spin and crossed over to the northbound lanes of US 27, where it collided with the Abrahams' vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Abrahams sued Gordon, Rhoads's estate, and the Nicholasville Police Department and the case proceeded to a multi-day jury trial. The jury apportioned 70% of the fault to Rhoads, 29% to Gordon, and 1% to Abraham. Appellants were ordered to pay a total of over $1.38 million in damages to the Abrahams.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. at 1213).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Trial court erred by refusing to instruct on sudden emergency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Appellees' defense of the trial court's sudden emergency ruling is grounded on the shifting sands of a contested fact-they assert Rhoads drove his cruiser at an unreasonable speed, thereby creating the emergency and depriving him of the right to the instruction. Rhoads argues that because the reasonableness of the speed was a contested fact never decided by the jury, the trial court's exercise of discretion to refuse the instruction would have been abusive. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   However, the trial court never exercised discretion whether to give the instruction because of a misapprehension of the law. The court stated, \"I don't give that [sudden emergency instruction] anymore,\" expressing a belief that the instruction is generally incompatible with comparative negligence principles. (VR 4:12:17, 3:26:25). The assumption that the sudden emergency\n   doctrine was subsumed in the comparative fault doctrine yielded an erroneous legal ruling. Because the defense remains viable, and because the reasonableness of Rhoads's speed was a contested issue of fact, we cannot affirm the trial court on the basis that the ruling was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The sudden emergency doctrine remains \"a necessary component of the process by which juries must determine the fault of parties who, finding themselves suddenly and unexpectedly in a position of imminent peril, respond in a way that might otherwise breach a specific duty of due care.\"\n   <em>\n    Henson v.

The opinion even includes a section heading stating, \"\n   <em>\n    The Advent Of Comparative Negligence Did Not Eliminate The Need To Instruct Juries On Sudden Emergency\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322451\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/319/413/#p418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322451\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/319/413/#p418\">\n    at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Satisfied that the doctrine is still a viable part of our jurisprudence, we turn to the substantive question whether the evidence in this case justified Rhoads's demand for the instruction. The parties do not differ dramatically in their position as to whether Rhoads was faced with a sudden emergency when Gordon cut across his lane of travel; rather, their main disagreement is whether Rhoads created that emergency by driving too fast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The evidence of Rhoads's speed is conflicting. For example, there was evidence that Rhoads's cruiser was traveling between 50 and 52 miles per hour (mph) when it struck the Abrahams' vehicle, and other evidence that its speed was 42.2 mph. (VR 4:12:17, 2:01:58). The Abrahams presented expert testimony that Rhoads was going about 56.9 mph when he collided with Gordon's vehicle. (VR 4:12:17, 2:03:10). But the expert further testified he would \"always put a plus or minus five percent on his numbers because ... we don't deal in exact numbers ... sometimes there's pieces missing....\" (VR 4:12:17, 2:06:24). Based on this acknowledgement, the testimony of even Abrahams' expert put Rhoads's speed at the time of impact with Gordon's vehicle in a range between 54.055 mph and 59.745 mph. Also, as discussed below, the trial court did not allow Rhoads's expert to testify that he saw no evidence indicating Rhoads was exceeding the speed limit when he struck Gordon's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Upon those facts, a reasonable jury could have decided either way whether Rhoads created or simply attempted to avoid a sudden emergency. As\n   <em>\n    Swope\n   </em>\n   indicates, the trial court should have given a sudden emergency instruction because of this conflicting evidence.\n   <em>\n    Swope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10123656\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/413/82/\">\n    413 S.W.2d at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A trial court's failure to properly instruct a jury is presumed to be prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan v. Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301190\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/291/622/#p640\">\n    291 S.W.3d 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640 (Ky. 2009). Considering the substantial jury verdict, we cannot conclude that the refusal to give a sudden emergency instruction was so inconsequential as to be a mere harmless error. We must vacate the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the other arguments raised by Appellants are likely to recur upon remand, we will address them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Limitation of Testimony of Richard Parkos\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Appellants contend the trial court erred by prohibiting their expert, Richard Parkos, from testifying in accordance with his written report that he found no evidence showing Rhoads exceeded 55 mph. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In determining whether to admit expert testimony, a trial court must consider \"whether the testimony is reliable, a factual determination, and whether the testimony will assist the trier of fact in understanding or determining a fact in issue, an admissibility determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Oliphant v. Ries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6873210\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/889/#p897\">\n    460 S.W.3d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 897 (Ky. 2015). We review the reliability determination\n   for clear error and the admissibility determination for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6873210\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/889/#p897\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Parkos retrieved electronic data from the vehicles and prepared an undated, one-page report on Kentucky State Police letterhead. Among others, that report includes two statements indicating: (1) Rhoads's cruiser was traveling between 50 and 52 mph when it collided with the Abrahams' Cadillac, and (2) \"[a]lthough the [police] vehicle had been previously struck and rotated [by Gordon's vehicle], no evidence would indicate a speed greater than the posted speed limit of 55 mph.\" (R. 589).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Without objection, Parkos testified about the speed of the cruiser when it struck the Abrahams-the first referenced statement in his report. (VR 4:12:17, 11:40:05). The Abrahams objected only when Parkos was asked his opinion relating to the second statement-whether Rhoads's \"top speed\" exceeded 55 mph. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:40:10). The objection was sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Abrahams' objection was not based on Parkos's lack of credentials. Instead, they emphasize that Parkos was not the lead reconstructionist, but tasked primarily with obtaining the electronic \"black box\" information from the vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:40:38-11:41:18). Unlike the Abrahams' expert, Parkos had not applied the physical laws and mathematics to extrapolate an estimate of Rhoads's speed when he struck Gordon's vehicle. We do not think this matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When it comes to admissibility, nothing distinguishes Parkos's testimony about Rhoads's speed when he struck the Abrahams' vehicle from that about Rhoads's speed when he struck Gordon's vehicle. Parkos's testimony about the lack of evidence of Rhoads's excessive speed is more assailable on cross-examination than his reporting of the \"black box\" data. But that is a question of the weight of the evidence, not of its admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Our concerns are not assuaged by the Abrahams' argument that Parkos would have impermissibly testified that Rhoads's speed was \"reasonable.\" To the contrary, by stipulation of all counsel, Parkos would only have testified that he saw no evidence that Rhoads was going more than 55 mph. Whether Rhoads's speed was reasonable would have remained a matter for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Next, the Abrahams argue that Appellants did not timely disclose Parkos as an expert under Rule 26. That assertion is not supported by the record. They failed to object to Parkos's expert testimony about the speed Rhoads was traveling when he collided with them. We cannot reconcile their claim that lack of notice prevents Parkos's testimony about Rhoads's speed at the first collision with their decision not to object to his testimony about Rhoads's speed at the second collision. More significantly, the Abrahams included Parkos's report as a portion of their own pretrial response to a motion in limine by the City of Nicholasville. (R. at 577-91). That response states that \"[a]ll parties have had the same information and the same statement from prior to the inception of the litigation.... There certainly is no surprise or different information.\" (R. at 580). Thus, the Abrahams' argument that they had insufficient notice of Parkos's conclusions is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Parkos's testimony was relevant and could well have assisted the jury in its determination whether Rhoads created the emergency. The court abused its discretion by prohibiting Parkos's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Collateral Source Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As summarized by our Supreme Court, the collateral source rule \"allows the plaintiff to (1) seek recovery\n   for the reasonable value of medical services for an injury, and (2) seek recovery for the reasonable value of medical services without consideration of insurance payments made to the injured party.\"\n   <em>\n    Baptist Healthcare Systems, Inc. v.

Essentially, \"[i]t is improper to reduce a plaintiff's damages by payments for medical treatment under a health insurance policy if the premiums were paid by the plaintiff or a third party other than the tortfeasor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898650\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/177/676/#p682\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Abrahams introduced evidence of medical expenses approaching $600,000, but the Appellants were prevented by application of the collateral source rule from introducing evidence that the Abrahams paid very little of that amount; Medicaid paid slightly more than twenty percent, with much of the remainder having been discounted or written off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Appellants' main argument is that the collateral source rule should be abrogated. However, we lack the authority to reverse decisions of our Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Alternatively, Appellants argue the trial court properly permitted the Abrahams to introduce the full billed amounts but urge us to conclude that evidence of discounts, write-offs and actual payments is also admissible. That approach is simply a different face on the same argument and was rejected by the Kentucky Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Baptist Healthcare Systems\n   </em>\n   .
