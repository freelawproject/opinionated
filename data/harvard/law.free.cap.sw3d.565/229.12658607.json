Ellis raises two claims on appeal. First, he argues that the prosecutor made an allegedly improper statement during closing argument. Second, Ellis argues that the State should not have been allowed to present testimony from eight witnesses who were endorsed approximately two weeks before trial. Finding no error, plain or otherwise, we affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
