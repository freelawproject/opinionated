Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 134.001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -.005 (Vernon 2011 &amp; Supp. 2016). Electro Circuits and Parikh cross-appeal to challenge the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of Agar on their claim for additional attorney's fees based upon Agar's asserted breach of a release. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This commercial dispute involves the alleged misappropriation of trade secrets relating to measurement and control devices that Agar designs, manufactures, and sells for use in the oil and gas industry. Agar contends two former employees, Sanjay Shah and Pandurang Nayak, conspired with many other persons and entities to obtain and use its trade secrets to sell knockoff Agar devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Agar sued more than a dozen individuals and entities in April 2008 including the two former Agar employees; it added Electro Circuits and Parikh as defendants to the existing lawsuit in a sixth amended petition filed in November 2011. That lawsuit was docketed as Cause No. 2008-20480.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its seventh amended petition filed on February 10, 2012, Agar asserted claims against Electro Circuits and Parikh for tortious interference, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary\n   duty, fraud, fraud by non-disclosure, misappropriation of trade secrets, violations of the Texas Theft Liability Act, conversion, and civil conspiracy. Agar sought actual and exemplary damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Electro Circuits and Parikh answered and filed a counterclaim against Agar seeking attorney's fees based upon (1) the Texas Theft Liability Act; and (2) Agar's asserted breach of a \"Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement\" dated December 20, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Electro Circuits and Parikh filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i) in September 2013. In the motion, they (1) identified each element of each claim asserted against them; and (2) contended that Agar lacked evidence on all specified elements of all claims. They also contended: \"[T]o prevail on a civil conspiracy claim[,] the plaintiff must show that the defendant was liable for some underlying tort.\" Electro Circuits and Parikh combined their no-evidence motion with a motion for summary judgment under Texas Rule 166a(b); among other grounds, they sought a traditional summary judgment based on their affirmative defenses of release and the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its response to the combined motion, Agar contended that summary judgment was not warranted because (1) Electro Circuits and Parikh \"are liable as co-conspirators of Defendants Sanjay Shah and Pandurang Nayak and their respective companies;\" (2) specific portions of evidence attached to the response raise fact questions regarding the liability of Electro Circuits and Parikh as co-conspirators; (3) unspecified evidence attached to separate summary judgment motions and responses filed by Agar in relation to other defendants \"clearly show[s] there was a fact issue on each of [Agar's] claims that it has also asserted against\" Electro Circuits and Parikh; (4) Electro Circuits and Parikh were not parties to or third-party beneficiaries of the release agreement they invoked, so they could not rely on it to obtain attorney's fees; and (5) limitations does not bar Agar's claims against Electro Circuits and Parikh because the discovery rule tolls accrual of those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court signed an order on October 10, 2013, in which it granted the combined summary judgment motion in its entirety. After Agar moved for reconsideration, the trial court signed an order on December 20, 2013, in which it (1) denied the no-evidence motion for summary judgment as to Agar's claim for civil conspiracy; (2) granted the no-evidence motion in favor of Electro Circuits and Parikh \"as to all other claims [by Agar] alleging direct liability;\" and (3) granted \"a traditional summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims against Defendants Electro Circuits International, LLC and Suresh Parikh only on the limited basis as to [their] ... affirmative defense of statute of limitations.\" The trial court's order states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court further finds the last overt act for limitations purposes regarding the conspiracy claim to be on July 3, 2009. Further, although the reasoning for the holding seems suspect, the cases from the Houston Court of Appeals clearly hold that the two year statute of limitations applies to conspiracy claims independent of whether the underlying tort has a longer limitations period. Since there is no evidence of any overt act within the two years prior to Electro Circuits and Suresh Parikh being named\n   as Defendants, the Court feels compelled to grant the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With respect to the traditional motion, the order also states as follows: \"Plaintiff's claims against Defendants Electro Circuits International, LLC and Suresh Parikh are dismissed solely on the basis of the affirmative defense of statute of limitations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 9, 2014, the trial court signed an order granting a motion by Electro Circuits and Parikh to sever the claims among Agar, Electro Circuits, and Parikh from the original Cause No. 2008-20480. The order states Agar \"was unopposed to the Motion ...\" and reflects at the bottom that Agar's counsel approved the severance order \"as to form only....\" The December 20, 2013 order became part of the severed case under Cause No. 2008-20480-A. No final judgment existed in the severed case at this point because Electro Circuits and Parikh still had unresolved claims against Agar for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following severance, Electro Circuits and Parikh filed a second motion for summary judgment in June 2014 on their claims against Agar for attorney's fees. They sought traditional summary judgment in their favor on grounds that (1) they are prevailing parties under the Texas Theft Liability Act; and (2) they are entitled to fees because Agar breached the release when it sued Electro Circuits and Parikh. They supported this motion with an attorney's fees affidavit signed by attorney Ken Krock, which included detailed time sheets reflecting hours expended and billable rates for the attorneys representing Electro Circuits and Parikh. According to this affidavit, Electro Circuits and Parikh incurred $ 79,167.50 in fees in connection with Agar's claims. Of this amount, the affiant attributed $ 64,307.44 to the Texas Theft Liability Act claim. The trial court denied this motion in an order signed on August 11, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For its part, Agar filed a combined traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment in the severed case in August 2014 (and again in September 2014) on the unresolved claims for attorney's fees. The trial court also denied this motion on November 5, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 6, 2014, the trial court signed an order vacating its prior order denying the summary judgment motion of Electro Circuits and Parikh on attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court signed a \"Modified Order Constituting Final Judgment\" in the severed case on January 20, 2015, in which it awarded $ 64,307.44 in attorney's fees to Electro Circuits and Parikh as prevailing parties under the Texas Theft Liability Act; the order conditionally awarded additional fees in the event of an appeal or a petition for review. The modified order denied any fee award in connection with the release. The modified order also granted Agar's motion for no-evidence and traditional summary judgment in part with respect to the claim for attorney's fees arising from the release. Taken together with the December 20, 2013 order, the January 20, 2015 order disposed of all parties and claims in the severed action docketed as Cause No. 2008-20480-A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Agar appeals from the trial court's summary judgment order in favor of Electro Circuits and Parikh signed on December 20, 2013; Agar also appeals from the modified order signed on January 20, 2015, to challenge the award of attorney's fees to Electro Circuits and Parikh as prevailing parties under the Texas Theft Liability\n   Act. Electro Circuits and Parikh cross-appeal from the January 20, 2015 modified order to challenge the denial of additional attorney's fees to them based on Agar's asserted breach of the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review the trial court's grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Valence Operating Co. v.

In its summary judgment response, Agar argued that \"JAK Instruments was still [s]elling parts to Wilbur Eagle Technology containing [Agar's] ... trade secrets as late as July 3, 2009.\" According to Agar's appellate briefing, the purchase order created on this date reflects \"the sale of goods including [Agar's] ... stolen trade secrets, which was a 'continued invasion of the\n   plaintiff's interest causing loss and damage.' \" Agar contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because (1) Agar did not learn of the July 2009 purchase order until it was produced in discovery on March 30, 2011; and (2) limitations therefore began running in March 2011 with respect to its claim against Electro Circuits and Parikh for conspiring with others to steal its trade secrets. Based upon a March 2011 accrual date, Agar contends that it timely sued Electro Circuits and Parikh in November 2011 even under a two-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Agar's contentions regarding \"the last overt act\" and a \"continued invasion\" of its interest in its trade secrets throughout the alleged conspiracy are grounded on this statement in\n   <em>\n    Mayes\n   </em>\n   : \" '[U]nder civil conspiracy, each continued invasion of the plaintiff's interest causing loss and damage in a conspiracy case is treated as an independent element for limitations purposes and the two year statute of limitations begins to run when each independent element arises.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11476158\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/11/440/#p453\">\n    11 S.W.3d at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cathey v.

We take Agar at its word when it invokes these concepts, and when it characterizes the injurious \"continued invasion\" at issue as \"the sale of goods including [Agar's] ... stolen trade secrets.\" Agar discovered this injury sufficiently to sue based upon the alleged theft of its trade secrets in 2008-more than three years before it added Electro Circuits and Parikh to the suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"The limitations exception in the continuing-tort doctrine is rooted in a plaintiff's inability to know that the ongoing conduct is causing ... injury; thus, when the plaintiff discovers [its] ... injury, the rationale for extending the accrual date no longer applies ....\"\n   <em>\n    Walston v.

Having already rejected Agar's challenge to the grant of summary judgment on limitations, we reject this contention as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, Agar contends that Electro Circuits and Parikh \"were not prevailing parties under the TTLA by merely avoiding liability under a statute of limitations defense.\" Third, Agar contends this statute \"does not allow a defendant avoiding liability to recover attorney's fees\" because a party must recover damages to \"prevail[ ]\" under section 134.005.

Additionally, the amount of $ 64,307.44 in attorney's fees related to purportedly intertwined fees relating to the Texas Theft Liability Act (\"TTLA\") claim is also not reasonable, necessary, equitable, or just.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Standing alone, these conclusory assertions do not raise a fact issue regarding the reasonableness and necessity of the fees incurred by Electro Circuits and Parikh.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cammack the Cook, L.L.C. v.

The Russell affidavit asserts that defense fees claimed in connection with the Texas Theft Liability Act are not reasonable and necessary (1) because Electro Circuits and Parikh were sued in November 2011 but did not file their summary judgment motion until September 2013; and (2) \"in light of applicable case law and legislative history regarding the TTLA suggesting that only plaintiffs, not defendants, that recover damages may recover attorney's fees under the TTLA ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The first stated rationale is insufficient; it ignores Rule 166a(i)'s requirement that an \"adequate time for discovery\" must pass before a no-evidence motion can be filed. The second stated rationale also is insufficient because it is neither a statement of fact nor a statement of opinion about fact.

This conclusion applies even if we assume for argument's sake that Electro Circuits and Suresh Parikh are \"legal and business entities or affiliates associated with\" Girish Parikh and V-J, and that they were released by Agar in paragraph 3. We reach this conclusion because the differing language used in paragraphs 3 and 7 demonstrates that not all persons or entities released by Agar in paragraph 3 are authorized to seek attorney's fees against Agar under paragraph 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The release defines the \"Parties\" as Agar, Girish Parikh, and SGM Corporation d/b/a V-J Electronic Assemblies. The release does not define the term \"Party\" in the singular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Electro Circuits and Parikh invite us to read the term \"Party\" used in paragraph 7 to encompass \"affiliates\" so that \"affiliates\" can seek attorney's fees. Under this reading, each of the \"affiliates\" referenced in paragraph 3 is a \"Party\" who \"shall be entitled to recover\" attorney's fees under paragraph 7 if Agar sues them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   We decline this invitation in light of the release's unambiguous language. The release does not define \"Party\" or \"Parties\" to include \"any and all legal and business entities or affiliates associated with\" Girish Parikh and V-J. Rather, this quoted \"affiliates\" phrase appears in paragraph 3 to identify the persons and entities being released by Agar. This quoted \"affiliates\" phrase also appears in paragraph 4, the mirror-image provision by which Girish Parikh and V-J mutually release Agar along with \"any and all legal and business entities or affiliates associated with Agar ....\" This quoted \"affiliates\" phrase appears nowhere else in the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In contrast to the release provisions in paragraphs 3 and 4, the attorney's fee language in paragraph 7 omits this quoted \"affiliates\" phrase; this portion of paragraph 7 addressing attorney's fees applies only to \"the Party against whom such action, suit or other proceeding has been instituted\" and \"the Party instituting such action, suit or other proceeding ....\" The \"Parties\" are Agar, Girish Parikh, and SGM Corporation d/b/a V-J Electronic Assemblies. This difference demonstrates that paragraph 7's scope with respect to attorney's fees is narrower than paragraph 3's scope with respect to a release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Paragraph 7's narrower scope with respect to attorney's fees comports with other\n   release provisions that specify actions by a \"Party\" but not \"affiliates\" of a Party. For example, paragraph 9 states as follows: \"Each Party further warrants and represents that it is legally competent to execute this Agreement ....\" Paragraph 9 continues: \"Each Party also understands ... that the consideration described herein is all the consideration to be given by each Party hereto.\" Electro Circuits and Suresh Parikh neither executed the release as asserted \"affiliates\" nor provided consideration. Similarly, the references in paragraphs 11 and 12 to execution of the release by a \"Party\" also do not encompass asserted \"affiliates\" Electro Circuits and Suresh Parikh because they executed nothing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The upshot is that paragraph 7 authorizes attorney's fees only for a subset of the universe of persons and entities released by Agar under paragraph 3. This circumstance fits with the supreme court's recognition that a release by itself is not equivalent to a covenant not to sue, and that creation of such a covenant requires express language to that effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Prop.

In its August and September 2014 summary judgment motions on attorney's fees, Agar expressly argued that Electro Circuits and Parikh could not obtain attorney's fees under the release because they were not parties entitled to fees under the release. Agar raised the same contention in its response to the June 2014 summary judgment motion filed by Electro Circuits and Parikh.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
