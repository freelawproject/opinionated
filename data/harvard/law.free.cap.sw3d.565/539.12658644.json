Jones, Ass't Att'y Gen., for appellee.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   N. MARK KLAPPENBACH, Judge\n   David Caldwell appeals from an order revoking his suspended sentence and sentencing him to two years in the Arkansas Department of Correction. He argues that the trial court erred in finding that he violated the conditions of his suspension and that he was denied the constitutional right to confront his accuser. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Appellant pled guilty in 2014 to possession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine). He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, with imposition of any additional imprisonment suspended for a period of two years subject to various conditions, including that he exercise good behavior. In 2017, the prosecuting attorney filed a petition to revoke appellant's suspension, alleging that appellant had violated the good-behavior condition by committing a number of new crimes, including multiple drug offenses and felony fleeing. A warrant was issued, and appellant was arrested. The petition to revoke was later amended to add an allegation of second-degree battery on a law enforcement officer for appellant's attack on a Crawford County deputy sheriff working at the jail where appellant was being housed after his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At the hearing on the petition, the State decided to present evidence related only to the battery charge. The State did not call the victim as a witness. Instead, it offered proof in the form of testimony from two other jail officials and a video of the attack. That evidence indicated that appellant refused an order to leave a common area, became aggressive with the jailers, was shocked with a Taser weapon, removed the Taser barbs from his body, and threw a punch at Deputy Logan Hight, hitting him in the chest. No testimony was offered to establish the extent, if any, of injury to the victim, and the video does not show any evidence of injury. Appellant did not present any evidence. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that appellant had violated the good-behavior condition of his suspended sentence by his attack on the officer, revoked the suspension, and sentenced appellant to an additional two years in prison on the underlying 2014 conviction for possession of a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant argues that the revocation order should be reversed and dismissed because the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that he committed second-degree battery as charged in the petition to revoke. He does not contend that the conditions of his suspension were insufficient to communicate that he was not to violate the law. Instead, appellant specifically argues only that the State failed to prove that he acted knowingly or that Deputy Hight suffered any physical injury, which are elements of second-degree battery on a law enforcement officer. While we agree that the physical-injury element of the offense alleged in the petition was not proved, we find no reversible error because the evidence was sufficient to establish a lesser-included offense of the one charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A trial court may revoke a defendant's suspended sentence or probation if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has violated a condition of the suspension or probation.\n   <em>\n    Atteberry v.

App. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The amended petition to revoke in this case accused appellant of violating the good-behavior condition of his suspension by committing second-degree battery on a law enforcement officer. As is pertinent here, Arkansas Code Annotated section 5-13-202(a)(4)(A)(i) (Supp. 2017) provides that a person commits second-degree battery if he knowingly, without legal justification, causes physical injury to a person whom he knows to be a law enforcement officer while the officer is acting in the line of duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A person acts \"knowingly\" with respect to a result of his conduct when he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause the result.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205-2-202\">\n    Ark.

Nevertheless, the law is settled that, although the evidence may be insufficient in a revocation proceeding to sustain an allegation that appellant committed a specific offense, revocation will be affirmed on appeal if the evidence establishes commission of a lesser-included offense of the one charged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Atteberry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Ark.%20App.%20331\">\n    2016 Ark.

In\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the appellant was convicted in a bench trial of second-degree battery on a law enforcement officer. There was evidence that Allen struck an officer one time on the head with either his hand or his arm. While we held on appeal that the proof was insufficient to establish physical injury as required for second-degree battery, we further held that the proof was clearly sufficient to establish the lesser-included offense of second-degree assault.\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6136858\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark-app/64/49/#p55\">\n    64 Ark.

There was testimony that he refused a lawful instruction, became aggressive with jailers, and \"swung at\" Deputy Hight, hitting him in the chest. The video shows that, after removing the Taser barbs, appellant squared his body and threw a well-aimed, solid punch from close range in the direction of Deputy Hight's chin or throat. The trial court quite reasonably could have concluded that appellant acted at least recklessly and that, had the punch connected cleanly, there very likely would have been physical injury to the officer. Viewing the video, it further appears that the only thing that prevented the punch from connecting squarely was the officer's ability to quickly dodge its full impact. We hold that the proof in this case was clearly sufficient to support a finding that appellant violated the conditions of his suspension by committing the lesser-included offense of second-degree assault against Deputy Hight and that the trial court did not clearly err in ordering revocation based on those actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Confrontation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the close of the State's case, appellant moved to dismiss the petition due to the State's failure to call the victim as a witness.

I likewise agree with the majority that there was no confrontation-clause violation in this case. I must respectfully dissent, however, because the majority has decided to affirm this case based on an argument never advanced by any party either below or on appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    It may be true, as the majority states, that the law is well settled that although the evidence in a revocation proceeding may be insufficient to sustain an allegation that one committed a specific offense, revocation can be affirmed if the evidence establishes the commission of a lesser-included offense. It is also a well-settled principle of appellate law, however, that we will not make a party's argument for him.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Running M Farms, Inc. v.Farm Bureau Mut.

The State never asked the circuit court to revoke Caldwell's SIS on this principle; moreover, the State never invited this court to affirm on this alternative basis. I simply do not believe we should do so. As noted above, the majority correctly holds that there was insufficient evidence that Caldwell committed the offense that was charged in the State's petition to revoke. I would therefore reverse and dismiss.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Hixson, J., joins.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
