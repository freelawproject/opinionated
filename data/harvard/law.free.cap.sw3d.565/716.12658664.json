On June 24, 2011, the DOR filed with the Circuit Clerk of St. Louis County a Certificate of Tax Lien dated July 11, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By letter dated April 17, 2017, the Kohns asserted that the lien was recorded improvidently because it was filed more than six years after the assessment had become final, and they requested that the Director withdraw, satisfy, or otherwise remove the Certificate of Tax Lien. The DOR, by letter from DOR counsel dated May 18, 2017, denied the Kohns' request to expunge the Certificate of Tax Lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 28, 2017, the Kohns filed a petition for declaratory judgment in their favor and against Director Walters and the DOR, requesting that the trial court declare that collection of the taxes pursuant to the Certificate of Tax Lien was barred by the statute of limitations, \u00a7 516.120(2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the trial court direct the Director on behalf of the DOR to file a satisfaction of judgment with the circuit court. The DOR moved to dismiss the Kohns' petition, arguing that \"[u]pon receiving their Notice of Deficiency for the 2001 tax year, Plaintiffs failed to utilize the administrative processes in place to appeal such matters,\" and that \"the statute of\n   limitations is not applicable\" to the filing of a tax lien. The trial court dismissed the Kohns' petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, finding as a matter of law that section 516.120(2) was not applicable to section 143.902.1 because statutes of limitation govern causes of action, and the filing of a tax lien is not a cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Kohns timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"We review the trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    DeFoe v.
