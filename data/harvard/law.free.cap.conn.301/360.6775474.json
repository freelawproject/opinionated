The petitioner contends that the habeas court improperly rejected his challenge to his indeterminate sentence on the basis of that court\u2019s conclusion that the statute only applies prospectively. This court recently rejected an identical argument advanced by the petitioner in <em>Castonguay </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>300 Conn. 649, 16 A.3d 676 (2011), a case that is indistinguishable from the present case as to the material facts. Because <em>Castonguay </em>controls, which the petitioner in the present case concedes, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-13\"> The petitioner appealed from the judgment of the habeas court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
