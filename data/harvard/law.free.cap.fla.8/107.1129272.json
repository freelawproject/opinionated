It has been generally understood that both these boys belonged to Mrs. Caroline Mattair, Witness knows that Henry Mattair has been refused credit repeatedly, as far back as 1850, on account of the negroes belonging to Ms wife. He has several times tried to sell these negroes, but his wife would not agree to it, and the trades were abandoned. The firm of S.'L. Niblack &amp; Co. was composed of William IT. Tison, the plaintiff in execution, and S. L. Niblack. S. L. Niblack, one of the firm, knew that these negroes belonged to Mrs. Cai\u2019oline Mattair before this debt was created.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">Asa A. Stewart, another witness for claimant, testified that in 1838 the negx\u2019oes Primus and Bill belonged to Henry Jones, the father of the claimant. Witness was told by Jones that he had deeded certain property to his children already married, and that he would deed certain property to his daxxghter Caroline when she married, and mentioned the negro boy Px\u2019imus as one he would give or deed to her. After Caroline married, the boy Primus went immediately into her possession, and her father Jones called him Caroline\u2019s negro. It has been generally known that these negx\u2019oes belonged to Mrs. Mattair for yeax\u2019s back, at least for eight years back.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">Douglas O\u2019Neil, another witness for the claimant, testified that he heard Henry Jones declare, in relation to certain property which he had given to his daughter Cax\u2019oline, that he was going to make it safe to her and to her children, that she was not in good health and that he intended that what he gave her should be secure so that she might always have the benefit of it, and not be subject to any per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>son\u2019s debts, and that the boy Primus was one of the negroes that was given to Caroline Mattair-. The two boys have always been considered Mrs. Caroline Mattair\u2019s. Henry Mattair is a dissipated, improvident man, and Henry Jones knew the fact. Has heard Jones express this as one of the reasons for his giving the- property to his daughter separately.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\">Charles B. Collins, another witness for the claimant, testified that he was called upon by Henry Jones, while he, witness, was Clerk of the Court, to draw a deed, which he did, and in that deed he gave to his daughter, Mrs. Caroline Mattair, certain negroes. To the best of witness\u2019 recollection, the negroes were Primus, Bill and Clarissa, which negroes he gave to his daughter Caroline Mattair during her natural life, and at her death to go to her children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">In the opinion pronounced by the judge in the Court below, it is stated, that it \u201c further appears from the record that said Henry Mattair became indebted to S.

That section reads as follows : \u201c Married women may hereafter,\u201d &amp;c. (See Thomp. Dig., 221.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>To this we reply, that before the passage of this act the said slave had become the property, by an absolute title, of the husband Henry Mattair. Having been conveyed by Henry Jones, in 1840, to his daughter Caroline Mattair, (then married,) by a deed which, had she been a <em>feme </em>sole, would have vested a fee simple right in said Caroline, (see Watts v. Clardy, 2 Florida R., 390,) said slave became <em>at once, </em>in accordance with the well-established principles of the common law, the absolute property of the husband. We feel that we should, first beg pardon of the Court before arguing so plain a proposition, yet as it is decisive \u00f3f the case, we adduce a few authorities, confining ourselves to the most elementary text-books, viz:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">Koper\u2019s Husband and Wife: <em>\u201cMarriage </em>is an absolute gift to the husband of all the goods, personal chattels and estate which the wife was actually and beneficially possessed of at that time in her own right, and of such other-goods and personal chattels <em>as come to Tier during the ma/rriage </em>\u2014 Wol. 1, p. 166.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\">Bright\u2019s Husband and Wife is to the same effect, nearly in the same words : \u201c Marriage is an absolute gift to the husband of the goods, personal chattels and estate of which the wife was actually and beneficially possessed, at the time of the marriage, in her own right, and of such goods and personal chattels as come to her during marriage.\u201d \u2014 \u25a0 1 Bright\u2019s H. <em>&amp; </em>W., p. 34.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">\u201cBut, as to chattels personal in possession which the wife hath in her own right, (says Blackstone,) as ready money, jewels, household goods and the like, the husband hath therein an immediate and absolute property, devolved to him by the marriage, not only potentially but in fact, which never can again <em>revest </em>in the wife.\u201d \u2014 2 Com., 435.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-8\">Broom\u2019s Commentaries on the Common Law may be referred to in the same connection, <em>(vide </em>p. 417.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>In Comyn\u2019s Dig., (Baron <em>&amp; </em>Feme,) it is said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">\u201c So if chattels are given to the wife after coverture, the interest vests in the husband.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">\"We will trouble the Court with but one or two reported cases decided in accordance with these well-established principles. In the case of Carne vs. Brice and another, (M. <em>&amp; </em>W. Exchequer R., vol. 7, p. 183,) it was held by all the Barons, that \u201cthe property in wearing apparel bought for herself by a wife living with her husband, out of money settled to her separate use before marriage and paid to her by the trustees of the settlement, vests by law in the husband and is liable to be taken in execution for his debts.\u201d See also Bird &amp; Pegram, 76 English Com. R., p. 638; Wash <em>barn vs. </em>Hale, 10 Pickering, 429, and Grisworld vs. Pennyman, 2 Conn., 564, (cited in notes to Bright on H. and W., vol. 1, p. 37.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-7\">But it is said that there is no evidence that the husband \u201c ever received this negro solely in the exercise of his marital rights and for the purpose of its appropriation to his own use.\u201d To which we answer that there <em>is </em>evidence, positive and explicit, of the husband\u2019s possession for years anterior to the act of 1845, from which possession the presumption of law is that he was in possession <em>as </em>owner, and it is for those who contend that he held possession for his wife (were not such a holding at common law an absurdity,) to show that he held in any other capacity than as owner. But we affirm that such a holding before the act of 1845 was an absurdity. The husband could not, had he desired so to do, hold personal property (not settled upon his wife) as her agent, so that his possession should ibe hers. The existence of the wife being merged in the husband, her possession would indeed be his, but not his hers. \u201c Whatever may have been the intent of the hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>band, (say the Supreme Court of Mass., in Washburn vs. Hale,) looking at it as a mere legal question, as the court are bound to do, the gift of money by a husband to his wife is merely void.\u201d \u2014 (Quoted in notes to 1 Bright\u2019s Husband and Wife, p. 37.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">The circuit judge has attempted to sustain his decision by reference to the ruling of the Supreme Court of New York in Holmes vs. Holmes, 4 Barb., 299. \u2014 a ruling deemed by his honor \u201cpeculiarly in point,\u201d being, as he says, \u201c under the same statute passed in that State.\u201d And we apprehend we have here the key to the error committed by the judge below in his ruling. The statute of New York is <em>not </em>the same as that of Florida. True, its first section tallies substantially with the first section of the Florida act, as does its third with our second; but then there is the second section of the New York act, designed, however abortively, to secure to women already married at the time of its passage, property previously theirs, <em>to which there is [,no corresponding section in the Florida law! </em>And it\"is under that section expressly cited that the case of Holmes vs. Holmes was ruled. It is in the following words : \u201c The real and personal property and rents, issues and profits thereof of any female <em>now married, </em>shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband, but shall be her sole and separate property, as if she were a single female,\u201d &amp;c. How different are the terms and purposes of this second section of the New York act from the second section of the Florida act, is seen by reference to the first line of the latter, as follows : \u201cMarried women may <em>hereafter </em>become seized or possessed of real and personal property during coverture, by bequest,\u201d &amp;c. The purpose of the New York second section was to give to women already married a title to property acquired by them <em>previous </em>to the passage of the act; that of the Florida second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>section to give to married women, whether married or not at the date of the act, their <em>future </em>acquisition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-5\">Having thus briefly compared the provisions of the two acts, let us see what have been the rulings of the New York courts under their statute. His honor, our 'Circuit Judge, in rendering his opinion, had manifestly before him two New York decisions, viz: Snyder vs. Snyder, 3 Barb. S. C. Reports, 62, and Holmes vs. Holmes, 4 Barb., 295. He quotes from both, though only the latter is formally cited. When (for example) he says, \u201c the true construction of this second section, therefore, is, that so far as there shall be any property upon which the law could operate, the same provisions contained in the first section for the protection of the property of females who should marry after the passage of this act, should be applicable to the property of females married before t'he passage of the act,\u201d he quotes nearly <em>verbatim </em>from <em>Snyder vs. </em>Snyder, 3 Barb. When, subsequently, however, his Honor is arguing to show that the negro, even though proved to be in the possession of the husband, must, so 'long as it could be traced, be deemed the wife\u2019s, he quotes expressly from Holmes vs. Holmes, 4 Barb. We need not repeat, that both these decisions were upon a section of the New York act not found in that of Florida. What we call to the especial attention of the Court is, that <em>both of these decisions are against the claimant </em>in the case now at bar. In Snyder vs. Snyder, Harris, J., ruled, that \u201cthere is nothing in the language of this section which indicates that the Legisla, ture intended it should apply to the property which such females had at the time of the marriage or had acquired during coverture. On the contrary, the husband had, by virtue of the marriage, acquired a legal title to such property, and in no proper sense <em>could it be said to be the property of the wife.\u201d </em>And so the judge decided against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the claim of the wife. In Holmes vs. Holmes, Barcnlo, J., although when he says (as quoted by our Circuit Court) that \u201c the act in question, if valid, most clearly gives this money to the plaintiff,\u201d (the wife,) he would seem to create hopes in favor of Mrs. Mattair, very summarily and effectively dashes them by deciding <em>against its </em>validity, because, 1st, \u201cit is beyond the scope of legislative authority to destroy vested rights of property;\u201d 2d, because \u201c a violation of that clause in the Constitution of the State which declares that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or <em>property </em>without due process of law ;\u201d and, 3d, because, \u201c as regards the rights of property existing prior to its passage, by virtue of the marriage relation, <em>it impairs a contract within the inhibition of the Federal Constitution.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-5\">Our opponents, then, are placed between the two horns of a dilemma, from <em>both </em>of which it is impossible for them to escape without a fatal goring. If they fly to Snyder vs. Snyder, we meet them with the language of Judge Harris, \u201c that as to such property as the female had at the time of the marriage, or had acquired during coverture, the husband, by virtue of the marriage, acquired a legal title to such property, and in no proper sense could it be said to be the property of the wife.\u201d Do they fall back upon Holmes vs. Holmes, we reply in the words of Judge Barculo, used in that case: \u201c It is impossible, therefore, in my opinion, to avoid the conclusion that the act of April 7, 1848,\u201d (corresponding to ours of March 6, 1845,) \u201c so far it is intended to affect <em>existing rights of property in married </em>persons, <em>is unconstitutional and void.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-6\">But mark! both of the fore-recited decisions were made on the second section of the New York act, with which no section of the Florida act corresponds; and, though the 3d section of the New York statute <em>is </em>substantially the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>as the second of the Florida statute, yet no one in the New York courts seems to have contended that their 3d section conld or was intended to affect rights of property existing at the time of its passage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-5\">In conclusion, we refer the Court to the late New York case of Perkins vs. Cottrell, 15 Barb., 446, in which it seems to have been definitely settled that \u201c the second section of the act of 1848 \u201d was intended to apply only to property acquired after its passage and taking effect; also to Westervelt vs. Gregg, 2 Kernan, 202, (U. S. Dig., vol. 16, p. 344,) where it is held that \u201cthe statute of New York of 1848, for the better protection of the property of married women, cannot divest the husband of his right to a legacy to his wife under the will of a person deceased in 1840, and to obtain payment of which legal proceedings had been commenced by the husband and wife before the passage of the act, although the legacy had not been reduced to possession.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b117-6\">BALTZELL, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIp\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">This is a claim on the part of Mrs. Caroline Mattair to a negro boy, Primus, levied upon to pay her husband\u2019s debts, under the execution of the plaintiff, Tison. Her title is asserted through a deed of gift from her father, Henry Jones, \u201c to his youngest daughter, for and in consideration of natural love and affection, <em>to her and the heirs of h&amp;r body </em>\u2014 the said Caroline Mattair and her immediate offspring to have and to hold the above described property to <em>their own proper use and behoof </em>forever.\u201d From the proof in the case the property came to the possession of her husband, Henry Mattair, immediately after the marriage, about the year 1840, and has so continued ever since. Whether it shall be regarded as the possession of the wife, will depend upon the words and language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>of this deed. If it creates a separate estate, independent of the husband, possession will follow the right, and he be regarded as holding for her, and his possession be hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u201c The words, <em>to and for her usef </em>\u201c in a gift to a <em>feme </em>have been adjudicated insufficient to create a separate estate \u2014 so determined by the master of the Rolls, and his decision afterwards affirmed by the Chancellor.\u201d Jacobs v. Amyatt, 1 Mad. 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In Johns v. Lockheart, it was held \u201cthat a legacy to a <em>feme covert </em>to her <em>own </em>use and benefit,\u201d is not to her separate use \u2014 (note to 3 Brown\u2019s Chy. Rep. p. 318.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In five subsequent cases in'the English Courts, the same doctrine has been held. Wills v. Sayer, 4 Mad. 409; Rob.erts v. Spicer, 5 Mad. 491. In the case of Kensington v. Holland, it is said \u201c a gift to a wife \u00a3 for her own use and benefit\u2019 does not clearly express such intention, nor to a husband for a wife\u2019s own use and benefit.\u201d 2 Myl. &amp; Keen, 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">In Tilor v. Lake, the words \u201c to be paid \u00a3 into her own proper hands for her own use and benefit,\u2019 were held insufficient.\u201d 4 Simons, 144. So as also <em>\u201c </em>the words \u00a3 to her own proper use and benefit,\u2019 were held insufficient.\u201d 2 Hare, 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">It is not pretended that the word \u201c behoof\u201d in this deed adds any thing to the other words. It seems to be equivalent to \u201c benefit\u201d in the cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">In Alabama, it has been held that the \u201c words <em>\u2018 </em>to the use and <em>behoof o\u00ed </em>the wife\u2019 and \u00a3 to have the use and benefit of the labor and services of the said slaves and all the proceeds thereof during her life,\u2019 do not create a separate estate.\u201d Scott v. Abercrombie, 14 Ala. 270 \u2014 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Abundant other cases to the same effect will be found in the American Courts, but it is unnecessary to extend them.</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">It is said that the authorities \u201c afford but an uncertain\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>light to guide the footsteps of the enquirer after truth, and we are remitted to the application of elementary principles \u201c as the only unerring guide to correct conclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">How the inference is attained that there is an uncertain light on this subject, it is difficult to understand. The eight cases referred to above are directly in point, and have not been overruled. If they are, it has not been shown to the court, nor have we been able to find any such in our extended examination and reseai'ch. So far fi\u2019om it, the text books in England speak of the law as settled, thus \u2014 \u25a0 \u201c expressions which have been held insufficient to raise a trust for the wife\u2019s separate estate are \u2018 to be paid to her and for her use,\u2019 \u2018to her own use and benefit.\u2019 \u201d 2 Roper, Husband and Wife, 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u201c However the intention to create a sepaz\u2019ate estate must be clearly and unequivocally expressed in order to depzdve the husband of his marital lights.

So far from .uncertainty, there is entire unanimity, full harmony and accord of opinion. And when it is remembered that these decisions were given by the Court of Chancery in England in its highest estate, composed of the first intellects, men renowned for their integrity, to which is to be added the concurrence of our own judges, jurists and lawyers of highest intelligence, standing and character, there will be found no little hazard in the assertion that there is uncertainty. If eight decisions on the very question, without a single one overrulling or in opposition, with the <em>fall </em>concurrence of the American Courts and elementary writers, both in this country and England, will not settle a point, will produce uncertainty, what is to be regarded as adequate to effect certainty and to remove doubts ?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">This uncertainty, it is said, makes it necessary to resort to <em>elementary </em>principles, and that these give a separate estate to the wife. They will be found to be to this effect: \u201c By marriage the husband and wife are as one person in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>law. The very being or legal existence of tbe woman was by the ancient common-law suspended during tbe continuance of marriage, wbicb gives an absolute right to tbe bus-band in all bis wife\u2019s chattels, personal in possession, a qualified right to her cboses in action, and a conditional right to chattels real, if be survive her, irrespective of bis right to alien them at bis pleasure during her life-time. Tbe husband becomes liable for all debts and obligations of bis wife incurred before tbe coverture. The reasons upon wbicb tbe law virtually suspends tbe existence of the woman during coverture, appear to be those first for her husband\u2019s safety in depriving her of tbe power to injur\u00e9 him by any act\u00bf without bis concurrence or bis assent, either expressed or implied-, and secondly for her own security in guarding against tbe husband\u2019s influence over her, by disabling her from disposing of her own property, except by those methods and with tbe solemnities wbicb th\u00e9 law itself prescribed.\u201d 1 Bopers, Husband and wife, p. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\"><em>\u201c </em>It is well known that tbe strict rules of tbe old common law would not permit tbe wife to take or enjoy any real or personal estate, separate from or independent from her husband.\u201d 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Such were tbe elementary principles governing this relation and tbe property belonging to or conveyed to the wife, when tbe Courts of Equity in tbe beginning of tbe last century recognized a separate interest and estate in her.

It will appear from the cases that the strongest evidence of intended generosity and of bounty towards the wife will not be sufficient to-give her a separate estate, unless in addition language be used by the donor clearly expressing the exclusion of the husband, or else directions be given with respect to the enjoyment of the gift wholly incompatible with any dominion of the husband.\u201d Clancey, 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u201c The intention to create a separate estate must be clearly and unequivocally expressed, in order to deprive the husband of his marital rights; And in modern times, judges have required much more stringent expressions for this purpose, than were once considered sufficient.\u201d Hill on Trustees, 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The decisions in South Carolina are accordant with these views. \u201c The bequest is to her. This gives an absolute estate in personal property, and she would have the absolute right to dispose of it during her life, or at her death,. unless she were a married woman and and thus disqualiby law from exercising acts of ownership over it, in which\" case her being and her rights are blended with her husband\u2019s. The addition of the words (at her disposal at her death,) do not of themselves add to or enlarge her interest in or power over the property previously bequeathed to her. If it had been intended to give her a sole and separate estate, free from the control of her husband, not subject to-his debts, and subject to her disposition by deed or will, it-would have been easy to have made such provision, and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the law is so desirous to extend to the citizens the right of disposing of their property, according to their affections, wishes and even caprices, that it will recognize and give effect to such departure from the general rule. It does, however, require that the expression of such intent should be plain, explicit and unequivocal, else there will be a continual conflict from the desire to raise up implication of an intention to give a sole and separate estate to the wife from slight expressions, leading to unceasing litigation.\u201d This was a bequest to a wife of personal property to her, and at her disposal at her death, and was held not to exclude the marital rights. Graham v. Graham\u2019s Exrs. 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The elementary principles appealed to, plainly and manifestly in this case give the property to the husband; for if the intent be not plain, explicit and unequivocal, if there be \u201c an uncertain light \u201d as to the meaning of the words and language of the instrument, then, by the elementary principles prevailing, as well at law as in equity, the, separate estate is not created, but the property is subject to the marital rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Again, it is urged that <em>\u201c </em>intention, relation of the parties and the context, exercise an important relation,\u201d and it is argued that the fact of \u201c this lady\u2019s being a married woman when the gift was made, is a circumstance from which the intent should be inferred.\u201d The opposite of this is clearly shown by the authorities already adduced, but more clearly in the decision made at a very early period, in which \u201c H. B. bequeathed \u00a3100 to the plaintiff\u2019s wife, to be paid within six months after the testator\u2019s death, and a bill being filed by the husband for this legacy against the executor, his defence was that he had paid the wife and had her receipt for the money, and it was argued for the defendant the executor, that it must have been the intention of the testator to have bequeathed this sum for the separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>maintenance of the wife, for that at the time of making the will the plaintiff and wife lived separately, and that she was much straightened in her circumstances, which was known to tire testator. However, the Lord Keeper held it to be no good payment.\u201d \u2014 1 Raith. Vern., 261; Clancey, 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">If our own opinions were less fixed on the subject, we should feel great reluctance in disturbing a rule of property prevailing so long and with such universal acceptance and approval. It is nearly a century since the first decision was made. Since then there is not one, but \u201c many decisions,\u201d \u201c successive determinations,\u201d a \u201clong series of authority \u201d \u201c and a train of decisions,\u201d all according, none opposing \u2014 not a dissent \u2014 so that there is no longer pretext for calling the principle ip question. \u201c <em>lies adgudieata stare </em>deeisis, is a first principle in the administration of justice \u2014 it is one of the most sacred in law.\u201d \u201c Whatever the private opinion of a judge may be, it is safer to conform to established decisions, particularly in the House of Lords, but if not, the errors of great judges^ acquiesced in for a series of years, ought to be adhered to. If mischief appear, the <em>Legislature </em>may interfere, <em>but it is too much for the Courts. </em>Upon the faith of an established rule and the acquiescence of judges and of the whole nation in it, property to the amount of millions may depend.\u201d \u2014 Earn on Legal Judgments, 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u201cEvery innovation occasions more harm and derangement of order, by its very novelty, than benefit by its actual utility.

He also proved that Henry Mattair, the defendant in execution and the husband of the claimant, had been in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>possession of the slave; from the'year 1840 or 1841, down to the date of the levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The claimant adduced in evidence a deed of gift from her father, Henry Jones, dated the 3rd day of November; 1840, purporting to convey the said slave t\u00a3 to Caroline Mattair, wife of Henry Mattair, and the heirs of her body,\u201d with <em>habendum </em>to tc the said Caroline Mattair and her immediate <em>offspring </em>\u2014 to <em>their own proper use and be-hoof forever.\u201d </em>It further appeared in evidence that the deed produced on the trial was a copy of the original which had been properly recorded, but which, together with the record of the same, had been destroyed in the fire which consumed the records and papers belonging to the clerk\u2019s office of Columbia county. This established Copy was also recorded on the 2nd day of February, 1848. It was also in evidence that the debt upon which the judgment was founded, consisted of two promissory notes of the said defendant in execution \u2014 the one dated on the 29th of January, 1853, and the other on the 20th of March, 1854. It further appeared that at the time that these notes were given, the plaintiff in execution had full notice of the existence of the deed of gift, and that it had been recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The Court gave judgment for the claimant, and from that judgment an appeal has been taken to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">At the hearing before us, the counsel on both sides argued the cause, as though it were to be governed by the provisions'of the statute known as \u201cthe married woman\u2019s law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">For the plaintiff in execution, it was insisted that the act referred to could not be made to operate retroactively, and the property having been acquired anterior to the passage of the act, it was not protected by its provisions, \u2022\u00a1unless by the terms of the deed it had been secured to the wife as <em>$ep&gt;arate property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>For the claimant, it was contended, that although the terms of the deed should not be found to convey a <em>separate estate to </em>the wife, yet, inasmuch as the possession of the husband was only the possession of the wife, and he had never exercised any act of ownership over the property inconsistent with the title of the wife, or attempted to deal with the same as his own; and, inasmuch as the credit extended to the husband transpired subsequent to the passage of the act, the provisions of the same operated to secure the property to the wife immediately from the date of the enactment. I do not concur in this position ; for, if the slave was not the <em>separate property </em>of the wife at the time of its acquisition and before the passage of the act, there is nothing in its provisions which will give it a retroactive operation, and even if there were, I doubt whether such a provision could be enforced without an infraction of the Constitution. My opinion is, that the case must be decided upon common law principles and without any reference to our statute. The simple question, then, presented for consideration is, did the terms of the deed secure to the wife a <em>separate estate </em>in the slave? The words of conveyance in this deed are, \u201cto Caroline Mattair, wife of Henry Mattair, and the heirs of her body.\u201d These words, when applied to <em>personalty ^ </em>it is well settled, convey an <em>absolute </em>title to the grantee or first taker. The words of the <em>habendum </em>are, \u201c to the said Caroline Mattair and her immediate <em>offspring </em>\u2014 to <em>their own proper use and behoof </em>forever.\u201d It is upon the effect to be given to these latter words that this case is to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Upon proceeding in this investigation, it is painful to discover in the adjudicated cases the extraordinary conflict which prevails upon the subject. In the English cases, of equal character and authority, the same identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>words are interpreted to signify a diametrically opposite meaning. While one authority will hold the particular words to secure a separate estate to the wife, another will hold the same words to convey the estate to the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">It has been held that the words \u201c for her own use and at her own disposal,\u201d created a separate estate-for the wife, and barred the marital rights of the husband'. \u2014 (Prichard vs. Ames, 1 Turn. &amp; Russ., 222; Inglefield vs. Coghlan, 2 Coll., 247.) So also the words, \u201c for her own use and benefit, independent of any other person.\u201d \u2014 (Margetts vs. Barrenger, 7 Sim., 482.) So too the words \u201cfor her livelihood,\u201d (Darly vs. Darly, 8 Atkins, 899,) or \u201c that she should receive and enjoy the issue and profits.\u201d \u2014 (Tyrell vs. Hope, 2 Atkins, 558.). So where the direction is that \u201c the interest and profits be paid to her, and the principal to her, or to her order,, by note in writing under her hand;\u201d \u2014 (Hulmne vs. Terrant, 1 Bro. C. C., 16;) or \u201cher receipt to be ajsufficient discharge;\u201d \u2014 (Lee vs. Prieaux, 3 Bro. C. C., 381;) or \u201cto be delivered to her on demand.\u201d' (Dixon vs. Olmins, 2 Cox, 414.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">On the other hand, it has been held that the words \u201c to-pay to her (a married -woman) and her assigns,\u201d do not create a separate use for the wife. \u2014 (Dakins vs. Berrisford, 1 Ch. C., 194;) or where the gift is \u201cto her use; \u2014 (Jacobs vs. Amyatt, 1 Mad., 379;) or \u201cto her own use and benefit ;\u201d \u2014 (Johnes vs. Lockhart, cited 3 Bro. C. C., 383;) or \u201c to her absolute <em>use;\u201d </em>\u2014 (ex <em>parte </em>Abbott, 1 Deac., 338 ;) or when the payment is- directed to be made \u201c into her own proper hands, to and for her own use and benefit;\u201d \u2014 - (Tyler vs. Lake, 4 Sim., 144;) or \u201cto her own proper use and benefit ;\u201d- \u2014 (Blacklow vs. Laws, 2 Hare, 49;) or when-the property is \u201c to be under her sole control;\u201d \u2014 (Massy vs. Parker, 2 My. <em>&amp; </em>Keene, 674.) So also a bequest to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u25a0woman and her assigns for her life, \u201c for her. and their \u2022own absolute use and benefit,\u201d has been held not to confer upon her a separate estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The foregoing citations are taken from the English reports, but, so far as I have had access to the American adjudications, I doubt if they will be found to afford any clearer light upon the subject. By a critical comparison of the words and their import which have been held to create a separate estate, and those which have been held not to do so, it will be seen that, where there have been no terms which expressly excluded the marital rights of the husband, the decision in the particular case has been purely arbitrary, and not conformable to any well-defined rule of interpretation. This being the case, they afford but an uncertain light to guide the footsteps of the enquirer after truth, and we are remitted at last to the application of elementary principles, the only unerring guide to correct conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">It is well settled, that no particular form of words is necessary in order to vest property in a married woman to her separate use,; but the intention to give her such an interest, in opposition to the legal rights of her husband, must be clear and unequivocal. On the other hand, whenever it appears, either from the nature of the transaction, as in the instance of a settlement in the contemplation of marriage, where the husband is a party, or from the whole context of the instrument, limiting to the wife the property, that she was intended to have it to her sole use, that intention will be carried into effect by a court of equity. \u2014 \u25a0 2 Bright\u2019s Husband and \"Wife, 210; Leading Oases in Equity, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">It will thus be seen that the question is made to turn entirely on intention, and that where resort is to be had to implication, in order to ascertain that intention, the <em>no</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>twe </em>of the transaction, the <em>relation </em>of the parties and the <em>context </em>of the instrument, will exercise an important bearing upon the question. To my mind, these circumstances are well entitled to be received as <em>indicia </em>of intention, and are of greater weight than any loose form of words, which have no technical or fixed signification. With reference to the <em>nature </em>of the transaction, we can well conceive that where the deed is made to a/erne in contemplation of an immediate marriage, the intention to secure to her a separate estate would be much more apparent than if it were made under ordinary circumstances. So, too, in respect to the <em>relation </em>of the parties : if the gift were from the husband, or he were a party to the deed, the presumption would be very strong that a separate estate were intended to be secured to the wife; for, to what purpose would he give the property, or become a party to the instrument, unless with the intention to bar his marital rights ? So also with respect to the context, where different expressions occur in the deed, it will not be inferred that it was the intention of the donor to apply one and the same meaning to the different expressions. This is illustrated by the decision in the case of Kensington v. Holland (2Mylne <em>&amp; </em>Keene, 184.) In that case, there was a settlement upon Harriet Elizabeth O\u2019Harra for, and during her life, \u201c to and for her own sole and separate use, <em>independent of, and without being subject to the </em>control, <em>debts or engagements of her </em>husbandIn the same deed the remainder, after the expiration of the life estate, was settled upon Maria Theresa Holland, wife of Erancis Holland, her executors, administrators and assigns, \u201c <em>to and for her and their own use and </em>benefit.\u201d A bill was filed by the assignee of the husband, to subject this remainder interest to the payment of his debts, and it was contended in behalf of the wife, that it was her separate estate under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the operation of the words, <em>\u201c </em>to and for her and their own use and benefit.\u201d ' The Master of the Bolls decided against her claim, and in his opinion delivered in the case said: <em>\u201c </em>The intention to give a separate estate must be clearly expressed. A gift to a wife for her own use and benefit, does not clearly express such an intention ; <em>more especially </em>when it is considered, that in this case a trust for the separate use of a married woman is clearly expressed in the preceding part of the settlement. The court cannot infer that the same effect was intended to be given to different expressions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The case of Tyler v. Lake, (4 Sim. 144,) furnishes another authority for resorting to the context of the deed in order to determine the intention of the donor, where the expressions used in the instrument are ambiguous. By a deed declaring the trusts of the proceeds of real estates, the share of a married daughter of the grantor was directed \u201c to be paid into her proper hands for her own use and benefit;\u201d and the same words were used in declaring the trusts of the shares of the grantor\u2019s sons. In commenting upon the case, the Nice Chancellor observed \u2014 \u201c Supposing that it were ambiguous in this case, what is the meaning of the words relied on ? The will itself has given us a power of construing them ; for it must be supposed that the settlor intended the same in one gift as in the other. Now in the gift to William Tyler, the settlor has used the same words as in the gift to Mrs. Anthony, but it cannot be supposed that she intended, by using those words, to give him any peculiar power, over the property which he was to take, except what is implied in the gift, and therefore I am bound to say that in the gift to Mrs. Anthony, those words are to be taken as mere words of gift, and not as conferring on her any peculiar power over the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>These cases abundantly illustrate the correctness of my position, that where the words in the deed are ambiguous, resort may legitimately be had to the circumstances arising out of the nature of the transaction, the relation of the parties, and the context of the instrument, as <em>indicia </em>\u2022of the intention. In other words, that each case must furnish its own lights, and that we are to be guided to a conclusion rather by those lights than by the <em>arbitrary rulings </em>upon particular words, which have been made regardless of the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Applying these views to the deed under consideration, and trying it by the tests above indicated, and I think there \u25a0can be but little doubt as to the <em>intention </em>of the donor, when he used the words1 \u2014 \u201c to their own proper use and behoof forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">If we refer to the <em>nature of the </em>transaction, it will be found that this was a gift to a woman, who was at the time under the <em>disability of coverture. </em>If it were not the intention of the donor to give her a separate estate in the property, .and to bar the marital rights of the husband, why was the deed made to her? We certainly cannot impute to the donor an ignorance of the fact, that, at common law, personal property given to the wife inures absolutely to the husband. There musthave been some object contemplated in making the wife the donee in the deed. I do not insist that this circumstance taken alone, is sufficient to fix an intention to create a separate estate, but I enumerate it as only one of the <em>indicia </em>of such an intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">And as to <em>the relation of the parties: </em>\u2014 This is not an ordinary purchase by the wife for value; but it is a voluntary gift from a parent to a married daughter, founded \u25a0upon the consideration of \u201c natural love and affection.\u201d The object doubtless, in making the deed to her, was <em>to </em>provide for the comfortable support and maintenance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>her and her children, and to guard against the casualties which might befall the husband\u2019s fortune. This view of the case is in accordance with the tender regard which every parent must be supposed to entertain for the welfare of his offspring. But neither do I consider this circumstance, isolated and alone, as sufficient <em>to </em>bar the marital rights of the husband. It is only mentioned as one of the guides to the intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">TTpon the next circumstance, however, to wit: <em>the context </em>of the deed, I do lay great stress, and I think it sufficiently potent of itself to fix the true signification and meaning of the words, <em>\u201c </em>to their own proper use and be-hoof forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">By reference to the deed it will be seen that the property was conveyed to her, \u201c <em>and the heirs of her body.\u201d </em>Now there must have been some object contemplated by the donor in thus attempting to limit the property \u201c to the-heirs of her body.\u201d That object evidently was to give the wife a life estate, with remainder over to her children, and thus to bar the estate of the husband. It is true that from ignorance of a well established rule of law, that object of the donor was frustrated ; but the failure to effectuate the obj ect by no means lessens the potency of the words, when considered as a means of interpreting the true meaning of the deed. In this connection, the words are to be considered, not with reference to their legal effect, but only as <em>indicia </em>of the intention. If there be any force in this view of the matter, then is it greatly strengthened by the fact, that the same effort to limit the estate is repeated in the <em>habendum </em>clause of the deed, where the words used are \u201c to her and to her immediate offspring.\u201d\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">After the most anxious deliberation upon this subject, and with an earnest desire to concur with the views of my brethren if possible, I am constrained to hold that the deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>in question does secure to Mrs. Mattair a <em>separate estate </em>in the slave levied upon, and that he is not subject to the debts of the husband. I therefore <em>dissent </em>from the judgment of reversal, pronounced by this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
