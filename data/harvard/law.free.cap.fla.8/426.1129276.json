Hartridge &amp; Co., Defendant in Error.</parties>\n<summary data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">This was an action of assumpsit, brought by the plaintiff in error against the defendant in error in the Circuit Court of Duval county. The bill of exceptions, signed by the Judge, states that the jury rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $672 01; that on the day following the said verdict the defendant\u2019s counsel entered a motion for a new trial upon the following grounds, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">1st. That the verdict is contrary to evidence and the weight of evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">2d. That the ruling of the Court was contrary to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-8\">3d.

On the ground of newly discovered evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-10\">\"Whereupon, and before the defendant\u2019s counsel proceeded with his argument, the Court announced to him that it had made no ruling on the point, and, the counsel not pressing the other points, the motion for a new trial was denied; that on the 27th day of October, A. D., 1858, another motion for reconsideration of the said motion for a\u2019 new trial was argued, which second motion was entered upon the motion docket on the 26th day of October, A. D. 1858, and in support of said motion the said counsel for the defendant filed an affidavit, setting forth the grounds of said motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-11\">The counsel of the plaintiff objected to the said motion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-12\">1st. That he had no notice of said motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-13\">2d. That the ground of this motion had already been adjudicated by the denial of a new trial under the first motion, and for other reasons, to wit: That the defendant\u2019s counsel having abandoned his defence on the trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>consented to a verdict, he could not be entitled to another trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">The Court, upon the hearing of said motion, granted a new trial upon the said affidavit of defendant\u2019s counsel alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">To which order of the Court, allowing and granting a new trial in said cause, the counsel for plaintiff then and there excepted and prayed the Court to seal his bill of exceptions, which was done accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-7\">The law of this State, entitled \u201c an act in addition to and amendatory of the several acts concerning writs of error and appeals to the Supreme Court,\u201d appoved January 7, 1853, (Pamphlet Laws 1852-3, page 100,) in the first section provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-8\">\u201c That from and after the passage of this act, all orders and judgments of the Circuit Courts of this State, made and passed in any cause therein, wherein the said Courts shall allow and grant, or shall refuse to allow and grant any motion for new trial, or any motion to amend the pleadings, or to file new or additional pleadings, or to amend the record of any cause during the term of the Court in which it was determined, or shall refuse to allow and grant a motion for continuance of the cause, shall and may be assigned for matter and cause of error, upon any writ of error sued out or appeal taken to the Supreme Court, and the said Supreme Court shall hear and determine the matter so assigned for error, in the same manner and under like rules and regulations as in other cases.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-9\">Te second section provides :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-10\">\u201cThat in all cases enumerated in the preceding section of this act, the party aggrieved by any such order or judgment, shall make his exception thereto in writing, and shall insert therein all such evidence, affidavits, amendment of pleadings, and all other matters which do not pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>perly appear of record, which were considered by the Court below, or which were offered to the consideration o^ the Court below, and should have been considered in the making and passing said order and judgment, and the said exception shall be tendered to the Judge of the Circuit Court for his signature, in the same manner and under the same rules, regulations and provisions as bills of exception are now by law made up, signed and made part of the record.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">The third section provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\">\u201c And whereas, the construction which has been given to the law regulating appeals in cases in equity, whereby appeals are refused after the merits of the cause have been passed upon, because of some reference for account, or some other matter, is productive of unnecessary delay and inconvenience, and sometimes of useless'expense in taking the accounts, because of the reversal of the decree ascertaining the rights of the parties litigant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-7\"><em>Be it therefore </em>enacted, That appeals may be taken and prosecuted' from any interlocutory order, decision, judgment or decree of the Circuit Courts of this State, when sitting as Courts of Equity: <em>Provided always, however, </em>That such appeal shall not operate as a supersedeas, unless the Judge of the Circuit Court, or a Justice of the Supreme Court, on inspection of the record, shall think fit to order and direct a stay of proceedings: <em>And provided further, </em>That no appeal so allowed shall operate as a supersedeas, except on the conditions now prescribed by law in cases of appeals from final judgments and decrees.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-8\"><em>Philip Fraser </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-9\">The Supreme Court of this State is a creature of the Constitution.

These are the powers incident to the Court as the law stood previous to the act of 1853. Under this law, the Court had no power to revise the proceedings of the Court below, either at law or in Chancery, until after a final judgment, sentence or decree. \u2014 Thompson\u2019s Digest, 449.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-9\">At common law, appeals from Courts of Equity might be brought upon any interlocutory matter, but at law, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>writ of error could be brought upon nothing but only a definitive judgment. \u2014 2 Black. Com., 46.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-5\">In this respect our iaw differs from the common law, because, under our statute, appeals and writs of error in law and chancery causes were put upon the same basis, and would not lie until after a <em>final </em>judgment, <em>sentence </em>or <em>decree.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-6\">It becomes us, then, to enquire whether the Legislature, by the act approved January 7th, 1853, intended to change or alter the law as it stood before, and, if so, in what respect the law has been altered, amended, restricted or enlarged in its operations by that act, and we must draw the intention of the Legislature from the language and provisions of the act itself, so far as this can be done. It is humbly conceived that the Legislature intended to extend the remedy by appeal and writ of error to a new class of cases not provided for by the old law. The old law provided for appeals and writs of error from <em>final </em>judgments and decrees. The new law provides for appeals and writs of error from different kind of judgments, viz: <em>\u201c </em>All orders and judgments of the Circuit Courts of this State, made and passed in any cause therein <em>\u201d </em>\u2014 not <em>final </em>judgments, but judgments wherein the said Courts shall allow and grant, or shall refuse to allow and grant, any motion for a Pew trial or any motion to amend the pleadings, or to file Pew or additional pleadings, or to amend the record of any cause during the term of the Court at which it was determined, or shall refuse to allow and grant a motion for the continuance of the cause \u2014 the orders and judgments of the Court upon these motions, and not a final judgment upon the merits, <em>may he assigned for matter a/nd cause of error </em>upon <em>any </em>writ of error sued out or appeal taken to the <em>Supreme </em>Court, and the said Supreme Court shall hear and determine the matter so assigned for error \u2014 that is, the or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ders and judgments upon these motions in the same manner and under the like rules and regulations as in other cases \u2014 that is, as in cases of writs of error and appeals from, final judgments, for those are the only <em>other oases </em>known to the law. \u2014 Pamphlet Laws 1852-53, page 100.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-5\">By the second section of the act of 1853, it is enacted, that in all the cases enumerated in the preceding section of this act, the party aggrieved by any <em>suoh </em>order or judgment \u2014 not final order or judgment, but such order or judgment made upon those motions \u2014 shall make his exception thereto in writing, and shall insert therein all such evidence, affidavits, amendment of pleadings and all other matters, which do not properly appear of record, which were considered by the Court below, or which were offered to the consideration of the Court below and should have been considered in (what ? \u2014 the progress of the trial upon the merits? No. In making up of the final judgment in the cause? No.' What then?) \u201cthe making and passing said order and judgment.\u201d \u201c And the said exception shal l be tendered to the Judge of the Circuit Court for his sig. nature in the same manner and under the same rules, regulations and provisions as bills of exception are now by law made up, signed and made part of the record.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZNa\">The first section of the act of 1853 enumerates the particular orders and judgments upon which appeals and writs of error may be brought. The second section prescribes the manner and rules under which they shall be brought. When such orders and judgments have been made and passed, the remedy given by the Legislature is applicable. But has the Legislature appointed and fixed by the act any <em>time </em>when the party aggrieved may have the benefit of that remedy ? So far as we can learn from. the act itself, he is not postponed to a final judgment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the merits. Tbe bill of exceptions is to be tendered at once upon tbe making and passing. of such orders and judgments. It is to contain sucb matter only as was considered, or ought to have been considered, upon tbe bearing of sucb motions in making and passing such orders and judgments, and not sucb matters as would arise in tbe course' of a trial upon tbe merits, or as would be considered in making up and entering a final judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-4\">From these considerations, it is evident tbat the Legislature intended tbat tbe remedy should be immediate. _ It is humbly conceived, that by tbe different modes of expression used in tbe first and third sections of tbe act of \u2022 1853, tbe Legislature meant nothing more than simply to \" provide, tbat at law appeals and writs of error could only be taken upon such orders and judgments as are made and \u25a0passed upon tbe motions enumerated and specified in tbe first section of tbe act, whereas tbe parties in equity shall have a fuller and more extensive remedy, not limited to \u2022specified and enumerated orders and decisions, but applicable to <em>any </em>and all interlocutory orders, decisions, <em>judgments </em>or decrees-. In other words, appeals may be taken from all interlocutory orders and judgments of tbe Court in equity, but only from those enumerated in tbe act at law, according to the rule tbat tbe .mention or enumeration of particular matters excludes those matters not mentioned. Tbat is, \u201c when tbe law descends to- particulars, sucb more special provisions' must be understood as exceptions to any <em>general rules </em>laid down to tbe contrary, and tbe <em>general rules must not T&gt;e alleged </em>in confutation of tbe special provisions.\u201d \u2014 Dwarris on St., 765; 5 Bing., 180, 492-\u20193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-5\">Tbe act thus far, then, can have no-reference whatever to the <em>time </em>when appeals and writs of error shall be taken except so- far as- this, tbat the remedy is given as soon as-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the <em>matter </em>arises which is made a cause of appeal by the act. The fourth section of the act seems fully to sustain this view. It is enacted by that section, \u201c that this act shall not be construed so as to deprive either party from \u00abdeferring and postponing the entry of his, her or their appeal until after the entry of the final decree <em>or end of the </em>cause, <em>as now prescribed by </em>law, nor shall such postponement of the appeal be decreed, held or taken as an acquiescence in the propriety of any interlocutory order or decree made in the progress of the cause, or any waiver of any error therein.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-5\">\u25a0 By this section, the Legislature evidently intended to leave it at the option of the party aggrieved to take/ffif-^A appeal instanter, when the order or decree complaihed^i1'-*'\u2019 ^ is made by the Court, .or to wait till after a final decree or judgment in the cause, and provides that his delay ti^f S\u20ac judgment should not be taken as an acquiescence or yfaiver of any error in any interlocutory order or decree ma'de^ia-i \u25a0the progress of the cause. This section clearly embraces ;- every case where an appeal is given by the act. If not, by what clause does it exclude any ? It is clearly intended to include appeals at'law as well as in equity, else, why designated a \u201c final decree <em>or end of the cause?\u201d </em>The Legislature certainly meant something more by the words \u201c end of the cause \u201d than a final decree in equity, and what other meaning can attach to those words than final judgment? It is as if the Legislature had said, \u201cthe party aggrieved shall not be deprived of the remedy given by this act though he may postpone his appeal until after a final judgment or decree.\u201d In order to fortify all the avenues of justice and to secure the party his remedy beyond all cavil, the Legislature goes still further and says, that such postponement shall not be held, decreed or taken as an acquiescence in the propriety .of <em>any </em>interlocutory <em>order </em>or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>decree, 'or <em>any </em>waiver of <em>cmy error therein. </em>Now, are we to say that this does not apply to all <em>orders </em>from which an appeal is given by this act, and that the words <em>\u201c </em>order or decree\u201d mean the same thing, and that therefore this section of the act refers to orders and decrees in equity alone? If so, then, by the application of the proper rules of construction, the privilege of waitiug until a final decree or the end of a cause before appeal is granted by this section to <em>parties in equity </em>only, and parties at <em>law </em>must take their appeals before final judgment or they acquiesce and waive their right of appeal from those orders enumerated in the first section of the act, where the order complained of is made before final judgment. That is, if a postponement is provided for in equity causes alone, it is allowable in no other. Besides, if such a construction should be given to the act as that no appeal shall lie at law until after final judgment, then, in cases of arrest of judgment, there being no final judgment, the statute would be nugatory \u2014 the party would have no remedy. \u2014 2 Chitty Pr., 593.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-5\">The argument <em>ab inconveniente </em>will apply to both sides of this question; for, if justice should be delayed by these appeals in some cases, it will be delayed by postponing them in others, as will be evident in this case. The hearing of this appeal will delay neither party, but a refusal to hear it till after final judgment will delay the plaintiff indefinitely.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-6\">The question, then, is, what is the intention of the act? If it is deducible from the act itself, that the Legislature intended to give appeals before fina'\u00ed judgment or decree or the end of the cause, then is this appeal well taken.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-7\"><em>L. I. Fleming </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The Supreme Court, after argument, dismissed the appeal, on the ground that the Court has no jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>an appeal or writ of error taken in a cause at law before final judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
