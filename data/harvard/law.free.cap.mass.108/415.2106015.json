The defendant objected to the evidence, and contended that within said time he had a right to keep and sell ale ; but the judge declined so to rule, and instructed the jury that the keeping and selling of ale within said time was competent evidence to prove the guilt of the defendant under the indictment. It was proved and admitted that the city of Lynn had voted against the sale of ale on the first Tuesday of September 1870.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">The 22d of July 1870 was the day when the St. of 1870, <em>c. </em>389, went into effect, and the first Tuesday of September 1870 was the day when the city might for the first time under that statute vote to prohibit the sale of malt liquors.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-7\"><em>iS.
