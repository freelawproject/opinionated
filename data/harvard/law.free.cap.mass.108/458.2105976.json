It appeared that the deceased, who was the defendant\u2019s wife, was drunk; that he struck her with his open hand one blow on the cheek and one about the temple ; and that she fell upon the floor, and did not speak afterwards. Medical witnesses testified \u201c that she had, by falling on a chair most probably, or by some external force, been affected by concussion of the brain and effusion of blood on the brain, and that thus her death was occasioned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">The defendant requested the judge to instinct the jury \u201c that the husband had a legal right to administer due and proper correction and corporeal chastisement on his wife; that it was for the jury to say whether he had so done in this case, and whether his conduct was not lawful under this rule, upon the evidence; that the evidence would not sustain the indictment, as the latter did not allege a death by a striking of the defendant, which said striking caused a fall, which fall, under the circumstances, resulted fatally, by reason of her condition arising from intemperate habits; and that, even if the defendant had exceeded his lawful authority as husband, if the jury should find that the two blows were with the open hand, and were not such as the husband had any reason to believe, and did not believe, could produce any serious injury, he could not be convicted, although the death of his wife was hastened by the shock received in falling from the effects of the slap or slaps on her cheek by him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\">The judge refused so to instruct the jury, and gave them the following instructions: \u201c Upon ar.y view of the facts in this case, which the testimony, taken most strongly for the defendant, will allow, there was, as matter of law, no justification for the blows given by the defendant to the deceased. If the unlawful blows of the defendant caused death, either directly, or by causing the deceased to fall upon file floor by the force and effect thereof, and \u00ab0 death thereby ensued, then the defendant is guilty of man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>slaughter.\u201d The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-5\"><em>O.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcH\">The motion to quash the indictment was not insisted on in the argument, and the indictment appears to be sufficient. But it is contended that the cause of death is not truly stated, and that the evidence does not support the averment The allegation is, that the defendant did strike, kick, beat, bruise and wound the deceased in and upon her head and body, and throw her upon the floor. The proof was, that he struck her with his open hand upon her cheek and about the temple, and she fell upon the floor and did not speak afterwards. Medical witnesses attributed her death to falling on a chair most probably, or to some external force, and believed that concussion of the brain or effusion of blood on the brain had been produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The defendant\u2019s counsel cites <em>Kelly's case, </em>1 Lewin, 193, where it was held that, when a blow with the fist was stated as the cause of death, and it appeared that in consequence of the blow the deceased fell upon a piece of brick and was killed by it, the cause of death was not truly stated; also <em>Thompson's case, </em>Ib. 194, where the allegation was of a killing by a beating on the head, and it appeared that in consequence of the beating the deceased fell upon the floor and was killed by it, and it was held that the cause of death was not truly stated. If in this case the beating only had been stated, those cases-would be in Doint. But here the throwing upon the floor is also stated; and the intervention of a chair standing upon the floor, or of some other hard sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>stance, would make no material variation. The case cornea within the rule stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>102 Mass. 155 ; the killing is set forth with as much particularity as is necessary for the defendant in order to prepare his defence. The allegation is as nearly correspondent with the proof as in <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>2 Cox Crim. Cas. 379; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>7 C. &amp; P. 250 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stafford, </em>12 Cush. 619; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>7 Gray, 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The beating of the defendant\u2019s wife was unlawful. In <em>Pearman </em>v. <em>Pearman, </em>1 Swab. <em>&amp; </em>Tristr. 601, it is said that there is no law authorizing a man to beat his drunken wife. Beating a wife is held to be unlawful in New York. <em>People </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>2 Parker Crim. Cas. 10. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>2 Paige, 501, 503. There is no authority in its favor in this Commonwealth. Beating or striking a wife violently with the open hand is not one of the rights conferred on a husband by the marriage, even if the wife be drunk or insolent. The blows being illegal, the defendant was at least guilty of manslaughter. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>7 Gray, 585. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
