On January 4, 2000, while Officer Louis Cavalier and Officer Douglas Harkins of the New Haven police department were conducting surveillance of the area of Chapel, Dwight and Kensington Streets in New Haven, they observed a male approach the defendant. After a short conversation, the male handed the defendant money, which the defendant placed in his pocket, in exchange for cocaine, which the defendant retrieved by reaching down his front waistband. Subsequently, a second male approached the defendant. The two conversed. Then, after receiving an amount of money and placing it in his pocket, the defendant gave the male an amount of cocaine. The defendant then proceeded along Kensington Street and entered the Dusk Market convenience store (Dusk Market).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Cavalier and Harkins then radioed Officers Anthony Maio and Vincent Anastasio with a description and loca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>tion of the defendant. On the basis of information from Harkins that the defendant had engaged in a drug transaction, Maio and Anastasio proceeded to Dusk Market, conducted a search of the defendant and then arrested him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">Prior to trial, the court conducted a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized from him following the search by Maio inside Dusk Market on January 4, 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition to those facts stated previously, the court found the following facts in its memorandum of decision. Maio and Anastasio entered Dusk Market and approached the defendant. Maio conducted an interview, which led him to believe the defendant was concealing contraband. He conducted a patdown search that revealed, in the defendant\u2019s pant leg, a concealed item, which was soft and bulgy to the touch. Maio asked the defendant if he was concealing any contraband, to which the defendant responded that if he was, the officer would have to find it. Maio raised the defendant\u2019s right pant leg. A bag containing a white substance fell to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Subsequently, Maio unrolled the defendant\u2019s pant leg within which was a ziplock bag containing smaller ziplock bags. A field test later revealed that the smaller bags contained crack cocaine. Maio then proceeded to conduct a full search of the defendant. In the course of the search, he found a ziplock packet containing smaller empty, yellow tinted ziplock packets, $112 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>United States currency and a razor blade. The defendant then was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">On the basis of those facts, the court concluded that the officers had conducted a valid search and seizure under <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), and further, that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant. The court concluded that the probable cause validated the contemporaneous search and seizure as incident to a lawful arrest. The court, therefore, denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The defendant claims that the denial was improper and that all of the seized items should have been suppressed because the warrantless search was unreasonable under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6He argues that the search was not valid under <em>Terry </em>or any other recognized exception to the warrant requirement. The state argues that the search was a valid search incident to lawful arrest, and, in the alternative, that it was valid under <em>Terry. </em>We agree that the search was valid as incident to a lawful arrest based on probable cause, and, therefore, it is unnecessary to consider whether the search was valid under <em>Terry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Subject to only a few well recognized exceptions, a search without a warrant issued on probable cause is per se unreasonable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>255 Conn. 268, 291, 764 A.2d 1251 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 235, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996). A search incident to a lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>custodial arrest, however, is an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 457-58, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 291; <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>supra, 235. \u201cWhen an arrest is made, it is reasonable for a police officer to search for, and seize . . . evidence within the immediate control of the arrested person in order to . . . prevent the destruction or concealment of evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">In reviewing whether the court properly concluded that the search and seizure was valid under the exception to the warrant requirement for a search incident to a lawful arrest, it is first necessary to evaluate the validity of the arrest. General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (b) authorizes a police officer to make a warrantless arrest based on probable cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the federal and Connecticut constitutions, the court uses a totality of the circumstances test in determining whether probable cause existed. See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 231-32, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>248 Conn. 183, 190-91, 728 A.2d 493 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">\u201cProbable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the officer and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe a felony has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 292; <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 236-37. In evaluating probable cause for a warrantless search, the court may \u201cconsider <em>all </em>of the legally obtained facts available to a police officer, and <em>all </em>of the reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>inferences that might be drawn therefrom in light of the officer\u2019s training and experience.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>supra, 230-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s determination that probable cause to arrest existed, we consider whether [it is] legally and logically correct and whether [it] findfs] support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision .... Because a trial court\u2019s determination of the existence of probable cause implicates a constitutional claim, we must review the record carefully to ensure that its determination [is] supported by substantial evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 293-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">We conclude that prior to their entry into the market, Maio and Anastasio had probable cause to arrest the defendant on the basis of information provided to them by Harkins and Cavalier. As the court found, Harkins and Cavalier, while conducting surveillance of a known high crime area, observed the defendant engage in two drug transactions. In each transaction, the defendant had been waiting on the street when an unknown individual approached and engaged him in a brief conversation. The defendant then received money from the individual and put it in his pocket. Next, the defendant reached into his pants and retrieved a bag containing smaller bags of a white substance, which he handed to the individual. Those facts would lead a reasonable police officer to believe that the defendant had committed a felony. Therefore, Harkins and Cavalier radioed Maio and Anastasio to arrest the defendant in connection with suspected drug transactions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>that the warrantless arrest based on probable cause was authorized under \u00a7 54-lf (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Having concluded that the officers had probable cause to arrest the defendant within the market, we next consider whether the search and seizure prior to the defendant\u2019s actual arrest was valid as a search incident to a lawful arrest. Both the United States Supreme Court and our Supreme Court have held that \u201c[e]ven if a search and seizure chronologically precede a formal arrest, the search and seizure may be constitutionally valid as long as the arrest and the search and seizure are substantially contemporaneous and ar e integral parts of the same incident.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 236; see also <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 111, 100 S. Ct. 2556, 65 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 294 n.41. Here, the facts allow the conclusion that the search and seizure were substantially contemporaneous with the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">We conclude, therefore, that the search of the defendant\u2019s pant leg and pockets, and the seizure of all the items discovered were valid as incident to his lawful arrest. The court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">SEQUESTRATION ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">Prior to trial, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>preceding the introduction of the state\u2019s evidence, defense counsel orally requested a sequestration order. The court granted the motion. There was only a brief exchange regarding that motion:</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I request a sequestration order. I formally make that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">\u201cThe Court: So ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The only other reference to the sequestration order during the hearing occurred prior to the lunch break on the first day of the hearing. At that time, the court asked the state to \u201cremind [Cavalier] of the sequestration order [and] not to discuss [his] testimony with anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">In a memorandum of decision, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. At trial, during the state\u2019s case-in-chief, while cross-examining Cavalier, defense counsel elicited testimony that Cavalier had discussed the case with Harkins, Maio and Anastasio to get their stories straight.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> During a recess, defense counsel raised the issue of whether that discussion of their testimony demonstrated a violation of the sequestration order.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Following arguments by counsel, the court concluded that on the basis of disjunctive language of General Statutes \u00a7 54-85a and Practice Book \u00a7 42-36, the sequestration order granted at the suppression hearing was not in effect for the trial proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>court concluded that even if the sequestration order was in effect, the violation did not prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The defendant claims that due to the virtually identical issues at the suppression hearing and at trial, the sequestration order granted at the hearing remained in effect for the trial. He argues that the court\u2019s ruling values form over substance. He argues that because the court did not place any limitation on the order, there is a presumption that in requesting the order at the beginning of the hearing, counsel sought to cover the entire trial process. He further contends that in delineating the scope of the order, courts, adhering to the purposes of a sequestration order, should err on the side of protecting the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">A review of the defendant\u2019s claim requires us to examine the scope of a sequestration order granted pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-36 and General Statutes \u00a7 54-85a on the facts of this case. In evaluating the propriety of the court\u2019s actions, we note that a \u201ccourt must take full account of the significant objectives advanced by sequestration in discerning the proper scope of a sequestration order.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nguyen, 253 </em>Conn. 639, 650, 756 A.2d 833 (2000). \u201cThe right to have witnesses sequestered is an important right that facilitates the truth-seeking and fact-finding functions of a trial. . . . Sequestration serves a broad purpose. It is a procedural device that serves to prevent witnesses from tailoring their testimony to that of earlier witnesses; it aids in detecting testimony that is less than candid and assures that witnesses testify on the basis of their own knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>edge.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">In <em>Nguyen, </em>our Supreme Court broadly interpreted the scope of the statute and the rule of practice. In that case, after the trial court had granted a sequestration order,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the state overheard defense counsel discussing a prior witness\u2019 testimony in the presence of a prospective witness. Id., 643. The defendant argued that the discussion did not violate the sequestration order because that order barred witnesses only from being in the courtroom prior to testifying. The court held, however, that \u201c [although the language of [Practice Book \u00a7 42-36] may seem merely to bar a sequestered witness from being in the courtroom when he is not testifying . . . we do not follow so rigid an interpretation. Indeed, such an interpretation would vitiate any sequestration order by exalting form over substance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nguyen, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">In the present case, the state argues, as the defendant did in <em>Nguyen, </em>for a strict and literal interpretation of the statute and the rule of practice. The state bases its argument on the use of the word \u201cor\u201d in Practice Book \u00a7 42-36 and in General Statutes \u00a7 54-85a. In accordance with that argument, the trial court in the present case held that the sequestration order requested at the suppression hearing, because it was not otherwise modified, was in effect only for the duration of that hearing. In light of the holding of <em>Nguyen </em>and the purposes of a sequestration order, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">We acknowledge, as the state argues, that Practice Book \u00a7 42-36 and General Statutes \u00a7 54-85a are written in the disjunctive. Contrary to the state\u2019s argument, however, a reading of the statute in light of the purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>of a sequestration order, leads us to the conclusion that the disjunctive language merely separates the types of proceedings at which a party may make a motion to sequester witnesses. The disjunctive language does not delineate or affect the scope of the order. If we were to read the statute as the state requests and therefore require the party seeking a sequestration order to renew its request at each juncture of a case, we would be \u201c \u2018exalting form above substance.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nguyen, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 651. Thus, in adhering to the purposes of the sequestration of witnesses and the holding in <em>Nguyen, </em>we conclude that the defendant\u2019s request for a sequestration order prior to the hearing on his motion to suppress remained in effect through the end of the trial. The officers\u2019 discussion of their testimony was, therefore, a violation of the order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Having concluded that the sequestration order was violated, it is next necessary to consider whether the defendant was prejudiced. The defendant argues that due to the similarities of the issues at the suppression hearing and at trial, he was prejudiced and that a new trial should be granted to protect his right to a fair trial. The state argues that the defendant has not shown any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">\u201cA violation of a sequestration order does not automatically require a new trial. . . . The controlling consideration is whether the defendant has been prejudiced by the violation. . . . The burden rests on the party requesting the sequestration to show that the violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>was prejudicial. ... If the prejudice resulting from the violation is likely to have affected the jury\u2019s verdict, a new trial must be ordered.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>230 Conn. 591, 599, 646 A.2d 118 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>70 Conn. App. 255, 277-78, 797 A.2d 616, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 919, 806 A.2d 1056 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In this case, the violation occurred when the four officers involved had a discussion after testifying at the suppression hearing, but prior to testifying at trial. \u201cNot all testimony that is tainted by a violation of a sequestration order [however] is necessarily prejudicial. Rather, [a]n inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each case is necessary to ascertain whether the purpose of a sequestration order has been thwarted. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 600. First, we must determine whether the testimony of the officers at trial was tailored to what was discussed in violation of the sequestration order. Second, if the testimony was tailored, we must determine whether that testimony is likely to have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. Id., 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Whether the officers tailored their testimony can be evaluated by comparing the testimony given by each officer at the suppression hearing, prior to the violation of the order, to the testimony given by each officer at trial, subsequent to the violation of the order. A thorough examination of the record reveals that the officers\u2019 testimony at each proceeding was the same. Although the officers testified similarly, that was not due to the tailoring of each one\u2019s testimony to that of the other officers. The similarity in the officers\u2019 testimonies existed at the suppression hearing before the violation occurred. That similarity is fully explainable by the fact that the officers observed and were witnesses to the same events. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>16 Conn. App. 172, 183, 547 A.2d 77 (similarities in testimony wholly explainable by reference to other factors), cert, denied, 209 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Conn. 821, 551 A.2d 758 (1988); <em>State </em>v. Sullivan, 11 Conn. App. 80, 85, 525 A.2d 1353 (1987) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Further, the defendant has not pointed out, either in his brief or at oral argument, any tailoring of the officers\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, during oral argument, the defendant conceded that the officers testified in the same way at the hearing on the motion to suppress and at trial. Additionally, the defendant had ample opportunity to, and did in fact, cross-examine the witnesses and argue to the jury regarding the officers having spoken with each other before testifying at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Under the facts of this case, the defendant has not met his burden of showing prejudice as a result of the officers\u2019 discussion of their testimony and, hence, the purposes of the sequestration order were not thwarted.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-9\"> Initially, the defendant was charged in two separate informations in connection with incidents occurring on January 4 and February 7, 2000. Prior to trial, the two case files were consolidated on the state\u2019s motion. The state proceeded at trial on the two informations. The defendant, however, was convicted of the charges related only to the January 4, 2000 incident, and, therefore, only those charges are relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-10\"> The facts of the search are discussed in part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b825-11\"> The hearing also addressed evidence seized in connection with the charges that were filed against the defendant in connection with a separate incident that occurred on February 7, 2000.

On that day, while counsel and the court were discussing an issue regarding the accuracy of the transcript of Maio\u2019s testimony from the preceding day, the state brought to the attention of defense counsel and the court that Cavalier was present in the courtroom. The state asked whether the presence was a violation of the sequestration order. Neither the court, nor defense counsel believed it was a violation. Thus, the defendant has waived any argument that it might have been a violation of the order. Further, neither in his brief nor at oral argument has the defendant argued that Cavalier\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>presence was a violation of the order.
