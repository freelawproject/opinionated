The court denied the plaintiffs application to vacate, correct or modify an arbitration award in favor of the defendant and granted the defendant\u2019s motion to confirm the arbitration award. On appeal, the plaintiff claims, as a matter of law, that the court improperly denied its application because the arbitrators awarded uninsured motorist damages to the defendant insured in excess of the coverage limit stated in the policy that was issued by the plaintiff. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">The following facts and procedural history underlie the plaintiffs appeal. The defendant purchased from the plaintiff an automobile insurance policy effective from February 5, 1989, to February 5, 1990. The policy included, inter alia, an uninsured motorist provision with a stated policy limit of $40,0004 The policy also included a provision binding the parties to submit uninsured motorist claim disputes to a panel of three arbitrators.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The record reflects that the defendant submitted a claim for uninsured motorist benefits after he was involved in a motor vehicle collision on January 20, 1990. He claimed that he sustained injuries as a result of the negligence of a driver of an uninsured motor vehicle and sought to collect, to the extent permitted under the uninsured motorist provision of his policy, the sums that he was legally entitled to recover as damages from the operator of the uninsured motor vehicle. The defendant and the plaintiff disagreed over the uninsured motorist coverage under the policy. The defendant claimed that the $40,000 policy limit stated on the policy\u2019s declaration page was inaccurate. The defendant claimed that he believed that he had, instead, purchased $300,000 in uninsured motorist coverage. The parties thereafter submitted their dispute to a panel of three arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">On June 7, 2000, the arbitration panel, with one arbitrator dissenting, awarded the defendant $225,000 in damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a preliminary matter, the arbitrators found that (1) the defendant had sustained injuries as a result of the negligence of the driver of an uninsured motor vehicle and (2) the defendant sustained $225,000 in damages. The parties do not take issue with either of those findings. The arbitrators also found that the defendant believed that he had purchased $300,000 in coverage but did not check his policy to verify the amount stated therein. Likewise, the arbitrators found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>plaintiffs agent failed to comply with the defendant\u2019s request to purchase $300,000 in coverage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the basis of those subordinate findings, the arbitrators concluded that an issue of \u201cmutual mistake\u201d as to the policy limit existed between the parties. The arbitrators observed that \u201cthe argument could be made that the question of <em>coverage </em>is inherent in the question of damages.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The arbitrators relied on General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in addition to the foregoing observation, in concluding that the submission before them reached the underlying coverage dispute rather than just the issue of the amount of damages to which the defendant was entitled under the policy. The arbitrators then determined the amount of coverage to be $300,000 and awarded the defendant $225,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The plaintiff thereafter filed in the Superior Court an application to vacate, correct or modify the arbitration award.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed, inter alia, that the arbitrators improperly (1) failed to limit their award to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>policy limit, (2) reformed the terms and conditions of the policy when such actions surpassed the scope of the submission before them, (3) reformed the limits of coverage under the policy in the absence of competent evidence and (4) considered issues of reformation of the policy when such a consideration exceeded their authority under the law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant thereafter filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award and to assess interest on the award.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court held that the \u201cdollar amount of the limit of liability for uninsured motorist coverage is a matter of coverage subject to compulsory arbitration by General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c.\u201d The court further held that \u00a7 38-175c, as well as precedent from our Supreme Court, strongly expressed the principle that \u201cwhen \u2018coverage\u2019 is at issue in an uninsured motorist dispute, every presumption should be made in favor of having a final determination of coverage issues decided by the arbitrators.\u201d The court denied the plaintiffs application and granted the defendant\u2019s motion to confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Before setting forth our standard of review, we first note that General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c, which applies to the contractual agreement between the parties, provides that \u201c[ejvery [automobile insurance] policy issued on or after October 1,1971, which contains a provision for binding arbitration shall include a provision for final determination of [uninsured motorist] insurance coverage in such arbitration proceeding. . . .\u201d As our Supreme Court has noted, \u201c[c]learly, \u00a7 38-175c mandates not only the inclusion of a provision for uninsured motorist coverage in automobile liability insurance policies, but that coverage under such provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>sions be determined through arbitration when the policy provides that the parties will arbitrate.\u201d <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>181 Conn. 37, 41, 434 A.2d 304 (1980); see also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>199 Conn. 618, 626, 509 A.2d 467 (1986) (characterizing \u00a7 38-175c as compulsory arbitration provision in that case).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The dispute between the parties in the present case, and the question resolved by the arbitrators, concerned the amount of coverage to which the defendant was entitled under the policy. The law governing the dispute concerns not the amount of damages that the defendant could recover from the tortfeasor, the operator of the uninsured vehicle, but the limitation on the defendant\u2019s ability to recover damages from the insurer, the plaintiff. Certainly, the issue of the amount of coverage to which a party is entitled under a contract of insurance requires us to determine the respective rights and obligations of the parties to a contract of insurance. As such, under the analysis set forth by our Supreme Court in <em>Quigley-Dodd </em>v. <em>General Accident Ins. Co. of America, </em>256 Conn. 225, 239, 772 A.2d 577 (2001), the issue before us is not one of damages, but coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Because the issue in this case is one of coverage and coverage issues are subject to compulsory arbitration under \u00a7 38-175c, we review the arbitrators\u2019 resolution of the issue de novo. \u201cWhen an arbitration panel\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is at issue, an appellate court must conduct a de novo review. . . . Conversely, the appropriate standard of review of the factual findings of an arbitration panel is the substantial evidence test. . . . Pursuant to this test, the reviewing court must determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the arbitrators\u2019 findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>Assn. </em>v. <em>Zasun, </em>52 Conn. App. 212, 223, 725 A.2d 406 (1999). \u201c[R]eview of questions of law includes . . . inquiry into whether the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or imperfectly executed them.\u201d <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casually &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 664, 591 A.2d 101 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The issue in this case is narrow. We are called on to determine only whether the arbitrators were legally correct in concluding that the submission permitted them to award the defendant an amount of damages that exceeded the stated coverage limit on his policy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cAn application to vacate or correct an award should be granted where an arbitrator has exceeded his power. In deciding whether an arbitrator has exceeded his power, we need only examine the submission and the award to determine whether the award conforms to the submission. ... A challenge of the arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to a comparison of the award to the submission. . . . Where the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that the construction placed upon the facts or the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, AFL-CIO, Council 4, Local 2663, </em>257 Conn. 80, 85-86, <em>777 </em>A.2d 169 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u201c[T]he charter of an arbitrator is the submission and no matter outside the submission may be included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the award. ... It follows that an award must conform to the submission and is void to the extent to which it is outside the submission. . . . This is particularly so in the case of insurance coverage where risks are actuarily analyzed and premium charges reflect those risks. To layer on additional coverage outside of the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into the contract would expose the insurer to liability for payments beyond the scope of the agreement.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Lighty, </em>3 Conn. App. 697, 700, 491 A.2d 1118 (1985). This case does not present a situation in which coverage has been added to a policy; the arbitrators premised their award on a finding that the written insurance policy did not accurately reflect the amount of uninsured motorist coverage purchased by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The submission in this case consisted of the arbitration clause from the plaintiffs policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That policy language, read together with \u00a7 38-175c, clearly granted the arbitrators the power to resolve the issue of the \u201camount of damages\u201d the defendant was legally entitled to under the policy. The arbitrators determined that amount to be $225,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The plaintiff has not demonstrated that the parties, by means of their submission, limited in any way the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>arbitrators\u2019 ability to award damages in excess of $40,000. We find no such limitation in the policy. Section 38-175c does not impose such a limitation on an arbitrator\u2019s ability to award damages. Given the lack of any such limitation, the arbitrators were essentially'free to resolve the issue of the \u201camount of damages\u201d as long as their findings in that regard were supported by substantial evidence and their legal conclusions were accurate. The parties do not challenge those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Our holding is bolstered by our Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 38-175c. Our Supreme Court has stated that the legislative intent and effect of the statute \u201cis to remove from the court and to transfer to the arbitration panel the function of determining, in the first instance, all issues as to coverage under automobile liability insurance policies containing uninsured motorist clauses providing for arbitration.\u201d <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 181 Conn. 42. In light of the legislative intent to have \u201call coverage issues\u201d resolved by arbitration when a policy contains a provision for binding arbitration, and on the basis of the submission in this case, which contained no limit as to the damages amount the arbitrators were empowered to award the defendant, we have no basis on which to conclude that the arbitrators exceeded their powers when they awarded damages in excess of the stated policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-11\"> Included in the defendant\u2019s policy was a provision entitled \u201cLIMIT OF INSURANCE,\u201d which states: \u201cRegardless of the number of covered \u2018autos,\u2019 \u2018insureds, \u2019 premiums paid, claims made or vehicles involved in the \u2018accident, \u2019 the most we will pay for all damages resulting from any one \u2018accident\u2019 is the LIMIT OF INSURANCE for UNINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE shown in the Declarations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-12\"> The relevant portion of the provision entitled \u201cARBITRATION\u201d states: \u201cIf we and an \u2018insured\u2019 disagree whether the \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or driver of an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 or do not agree as to the amount of damages, either party may make a written demand for arbitration. In this event, each party will select an arbitrator. The two arbitrators will select a third. If they cannot agree within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>30 days, either party may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. Each party will pay expenses it [incurs] and bear the expenses of the third arbitrator equally.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\"> The third arbitrator from the panel that considered the submission filed a dissenting opinion in which he considered the issue of the amount of uninsured motorist coverage to which the defendant was entitled under the policy, but disagreed with the majority\u2019s finding that the defendant had demonstrated the existence of a \u201cmutual mistake\u201d between the parties. As a result, the dissenting arbitrator stated that he would have awarded the defendant 1he full amount permitted under the terms of the policy, $40,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\"> The arbitrators found in relevant part as follows in that regard: \u201cThe [defendant] testified that at all times he thought he had $300,000 uninsured motorist coverage. The [plaintiff] introduced the application for coverage form, showing the uninsured motorist coverage stated thereon is $40,000. The [defendant] testified that the first time he learned about the $40,000 coverage was after the accident, when his lawyer ... so advised him. The [defendant] had spoken to an Allstate agent, Joseph Pietrosante, who confirmed to him that the correct policy limits for uninsured motorist coverage was $300,000, that the stated amount on the policy declaration sheet was a mistake and that he would correct the same to reflect the $300,000 figure. The [plaintiff] introduced an affidavit from Mr. Pietrosante, not denying the conversation but stating that he does not recall having a conversation with [the defendant] regarding his uninsured motorist coverage from $40,000 to $300,000. The arbitrators accept the testimony of the [defendant] in this regard.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cEach automobile liability insurance policy issued on or after October 1, 1971, which contains a provision for binding arbitration shall include a provision for final determination of insurance coverage in such arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">. . .\u201d We note that this statute essentially is similar to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175e, which governs this dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\"> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-418 and 52-419.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\"> In addition to seeking other relief, the plaintiff asked the court to order that the arbitrators\u2019 decision be vacated insofar as it found that it provided $300,000 in uninsured motorist coverage or that the decision also be corrected so as to limit the award to the policy limit of $40,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 52-417.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b75-8\"> In its application to vacate, the plaintiff challenged the evidentiary basis of the arbitrators\u2019 finding that the defendant had purchased $300,000 in coverage.

See <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 218 Conn. 663.
