The issues before us are whether the court properly determined that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-26d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1) the plaintiff was entitled to possession of the premises and (2) the special defenses alleged by the defendant were inapplicable to the cause of action and facts here. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">There is no disagreement as to the following facts. In 1985, the plaintiffs predecessor in title leased the premises at 273 Clarks Fall Road in North Stonington to the defendant\u2019s predecessors in interest. The lease was for a ten year term and provided the option of renewal for two additional five year terms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****2About the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>time that the original lease was signed, the defendant obtained rights to the leasehold, hi May, 1995, the defendant and the plaintiffs predecessors signed an amendment to the lease that memorialized the defendant\u2019s right to an additional five year term and included, among other things, the rent to be paid for the additional five year term, through April 30, 2000. One of the covenants contained in the amendment concerned an option to renew the lease for yet another five year term.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff purchased the premises in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>By letter dated July 30,1999, the defendant attempted to exercise its option to renew the lease for an additional five year term. The plaintiff rejected the defendant\u2019s attempted renewal. In 2000, unlike the events that transpired in May, 1995, the parties did not memorialize an agreement concerning the defendant\u2019s desire to exercise its option to renew, and they did not negotiate the rental for an additional five year term. On May 4,2000, the plaintiff caused a notice to quit the premises by May 12, 2000, to be served on the defendant. Although the time given in the notice to quit has passed, the defendant continues in possession of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>In June, 2000, the plaintiff commenced a summary process action against the defendant seeking immediate possession of the premises. The plaintiff subsequently amended its complaint, which was in three counts. The factual allegations of the complaint are consistent with the undisputed facts. The first count sought possession of the premises on the basis of termination of the lease by lapse of time. The second count sounded in breach of contract, and the third count alleged waste on the premises, unauthorized alterations, injury, misuse and termination by expressed stipulation in the lease. The defendant answered the complaint and alleged a number of special defenses, including the equitable doctrine of laches, equitable forfeiture and promissory estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">At the time it filed its amended complaint, the plaintiff also filed a motion for summary judgment. The defendant objected to the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff sought summary judgment in its favor on the basis of the allegations in the first count of its amended complaint. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the lease has expired, that there is no new lease and that notice to quit was served properly on the defendant. The defendant objected, arguing that it was entitled to remain in possession of the premises pursuant to the renewal option contained in the original lease. The parties disagree as to whether the renewal option was enforceable, as a matter of law, because it required the amount of rent due during the second five year term, if any, to be negotiated after the defendant had exercised its right pursuant to the option to renew.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The court did not reach the issue of enforceability, concluding, on the basis of the undisputed facts, that the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment regardless of the enforceability of the renewal clause. That is, as a matter of law, the defendant was unable to demonstrate that it had title in the premises at the time the notice to quit was served. Specifically, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>concluded, citing <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>75 Conn. 183, 52 A. 819 (1902), that the defendant\u2019s notice of its intention to renew the lease did not renew the lease because the language of the lease renewal clause required the written consent of the plaintiff if the defendant held over, or the negotiation of the rent due under the new five year term. The term of the amended lease had expired, there was no signing by the plaintiff permitting the defendant to hold over and there was no new lease. The court also concluded, as a matter of law, that the special defenses addressed by the defendant in its brief in support of its objection to the motion for summary judgment were inapplicable to the facts of this summary process action.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">\u201cOn appeal, the scope of our review of the granting of a motion for summary judgment is plenary. ... In seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any issue of fact [and] a party opposing summary judgment must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Richter </em>v. <em>Danbury Hospital, </em>60 Conn. App. 280, 286, 759 A.2d 106 (2000). \u201cTo establish the existence of a material fact, it is not enough for the party opposing summary judgment merely to assert the existence of a disputed issue. . . . Such assertions are insufficient regardless of whether they are contained in a complaint or brief.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Roina, </em>38 Conn. App. 240, 244, 659 A.2d 1226, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 915, 665 A.2d 609 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">With respect to a motion for summary judgment, \u201c[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... A material fact is a fact that will make a difference in the result of the case. . . . The facts at issue are those alleged in the pleadings.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co., </em>48 Conn.

App. 439, 443, 473 A.2d 318 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">\u201cA lease is a contract. In its construction, three elementary principles must be kept constantly in mind: (1) the intention of the parties is controlling and must be gathered from the language of the lease in the light of the circumstances surrounding the parties at the execution of the instrument; (2) the language must be given its ordinary meaning unless a technical or special meaning is clearly intended; (3) the lease must be construed as a whole and in such a manner as to give effect to every provision, if reasonably possible. <em>Hatcho Corp. </em>v. <em>Della Pietra, </em>195 Conn. 18, 20, 485 A.2d 1285 (1985). In determining the meaning and effect of the controverted language in the lease, the inquiry must focus on the intention expressed in the lease and not on what intention existed in the minds of the parties. <em>Lampson Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Caporale, </em>140 Conn. 679, 682, 102 A.2d 875 (1954).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Warner Associates </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>50 Conn. App. 90, 94-95, 718 A.2d 48 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The issue in the case before us can be stated succinctly as whether the contract called for an extension of the existing lease or a renewal of the lease. \u201cIt is the general rule that no new lease is necessary upon exercising an option for the extension of the term of the lease for a further specified period after the expiration of the original term, and many courts apply the same rule in the case of options for renewal. . . . The view has been taken that a lease for a specified term with the privilege of a renewal on the same terms is equivalent, where such privilege is exercised, to a demise for the full period of the two terms, without any necessity for the execution of a new lease, and this would seem to be the view which a court of equity would take in case the rights of the lessee under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>privilege of renewal is there called in question, as equity regards that as done which ought to be done. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">\u201cA technical difference is frequently recognized, however, between the effect of a covenant for renewal and one for extension, especially as to the effect of retention of possession after the original term, it being held that a stipulation for renewal does not, like a covenant to extend, of itself and alone continue the tenancy for the renewal period, but calls for a new lease, a formal extension of the existing lease or something equivalent thereto, performance by the lessee of everything required for him to entitle him to a new lease, or, at least, some affirmative act by way of creation of an additional term. . . . But it is recognized that the technical difference may be controlled by the intention of the parties as manifested by the entire lease or <em>by their practical construction of their contract, as by conduct before the controversy arose, </em>whereby the privilege may be construed as one for an extension of term, though the language employed, in a strict technical sense, may signify renewal. The mere fact that the privilege is called one to renew is not conclusive.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Loforese, </em>111 Conn. 700, 703-704, 151 A. 159 (1930).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">On the basis of our plenary review of the amended complaint, answer and special defenses, the lease and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>its amendment, and documents and affidavits submitted with respect to the summary judgment motion, we agree with the court that the defendant had no right of possession in the premises at the time the notice to quit was served. In reaching that conclusion, we have adhered to the rule that the technical distinction between a covenant to extend or to renew can be ascertained \u201cby the intention of the parties as manifested ... by their practical construction of their contract, as by conduct before the controversy arose . . . .\u201d Id., 704.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">The original lease provided that holding over by the defendant will not renew the lease without the written consent of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has not consented in writing to the defendant\u2019s remaining in possession after April 30, 2000. Furthermore, the lease amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>unambiguously provides for the expiration of the lease and requires the negotiation of a new rent as a prerequisite to the defendant\u2019s continued possession of the premises. The amendment of lease signed in May, 1995, is instructive. The preliminary statements set forth the context of the agreement, they acknowledge the original lease and its assignments, the option to renew and the parties\u2019 \u201cdesire to set forth [therein] their agreement concerning the exercise of the aforesaid option to renew.\u201d Furthermore, paragraph one of the amendment contains a detailed agreement as to the amount and manner in which rent is to be paid for the five years of the lease. Because the parties executed a signed agreement with respect to the option in 1995 and negotiated the rent to be paid, we conclude that the lease and the amendment provided a covenant to renew that required a writing. For that reason, the trial court properly concluded that the defendant had no right to possession after the five year leasehold expired in 2000. Furthermore, the plaintiff served notice to quit on the defendant and initiated a summary process action as soon after the end of the five year lease as was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Our construction of the terms of the lease and the amendment are consistent with our case law. See <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>supra, 75 Conn. 186 (\u201cThe lease was for the term of one year only, and the year had expired. The agreement for renewal conveyed no right nor interest in the premises beyond the term. At most it gave the defendant a right, if he complied with the conditions upon which the right was based, to obtain a lease for two years more, but he did not in fact obtain such a lease.\u201d); <em>Warner Associates </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 96 (\u201cintent expressed in the plain language of the lease between the plaintiff and the defendants created an option to renew the lease for an additional five year period under the same terms and conditions as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>original lease, except that the amount of rent during the renewal period would be subject to a negotiated adjustment . . . the negotiated renewal lease was to be in writing, and if the defendants remained in the premises after the expiration of the term of the lease without having executed a new written lease, such holdover would not constitute a renewal or extension of the lease\u201d). The same legal principle was followed under different factual scenarios in <em>F.B. Fountain Co. </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>97 Conn. 619, 118 A. 47 (1922), and <em>Karn </em>v. <em>DiLorenzo, </em>95 Conn. 267, 111 A. 195 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The dissent takes issue with our reliance on <em>Platt </em>and <em>Warner Associates </em>and relies on six cases that are factually distinct from the one before us. The most important factual distinction in all of those cases is that the rent to be paid during the extended or renewed leasehold had been determined or a formula for computing it had been agreed on by the parties. The cases cited in the dissent support, rather than detract from, our conclusion that a writing was necessary to renew the leasehold for an additional five year term.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The dissent relies on <em>Corthouts </em>v. <em>Connecticut Fire Safety Services Corp., </em>2 Conn. Cir. Ct. 34, 193 A.2d 909 (1963), for the proposition that the extension of a lease does not require a new writing if at least three limitations are included in the lease, the commencement, the continuance and the termination. Id., 38-39; but see <em>W.G. Maltby, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Realty Co., </em>114 Conn. 283, 288, 158 A. 548 (1932), in which our Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[t]he contract is definite as to the premises to be let, the time when the term was to commence, the duration of the term, <em>the rent to be paid, </em>and was, as between the parties, a valid lease of the premises.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>In <em>Corthouts, </em>the lease provided an option for an extension and the amount of rent to be paid if the lease were extended.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The lessee was not required to give notice of its intension to exercise its option to continue in possession of the premises. Under certain conditions, which were present in <em>Corthouts, </em>a lessee\u2019s mere holding over was sufficient to exercise its option. <em>Corthouts </em>v. <em>Connecticut Fire Safety Services Corp., </em>supra, 2 Conn. Cir. Ct. 39. The court noted that the lease at issue provided the amount of rent to be paid and distinguished the case from <em>Welk </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>136 Conn. 603, 73 A.2d 295 (1950), in which the dispute centered on the amount of rent to be paid. <em>Corthouts </em>v. <em>Connecticut Fire Safety Services Corp., </em>supra, 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">In <em>Welk, </em>the landlord and the tenant had agreed to a month-to-month lease of a tobacco bam for $10 per month. <em>Welk </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>supra, 136 Conn. 605. Prior to the expiration of a month\u2019s term, the landlord informed the tenant that he was increasing the rent to $125. Id. The tenant held over, refused to pay $125 per month and continued to pay $10 per month. Id. The landlord brought an action to collect the difference between $10 and $125 per month. Id., 604-605.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\u201cThe fact that the [tenant in Welk] held over in possession of the property after the expiration of his lease for the month . . . did not itself create a lease for the subsequent month. The parties were free to make a contract for the future occupancy of the property. If there had been no dispute between them as to the terms of the future occupancy, the holding over by the tenant and the acquiescence therein by the landlord would have raised such a contract by implication. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Indeed, if the landlord had specified terms for the future occupancy of the property, the continuance in possession by the tenant without objection by him to those terms might have been construed as an acceptance of those terms and thus a contract would have been implied from the conduct of the parties. . . . But if there had actually been no meeting of the minds either because of ambiguity or uncertainty in negotiations or because the negotiations had not been completed, then, of course, there could have been no contract. ... If a tenant remains in possession without the consent of the landlord, there is no contract for an extended term to be implied from the holding over. ... A fortiori, where the parties are in definite dispute as to any of the essential terms of a new tenancy, certainly no lease can be implied from the fact that the tenant holds over.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 607-608.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">The <em>Welk </em>court noted that the landlord could not impose the increased rent on the tenant and that the tenant\u2019s refusal to pay left the parties without a contract. Id., 608. The tenant was not a trespasser, as he had entered into possession of the property under a lease that gave him the right to possession. Id. \u201cThe plaintiff could have revoked that right and recovered the right of possession by peaceable entry or by way of summary process.\u201d Id.;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> see also <em>FJK Associates </em>v. <em>Karkoski, </em>52 Conn. App. 66, 68, 725 A.2d 991 (1999). The case before us is similar: The parties do not have a contract or lease because there was no meeting of the minds as to the rent to be paid during the optional, second five year lease term.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The case of <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Loforese, </em>supra, 111 Conn. 700, demonstrates how the practical construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>the parties\u2019 contract can be determined by their conduct prior to a dispute. In 1919, the Ackerman parties entered into the five year lease that contained an option for renewal and an option to purchase the premises for a specific sum. At the end of the first year under the lease, the parties executed a supplemental agreement continuing the lease in all respects, except that the amount of rent was increased. In 1924, at the end of the five year term, the tenant notified the landlord that he was exercising his option to continue to rent the premises under the same terms and conditions of the original lease. The tenant offered to sign a renewal lease, but no new lease was executed. After refusing to accept the tenant\u2019s rent for a few months in 1924, the landlord accepted all rent until the events that gave rise to the tenant\u2019s action for specific performance. In 1929, the tenant notified the landlord of his intent to exercise the option to purchase and tendered the agreed on price. The landlord refused to convey the premises to the tenant. \u201c[The landlord\u2019s] acquiescence and conduct and that of his successors was consistent only with a construction that the word \u2018renewed\u2019 was used in the lease as synonymous with \u2018extended\u2019 or with an admission that the exercise by the [tenant] of his election to renew was such an affirmative act as to create the renewal.\u201d Id., 706. In the present case, the plaintiff did not acquiesce in the defendant\u2019s holding over, thereby creating a new lease by implication. See <em>Welk </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>supra, 136 Conn. 607.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Here, there is no question that the parties did not sign a new agreement, the rent for a second five year term had not been determined, and the plaintiff did nothing to acquiesce in the defendant\u2019s continuing in possession after April, 2000. The option in the lease constituted a renewal, not an extension of the lease. That conclusion is supported by the undisputed conduct of the parties in May, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">We therefore conclude that the court properly granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment because, in accordance with \u00a7 47a-26d, the defendant had no right to possession of the premises after the five year leasehold expired.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly concluded that the equitable doctrines of laches, equitable forfeiture and promissory estoppel were not applicable special defenses in this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although we acknowledge that equitable special defenses may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>alleged in a summary process action; see <em>Fellows </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>217 Conn. 57, 61-63, 584 A.2d 458 (1991); <em>Kim </em>v. <em>Magnotta, </em>49 Conn.

First, there must have been a delay that was inexcusable, and, second, that delay must have prejudiced the defendant. ... A conclusion that a plaintiff has been guilty of laches is one of fact for the trier and not one that can be made by this court, unless the subordinate facts found make such a conclusion inevitable as a matter of law. . . . We must defer to the court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ridgefield </em>v. <em>Eppoliti Realty Co., </em>71 Conn. App. 321, 333, 801 A.2d 902, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 933, 806 A.2d 1070 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">On the basis of our review of the pleadings, we agree with the court\u2019s findings and analysis. In this summary process action, count one of the complaint seeks to evict the defendant on the basis of the termination of the lease by lapse of time. The defendant did not raise a genuine issue of fact that the plaintiff did not com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>menee its action in a timely manner, but claimed that the plaintiff did not present timely its legal theory regarding the enforceability of the renewal option. The lease expired on April 30, 2000. The notice to quit was served on the defendant on May 4, 2000, and the action was commenced in June, 2000. The plaintiff could not have commenced the action prior to the expiration of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">\u201c[T]he defense of laches does not apply unless there is an unreasonable, inexcusable, and prejudicial delay in bringing suit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Tripp, </em>204 Conn. 67, 88, 527 A.2d 230 (1987); <em>Castonguay </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>46 Conn. App. 251, 265, 699 A.2d 226, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 931, 701 A.2d 660 (1997). The court, therefore, properly concluded that the defendant could not prevail on its special defense of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The defendant claims that the doctrine of equitable estoppel should bar the plaintiffs claim. The defendant asserts that the plaintiff should have told the defendant that it did not believe the covenant to renew was enforceable when it acquired title to the premises. Although the court analyzed the defendant\u2019s claim, it also restated its conclusion that the enforceability of the renewal option relates to the defendant\u2019s right to a new lease, not to the defendant\u2019s right of possession. We agree that the defendant\u2019s equitable estoppel defense does not apply to the plaintiffs right of possession in this summary process action.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">The defendant\u2019s third equitable defense is based on the doctrine of equitable forfeiture.

In the present action, the defendant argues that the doctrine should excuse its alleged failure to exercise its right of renewal properly by sending notice via certified mail. The court already concluded in its memorandum of decision that under the holding in <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>supra, 75 Conn. 186-87, \u201cproper notice by the defendant of its intent to renew might create a contractual right to a new lease, but does not itself create a right to possession. Consequently, under the facts of the present case, the equitable doctrine against forfeitures does not implicate the defendant\u2019s right to possession, as equitable defenses to summary process must. Nor does the defense constitute a genuine issue of material fact because it cannot affect the outcome of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In this opinion FLYNN, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-26d provides: \u201cIf, on the trial of a summary process complaint it is found that the defendant is the lessee of the complainant and holds over after the termination of the lease or rental agreement or, if there was <em>no lease or </em>rental agreement, that the defendant is the occupant of such premises and has no right or privilege to occupy the same and that notice to quit has been given as provided in this chapter, yet that the defendant holds possession or occupancy after the expiration of the time specified in such notice to quit, and the defendant does not show a title in himself which accrued after the giving of the lease or rental agreement, if any, or <em>if the defendant does not show a title in himself existing at the time the notice to quit possession or occupancy was served upon him, </em>the court shall forthwith enter judgment that the complainant recover possession or occupancy of the premises with his costs, and execution shall issue accordingly subject to the provisions of sections 47a-35 to 4a-41, inclusive.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-17\"> The lease states in relevant part: \u201cAnd it is further agreed that in case the said Tenant shall, with the written consent of the said Landlord endorsed hereon, or on the duplicate hereof, at any time hold over the said premises, beyond the period above specified as the termination of this lease, then the said Tenant shall hold said premises upon the same terms, and under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>same stipulations and agreements as are in this instrument contained, and no holding over by said Tenant shall operate to renew this lease without such written consent of said Landlord.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9v\">The lease further states in relevant part: \u201cADDITIONAL OPTIONS \u201cIf this lease is not in default nor has been cancelled at the expiration of the prime leased terms as contained herein, at the expiration of the term of this lease (April 30, 1995) the Tenant shall have the further option to renew said lease for Two further periods of Five years each from said date upon the same terms and conditions except that annual rental for said additional terms is to be negotiated by the parties, provided, however, that notice of said intention to renew shall be given to the Landlord on or before October 31, 1994.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\"> The amendment to the lease states: \u201cThis Amendment made and executed this 2nd day of May, 1995, by and between [the plaintiffs predecessor] (hereinafter referred to as the Landlord) and [the defendant] (hereinafter referred to as the Tenant).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">\u201cWitnesseth:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">\u201cWHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant are parties to certain Lease made and executed on April 25, 1985, and a certain Assignment of Lease dated April 23, 1985, relating to certain premises located within the Plaza Trust Stop in North Stonington, Connecticut, all as more particularly described therein; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-10\">\u201cWHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant entered into a certain Amendment of Lease made and executed on June 27,1994, (the foregoing Lease, Assignment of lease and Amendment of Lease, copies of which are attached hereto, hereinafter collectively referred to as the \u2018Lease\u2019); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-11\">\u201cWHEREAS, the Lease provides that at the expiration of the term of the Lease on April 30, 1995, \u2018the Tenant shall have the further option to renew said Lease for two further periods of five (5) years each\u2019; and \u201cWHEREAS, the parties desire to set forth herein their agreement concerning the exercise of the aforesaid option to renew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-12\">\u201cNOW, THEREFORE, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-13\">\u201c1.

It also challenges the court\u2019s construction of the lease and its amendment.

There was no disagreement about what the parties did in 1995 to renew the lease. They signed an amendment to the lease. In opposition to the motion for summary judgment, the defendant contended that there was a disagreement about the intent of the parties. The trial court made its determination on the basis of the language in the lease. All of the evidence was before the trial court, which determined that according to the language of the lease, to remain on the premises, the defendant needed a writing. The majority agrees, but in response, the dissent points out that the distinction between renewal and extension is vague and that the conduct of the parties is determinative. The majority agrees with that proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Appellate review of a motion for summary judgment is plenary. The parties do not disagree that they negotiated rent and signed an amendment for the five year renewal in 1995. The parties\u2019 behavior was what it was; there is nothing ambiguous about it. In view of our case law, cited by the dissent, there is no evidence that could be presented at a trial that could change the outcome. Consequently, the majority has not engaged in fact-finding, as there was no genuine issue of material fact that a writing was needed to renew the lease in 1995.

Those cases, too, are factually distinct and do not support the position taken by the dissent. In each case, the new rent was determined or there was an agreed formula for computing the same. See <em>Warner Associates </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 96 (negotiated renewal lease to be in writing, tenant holding over would not constitute renewal or extension of lease); <em>David A. Altschuler Trust </em>v. <em>Blanchette, </em>supra, 33 Conn.

Because we affirm the judgment on the basis of the issues presented by the defendant, we will not consider the plaintiffs alternate basis. The plaintiff requested that we consider the alternate basis as a matter of judicial economy so that the parties and the court could obviate the need for a trial in the parties\u2019 separate breach of contract action. As we and the trial court both have stated, the enforceability of the renewal clause is not relevant to the plaintiffs summary process action, which concerns only the right of possession.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b798-6\">BISHOP, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ana-dedup-0\">dissenting. I believe that the trial court should not have granted summary judgment because the pleadings and affidavits submitted by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>in opposition to the motion for summary judgment fairly implicated the central question of whether the lease had terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The trial court relied on the proposition, gleaned from Connecticut decisional law, that, where the language of the lease is clear and definite, the intention of the parties must be gathered from the instrument itself, and that, where contractual language is clear and unambiguous, intent is a question of law that may be decided by way of summary judgment. <em>Water &amp; Way Properties </em>v. <em>Colt\u2019s Mfg. Co., </em>230 Conn. 660, 666-68, 646 A.2d 143 (1994) (phrase \u201cadditional rent\u201d plain, unambiguous); <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>164 Conn. 369, 373-74, 321 A.2d 444 (1973) (provision for increased rent if property foreclosed on found unambiguous). While I agree that these propositions apply in many cases involving contractual interpretation, I believe these truths are, here, inapplicable. Our courts have consistently held that even though a lease speaks in terms of a \u201cright to renew,\u201d that language, itself, is not conclusive. Therefore, to the extent that the court found that the language of the lease alone was adequate to determine the intent of the parties as a matter of law, I believe it improperly grafted general contract law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> into a particular context in which decisional law has carved out an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">I agree with the majority that the determinative issue is whether the option in the lease is one to extend or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>to renew, and also agree that the resolution of that issue requires a determination of the parties\u2019 intent. I part company with my colleagues because I believe that intent is a genuine question of material fact that, when adequately raised, defeats summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">A review of our decisional law suggests that the specific contractual language \u201coption to renew\u201d is frequently not indicative of the nature of the option, and, in such cases where it is contended that the lease option is for an extension and not a renewal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> further inquiry is warranted to determine the intent of the parties. The distinction between an extension and a renewal of a lease is a technical one; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Mary Oliver Candy Shops, Inc., </em>116 Conn. 86, 89, 163 A. 606 (1933); and one that is ignored in a substantial number of jurisdictions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> yet persists, vestigially, in Connecticut. The most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>pertinent aspect of the distinction is that an extension is considered a continuation of the existing lease, not requiring a new lease, while a renewal, in the most technical sense, is a new demise, requiring a new lease.* <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ar3\">The trial court\u2019s decision and the majority\u2019s affirmance turn on the characterization of the lease language as an option to renew. If the option is for a renewal, then, as our case law generally holds, the exercise of the option results in no possessory right in the leasehold without a new written lease \u2014 though it may entitle the lessee to other legal rights. If the option is determined to be an extension, then the exercise of the option provides a possessory right, as the extended term is viewed as a continuance of the original lease. In other words, if the lease option is a covenant to extend the lease, and not to renew it, then the summary process action under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-26d is inapplicable because the defendants, if they have properly exercised the option to extend the lease,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> can show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>title.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, to defeat the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment in the present action, it should have been sufficient for the defendant to raise the factual question of whether the option operates as an extension or as a renewal. I believe the defendant met this burden by the pleadings and the materials it submitted in opposition to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">A brief review of our decisional law supports the notion that the option language can be understood as providing for an extension, rather than a renewal, by reference to the conduct of the parties and a review of the entire lease. In short, the language of the clause itself, no matter how apparently clear, is, alone, often not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">In <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Loforese, </em>111 Conn. 700, 151 A. 159 (1930), a tenant attempted to renew pursuant to a renewal clause, but did not succeed in obtaining a new lease. When the landlord later claimed that the tenant had failed in his attempt to renew, the court turned to the distinction between a renewal and an extension. \u201cA technical difference is frequently recognized . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>between the effect of a covenant for renewal and one for extension, especially as to the effect of retention of possession after the original term, it being held that a stipulation for renewal does not, like a covenant to extend, of itself and alone continue the tenancy for the renewal period, but calls for a new lease, a formal extension of the existing lease or something equivalent thereto .... [I]t is recognized that the technical difference may be controlled by the intention of the parties as manifested by the entire lease or by their practical construction of their contract, as by conduct before the controversy arose, whereby the privilege may be construed as one for an extension of term, though the language employed, in a strict technical sense, may signify renewal. The mere fact that the privilege is called one to renew is not conclusive.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">These two tenets \u2014 that the terminology of renewal does not necessarily mean that a renewal was intended and that the intention of the parties may govern the characterization \u2014 have been reiterated frequently in landlord-tenant cases since <em>Ackerman. </em>In <em>Blanck </em>v. <em>Kimland Realty Co., </em>122 Conn. 317, 189 A. 176 (1937), which quoted <em>W.G. Maltby, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Realty Co., </em>114 Conn. 283, 285 n.(a) &amp; 288-89, 158 A. 548(1932), our Supreme Court held that \u201can agreement . . . for a lease . . . with privilege of renewing lease for five years, [was] one for an extension and not a covenant of renewal .... There is <em>no express covenant </em>on the part of the lessor to enter into a new lease, and we think the agreement in this case is to be construed as one for an extension rather than a covenant of renewal in the strict sense. This is controlling authority for our conclusion that in the present case the agreement was for an extension of the lease and not a covenant of renewal.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blanck </em>v. <em>Kimland Realty Co., </em>supra, 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Twelve years later, <em>in Didriksen v. Havens, </em>136 Conn. 41, 68 A.2d 163 (1949), our Supreme Court, in affirming the trial court, concluded that the phrase \u201c \u2018the privilege of renewing this lease\u2019 id., 42; actually gave the lessee the privilege of extending the lease. Id., 45. In doing so, the court looked to letters exchanged by the lessor and lessee (which continued to use the word \u201crenew\u201d), the parties\u2019 actions, as well as the lessee\u2019s improvements to the property. Id., 44-45. \u201cIf there is any doubt that extensions rather than renewals were intended, it is removed by the practical construction of the parties in continuing the lease merely upon the strength of the letters passing between them.\u201d Id., 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">More recently, in <em>Seven Fifty Main Street Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Spector, </em>5 Conn. App. 170, 171, 497 A.2d 96, cert. dismissed, 197 Conn. 815, 499 A.2d 804 (1985), the court commented that \u201c[although . . . the lease speaks in terms of a \u2018right to renew,\u2019 such language, in and of itself, is not conclusive [of the parties\u2019 intent].\u201d The holdover lessee, who had not acted in any affirmative way to renew the lease, claimed that the option was really one to extend, which would be exercised by holding over. The court reviewed the holdover clause to ascertain the intent of the parties in the event that the lessees remained on the premises after the expiration of the lease.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Upon finding that the holdover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>clause foreclosed the possibility that remaining after the lease\u2019s first term would operate to either extend or renew (the factual distinction, at this point, became immaterial), this court found that the trial court did not improperly find that the option was one to renew.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">As this cursory review of our decisional law shows, the language of the lease does not control when determining whether an option is one to renew or to extend, but the intent of the parties controls, as evidenced by any number of collateral factors, including the actions or expressed beliefs of the parties, the nature of the business at the leasehold, the parties\u2019 statements and deeds, and past practice: In other words, <em>\u201cthe intention of the parties as manifested by the entire lease or by their practical construction of their contract, as by conduct before the controversy arose </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Loforese, </em>supra, 111 Conn. 704. This determination requires an examination of the intent of the parties, and, since intent is a question of fact; <em>Peter-Michael, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sea Shell Associates, </em>244 Conn. 269, 275, 709 A.2d 558 (1998); requiring fact based analysis, summary judgment should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to title, the trial court looked to the construction of the renewal clause, and, to a lesser extent, the holdover clause to determine whether the parties intended that a new written lease would be required for the defendant to remain in possession. The majority goes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>further and additionally examines the lease amendment to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the parties intended to renew. In either case, I believe, respectfully, the court is engaging in fact-finding, an improper foray when testing a motion for summary judgment or a trial court\u2019s response to it. For me, the inquiry stops at the determination that a question of material fact, in this case the intent of the parties, has been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">In examining the entire lease, and the practical construction of it by the parties prior to this controversy, as our case law requires, I think it is material that the first renewal, for five years after the initial ten year term, was exercised <em>without a new lease, </em>but merely with an amendment to the original lease. The amendment, dated two days after the expiration of the first term, memorializes the parties\u2019 agreement to the renewal, specifies terms for the new rental period<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and refers back to the original lease for all other terms.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The sole condition precedent mentioned in conjunction with the option to renew, both in the original document and the amendment, was for timely notice. Under these circumstances, it is not unreasonable to conclude that a fact finder could determine that the parties contemplated a lease extension, notwithstanding the language of the option clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Additionally, the option here contains no express requirement for a new lease, nor did the parties create a new lease when the option for the first term was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>exercised. These facts alone, if construed in favor of the nonmoving party, raise a question of material fact as to the intent of the parties that is sufficient to defeat summary judgment. Also, the affidavit from the defendant\u2019s president attests the following: \u201c[A]ll the parties to the transaction knew that I would only purchase the restaurant if I could have a twenty year lease. . . . [I]t was always my intent and the intent of the parties to permit [the defendant] to have a twenty year lease. . . . [I]t was absolutely imperative to have a twenty year lease in order to make the financial commitment necessary to run this business.\u201d Further, the defendant in that affidavit purports to \u201chave expended large sums of money, in addition to my lease payments, to effectuate any and all repairs and \u2018cosmetic renovations\u2019 that were or may have been required under the lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">To the extent that the court made factual findings that led it to the conclusion that the lease was clear and unambiguous, the court exceeded its bounds. It is axiomatic that in considering a motion for summary judgment, the function of the court is to determine whether any genuine issue of material fact is in dispute, not to make factual findings. <em>Golden </em>v. <em>Johnson Memorial Hospital, Inc., </em>66 Conn. App. 518, 522, 785 A.2d 234, cert. denied, 259 Conn. 902, 789 A.2d 990 (2001); <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>35 Conn. App. 94, 102, 644 A.2d 933 (1994). The court found that \u201cit is undisputed that . . . the old lease expired and a new lease was never implemented.\u201d While the defendant was, concededly, unclear in its assertion that the option was one to extend and not simply one to renew (\u201cthe technical distinction\u201d), it has consistently denied that the lease had expired by lapse of time, and has asserted that the intent behind the two lease options was to have the equivalent of a twenty year lease. Implicit in these assertions is the belief that the option was, what has been historically called, an extension. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Since, in Connecticut, we maintain a distinction between covenants to renew and covenants to extend, and hold that the language of such covenants is equivocal in itself, I believe we are obliged to look beyond the immediate language of the option, to factually determine the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\"> \u201c[BJecause the trial court relied solely upon the written [agreements] in ascertaining the intent of the parties, the legal inferences properly to be drawn from the [documents are questions] of law .... <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>[222 Conn. 49], 53-54, [607 A.2d 424 (1992)].

Some authorities have gone further and declared that there is no distinction or substantial difference between the terms. It has been asserted that the words \u2018renewal\u2019 and \u2018extension\u2019 as used in a lease are not always to be considered words of art, that they have no legal or technical significance, and that they may mean whatever the parties intended when contracting.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">\u201cEven in jurisdictions in which a distinction obtains, it has been judicially recognized that considerable difficulty sometimes arises in deciding whether in different leases a provision is one for a renewal or an extension. In the final analysis, whether a contractual provision involves a renewal or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>extension is determined by the intention of the parties as disclosed by the whole instrument and the parties\u2019 interpretation and practical construction thereof; and the use of the word \u2018renewal\u2019 or \u2018extension\u2019 is not conclusive.\u201d 51C C.J.S. 165-66, Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 54 (b) (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\"> R. Schoshinski, American Law of Landlord and Tenant (1980) \u00a7 9:1, p. 596. \u201cSome courts have drawn this sharp distinction between renewal and extension, requiring more than mere holding over and payment of rent to exercise an option to renew. Under the most narrow view, since renewal is a new tenancy, the execution of a new leasing agreement is required to give it effect.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\"> I am mindful that the option, even if construed as an option to extend, leaves the monthly rental of the extended period open to negotiation. That concern, however, is not determinative of the issue because the inclusion of a fixed rate for the option period may not be an essential component of an option to extend. See <em>Corthouts </em>v. <em>Connecticut Fire Safety Services Corp., </em>2 Conn. Cir. Ct. 34, 38-39, 193 A.2d 909 (1963) (extension does not require new document if, in existing lease, at least three of limitations for valid lease are certain: commencement, continuance, end of term); see also <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>Dugan\u2019s Restaurant Cafe, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Housing Session, Docket No. 015786 (March <em>20,1996); Larsen </em>v. <em>Timothy\u2019s Ice Cream, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Housing Session, Docket No. 29502 (October 12, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The question of whether an option to extend or renew, where the rent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>to be paid is \u201cto be negotiated,\u201d is unenforceable for vagueness is a question of first impression for appellate review in Connecticut. Other jurisdictions have split on the issue, some finding that the absence of a rental amount or a formula for determining it makes the option unenforceable; see 58 A.L.R.3d 500 (1974); but a growing number of jurisdictions have found that a \u201creasonable\u201d amount of monthly rent is to be implied and could be determined by a court to be fair market rental. See <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Frisbee, </em>119 N.H. 555, 560, 404 A.2d 1106 (1979); <em>Playmate Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Country Clubs, Inc., </em>62 Tenn. App. 383, 462 S.W.2d 890 (1970). This latter view has been characterized as the \u201ctrend in modem decisions\u201d by at least one commentator. R.

In contrast, in this case, the clause makes no mention of the effect holding over would have as to the exercise of an extension, nor does it mention a new written lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">At common law, an extension can be exercised by mere holding over. Whether an extension can be exercised in such a way is only peripheral to this case, however, because, the lease provides another specific means of exercising the option, that is, by giving timely notice, which the lessee, arguably, gave. It is argued that the giving of proper notice combined with the terms of the option specified in the lease was sufficient to exercise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>option to extend the lease. In essence, the lessee claims that it is not holding over.
