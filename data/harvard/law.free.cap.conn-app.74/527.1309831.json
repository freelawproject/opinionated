Gasser, appeals from the judgment of conviction rendered by the trial court subsequent to his plea of guilty to the charge of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during the plea process. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the defendant\u2019s appeal. The defendant was charged with manslaughter in the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>degree with a motor vehicle and failure to drive on the right in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-230 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3On December 10, 1999, the defendant withdrew his not guilty plea and pleaded guilty to the charge of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that time, the defendant was represented by attorney David Lenefsky, a member of the New York bar who had been admitted pro hac vice<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the purpose of representing the defendant in the criminal matter. The plea bargain that the state disclosed to the court contemplated a sentence of ten years, execution suspended after seven years, a period of probation, and the right for the defendant to argue for a lesser sentence on behalf of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Prior to accepting the defendant\u2019s plea, the court engaged in a lengthy canvass of the defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 through 39-21. The court read a recital of the facts of the case, and the defendant conceded that he generally knew what the evidence would have been had there been a trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>acknowledged that at the time of his canvass, he was not under the influence of any alcohol, drugs or medication. Additionally, the court reviewed the elements of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle, as well as the rights that the defendant waived by pleading guilty. The court informed the defendant that he would not be able to withdraw his plea without permission. The defendant acknowledged that he was pleading guilty of his own volition and that no one had forced him to do so. The court accepted the plea after concluding that it was entered into knowingly and voluntarily, and was made with the assistance of competent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On March 3, 2000, prior to the sentencing hearing, attorney John R. Williams, a member of the Connecticut bar, filed an appearance on behalf of the defendant. On the same day, the defendant filed a motion to withdraw the plea and claimed that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. Specifically, the court found that Lenefsky\u2019s representation did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the defendant voluntarily had pleaded guilty. The court thereafter rendered judgment of guilty and sentenced the defendant to a period of incarceration of ten years, suspended after five years, with five years of probation with special conditions. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">On appeal, the defendant renews his claims that the court improperly denied his motion to withdraw his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>guilty plea, which motion he made pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 and in which he asserted that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant claims that Lenefsky\u2019s representation fell below the range of competence of a lawyer with ordinary training in the field of criminal law. Specifically, the defendant argues that Lenefsky (1) failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the facts of the case, (2) failed to obtain a full accident reconstruction by an independent expert, (3) failed to communicate to him the availability of an expert who would testily that the accident was not caused by the defendant and (4) excessively pressured him into pleading guilty. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">At the outset, we must identify the applicable standard of review and set forth the legal framework that guides our resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. \u201c[0]nce entered, a guilty plea cannot be withdrawn except by leave of the court, within its sound discretion, and a denial thereof is reversible only if it appears that there has been an abuse of discretion. . . . The burden is always on the defendant to show a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>253 Conn. 497, 505-506, 752 A.2d 49 (2000). \u201cWe further note the pertinent case law applicable to ineffective assistance of counsel claims brought under Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (4). Our case law holds that [a] claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is generally made pursuant to a petition for a writ of habeas coipus rather than in a direct appeal. . . . Section 39-27 of the Practice Book, however, provides an exception to that general rule when ineffective assistance of counsel results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>in a guilty plea. A defendant must satisfy two requirements ... to prevail on a claim that his guilty plea resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel. . . . First, he must prove that the assistance was not within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in criminal law .... Second, there must exist such an interrelationship between the ineffective assistance of counsel and the guilty plea that it can be said that the plea was not voluntary and intelligent because of the ineffective assistance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>67 Conn. App. 168, 177, 786 A.2d 1171 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>63 Conn. App. 151, 161-62, 772 A.2d 747, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 934, 776 A.2d 1151 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u201cIn choosing to plead guilty, the defendant is waiving several constitutional rights, including his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to trial by jury, and his right to confront his accusers. . . . These considerations demand the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and its consequences. . . . We therefore require the record affirmatively to disclose that the defendant\u2019s choice was made intelligently and voluntarily.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 503. With those principles in mind, we now address the defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The defendant first argues that Lenefsky failed to conduct an adequate investigation into the facts of the case. The defendant claims an adequate investigation by Lenefsky was of particular importance in this case because the defendant had no recollection of the accident. We have previously noted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s cautionary advice in <em>Strickland </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number><em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), that \u201c[\u00a1judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a [defendant] to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. ... A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the [defendant] must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. . . . [C]ounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>66 Conn. App. 598, 601, 785 A.2d 1143 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">At the evidentiary hearing, Lenefsky testified that he had numerous discussions with the defendant and his family. He stated that he reviewed the materials that he obtained during pretrial discovery, including various police and medical reports, as well as statements from witnesses. Lenefsky discussed the case with medical experts and engineers. As part of his investigation, Len-efsky went to and examined the accident scene and obtained a psychiatric evaluation for the defendant. He utilized local counsel to assist with Connecticut procedure and reviewed the relevant statutes. On the basis of that conduct, we agree with the court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Lenefsky\u2019s actions in investigating the accident involving the defendant did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The defendant next argues that Lenefsky failed to obtain an independent accident reconstruction expert. Lenefsky, however, utilized an expert witness to review the state\u2019s report detailing the accident, although he did not want the expert to produce a written report.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After reviewing the information with the expert, Lenef-sky concluded that although he would be able to attack the state\u2019s accident report at trial, ultimately, that was, on the basis of his experience, not a triable issue. On the basis of that evidence, we conclude that the court properly found that Lenefsky\u2019s actions did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">The defendant next argues that Lenefsky failed to communicate to him the availability of an expert who would testify that the defendant did not cause the accident. The defendant initially testified that Lenefsky never informed him that it would be possible to obtain an accident reconstruction expert who would testify that the accident was not the defendant\u2019s fault. Later, the defendant stated that he and Lenefsky did in fact discuss the possibility of hiring such an expert.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>court, in its memorandum of decision, did not address whether the defendant and Lenefsky discussed the possibility of using an expert witness to testify. The state asserts that the record, therefore, is inadequate for review of the defendant\u2019s argument. We agree with the state and do not address the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">It is the duty of the defendant in this case to provide us with an adequate record to review his claims. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 60-5 and 61-10. \u201cA lack of pertinent factual findings and legal conclusions will render a record inadequate. . . . Similarly, ambiguity in a record can render it inadequate.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>36 Conn. App. 161, 165, 649 A.2d 801 (1994), appeal dismissed, 235 Conn. 405, 666 A.2d 821 (1995). We cannot speculate as to the factual determination of whether Lenefsky failed to communicate to the defendant the possibility of obtaining an accident reconstruction expert. We therefore decline to review the claim because the defendant has not presented an adequate record for its review.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that Lenefsky excessively pressured him into entering a plea of guilty. At the plea hearing, the following colloquy occurred between the court and the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">\u201cThe Court: No one\u2019s forcing you to plead guilty by use of a threat or intimidation or anything like that?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">\u201c[Defendant]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">\u201cThe Court: This is your choice to resolve the case in this way?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">\u201c[Defendant]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">^ ^</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">\u201cThe Court: . . . But do you have any reason to disbelieve the advice of your attorney, which, obviously\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u201c[Defendant]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 is to resolve this case, on the best terms you can, by agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u201c[Defendant]: I have no question about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">\u201cIt is well established that [a] trial court may properly rely on .... the responses of the [defendant] at the time [he] responded to the trial court\u2019s plea canvass . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>65 Conn. App. 234, 252, 783 A.2d 7, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 929, 783 A.2d 1031 (2001). Moreover, during the evidentiary hearing, the defendant testified that Lenefsky did not intimidate him into pleading guilty. We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion when it found that Lenefsky did not excessively pressure the defendant into pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">On the basis of the record before us, including the testimony from the evidentiary hearing, we are unable to conclude that the court abused its discretion when it found that Lenefsky\u2019s actions did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56b (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle when, while operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both, he causes the death of another person as a consequence of the effect of such liquor or drug.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> In its memorandum of decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the court found the following facts underlying the plea. \u201cThis case involves a two car motor vehicle accident in East Haddam which resulted in the death of the driver of the other vehicle. The defendant, operator of his vehicle, was removed from his truck by a witness who told police that the vehicle \u2018reeked\u2019 of alcohol. The defendant was flown by Life Star helicopter to Hartford Hospital for treatment. A treating physician at the hospital noticed a distinct odor of alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath. Records later obtained from the hospital showed that the defendant had a blood alcohol level of 0.18 [percent]. The state\u2019s investigation determined that the vehicle operated by the defendant had veered into the opposite lane, striking the victim\u2019s vehicle head on.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> The court subsequently dismissed the charge of failure to drive on the right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 2-16 provides in relevant part: \u201cAn attorney who is in good standing at the bar of another state . . . may, upon special and infrequent occasion and for good cause shown upon written application presented by a member of the bar of this state, be permitted in the discretion of the court, to participate to such extent as the court may prescribe in the presentation of a cause or appeal in any court of this state . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\"> The defendant stated that he had no memory of the accident and that he had heard rumors that the victim suffered a heart attack while driving. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Both the court and attorney Lenefsky told him that this rumor was \u201cwishful\u201d thinking on the defendant\u2019s part. The office of the chief medical examiner issued an autopsy report that concluded that multiple blunt force trauma caused the death of the victim. The defendant conceded that if there had been a trial, he would have been convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe grounds for allowing the defendant to withdraw his or her plea after acceptance are . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\u201c(4) The plea resulted from the denial of effective assistance of counsel .. . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b554-10\"> The defendant\u2019s legal expert testified that he would not have unfavorable findings from an expert reduced to writing because they \u201cwould have to be disclosed to the opposing party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b554-11\"> The following colloquy occurred between the defendant and defense counsel during the evidentiary hearing on the motion to withdraw the defendant\u2019s guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-12\">\u201cQ. Did attorney Lenefsky ever tell you that it would be possible or might be possible that even it might be possible to find an expert who would say, like, the accident happened in your lane of travel, not the [victim\u2019s] lane? Did he ever tell you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-13\">\u201cA. No, he never did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-14\">\u201cQ.
