Finding that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Rivera\u2019s requests, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-35\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-36\">In August 1979, shortly after the Sandi-nistas assumed power in Nicaragua, Sandinista soldiers came to the home of Rivera\u2019s parents in Managua, searching for Rivera\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>older brothers. The soldiers apprehended the brothers and beat them. When Rivera pleaded with the soldiers (or interfered with their arrest, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cService\u201d)), he too was beaten, suffering a broken leg and a broken finger. After being hospitalized for 25 days, Rivera hid for several weeks in the home of a friend. He was informed by his father that the Sandi-nistas were now looking for him as a result of the encounter, and would arrest him as a supporter of the Somoza regime. He learned as well that his brothers had been sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder. Both brothers are now out of prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\">After his broken leg healed, Rivera fled Managua and went to the city of Grenada where he changed his name and performed menial labor to support his wife and children who were living with his parents in Managua. After being recognized by a Sandinista supporter in Grenada, he fled to Estel and changed his name again. He then moved from town to town for the next several years. During his six years on the run, Rivera was able to take a bus to visit his family at least one weekend per month, and never encountered any difficulties or Sandinistas when visiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">Rivera and another brother entered the United States illegally at Hidalgo, Texas in 1985. At the time of his entrance to the United States, Rivera was apprehended by the Service and issued an Order to Show Cause. Rivera moved for and was granted a change in venue to New Orleans, Louisiana. In May 1986, he filed his Request for Asylum in the United States in the Service office in New Orleans.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">At his hearing before the immigration judge on May 12, 1987, the judge granted Rivera\u2019s request for asylum under \u00a7 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the \u201cD\u00cdA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a), and withholding of deportation under \u00a7 243(h) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The immigration judge apparently based his grant in part on the prediction that there would not be a change of government in Nicaragua. He found that Rivera had a well-founded fear of persecution because of his family\u2019s pro-Somoza leanings and Rivera\u2019s intercession on behalf of his brothers when they were being arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-12\">The Service appealed to the Board, contending that Rivera\u2019s only contact with the Sandinistas was when he criminally interfered with the arrest of his brothers. He fled, argued the Service, because he was warned he had been accused of assaulting an officer and interfering with an arrest. The Service also contended that Rivera had no reasonable fear of persecution because the new Nicaraguan government had no inclination to punish him for these acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-13\">On December 6, 1990, the Board sustained the appeal, reversing the decision of the immigration judge. <em>In re Gonzalo Rivera-Cruz, </em>file no. A27 677 461 (BIA, Dec. 6, 1990). The Board concluded that in light of the change of government in Nicaragua, Rivera could not establish that he had a well-founded fear of persecution should he return. The Board took administrative notice that in April 1990, Violeta Chamorro was elected President of Nicaragua, and that the Sandinista regime was no longer in power. Given its recognition that the Sandinista government no longer governed Nicaragua, the Board found that Rivera did not have a well-founded fear of persecution by the current government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-14\">The Board further held that \u201ceven if one were to assume that [Rivera\u2019s] previous experiences in Nicaragua amounted to past persecution, or that at the time he left [Nicaragua] and for some time thereafter he had a well-founded fear of persecution should he return, it is not established that he presently merits a grant of asylum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Citing <em>Matter of Chen, </em>Int.Dec. 3104 (BIA 1989), the Board acknowledged that in certain circumstances past persecution alone might warrant a grant of asylum even if there were no likelihood of present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>persecution. Such a situation would exist where the past persecution was so severe that return to the country of persecution would be inhumane. Even had petitioner established past persecution, the Board concluded, on the record presented there were no \u201chumanitarian or compelling bases\u201d for granting him asylum on this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">The Board held as well that, given petitioner\u2019s failure to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, he <em>a fortiori </em>could not satisfy the more rigorous standard for withholding of deportation. The Board concluded by granting petitioner a thirty-day voluntary departure period, and alternatively ordered petitioner\u2019s deportation to Nicaragua should he not voluntarily depart within that time. Rivera petitions this court for review of the Board\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">The standard for determining if asylum should be granted is whether a reasonable person in the applicant\u2019s circumstances would fear persecution. <em>Guevara Flores v. INS, </em>786 F.2d 1242, 1249 (5th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>480 U.S. 930, 107 S.Ct. 1565, 94 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987). It is sufficient under this standard to show that persecution is a reasonable possibility, or that the applicant has a \u201cwell-founded\u201d fear of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 428, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1211, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). In order to qualify for withholding of deportation, a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution must be shown. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 2492, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). According to these standards, it is easier to qualify for asylum than for a withholding of deportation. <em>Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. at 443, 107 S.Ct. at 1219; <em>Guevara Flores, </em>786 F.2d at 1250.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We accord deference to the Board\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes unless there are compelling indications that the Board\u2019s interpretation is incorrect. <em>Campos-Guardado v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 285, 289 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 826, 108 S.Ct. 92, 98 L.Ed.2d 53 (1987); <em>Guevara Flores, </em>786 F.2d at 1250 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">The Board took administrative notice of the change of governments in Nicaragua and the Sandinistas\u2019 loss of power. The Board took notice as well that Chamorro has announced a general amnesty covering the hostilities between the Contra resistance and the Nicaraguan government, and an end to military conscription.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on the notice of these facts, the Board found that Rivera is not eligible for asylum because persecution under the Chamorro government is not a reasonable possibility and his fears of persecution are not well-founded. Rivera now argues to this court that the Chamorro government is unstable and that the Sandinistas have more power than the Board recognizes, and adduces various newspaper articles to that effect. This court should, argues Rivera, take judicial notice of the frailty of Chamorro\u2019s government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">Courts allow agencies \u201cwide latitude in taking official notice.\u201d <em>Kaczmarczyk v. INS, </em>933 F.2d 588, 596 (7th Cir.1991). Because the taking of notice is committed to the broad discretion of the agency, we review the taking of administrative notice by the Board under the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">The Board is entitled to take administrative notice of a change of government. <em>See, e.g., Kapcia v. INS, </em>944 F.2d 702 (10th Cir.1991) (notice taken of Solidarity party becoming member of Polish coalition government); <em>Kubon v. INS, </em>913 F.2d 386, 388 (7th Cir.1990) (same); <em>United States ex rel. Mercer v. Esperdy, </em>234 F.Supp. 611, 616 (S.D.N.Y.1964) (notice tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>en of unsafe conditions in Haiti). An agency such as the Board may take official notice of \u201ccommonly acknowledged facts, [and] ... technical or scientific facts that are within the agency\u2019s area of expertise.\u201d <em>McLeod v. INS, </em>802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir.1986); <em>see also Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Util. Comm\u2019n, </em>301 U.S. 292, 57 S.Ct. 724, 81 L.Ed. 1093 (1937); <em>Kaczmarczyk, </em>933 F.2d at 596. According to the Seventh Circuit, in exercising official notice, \u201cadministrative agencies may consider commonly acknowledged facts.... The Board\u2019s notice of current events bearing on an applicant's well-founded fear of persecution ... falls within this accepted category.\u201d <em>Kaczmarczyk, </em>933 F.2d at 593-94 (citing <em>McLeod, </em>802 F.2d at 93 n. 4). The Board may also draw reasonable inferences from the evidence which \u201ccomport with common sense.\u201d <em>Kapcia, </em>944 F.2d at 702; <em>Kaczmarczyk, </em>933 F.2d at 594; <em>cf. NLRB v. Milk Drivers &amp; Dairy Employees, </em>531 F.2d 1162, 1165 (2d Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">We are constrained to find that the Board did not abuse its discretion by taking official notice that Chamorro is now in power and the Sandinistas are not. We cannot decide otherwise because there is properly before us no evidence to the contrary. Rivera argues for the first time to this court that Chamorro\u2019s regime is crumbling. Rivera\u2019s attempt to argue officially noticed facts for the first time in this forum is misplaced, for we cannot weigh evidence that has not been brought previously before the Board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Yahkpua v. INS, </em>770 F.2d 1317, 1320 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Tejeda-Mata v. INS, </em>626 F.2d 721, 726 (9th Cir.1980) (\u201cthis Court does not sit as an administrative agency for the purpose of fact-finding in the first instance....\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 994, 102 S.Ct. 2280, 73 L.Ed.2d 1291 (1982). To argue facts concerning the power of the Chamorro regime here, Rivera should have first brought this information before the Board. <em>Cf. Knox v. Butler, 884 </em>F.2d 849, 852 n. 7 (5th Cir.1989) (declining to take judicial notice of facts that could have been raised in court below), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S, 1088, 110 S.Ct. 1828, 108 L.Ed.2d 957 (1990). Because we believe that Rivera\u2019s failure to contest the Board\u2019s official notice may have been caused in part by lack of clarity concerning the procedure by which he could have done so, his contentions require us to look at the process by which applicants may contest facts noticed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">As we have noted, the Board may take notice of \u201ccommonly acknowledged facts.\u201d <em>McLeod, </em>802 F.2d at 93 n. 4. The INA does not, however, provide a method for applicants who contest such facts to bring their evidence before the Board. <em>See Kaczmarczyk, </em>933 F.2d at 595.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In fact, the INA does not expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>entitle asylum applicants to rebut noticed facts, nor does it require the Board to alert applicants prior to hearing that it is taking official notice of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">This does not mean that the applicant in a deportation proceeding has no opportunity to be heard regarding the noticed facts. \u201cIt is a fundamental proposition of administrative law that interested parties must have an effective chance to respond to crucial facts.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Carson Prods. Co. v. Califano, </em>594 F.2d 453, 459 (5th Cir.1979); <em>See Banks v. Schweiker, </em>654 F.2d 637, 641 (9th Cir.1981) (parties must be given an opportunity to present information \u201cwhich might bear upon the ... truth of the matter noticed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">While not explicitly referring to the taking of notice, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2 provides that an asylum applicant may move to reopen his case to present new evidence to the Board between the time the Board renders a decision and the time the applicant is ordered to depart the United States.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Kaczmarczyk, </em>933 F.2d at 597; <em>Chavarria v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>722 F.2d 666, 669 (11th Cir.1984). Such motions will be granted if the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available or discoverable at the earlier hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2. The motion to reopen provides asylum applicants, such as Rivera, with an opportunity to be heard regarding facts officially noticed and to present contrary evidence. <em>See generally Kaczmarczyk, </em>933 F.2d at 597 (finding the motion to reopen mechanism sufficient to satisfy an applicant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to a fair asylum proceeding). Applicants may then appeal the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen to the court of appeals. <em>Dokic v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 530, 532 (6th Cir.1990) (\u201cIf the BIA were to deny the motion, petitioner could then challenge the BIA\u2019s decision in this Court_\u201d). Judicial review of motions to reopen will ensure that Board decisions to take official notice in the face of petitioners\u2019 protests do not deprive them of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>fair asylum hearings. <em>Kaczmarczyk, </em>933 F.2d at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">In the instant case, Rivera never submitted the newspaper articles as evidence before the Board, nor has he moved the Board to reopen his case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, Rivera\u2019s contention that conditions in Nicaragua are other than as officially noticed by the Board is not properly before this court and provides no basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">Rivera contends in the alternative that he merits a discretionary grant of asylum under the analysis of <em>Matter of Chen, </em>Int.Dec. 3104 (BIA 1989). Under <em>Chen, </em>a grant of asylum may be proper under certain circumstances even if there is no reasonable likelihood of present persecution. Discretionary asylum may be granted if the past persecution was so severe that repatriation of the applicant would be inhumane. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5. In <em>Chen </em>the petitioner was systematically tortured for eight years during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution on account of his religious beliefs. During that period he was locked in a room for six months, continually beaten and starved, and denied medical care. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">Even if this court accepts Rivera\u2019s claim of past persecution, the facts of the instant case do not indicate a level of persecution such that repatriation would be inhumane. <em>Compare Chen </em>at 5-6, <em>with Rojas v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 186, 189-90 (5th Cir.1991) (affirming denial of discretionary asylum to applicant who was arrested, beaten, tortured, and later fired from his job and denied other employment by Nicaraguan government). We find no error in the Board\u2019s refusal to find a humanitarian or compelling basis to grant asylum for past persecution in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">Because Rivera has failed to satisfy the lower burden of proof required for asylum, we need not decide whether Rivera is eligible for withholding of deportation. Rivera\u2019s failure to establish a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution necessarily implies that he is unable to satisfy the more demanding standard of \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution. <em>See Kubon, </em>913 F.2d at 388; <em>Diaz-Escobar, </em>782 F.2d at 1492.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-12\">Accordingly, the decision of the Board is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">. After being granted political asylum by the immigration judge on May 12, 1987, Rivera was joined in New Orleans by his wife and sons in October 1988. Rivera has been employed for three years, and all of his children are enrolled in school. In January 1991, Rivera\u2019s wife and sons received their permanent residence cards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">. Normally we review the Board\u2019s factual findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4); <em>Zamora-Morel v. INS, </em>905 F.2d 833, 838 (5th Cir.1990). The substantial evidence standard requires only that the Board's conclusion be based upon the evidence presented and be substantially reasonable. <em>Rojas v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Diaz-Escobar v. INS, </em>782 F.2d 1488, 1493 (9th Cir.1986). In this case, however, the Board has made no findings of fact other than the noticed facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1086-13\">. <em>See, e.g., Chamorro Takes Nicaraguan Helm; Hails New Era, </em>N.Y.Times, April 26, 1990, at A-1 (Violeta Chamorro\u2019s inaugural address).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">. It is hypothetically possible, though practically unlikely, that the Board might take official notice of a \u201cfact\u201d that a court could recognize as wrong or not \"commonly acknowledged.\" In that situation, the court need not wait for rehearing by the agency, and may, in assessing whether the taking of notice was proper, reverse the noticed finding or remand to the agency for further explanation. We note that the instant case does not present such a situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">. We note that the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556(e) (\u201cAPA\u201d), provides that \u201c[w]hen an agency decision rests on official notice ... a party is entitled, upon timely request, to an opportunity to show the contrary.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556(e); <em>McLeod, </em>802 F.2d at 94. The APA approach does not seem supportable, however, under Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Marcello v. Bonds, </em>349 U.S. 302, 310, 75 S.Ct. 757, 762, 99 L.Ed. 1107 (1955), that the statutory provisions of the INA relating to deportation proceedings expressly supersede the hearing provisions of the APA. The Court noted that the INA specifies that the procedures designated therein are the \u201csole and exclusive procedure[s] for deportation proceedings.\" <em>Id.; </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). The Court stated, moreover, that \"this clear and categorical direction was meant to exclude the application of the Administrative Procedure Act,\u201d and that the APA \"was intended only as a model.\u201d 349 U.S. at 309, 75 S.Ct. at 761. The Court also stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1087-11\">[W]e cannot ignore ... the direction in the statute that the methods therein prescribed shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for deportation proceedings. Unless we are to require Congress to employ magical passwords in order to effectuate an exemption from the Administrative Procedure Act, we must hold that the [INA] expressly supersedes the hearing provisions of that Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1087-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 310, 75 S.Ct. at 762.
