Specifically, the Independent Counsel in her Application for Referral of Related Matters (\u201cIndependent Counsel Application\u201d) seeks investigative and prosecutorial jurisdiction over \u201ccertain allegations against two former Department of Justice (\u201cDepartment\u201d) officials, Edward C. Schmults (\u201cSchmults\u201d) and Carol E. Din-kins (\u201cDinkins\u201d), in a report of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives (\u201cCommittee\u201d) entitled <em>Report on the Investigation of the Role of the Department of Justice in the Withholding of Environmental Protection Agency Documents in 1982-83 </em>(\u201cCommittee Report\u201d).\u201d Independent Counsel Application at 1-2. The Department of Justice has responded to the Independent Counsel\u2019s application for referral of related matters, urging that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 592(b)(1) precludes the Division from granting the request of Independent Counsel. (\u201cDepartment of Justice Response\u201d). The Independent Counsel has in turn replied to the objections of the Department of Justice. (\u201cIndependent Counsel Reply\u201d). We agree generally with the Department of Justice that the applicable statute requires us to deny the Application because the Attorney General has twice denied such request.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">The House of Representatives in the 97th Congress conducted two separate investigations <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> into the administration by the Environmental Protection Agency of the Hazardous Substance Response Fund (\u201cSuperfund\u201d). In the course of those investigations the Committees requested and subpoenaed a number of documents. Acting on advice from the Department of Justice, the EPA promptly acceded to some of these requests, but the EPA initially opposed other requests, asserting claims of executive privilege and that the documents were \u201cenforcement sensitive\u201d or \u201cdeliberative.\u201d However, it was eventually agreed that the Committees would have access to the requested documents except \u201cenforcement sensitive\u201d documents, the release of which it was felt could hamper law enforcement efforts. It was also agreed that the Department would not shield documents containing evidence of criminal or unethical conduct by agency officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">In the next Congress, the House Judiciary Committee decided to investigate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>conduct, during the prior investigation, of certain individuals in the Justice Department. As a consequence, the Committee initiated an investigation and compiled a report in excess of 3,000 pages, entitled <em>Report on the Investigation of the Role of the Department of Justice in the Withholding of Environmental Protection Agency Investigative Documents from Congress 1982-83.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Upon completion of this follow-up investigation, the House Judiciary Committee directed its Chairman to transmit the Committee Report to the Attorney General. In his December 12, 1985, letter transmitting the Report, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee requested the Attorney General to conduct an independent determination and to consider the Chairman\u2019s letter as \u201can official request of the Committee on the Judiciary that you apply for the appointment of an independent counsel under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591, <em>et seq.\u201d </em>The letter from the Committee also stated that among other possible issues raised by the report, it would appear appropriate that the Executive Branch examine whether, during the Superfund Investigation in the prior Congress, there had been any violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001, 1505, 1621-23, 371, \u201cor any other provision of federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">After studying the Committee Report, the Attorney General determined that it contained sufficient information to warrant \u201cpreliminary investigations,\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 592 as to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">(A)Whether the conduct of former Assistant Attorney General Theodore Olson in giving testimony at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Monopolies and Commercial Law of the House Judiciary Committee on March 10,1983, and later revising that testimony, regarding the completeness of the Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s response to the Judiciary Committee\u2019s request for OLC documents, and regarding his knowledge of EPA\u2019s willingness to turn over certain disputed documents to Congress, violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, \u00a7 1001, or any other provision of federal criminal law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">(B) Whether the conduct of former Deputy Attorney General Edward Schmults, resulting in the undisclosed withholding of documents from the House Judiciary Committee from March, 1983, through April, 1984, violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, \u00a7 1001, \u00a7 1512 or any other provision of federal criminal law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">(C)(1) Whether the conduct of former Assistant Attorney General Carol Din-kins, resulting in the undisclosed withholding of documents from the Judiciary Committee during its investigation, violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, \u00a7 1001, \u00a7 1512, or any other provision of federal criminal law; and (2) whether the conduct of Mrs. Dinkins in preparing and submitting a declaration in the case captioned <em>United States v. United States House of Representatives, </em>Civil No. 82-3583 (D.D.C.), violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503, \u00a7 1621, \u00a7 1623, \u00a7 401, \u00a7 1001, \u00a7 1512, or any other provision of federal criminal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Report of the Attorney General Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 592(c)(1) Regarding Allegations Against Department of Justice Officials in United States House Judiciary Committee Report (\u201cReport of Attorney General\u201d) at 3-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">Following the foregoing determination, the Attorney General directed the Public Integrity Section of the Department to conduct the preliminary investigation into the allegations contained in the Committee Report. Thereafter, the Public Integrity Section, as well as John C. Keeney, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, and William F. Weld, United States Attorney for Massachusetts, designated by the Attorney General to be his Special Assistant in the matter, made recommendations to the Attorney General as to whether any allegations in the Committee Report warranted further investigation by an independent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">After considering all these recommendations, the Attorney General on April 10, 1986, requested the Division to appoint an Independent Counsel to investigate the allegation against Olson set out in section A above, <em>\u201cand any other matter related to that allegation.\" </em>Report of Attorney Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>eral at 11 (emphasis added). The Attorney General also stated in his report to the Division that he had determined, pursuant to \u00a7 592(b)(1), that there were no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation or prosecution was warranted with respect to the allegations against Schmults and Dinkins. <em>Id. </em>at 26 &amp; 47-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Acting upon the Attorney General\u2019s report, the Division for the Purpose of Appointing Independent Counsels on April 23, 1986, filed an order appointing independent counsel and defining his jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In re: Theodore Olson, D.C.Cir., Division No. 86-1. In response to the request of the Attorney General, Independent Counsel was ordered</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">to investigate and pursue the question whether testimony of Mr. Theodore Olson and his revision of such testimony on March 10, 1983, violated either 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or \u00a7 1001,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>or any other provision of federal law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In addition to this authority the Division further</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">ORDERED, ... that the Independent Counsel shall have jurisdiction to investigate <em>any other allegation of evidence or violation of any federal criminal law by Theodore Olson developed during investigations by the Independent Counsel referred to above, and connected with or arising out of that investigar tion and the Independent Counsel shall have jurisdiction to prosecute for any such violation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">The jurisdictional order also noted that the Independent Counsel would have \u201call the powers and authority provided by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, and specifically by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 594.\u201d This section provides an independent counsel with very broad investigative and prosecutorial powers. The Independent Counsel then proceeded to conduct an investigation of Theodore Olson as authorized by her appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">By letter of November 14, 1986 (\u201cIndependent Counsel letter\u201d), the Independent Counsel requested the Attorney General to refer to the Independent Counsel the allegations in the Committee Report against Schmults and Dinkins and the criminal investigation being conducted by the Department of Justice of former General Counsel to the Environmental Protection Agency, Robert M. Perry. This request was made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 594(e)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the claim that under the statute, the allegations were \u201crelated matters\u201d to the investigation of Olson that she was then conducting.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-18\">After reciting the incidents of her investigation of Olson to date, the Independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Counsel concluded in her application to the Attorney General that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzM\">no reasonable, fair, impartial and complete investigation can be conducted without examining the conduct of Mr. Schmults and Ms. Dinkins.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Independent Counsel letter at 3. The Independent Counsel stated that this conclusion was rooted in the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">(1) standing in isolation, as framed by [the Attorney General\u2019s] report, Mr. Olson\u2019s testimony of March 10, 1983, probably does not constitute a prosecutable violation of any federal criminal law, based on my present understanding of the evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">(2) Mr. Olson's testimony cannot properly be viewed in such isolation, because there are at a minimum \u201creasonable grounds to believe that further investigation ... is warranted\u201d <em>with respect to whether Mr. Olson\u2019s testimony was part of a larger, concerted plan, including Mr. Schmults, Ms. Dinkins, or others, to obstruct or impede the Committee\u2019s investigation into the Department\u2019s discharge of its responsibilities in the EPA documents dispute, possibly in violation of federal criminal law;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">(3) wholly apart from any participation by Mr. Olson in a scheme to obstruct or impede the Committee\u2019s investigation, there are at a minimum \u201creasonable grounds to believe that further investigation ... is warranted\u201d with respect to the conduct of Mr. Schmults and Ms. Dinkins, whose active and apparently admitted roles in the withholding of documents from the Committee seem to merit further scrutiny at least as much as Mr. Olson\u2019s testimony at the very threshold of the inquiry; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">(4) my inquiry has turned up new information which justifies referral to me of the allegations as to Mr. Schmults and Ms. Dinkins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">It is, therefore, necessary that I request, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 594(e) and for the reasons set out below, that you refer to me, as matters related to my present jurisdiction over specific aspects of Mr. Olson\u2019s March 10, 1983 testimony, the allegations made against <em>Mr. Schmults and Ms. Dinkins in the Committee Report, as well as the investigation, which is now being conducted by Public Integrity, of possible perjury charges against Robert M. Perry, EPA\u2019s General Counsel during the inter-branch controversy over the Superfund documents. I also request that you refrain from personal consideration of the requests made herein on grounds explained below.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 3-4 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Deputy Attorney General Burns, in a letter dated December 17, 1986 (\u201cBurns letter\u201d), informed the Independent Counsel that the Attorney General had, as authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 594(e), referred to the Independent Counsel the Department\u2019s ongoing investigation of Robert M. Perry (not a person covered by the Independent Counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act). The Attorney General had, however, denied granting the Independent Counsel authority to investigate Schmults or Din-kins. Deputy Attorney General Burns\u2019 letter emphasized that the Attorney General had already determined there were no reasonable grounds warranting further investigation or prosecution of the allegations against Schmults and Dinkins. In addition, the letter stated that although the Independent Counsel claimed that \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence (not available to the Justice Department at the time of its April 10, 1986, report to the Division) warranted further investigation, the Attorney General either had already considered the evidence when he reported to the Division on April 10, 1986, or had considered the Independent Counsel\u2019s request for referral and determined that the evidence would not \u201calter [his] conclusion.\u201d Burns Letter at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">The Independent Counsel thereafter applied to this Division for referral of the allegations against Schmults and Din-kins on the ground that they were \u201crelated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>matters\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 594(e),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the Division had authority to refer them for investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\n<em>The Independent Counsel Provisions of the Ethics in Government Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Before addressing the Independent Counsel\u2019s request, we discuss briefly the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act and their historical background.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\n<em>Historical Background of the Independent Counsel Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">The Ethics in Government Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-521, 92 Stat. 1824, as amended Puh.L. No. 97-409, 96 Stat. 2039 (1982), provides <em>inter alia </em>for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate and prosecute (1) certain designated high-ranking government officials, and (2) other persons if the Attorney General determines that their investigation by the Attorney General or other officer of the Department may result in a personal, financial, or political conflict of interest. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591 <em>et seq. </em>The statute is designed to ensure that violations of federal criminal law by high-ranking government officials (particularly those who are of the same party as the Administration in power) will be fairly and impartially investigated and prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">The need for a special counsel who is to some extent independent of the Justice Department and free of the conflicts of interest that exist when an Administration investigates the alleged wrongdoing of its own high officials has been demonstrated several times this century.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">(1) <em>Teapot Dome Scandal</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_n\">During the Teapot Dome scandal of the Harding Administration, Congress found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>normal federal prosecution authority to be flawed<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and deemed it necessary after investigating the leases of certain naval oil reserves to pass a special act appropriating money:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">to be expended by the President for the purpose of employing the necessary attorneys and agents ... in instituting and carrying on any suits or other proceedings, either civil or criminal, which he may cause to be instituted or which may be instituted, or to take any other steps deemed necessary to be taken in relation to the cancellation of any leases on oil lands in former naval reserves, <em>in the prosecution of any person or persons guilty of any infraction of the laws of the United States in connection with said leases </em>or in any other measures which he may take to protect the interests of the United States and the people thereof in connection therewith. <em>Any counsel employed by the President under the authority of this resolution shall be appointed by, and with the advice and consent of the Senate and shall have full power and authority to carry on said proceedings, any law to the contrary notwithstanding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">H.J.Res. 160, 43 Stat. 16 (1924) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Pursuant to this statutory authority, former Senator Atlee Pomerene of Ohio was appointed by President Coolidge and on February 16,1924, confirmed by the Senate as \u201cSpecial Counsel to have charge and control of the prosecution ...\u201d 68 Cong. Rec. 2566 (1924). Mr. Owen J. Roberts, a private attorney from Philadelphia and later an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, was subsequently appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to assist Senator Pomerene in the prosecution of the \u201coil cases.\" These lawyers then conducted the \u201coil cases\u201d including the criminal prosecution of the former Secretary of the Interior, Albert B. Fall. <em>See United States v. Fall, </em>10 F.2d 648 (D.C.Cir.1925). Secretary Fall was convicted of bribery and, being a sick man, was sen-fenced to one year in prison and fined $100,000. <em>See Fall v. United States, </em>49 F.2d 506 (D.C.Cir.1931). Henry F. Sinclair and Edward L. Doheny were acquitted of bribery in obtaining their oil leases, but Sinclair was sentenced to nine months in prison and a $1,000 fine for contempt of court. The oil leases were cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">(2) <em>Corruption in the Truman Administration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">During the last years of the Truman Administration, Senator John J. Williams of Delaware on numerous occasions on the Senate floor exposed widespread corruption throughout the nation in the handling of tax evasion cases. In 1951, more than one hundred and fifty Bureau of Internal Revenue officials from all over the country were discharged or forced to resign. The Assistant Attorney General of the Tax Division of the Department of Justice, T. Lamar Caudle, was forced to resign, N.Y. Times, Nov. 20, 1951, but was not prosecuted during the Truman Administration. Daniel A. Bolich, the Assistant Commissioner of Internal Revenue, also resigned. <em>Id. </em>No area of the nation seemed to be immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Acting under this public pressure, Attorney General J. Howard McGrath on February 1, 1952, appointed former President of the New York City Council Newbold Morris, a highly respected associate of former New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, to lead an investigation into the alleged corruption throughout the federal government. Morris was designated <em>Special Assistant to the Attorney General. </em>At the time of Mr. Morris\u2019 appointment, Senator Taft complained that the investigation should be taken out of Department of Justice jurisdiction: \u201cThe President should ask Congress for a law to set up an independent agency to conduct the investigation.\u201d N.Y. Times, Feb. 3, 1952. Mr. Morris, replying to Senator Taft\u2019s suggestion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6j\">I\u2019m not under the Department of Justice. I\u2019m completely independent. There are no strings attached. It is entirely nonpolitical. I\u2019m designated as a special assist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ant attorney general, but I\u2019m even going to investigate the Department of Justice itself. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Senator Taft\u2019s reservations were subsequently borne out by the firing of Mr. Morris on April 3,1952, by Attorney General J. Howard McGrath shortly after Special Assistant Attorney General Morris, as one of the first acts of his investigation, sent McGrath a questionnaire on his personal finances and <em>requested access to McGrath\u2019s Attorney General files, </em>telephone records, engagement book, diary, and other documents. President Truman immediately fired Attorney General McGrath. N.Y. Times, Apr. 4,1952.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Morris told the Senate Subcommittee on April 10th that his investigation stalled when \u201cit moved into the Attorney General\u2019s office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>During the remainder of the Truman Administration, no special counsel was appointed to succeed Morris to continue the investigation of government corruption. However, during the Eisenhower Administration, the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice under Assistant Attorney General Warren Olney prosecuted and obtained key bribery convictions of T. Lamar Caudle, the former Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Tax Division, and Matthew J. Connelly, Truman\u2019s Appointments Secretary. Both convictions were affirmed on appeal. <em>Connelly and Caudle v. United States, </em>249 F.2d 576 (8th Cir.1957), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>356 U.S. 921, 78 S.Ct. 700, 2 L.Ed.2d 716 (1958). Also, John D. Nunan, Jr., former Commissioner of Internal Revenue, was indicted and convicted of tax evasion of $91,086.00 on June 29, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">(3) <em>Watergate Scandal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">During the Watergate scandal of the Nixon Administration, Attorney General Richard Kleindienst determined, shortly after taking office in 1973, that there was the appearance of conflicts of interest requiring his resignation. His voluntary resignation letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">persons with whom I have had close personal and professional associations could be involved in conduct violative of the laws of the United States. Fair and impartial enforcement of the law requires that a person who has not had such intimate relationships be the Attorney General of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">9 Weekly Comp.Pres.Doc. 431-32 (May 5, 1973). The Honorable Elliot Richardson was appointed Attorney General and a special prosecutor\u2019s office was established on May 25, 1973.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Professor Archibald Cox was then appointed by President Nixon as special prosecutor to lead the Watergate investigations. When Cox threatened to secure a judicial ruling that President Nixon was violating the order of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to deliver certain presidential tapes to Chief Judge Sirica of the United States District Court, the President ordered him fired. The Attorney General refused to execute the President\u2019s order and resigned. Immediately thereafter the Deputy Attorney General was fired for the same reason. Cox was then discharged as special prosecutor by the Solicitor General, in his capacity as Acting Attorney General. The President also abolished the special prosecutor\u2019s office; the Watergate investigations were transferred back to the Department of Justice. A few days later President Nixon reversed his decision to abolish the special prosecutor\u2019s office and announced that a new special prosecutor would be named. Acting Attorney General Bork, by formal order, established \u201cThe Office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force.\u201d 38 Fed.Reg. 30738, 32805 (1973). Shortly thereafter, Leon Jaworski, a private attorney from Houston, Texas, was appointed by Acting Attorney General Bork to be the new Watergate Special Prosecutor. Jaworski continued to act in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>that capacity until a number of convictions were obtained and most of the principal cases were disposed of. The vacancy in the office of Attorney General was not filled until Congress passed a special act to authorize the appointment of Senator William B. Saxbe. Pub.L. No. 93-178, 87 Stat. 697 (1973). The special act was necessary in light of his prior vote to increase the salary of the office which would otherwise have disqualified him under art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 2 of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Thus, fifty years of the nation\u2019s history involving the Teapot Dome, Truman Administration, and Watergate scandals, has demonstrated a generally recognized inability of the Department of Justice and the Attorney General to function impartially with full public confidence in investigating criminal wrongdoing of high-ranking government officials of the same political party. In each of these events, extraordinary steps were deemed necessary to ensure fair investigation and in each instance, special prosecutors were appointed. The examples of the firings of special prosecutors Morris (1952) and Cox (1973), and the fact that Congress found it necessary to pass a special act requiring the appointment of special counsel outside government in the Teapot Dome cases (1924), and the act for Senator Saxbe in 1973, made it obvious to Congress that if special prosecution counsel were <em>necessary </em>in the future, such counsel would have to enjoy some measure of independence from the Executive Branch. Accordingly, Congress in 1978, acting to regularize the manner of handling such major conflict of interest problems, enacted the Special Prosecutor provisions of the Ethics in Government Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">(4) <em>Application of the Independent Counsel Provisions: The Iran Weapons Sale and the Alleged Diversion of Funds</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The best evidence that the independent counsel provisions are \u201cnecessary\u201d and reasonable lies in their application to the current investigation into the sale of weapons to Iran and the alleged diversion of the funds to the Contra rebels.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">In late 1986 there was considerable political discussion about American hostages held in the Middle East and in the provision of materiel and financial aid to the insurgents in Nicaragua. A number of letters were sent from congressional committees to the Attorney General but none generated any request for the appointment of an Independent Counsel. Then suddenly out of the blue, a Middle East newspaper reported that the United States had been involved in the sale of arms to Iran. This report led Attorney General Edwin Meese III to an immediate investigation. A few days later he called a very significant press conference in which he stated there was a strong possibility that some of the proceeds from the Iran arms sale <em>had been diverted to the Contras. </em>The announcement shocked the nation. Then in an act which has had no parallel in the history of the Special Prosecutor (Independent Counsel) statute, the Attorney General <em>voluntarily </em>requested (and President Reagan publicly supported his request) that this Division appoint an Independent Counsel with <em>the broadest investigatory powers ever requested under the Act. </em>The violation of <em>every </em>federal criminal law was to be investigated. Only one person, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver L. North, U.S. Marine Corps, was designated as a subject of the investigation, and this, not because he was a high government official but because with respect to him the Attorney General had a \u201cpersonal, financial, or political <em>conflict of interest.\" </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591(c) (emphasis added).

It is as fully consistent with the separation of powers doctrine of the Constitution to which we briefly allude as it is a commonplace that the Constitution does not \u201ccontemplate[ ] total separation of each of the three essential branches of Government.\u201d <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 121, 96 S.Ct. 612, 683, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976). <em>See Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v.

II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. It is noteworthy that this clear grant of authority to Congress to establish other officers \u201cby law\u201d and to provide \u201cby law\u201d for their appointment by \u201ccourts of law\u201d is found in Article II \u2014 that part of the Constitution devoted to the Executive Department. The responsibility imposed upon Congress by Article II empowers it to enact laws to guard. against <em>the evils of massive conflicts of interest involved in the enforcement of federal criminal law against the highest officials of government </em>and to vest in the courts the appointment of inferior officers to carry out this responsibility. Such counsel serve in the Executive Department and are constitutionally entitled to the independence that the statute provides. <em>Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 602, 55 S.Ct. 869, 79 L.Ed. 1611 (1935); <em>Wiener v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 349, 78 S.Ct. 1275, 2 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1958). Since 1863 the courts have been authorized by statute to fill temporary vacancies in the office of United States Attorneys (formerly District Attorneys).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The appointment by the Division of an independent counsel is tantamount to a court filling a vacancy created by adverse interest. For example, in <em>United States v. Morris, </em>23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 246, 6 L.Ed. 314 (1825), Daniel Webster argued in a condemnation case brought by court-appointed counsel in the name of the United States when the U.S. District Attorney refused to act: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>discretionary power exercised by the court below, in this instance [appointing counsel], was essential to the administration of justice, whenever the district-attorney refuses to act, <em>or is interested, </em>or in case of his death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274. The court decided the case without commenting on the propriety of the appointment, but one judge expressed \u201csurprise.\u201d <em>Id., </em>300.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Our history, as above outlined, has thus demonstrated that it is <em>\u201cnecessary </em>\u201d when high government officials are being investigated for criminal wrongdoing by officials of their own party, and that is the usual situation, that the Congress to the extent it thinks <em>\u201cproper </em>\u201d \u201cmay by Law vest the Appointment of ... inferior Officers ... in the Courts of Law.\u201d In dealing with this problem a page of history is worth a ton of theory. The independent counsel provisions are tailor-made to meet all the requirements envisioned by the Constitution. And the Independent Counsel is clearly an \u201cinferior officer\u201d \u2014 he is appointed for a single task to serve for a temporary limited period.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">If there were any doubt about the validity of Congress acting as it has to deal with the conflict of interest problems, which are at the heart of the independent counsel provisions, it is answered by the power set forth in the \u201cNecessary and Proper\u201d clause. This provision of the Constitution provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\"><em>The Congress shall have Power </em>* * * To make all Laws which shall be <em>necessary and proper </em>for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 18 (emphasis added). The constitutional authority of Congress to vest appointment of inferior officers in the courts of law, conjoined with its power to enact laws that are \u201cnecessary and proper,\u201d \u201cgives Congress a share in the responsibilities lodged in other departments.\u201d E. Corwin, <em>The Constitution of the United States </em>\u2014 Analysis <em>and Interpretation </em>358 (U.S. Govt. Printing Office 1972). Thus, with the constitutional authority to establish offices to be filled by inferior officers in the Executive Department and to vest the appointment of inferi- or officers in \u201cCourts of Law,\u201d the Congress is authorized to enact the laws necessary to carry into execution such powers. As Chief Justice Marshall cogently remarked in <em>McCulloch v. Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. (17 U.S.) 316, 420, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-11\">Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are .plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-12\"><em>Id. </em>The Independent Counsel statute meets all these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">(2) <em>The Exercise of Power by the Attorney General in the Independent Counsel Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">The minimal powers conferred on Independent Counsel do not by any means constitute an assumption of the constitutional field of action of the Executive Branch in enforcing the criminal law. The highly limited duties of the Independent Counsel are \u201cfixed according to sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental [problem].\u201d See <em>Hampton &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>276 U.S. 394, 405-406, 48 S.Ct. 348, 350-351, 72 L.Ed. 624 (1928). The provision of the Constitution providing that: \u201c[The President] ... shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d U.S. Const, art. II, \u00a7 3, does not require the President (or his delegate) to <em>\u201cexecute the laws.\u201d </em>The President\u2019s responsibility may be satisfied by Congress entrusting the power of execution to some other officer while the President\u2019s obligation would be satisfied by the right of the President (or his delegate) to remove the individual officer for impropriety, which may be done here.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Kendall v.

L. White, <em>The Federalists, </em>406-11 (1948). The Attorney General was thought of as the legal advisor to the President and department heads and as an agent to whom Congress might turn for advice. It was a part-time job and the government was merely one of his clients for which he was paid half the salary of department heads. He was expected to pursue private legal work. <em>Id. </em>at 164. The District Attorneys acted in the Department of State and contacts between the two were largely fortuitous. Apart from cases of exceptional importance and difficulty, the District Attorneys operated largely on their own responsibility as matters developed within their respective districts. On occasion they employed \u201cspecial counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406-411. It was not until the Act of August 2, 1861, c. 37, 12 Stat. 285, that the \u201cgeneral superintendence and direction\u201d of District Attorneys was placed with the Attorney General. This history indicates that the authority and powers of District Attorneys (now United States Attorneys) and the Attorney General are largely governed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>Application of the Statutory Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARJ\">The instant dispute between the Independent Counsel and the Department of Justice concerns only two provisions of the independent counsel statutory scheme. The relevant statutory language provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApE\">\u00a7 592(b)(1) If the Attorney General, upon completion of the preliminary investigation, finds that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation or prosecution is warranted, the Attorney General shall so notify the division of the court specified in section 593(a) of this title, and <em>the division of the court shall have no power to appoint afn] independent counsel. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">* # * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u00a7 594(e) A[n] independent counsel may ask the Attorney General or the division of the court to refer matters related to the independent counsel\u2019s prosecutorial jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">We agree with the Department of Justice that \u201cSection 594(e) cannot be read, as the Independent Counsel suggests, to give the Division the authority to refer allegations to the Independent Counsel when the Attorney General has specifically determined, under \u00a7 592(b)(1) that those allegations should not be pursued.\u201d Department of Justice Response at 5. The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 592(b)(1) and 594(e) must be read together and not in isolation. It would be highly unreasonable to interpret these statutory provisions either as requiring the Attorney General, or as authorizing the division of the court, to refer the investigation of the conduct of two officials to an independent counsel\u2019s investigatory and prosecutorial jurisdiction under \u00a7 594(c) when the Attorney General has <em>twice </em>determined with respect to the conduct of said two individuals, in accordance with his statutory authority under \u00a7 592(b)(1), that there were \u201cno reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation or prosecution is warranted.\u201d That is in effect what the court would accomplish if the order appointing independent counsel to investigate Olson were amended by the court, in effect, to appoint the same counsel to investigate Schmults and Dinkins as separate subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">To suggest that the division of the court can bring about this result acting alone, upon the sole request of the independent counsel, would undercut the plain intent of \u00a7 592(b)(1) and permit the accomplishment by indirect means of a result that the statute prohibits being accomplished by direct means. Section 594(e) cannot be read to achieve such an unreasonable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">The Independent Counsel, while urging \u201cthat the allegations against Schmults and Dinkins, standing alone, warrant further investigation,\u201d Independent Counsel Application at 34, also maintains that \u201cthe known facts raise a reasonable suspicion that Olson, Schmults, and Dinkins may have acted together to frustrate the Committee\u2019s inquiry.\u201d Independent Counsel Reply at 11. <em>See also </em>Independent Counsel Application at 34 (noting \u201cpossibility that the actions of Schmults, Dinkins, and Olson were taken pursuant to a concert of action involving some or all of them and designed to obstruct the Committee\u2019s inquiry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Our current Order appointing the Independent Counsel authorizes her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1W\">to investigate and pursue the question whether testimony of Mr. Theodore Olson and his revision of testimony on March 10, 1983 violated either 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505 or \u00a7 1001, <em>or any other provision of federal law. </em>[The Order also further grants] jurisdiction to investigate any other <em>allegation or evidence of violation of any Federal criminal law </em>by Theodore Olson developed during investigations, by the Independent Counsel, referred to above, and connected with or arising out of that investigation and the Independent Counsel shall have jurisdiction to prosecute for any such violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF\">Order of April 23, 1986 at 1-2 (emphasis added). Implicit in this jurisdictional grant to investigate possible connected violations of federal criminal law is the authority to investigate allegations and evidence that Theodore Olson was engaged in an unlawful conspiracy with others or that he aided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>and abetted any criminal offense connected to the investigation ordered. To the extent that the Independent Counsel wishes to investigate \u201cwhether Mr. Olson\u2019s testimony was part of a larger, concerted plan, including Mr. Schmults, Ms. Dinkins, <em>or others, </em>to obstruct or impede the Committee\u2019s investigation into the Department\u2019s discharge of its responsibility in the EPA documents dispute, possibly in violation of federal law,\u201d Independent Counsel letter at 3, the current order confers that power upon the Independent Counsel. The Attorney General\u2019s decision not to request appointment of an independent counsel with respect to Schmults and Dinkins, or to refer certain allegations against them to the Independent Counsel investigating Olson, simply cannot impinge upon the Independent Counsel\u2019s current jurisdiction, as stated in our April 23, 1986, Order, to investigate \u201cany other allegation or evidence of violation of any Federal criminal law by ... Olson and connected with or arising out of that investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">It should be pointed out, however, that while the Independent Counsel\u2019s authority to investigate the possibility that Olson was engaged in criminal conspiracy, or aided or abetted any criminal offense, <em>a fortiori </em>encompasses the authority to investigate the actions of others involved in the possible unlawful concert of action, the current order grants the Independent Counsel jurisdiction to <em>prosecute </em>only Olson. If further investigation by the Independent Counsel turns up credible evidence of federal criminal violations by others, the Department of Justice has expressed its willingness to consider such new evidence. Burns Letter at 3. (\u201cIf you have any additional information that bears on this matter please do not hesitate to bring it to our attention. In that event, the Attorney General will, of course, consider your request in the light of any additional information available.\u201d) <em>See also </em>Report of Attorney General at 11 (noting that \u201cindependent counsel may wish to confer with the Department concerning related matters\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Thus, the Independent Counsel has jurisdiction under our current jurisdictional order to investigate whether Olson conspired with or aided or abetted <em>any person </em>(including but not limited to Schmults or Din-kins), to frustrate the inquiry of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, in violation of federal criminal law. Also, the investigation of EPA\u2019s Perry has been transferred by the Attorney General as a related matter from the Public Integrity Section to Independent Counsel at her request. Due to the Attorney General\u2019s prior decisions closing investigation of the distinct allegations against Schmults and Din-kins, and the preclusive effect of \u00a7 592(b)(1), the Independent Counsel has continuing jurisdiction to investigate the actions of Schmults and Dinkins only insofar as they were part of a concert of action <em>with Olson, </em>in violation of federal criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\n<em>Miscellaneous</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The Independent Counsel has requested the Division to publicly release the pleadings with respect to her request for jurisdiction over the alleged \u201crelated matters\u201d discussed above and the Attorney General has agreed to such request. Schmults and Dinkins have submitted motions to intervene and have been allowed to file <em>amicus curiae </em>briefs in support of their request to withhold disclosure of the Independent Counsel\u2019s application, the response of the Department, and the reply of the Independent Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Courts have consistently held that a person challenging the authority or propriety of a criminal investigation can do so only after an indictment (if any) is returned by the grand jury. <em>See, e.g., Matter of Doe, </em>546 F.2d 498 (2d Cir.1976); <em>Jett v. Castaneda, </em>578 F.2d 842 (9th Cir.1978). The court therefore denies the motions to intervene and the requests to withhold disclosure, and in the best interests of justice grants leave of court to publicly release the application of the Independent Counsel, the briefs of the parties on the application, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the court\u2019s foregoing opinion in this cause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\n<em>Order Accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Upon consideration of the request of counsel for Edward C.

Ms. Alexia Morrison was appointed to succeed Mr. McKay on May 29, 1986, without alteration of the Division\u2019s original jurisdictional order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-10\">.

In addition to arguing that the Attorney General\u2019s determination pursuant to \u00a7 592(b) does not limit the Division\u2019s authority under \u00a7 594(e) to refer to the Independent Counsel the allegations against Schmults and Dinkins, the Independent Counsel charges that the Attorney General\u2019s determination under 592(b) was tainted because he \u201capplied an erroneous standard in concluding that no further scrutiny by an independent counsel of the allegations against Schmults and Dinkins was warranted\u201d and \"made his determination under the disability of at least an apparent \u2014 if not actual \u2014 conflict of interest which should have led to his recusal.\" Independent Counsel Application at 20. The most specific fact relied upon to support the Independent Counsel\u2019s charge is that Meese, when Counselor to the President, had expressed opposition to a Presidential pardon for former EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford. <em>Id. </em>at 37-38. This action, however, does not demonstrate any conflict of interest that would disqualify the Attorney General from evaluating the Schmults and Dinkins matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">The Independent Counsel also urges that the Attorney General should have automatically forwarded to the Division the allegations contained in the House Committee Report, because the Attorney General did not comply with the ninety-day limitation imposed by \u00a7 592(c)(1). Independent Counsel Application at 3 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">Section 592(c)(1) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZU\">if ninety days elapse from the receipt of the information without a determination by the Attorney General that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation or prosecution is warranted, then the Attorney General shall apply to the division of the court for the appointment of a[n] independent counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">The Department received the extensive Committee Report on December 12, 1985. Based on the results of the review of the Report conducted by Department attorneys, the Attorney General determined on January 10, 1986, that a preliminary investigation was warranted as to the allegations against Olson, Schmults, and Dinkins. This action was expeditious. The Attorney General\u2019s Report to the Division was filed on April 10, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-19\">Section 592(a)(1) compels the conclusion that the Attorney General\u2019s Report was timely filed. Section 592(a)(1) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-20\">Upon receiving information that the Attorney General determines is sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate that any person covered by the Act has engaged in conduct described in subsection (a) or (c) of section 591 of this title, the Attorney General shall conduct, for a period not to exceed ninety days, such preliminary investigation of the matter as the Attorney General deems appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGD\">We agree with the Department that \"some period of time is often required to ... determin[e] whether the information is sufficient to trigger even a preliminary investigation [and thus] the Department must be afforded a reasonable period of time to make that determination before the 90-day period for the preliminary investigation begins to run.\u201d Department Response at 27 n. 14. In our opinion, thirty days is not an unreasonable period of time to properly evaluate a 3,000 page investigatory report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\">.
