Mercer, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>his action seeking monetary damages, attorney\u2019s fees and declaratory and injunctive relief for the allegedly discriminatory actions of the defendants, employees of the department of correction (department).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that his claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq., and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was barred by General Statutes \u00a7 4-165, which provides for statutory immunity, because the complaint had not alleged facts sufficient to support a claim that the defendant state employees had acted wantonly, recklessly or maliciously. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants by way of a four count complaint, in which he alleged that the defendants violated Title II of the ADA, \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 20, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by articles five and twenty-one of the amendments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint indicated that each of the defendants was being sued in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>his or her official capacity. All of the plaintiffs claims stem from his belief that the defendants discriminated against him on the basis of his physical disability by refusing his request for placement in a single cell in the back of one of the housing facilities at the correctional institution in which he is housed. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, stating that the plaintiffs claims were barred by the doctrines of sovereign immunity and statutory immunity. In a memorandum of decision dated March 28, 2005, the court dismissed the action, concluding that sovereign immunity was not an effective bar to the plaintiffs ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, but that the plaintiffs state claims were barred by \u00a7 4-165 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Thereafter, the court rendered judgment of dismissal as to the entirety of the plaintiffs claims, and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The trial court\u2019s judgment was rendered and the parties\u2019 briefs to this court were filed prior to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>546 U.S. 151, 126 S. Ct. 877, 163 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2006), in which the court explained the extent to which claims made pursuant to Title II of the ADA are not barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. At oral argument before this court, both parties requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the case be remanded to the trial court for reconsideration in light of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>supra, 151.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although we agree with the parties that remand for this purpose is appropriate, we first must consider the propriety of the court\u2019s judgment dismissing the action on statutory immunity grounds because if the plaintiff s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims are barred by statutory immunity, then any consideration of sovereign immunity is academic at best.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Prior to discussing the role of statutory immunity in this action, it is necessary to understand in what capacity the named defendants were sued. Throughout the course of this litigation, it has been understood that the plaintiff sued the defendants in their official capacities, and the complaint, in fact, alleges as much. Although a statement by the plaintiff that he has sued the defendants in their official capacities is not dispositive of the issue and is a question of law over which our review is plenary; see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>265 Conn. 301, 308, 828 A.2d 549 (2003); the nature of the pleadings and relief sought by this plaintiff clearly indicate that the suit is against the defendants in their official capacities. See id. \u201c[A] suit against a state officer concerning a matter in which the officer represents the state is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>in effect, against the state.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 313. This is because a state can act only through its officers and agents. Id. In suits, therefore, in which the officials or agents are being sued for actions that concern matters in which they represent the state, we consider such suits as if they were solely against the state. See <em>Fetterman </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>192 Conn. 539, 550-51, 473 A.2d 1176 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Having determined the capacity in which the named defendants have been sued, we now consider the propriety of the court\u2019s decision dismissing the plaintiffs claims on the ground of statutory immunity. \u201cClaims involving the doctrines of common-law sovereign immunity and statutory immunity, pursuant to \u00a7 4-165, implicate the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>94 Conn. App. 103, 113-14, 891 A.2d 106 (2006). A determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law over which our review is plenary. Id., 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">It is well settled that the defense of sovereign immunity can be raised for claims brought directly against the state or against state employees acting in their official capacities. Likewise, the defense of statutory immunity can be raised for claims brought against state employees acting in their individual capacities. Id.; see also <em>Tuchman </em>v. <em>State, </em>89 Conn. App. 745, 878 A.2d 384, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 920, 883 A.2d 1252 (2005). Because an action against state employees in their official capacities is, in effect, an action against the state; see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 313; the only immunity that can apply is the immunity claimed by the state itself\u2014 sovereign immunity. The United States Supreme Court explained this concept well in <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Graham,, </em>473 U.S. 159, 105 S. Ct. 3099, 87 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985), in which it stated: \u201cIn an official-capacity action, [individual capacity] defenses are unavailable. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>only immunities that can be claimed in an official-capacity action are forms of sovereign immunity that the entity, qua entity, may possess, such as the Eleventh Amendment. While not exhaustive, this list illustrates the basic distinction between personal- and official-capacity actions.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 167; see also <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Capitol Region Mental Health Center, </em>74 Conn. App. 264, 268, 812 A.2d 95 (2002) (\u201c[b]y its own terms, \u00a7 4-165 applies only to state officers and employees sued in their personal capacities, and is therefore inapplicable to [whether state officers or employees sued in their official capacities are] immune from suit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">We have concluded that the plaintiff brought this action against the named defendants solely in their official capacities. Because suing these state employees in their official capacities is tantamount to bringing the action against the state, the only immunity defense available to these defendants is sovereign immunity. The court, therefore, improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground of statutory immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Because the court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity, the plaintiff does not address the applicability of the defense of sovereign immunity to his claim under the Rehabilitation Act. The defendants also did not brief this question and instead stated: \u201cOn appeal, [the] plaintiff assumes that the trial court dismissed his claims under the Rehabilitation Act. The defendants do not read the trial court\u2019s decision as such, and [do] not address the Rehabilitation Act claim in this memorandum.\u201d Although we agree with the defendants that the court\u2019s decision does not dispose of the plaintiffs claim under the Rehabilitation Act in a clear and articulate manner, it nonetheless is trae that the plaintiffs complaint was dismissed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>its entirety, including the claim made pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act. We therefore disagree with the defendants that the court did not dismiss the plaintiffs claim under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We consider whether the defense of sovereign immunity is applicable to claims raised under the Rehabilitation Act because the question implicates the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>supra, 94 Conn. App. 113-14. As with determinations made by the trial court regarding the applicability of statutory immunity, our review of the court\u2019s conclusions regarding sovereign immunity is plenary. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">It is well settled law in this jurisdiction that Congress intended states\u2019 acceptance of federal funds to constitute waiver of their sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment as to claims under the Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Lane </em>v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 198-200, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed. 2d 486 (1996); <em>Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Sciences Center, </em>280 F.3d 98, 113-15 (2d Cir. 2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>This waiver applies both to claims seeking injunctive relief; <em>Henrietta D. </em>v. <em>Bloomberg, </em>331 F.3d 261, 288-89 (2d Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 936, 124 S. Ct. 1658, 158 L. Ed. 2d 356 (2004); and to claims seeking monetary damages. <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>S.U.N.Y. Health Sciences Center, </em>supra, 115;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>My slow </em>v. <em>New Milford School District, </em>2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9868 *27-28 (D. Conn. 2006); <em>Sacca </em>v. <em>Buffalo State College, </em>2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9134 *11-18 (W.D.N.Y. 2004); <em>Johnson v. Southern Connecticut State University, </em>2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21084 *9 (D. Conn. 2004); <em>Doe v. Goord, </em>2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24808 *57-60 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). The plaintiff has alleged in his complaint that the department receives federal funding, which would subject the department to the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act. See <em>Powell </em>v. <em>National Board of Medical Examiners, </em>364 F.3d 79, 85 (2d Cir. 2004). We therefore conclude that the plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to defeat the defense of sovereign immunity as to his claim under the Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Having concluded that proper disposition of this appeal includes a remand to the trial court for consideration of the plaintiffs claim under the Rehabilitation Act, we must determine whether the court on remand also must address the plaintiffs claim under the ADA. As indicated previously, the legal landscape in this area has changed significantly since the trial court\u2019s initial consideration of the plaintiffs claim because of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>supra, 546 U.S. 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">There is no question that Congress, in enacting the ADA, intended to abrogate the states\u2019 sovereign immunity from liability and suit under the eleventh amendment. Codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12202, the relevant provision of the ADA provides: \u201cA State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter. In any action against a State for a violation of the requirements of this chapter, remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) are available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in an action against any public or private entity other than a State.\u201d In abrogating the states\u2019 immunity in this manner, Congress sought \u201cto invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment ... in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 (b) (4). Until recently, however, the question has remained whether and to what extent the abrogation of sovereign immunity was valid congressional action.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>supra, 546 U.S. 151, answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>this question in part. The court held that when a claim under the ADA is made for conduct that violates the fourteenth amendment, either by violation of one of the stated provisions of that amendment or by violation of one of the amendments that has been incorporated into the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process, Title II of the ADA validly abrogates states\u2019 sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 158-59. Therefore, on remand, the court must consider whether any of the actions of which the plaintiff complains constitutes a constitutional violation. If the court concludes that the complaint alleges constitutional violations, the court then must consider whether these violations also are covered under the ambit of Title II of the ADA. To the extent that the alleged conduct both constitutes a constitutional violation and is forbidden under the ADA, the defense of sovereign immunity does not apply to bar the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">It is unclear however, even after <em>United States </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>supra, 546 U.S. 151, whether Congress\u2019 abrogation of states\u2019 sovereign immunity under the ADA is valid as it applies to conduct that does not violate the fourteenth amendment. The Supreme Court remanded this question to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for consideration in the first instance. Id., 159. We likewise remand this issue to the trial court insofar as the plaintiffs complaint may implicate it. To that end, the court, on remand, should consider (1) which aspects of the defendants\u2019 alleged conduct violated the ADA; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated the ADA but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress\u2019 purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid. See id. In considering any portion of the plaintiffs claim that alleges conduct that comes within the scope of the ADA, but does not violate any constitutional guarantee so that it falls within the prophylactic aspects of the ADA,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the court must consider whether that aspect of the legislation exhibits \u201ca congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means to be adopted to that end.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tennessee </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>541 U.S. 509, 520, 124 S. Ct. 1978, 158 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2004). If the portion of the legislation triggered by the plaintiffs claim is congruent and proportional to the injury to be prevented, then the abrogation of the defendants\u2019 sovereign immunity is valid as to that claim, and further litigation of the plaintiffs claim may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\"> The plaintiff named the following individuals as defendants: (1) David Strange, warden of the Osbom Correctional Institution (Osbom); (2) Dan Bannish, the health services program director and ADA administrator for the department of correction; (3) Sheila Hughes, a nursing supervisor and ADA facility coordinator at Osborn; (4) Patricia Wollenhaupt, a nursing supervisor and medical grievance coordinator at Osborn; (5) John Gitzus, the infectious disease specialist at Osbom; (6) Michele Cabana, the infectious disease nurse at Osbom; (7) Richard Stratton, the unit manager of the J1 housing unit at Osbom, which is a medical dormitory; and (8) Dennis Morgan, the grievance coordinator at Osbom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\"> \u201cSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA are applicable to inmates in state prisons.\u201d <em>Divine Allah </em>v. <em>Goord, </em>405 F. Sup. 2d 265, 274 (S.D.N.Y. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\"> On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the court\u2019s judgment only as to his claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Because the plaintiff no longer pursues his claims under the federal and state constitutions, we do not consider whether the court had subject matter jurisdiction over the litigation of those claims. We therefore decline the defendants\u2019 invitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>to discuss those claims, even though they otherwise might bear on the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, because the claims have been abandoned, and any discussion thereon would be purely academic. See <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>81 Conn. App. 163, 164 n.1, 838 A.2d 1023, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 905, 845 A.2d 407 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\"> The court\u2019s memorandum of decision does not address the plaintiffs federal constitutional claim in any way. Additionally, the court\u2019s memorandum of decision states that the \u201cstate law claims\u201d are barred by the doctrine of statutory immunity. Nonetheless, the court dismissed the action in its entirety after stating \u201cstatutory immunity applies, and the motion to dismiss is granted on that ground.\u201d We therefore read the court\u2019s decision as having granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all counts of the plaintiffs complaint on the ground of statutory immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\"> The defendants did not address either in their brief or at oral argument before this court whether, on remand, the trial court should consider the plaintiffs claims under the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiff, on the other hand, requested a remand for his claims to be considered under both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. We note that the release of the slip opinion in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>supra, 546 U.S. 151, so close in time to oral argument in this case likely affected the parties\u2019 focus at oral argument. As indicated in this opinion, how'ever, a remand for purposes of considering the plaintiffs claims under <em>both </em>the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> \u201c[W]e have consistently held that we do not render advisory opinions. . . .

After <em>Garcia, </em>Connecticut could not rely on abrogation under Title II, and therefore knowingly and intentionally waived its sovereign immunity under the Rehabilitation Act when accepting federal funds.
