J.</author>\n<p id=\"At5\">The defendant, Seth Mitchell, appeals from the judgment of the trial court awarding $56,937 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>in damages to the plaintiff, Chad Shepherd, plus $5830.45 in costs taxed to the defendant. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) permitted a former insurance adjuster, David Bussolotta, to testify, (2) denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the basis of unsupported findings and (3) taxed costs against the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reject all of the defendant\u2019s claims and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">We set forth some of the pertinent procedural and factual history. The jury reasonably could have found that the plaintiffs pickup truck was struck from behind by the defendant\u2019s automobile while the plaintiff was stopped at a traffic light and that, as a result of the collision, the plaintiff suffered personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In his complaint dated June 10, 2003, the plaintiff pleaded in paragraph five that the defendant \u201csuddenly and without warning struck the vehicle operated by the [p]laintiff in the rear with great force and violent impact,\u201d causing the plaintiff personal injuries. In his original answer, the defendant denied all allegations of negligence and left the plaintiff to his proof concerning all other pertinent allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Although the defendant later amended his answer at the time of trial<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and admitted one of the acts of negligence specified, he continued to deny that the collision occurred with great force and violent impact. In her opening statement, the defendant\u2019s counsel emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>her theoiy of the case, namely, that the collision had been low impact. She told the jury that this was \u201cnot a huge accident\u201d and that it would see a picture of the plaintiffs truck showing very little damage. Prior to trial, however, the plaintiff had conducted written and oral deposition discovery on this very issue. Interrogatory number eleven of the standard interrogatories had sought the name of the appraiser who had appraised or repaired the damage to the automobile owned or operated by the defendant. The defendant had answered that interrogatory: \u201cNot applicable.\u201d In response to another interrogatory, the defendant had answered that there were \u201cno photographs depicting the accident scene and/or depicting any condition of injury alleged to have been caused by the incident alleged in the complaint.\u201d The defendant\u2019s deposition of November 22, 2004, however, disclosed that his automobile indeed had been repaired in Danbury. The plaintiff then subpoenaed photographs, repair bills and estimates concerning these repairs. The defendant\u2019s counsel moved to quash the subpoena, and her motion represented that \u201cthe [defendant and his insurance company are not in possession of any factual documents that have not already been produced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Nevertheless, as jury voir dire drew to a close, the defendant\u2019s counsel, on January 10, 2005, disclosed a damage estimate concerning the defendant\u2019s automobile that had been prepared by David Bussolotta, an adjuster for the defendant\u2019s insurer, the Infinity Insurance Company (Infinity). Bussolotta, however, had terminated his employment with Infinity prior to trial. Nevertheless, the plaintiff called Bussolotta as a witness, and Bussolotta testified that, in fact, he had prepared an estimate concerning damage to the defendant\u2019s automobile and had taken photographs of the damaged automobile. Bussolotta described the damage as \u201cheavy front end damage to the 1997 Toyota <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Corolla, a small unibody structured car.\u201d He went on to observe that \u201cthe damage to the front end was fairly severe where it actually folded the hood like an accordion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and awarded damages in the amount of $56,937, which the court then reduced by $4949 on the basis of collateral source payments. The defendant filed a motion to set aside the verdict, which was denied by the court. The plaintiff later filed a bill of costs and was awarded $5830.45. The defendant filed a motion for review of taxation of costs on March 30, 2005. The court granted review of the costs, but declined to modify them. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The defendant first claims on appeal that the court improperly permitted Bussolotta to testify. Specifically, he argues: (a) \u201cBussolotta\u2019s testimony was irrelevant and highly prejudicial\u201d; (b) \u201cBussolotta was never disclosed as an expert\u201d; and (c) \u201cBussolotta was not credible and should not have been allowed to testify in front of the jury.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Initially, we determine our standard of review. The defendant\u2019s counsel has not clearly set forth the standard of review that she \u201cbelieves should be applied\u201d to this claim as is required by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 67-4 (d) and 67-5 (d). Rather, she maintains in her brief that our standard of review is abuse of discretion, clearly erroneous and plenary. She then argues in her reply brief that the defendant is entitled to plain error review in relation to this claim. The plaintiffs counsel asserts that our standard of review is abuse of discretion. We agree with the plaintiffs counsel. \u201cThe trial court is given broad latitude in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and [an appellate court] will not disturb such a ruling unless it is shown that the ruling amounted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>an abuse of discretion. [Additionally] [e]ven when a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is deemed to be improper ... a new trial [will be ordered] only if the ruling was both wrong and harmful. . . . [T]he standard in a civil case for determining whether an improper ruling was harmful is whether the . . . ruling [likely] would [have] affect[ed] the result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Daley </em>v. <em>McClintock, </em>267 Conn. 399, 403, 838 A.2d 972 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The defendant first argues that the court should not have allowed Bussolotta to testify because his testimony was irrelevant and highly prejudicial. We disagree and conclude that Bussolotta\u2019s testimony was relevant to the plaintiffs case and that, although it was highly adverse to the defendant, it was not unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Section 4-1 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides in pertinent part that evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Nevertheless, relevant evidence may be excluded by the court \u201cif its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or surprise, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury . . . .\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-3. All evidence that is adverse to an opposing party, by its very nature, is prejudicial because it is damaging to that party\u2019s position in the case. See <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 806, 614 A.2d 414 (1992). Unfair prejudice exists, however, when the evidence \u201ctends to have some adverse effect upon [the party against whom the evidence is offered] beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ancheff v. Hartford Hospital, </em>260 Conn. 785, 804, 799 A.2d 1067 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>From the outset, the defendant\u2019s counsel portrayed this traffic accident as a minor accident, creating little damage. During opening statements, she specifically argued to the jury that it was \u201cgoing to be hearing testimony . . . [that] show[ed] this was not a huge accident. The plaintiff was driving [a] pickup truck at the time, and he had little damage.\u201d The defendant also introduced into evidence photographs of the plaintiffs truck, which, indeed, showed little damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The plaintiff subpoenaed Bussolotta, who worked as an adjuster for the defendant\u2019s insurer at the time of the accident and had been responsible for processing this claim, to testify as to the condition of the defendant\u2019s automobile after it struck the plaintiffs truck. The defendant argues that the condition of his car was not relevant to the plaintiffs case, and, therefore, Bus-solotta\u2019s testimony was not relevant. We cannot agree with such a contention. Certainly, the condition of the defendant\u2019s automobile, after rear-ending the plaintiffs truck, was relevant to assessing the force of the impact and the possible injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of this impact. After the defendant finally amended his answer at the start of the trial, admitting that he was negligent and that his automobile had struck the plaintiffs truck, the force of the impact remained one of the primary issues in this case. Bussolotta\u2019s testimony certainly was adverse to the defendant\u2019s position, but it was not irrelevant or unduly prejudicial. Although adverse to the defendant\u2019s stated position that the impact was minor, this testimony was relevant to show that the impact of the rear-end collision was substantial enough to have caused the plaintiff serious injuries. The plaintiff offered Bussolotta\u2019s testimony to prove the plaintiffs position that the impact was substantial and not minor. We conclude that this testimony properly was admitted and that the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The defendant next claims that Bussolotta should not have been allowed to testify because the plaintiff never disclosed him as an expert. We conclude that Bussolotta properly was allowed to testify as a fact witness and that he did not offer expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel raises this issue for the first time on appeal. During trial, she objected only to Busso-lotta\u2019s testifying that he took photographs of the defendant\u2019s automobile. She specifically stated that she did not object to his testifying as a fact witness on the issue of the damage estimate he prepared or the extent of damage done to the defendant\u2019s automobile. After the defendant\u2019s counsel offered an objection, the court asked: \u201cYou\u2019re objecting, counsel, to this appraiser as a fact witness to the extent of the damage to the vehicle?\u201d Counsel responded: \u201cNo, Your Honor. If he is going to just be put on the stand to admit the estimate and the extent of damage, I don\u2019t have any problem with that.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel then went on to explain that the basis for her objection related to any testimony that Bussolotta would offer as to photographs because \u201cthere\u2019s been no evidence that these photos exist.\u201d However, Bussolotta, as a fact witness, was prepared to and, in fact, did testify that he, personally, took photographs of the defendant\u2019s automobile, but that they no longer were in his possession. This was evidence being offered to show that photographs had existed. For the defendant\u2019s counsel to argue for the first time on appeal that Bussolotta\u2019s testimony was in the nature of expert testimony, when his testimony related to an estimate that he prepared, damage that he witnessed and photographs that he took, appears disingenuous. This testimony clearly was offered as a matter of fact and not as a matter of expert opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Next, the defendant claims that the court improperly permitted Bussolotta to testify because he was not credible and was biased. The defendant\u2019s counsel failed to raise this claim at trial and raises it for the first time on appeal. Accordingly, we decline to review it. \u201cThe standard for the preservation of a claim of improperly admitted evidence at trial is well settled. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part that [this] court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial .... Our rules of practice make it clear that counsel must object to a ruling of evidence [and] state the grounds upon which objection is made ... to preserve the grounds for appeal. . . . These requirements are not simply formalities. . . . We consistently have stated that we will not consider evidentiary rulings where counsel did not properly preserve a claim of error by objection . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rubel </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>86 Conn. App. 728, 745, 862 A.2d 863, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 919, 871 A.2d 1028 (2005); see also Practice Book \u00a7 5-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial. The defendant specifically claims: \u201cThe trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for [a] mistrial and subsequently making findings that were not supported by the record.\u201d In his brief, however, the defendant discusses only the court\u2019s factual findings and never discusses why he was entitled to a mistrial, nor does he provide any analysis as to how the court abused its discretion in denying his motion. Nevertheless, our review of the record and procedural history of the case leads us to the inevitable conclusion that the court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>not abuse the wide discretion vested in it in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">In relation to this claim, the defendant sets forth several standards of review and does not request that we apply any one of them in particular. The plaintiff fails to set forth any applicable standard of review. \u201cWhile the remedy of a mistrial is permitted under the rules of practice, it is not favored. . . . On appeal, we hesitate to disturb a decision not to declare a mistrial. The trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which his function is to assure a fair and just outcome. . . . The trial court is better positioned than we are to evaluate in the first instance whether a certain occurrence is prejudicial to the defendant and, if so, what remedy is necessary to cure that prejudice. . . . The decision whether to grant a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Label Systems Corp. v.Aghamohammadi, </em>270 Conn. 291, 316-17, 852 A.2d 703 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The record reveals that on January 19, 2005, the defendant moved for a mistrial on the following grounds: (1) \u201cthe plaintiff has, essentially, tried a bad faith claim against Infinity ... in this case, where the only issue is what injuries the plaintiff has proven as a result of [the defendant\u2019s] conduct\u201d; and (2) the purpose of Bussolotta\u2019s testimony \u201cwas to imply that [the defendant,] either directly or through his insurance company, lost, destroyed [or] somehow did something with photographs\u201d of the defendant\u2019s damaged vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In ruling on the motion for a mistrial, the court concluded that \u201cin the context of the entire case . . . what [the defendant\u2019s] counsel is complaining of [does not] threaten the defense right to a fair trial.\u201d The court also concluded that there had been an abuse of discovery by the defendant\u2019s counsel and that, although its rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>might constitute grounds for appeal, they did not constitute grounds for the granting of a mistrial. The court made several key findings when considering the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. These included: (1) the defendant\u2019s counsel, herself, had answered an important interrogatory on the defendant\u2019s behalf, which the defendant later indicated was not his response; (2) the defendant knew that his vehicle had been repaired, but his counsel failed to provide this information to the plaintiff; (3) the defendant\u2019s insurer, acting on behalf of the defendant, knew that it had prepared a damage estimate, but that estimate \u201cwas intentionally not disclosed\u201d by his counsel in a timely manner; (4) the estimate of damages was not produced until January 10, 2005, when jury selection was in progress; (5) the defendant\u2019s counsel repeatedly had represented that there were no appraisal or repair documents but, contrary to that representation, the defendant\u2019s counsel, in fact, had received from the defendant\u2019s insurer the damage estimate documents once by mail and a second time by facsimile; and (6) despite receiving the damage estimate, the defendant\u2019s counsel, in objections to interrogatories filed with the court, insisted that no such documents existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">From our review of the record before us, we cannot and do not find any of the court\u2019s factual findings clearly erroneous, and we conclude that there is more than ample evidence in the record to support these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">As to the defendant\u2019s alleged grounds for a mistrial, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion on the grounds alleged. First, despite the defendant\u2019s contentions in his motion, no bad faith claim was brought or tried against Infinity. It is clear from the record before us that the court took pains to ensure that the company\u2019s name and the fact that the defendant was insured were not mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>before the jury. There is nothing in the record to support this ground for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Second, we conclude thatBussolotta\u2019s testimony was not unfair to the defendant. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument to the jury, Bussolotta testified that the damage to the defendant\u2019s automobile was extensive and that he had taken photographs of it, belying the defense theory that the collision was low impact and, therefore, unlikely to have caused the plaintiff injuries. Counsel, in representing the defendant, flouted the rules of practice in denying that repair estimates had been prepared. The plaintiff was entitled to put the truth of the matter before the juiy that an estimate had been prepared and that repairs, indeed, had been made and that they were extensive. This testimony was relevant on the issue of whether the impact was severe enough to have caused extensive property damage and that it, therefore, could have caused the plaintiffs injuries and damages. On this basis, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim on appeal is that the court improperly granted \u201cthe plaintiffs bill of costs when the defendant was not provided with an opportunity to object and subsequently disregarded the defendant\u2019s objection to the bill of costs.\u201d We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is not reviewable because he did not amend his appeal to include the order granting review of, but refusing to modify, the taxation of costs. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-9;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> see also <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>265 Conn. 669, 673 n.4, 830 A.2d 193 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>The defendant, again, refers to several different standards of review in his appellate brief with no specific request that we apply any one in particular to this claim. The plaintiff states, and we agree, that our standard of review is abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Our rules of practice provide that a prevailing party may ask that costs be taxed against the party who suffered judgment. Practice Book (2005) \u00a7 18-5 provides: \u201c(a) Costs may be taxed by the clerk in civil cases fourteen days after the filing of a written bill of costs provided that no objection is filed. If a written objection is filed within the fourteen day period, notice shall be given by the clerk to all appearing parties of record of the date and time of the clerk\u2019s taxation. The parties may appear at such taxation and have the right to be heard by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\u201c(b) Either party may move the judicial authority for a review of the taxation by the clerk by filing a motion for review of taxation of costs within twenty days of the issuance of the notice of taxation by the clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In this case, the plaintiff filed a bill of costs dated February 11, 2005, with the clerk, seeking reimbursements for costs in the amount of $5830.45. The certification on the plaintiffs bill of costs, signed R. Christopher Meyer, indicated that the plaintiffs counsel mailed a copy of the bill of costs to the defendant\u2019s counsel on February 11, 2005. It is not completely clear from the record, however, on what date the bill of costs was filed with the clerk of the Superior Court. We have received both the copy of the clerk\u2019s original file forwarded to us on appeal and the original clerk\u2019s file. No date stamp appears on the bill of costs to indicate the date of filing with the clerk. However, the file does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>contain a record showing that the clerk sent out computerized notices to counsel on March 3, 2005, stating that the plaintiff had filed a bill of costs dated February 11, 2005, and notifying all parties that a voucher for the bill of Edward Staub, an orthopedic surgeon and an expert witness for the plaintiff, would have to be filed by the plaintiff pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 18-1 et seq. This voucher was filed by the plaintiff on March 11, 2005, and the clerk taxed costs on March 15,2005, more than one month after the plaintiffs counsel certified that he had mailed a copy of the bill of costs to the defendant\u2019s counsel and ten days after the clerk had sent the computerized notice to both parties. On March 30, 2005, the defendant filed a \u201cmotion for review of taxation of costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">On April 14, 2005, the court sent a notice to the defendant\u2019s counsel, which stated in relevant part: \u201cThe court having considered the defendant\u2019s motion for review of taxation of costs . . . has issued the following order: Granted in part. The clerk properly approved the bill of costs having received no objection from the defendant. Although [the defendant\u2019s] counsel claims that she never received the plaintiffs bill of costs to date [the defendant\u2019s] counsel has not objected to the bill of costs nor has she moved for an extension of time to do so. The court takes notice that the clerk notified [the defendant\u2019s] counsel of the filing of the bill of costs by notice dated [March 3,2005]. Putting aside the failure of the defendant to file an . . . objection, the court has reviewed the bill of costs and finds that they are reasonable and in order, including the cost related to Dr. Staub, particularly in light of his travel time, education background, and experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">On appeal, the defendant specifically argues: \u201cAn objection to the bill of costs and motion for review of taxation of costs were filed on March 30, 2005. In response, the trial judge again stated that an objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>to the bill of costs was never filed, but then briefly responded to the defendant\u2019s objection regarding the $5000 expert witness fee Dr. Staub charged. Having responded, although only partially, to the objection, it is clear that the trial judge had, in fact, received an objection to the bill of costs.\u201d We find this assertion not only unfair to the trial judge, but misleading to this Appellate Court. The defendant has not provided a copy of an objection to the bill of costs in the return of record, his brief or his appendix. We thoroughly have searched through the Appellate Court file and taken additional steps to secure and review the original trial court file as well as the case detail sheet. Nevertheless, despite the contention of the defendant\u2019s counsel that \u201cit is clear that the trial judge had, in fact, received an objection,\u201d we are unable to find an objection filed on behalf of the defendant. Additionally, in the defendant\u2019s motion for review of taxation of costs, itself, he specifically represented: \u201cSince [the defendant\u2019s] [c]ounsel never received the [b]ill of [c]osts or the supporting documents, there was no opportunity to object.\u201d In the defendant\u2019s motion for review of taxation of costs, he specifically complained about the $5000 fee charged by Staub, from which the court apparently received its inkling that the defendant disputed this amount, but a motion for review of taxation of costs is <em>no t </em>an objection to a bill of costs. See Practice Book \u00a7 18-5. As is plainly set forth in W. Horton &amp; K. Knox, 1 Connecticut Practice Series: Connecticut Superior Court Rules (2005 Ed.) \u00a7 18-5, authors\u2019 comments, p. 822: \u201cIn civil actions, the prevailing party prepares a bill of costs and submits it to his opponent. If there is no objection, the clerk will approve the bill of costs. If there is an objection, the clerk or assistant clerk will set a hearing and assess costs. If [the] party is still aggrieved, he may appeal directly to the court through this motion for review.\u201d In this case, the defendant improperly appealed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>the taxation of costs without ever having filed an objection to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Despite the defendant\u2019s complete failure to file an objection to the taxation of costs, the court considered the motion for review and the issues raised therein. The defendant, however, has not filed an amended appeal to include the court\u2019s order granting review of the costs, but denying a modification thereof.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Regardless of what date between February 11 and March 3,2005, that the plaintiff actually filed his request for taxation of costs, it is clear from the record in this case that the defendant was put on notice from the clerk\u2019s office on March 3, 2005, that the plaintiff had requested that costs be taxed against the defendant. No objection to that request was filed, nor has one ever been filed. Additionally, a request for additional time was never filed, nor was a request for permission to file a late objection ever filed. More important to this issue on appeal, the defendant filed the present appeal on March 22, 2005. On April 11, 2005, the court granted the motion to review the taxation of costs, but refused to modify it. The defendant did not file an amended appeal to include this later order. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\"> The defendant also had claimed that the court improperly permitted the plaintiff to introduce the complaint, answer and amended answer into evidence after the closing statement of the defendant\u2019s counsel and that the court improperly instructed the jury to disregard certain statements made by the defendant\u2019s counsel during closing argument. These claims, which were briefed together as claim three in the defendant\u2019s appellate brief, expressly were abandoned during oral argument before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\"> The amended answer, which was presented to the court on January 19, 2005, and marked as exhibit four, was dated August 22, 2003, the same date as the original answer, and it did not specify that it was an amended answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\"> The court was very careful in previewing Bussolotta\u2019s testimony, and in directing counsel, before Bussolotta testified in front of the jury, to ensure that the issue of insurance coverage was not interjected into the case improperly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> Practice Boole \u00a7 61-9 provides in relevant part: \u201cShould the trial court, subsequent to the filing of the appeal, make a decision which the appellant desires to have reviewed, the appellant shall file an amended appeal form in the trial court within twenty days from the issuance of notice of the decision as provided for in Section 63-1. At the time the amended appeal form is filed, the appellant shall submit a copy thereof, endorsed in accor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>dance with Section 63-3, to the appellate clerk together with any amendments to the documents required by Section 63-4. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b757-14\"> Nevertheless, we can find nothing in the record to indicate that the taxation of costs was improper or unjust.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
