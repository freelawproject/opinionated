Pearson appeals the denial of social security disability benefits. Concluding that the administrative law judge (AU) incorrectly applied the Secretary\u2019s medical-vocational guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, in determining Pearson\u2019s disability status, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Pearson, 39 years of age, is five feet one and one-quarter inches tall and weighs over 300 pounds. She has a ninth-grade education. In October of 1982 she quit her job as a cook and filed an application for disability benefits. Pearson claims that she suffers from a nervous disorder and experiences pain in her left leg, back, and chest. After a hearing the AU recommended a denial of benefits, a recommendation accepted by the Secretary. When Pearson sought judicial review, the district court remanded for additional consideration of her claimed mental impairment. Following a supplemental hearing, the AU again recommended a finding that Pearson was not disabled. The Secretary again accepted the AU\u2019s recommendation and the district court denied relief. Pearson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-17\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b922-18\">Appellate review in social security cases is limited to a determination whether the Secretary\u2019s decision is legally correct and supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Underwood v. Bowen, </em>828 F.2d 1081 (5th Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 108 S.Ct. 758, 98 L.Ed.2d 770 (1988); <em>Dellolio v. Heckler, </em>705 F.2d 123 (5th Cir.1983). We have noted that substantial evidence \u201cis more than a scintilla, less than a preponderance, and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Dellolio, </em>705 F.2d at 125. Moreover, \u201c[w]e may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the Secretary, but we must scrutinize the record in its entirety to ascertain whether substantial evidence does indeed support the Secretary\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Fraga v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1296, 1302 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-21\">Pearson advances three points of error. She first challenges the AU\u2019s conclusion that she did not meet or equal a listed impairment under the Secretary\u2019s listing of impairments, 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, any of which, if present, requires an automatic finding of disability without consideration of a claimant\u2019s age, education, or work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). Pearson claims that she met the criteria listed for the impairment of obesity under 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 10.10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is undisputed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Pearson falls within the definition of obesity. The AU concluded, however, that Pearson did not exhibit any of the five conditions that must accompany obesity for a disability rating under section 10.10. Pearson claims qualification under section 10.10(A), which refers to pain and limitation of motion in any weight-bearing joint associated with x-ray evidence of arthritis. Alternatively, Pearson contends that her multiple ailments, including hypertension, diabetes, respiratory impairment, and chronic anxiety, when considered together, render her disabled under section 10.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">The record establishes that although Pearson complained of pain in her left knee, an x-ray taken on June 12, 1979 indicated that the knee was normal. In June of 1980, Pearson injured her left knee while playing baseball. Another x-ray was taken on June 26, 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 30, 1980, Pearson was examined by Dr. George Purvis. Although Dr. Purvis concluded that Pearson suffered from mild hypertrophic arthritis of her left knee, he noted that the knee had a full range of motion. Dr. Leon Binns conducted an examination of Pearson on November 13, 1982 and concluded that she had osteoarthritis of the left knee. Dr. Binns noted that flexion and extension could be accomplished, but with difficulty. On November 13, 1984, Pearson was examined by Dr. W.G. McDonald, who noticed no heat, warmth, or significant swelling of Pearson\u2019s left knee and found full range of motion in extension and flexion.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The absence of x-ray evidence of arthritis and the reports of the two doctors that Pearson had a full range of motion in her left knee suffice to support the AU\u2019s finding that Pearson did not meet the disability threshold of section 10.10(A). Pearson\u2019s argument that her combined impairments rendered her disabled under section 10.10 is likewise unpersuasive. Although she complained of hypertension and shortness of breath, the record contains no evidence of persistent high blood pressure or respiratory disease. The AU concluded that Pearson\u2019s anxiety did not impose any significant limitation on her ability to function. That determination is supported by substantial evidence. And although Pearson has diabetes, there is no evidence to support the suggestion that the disease poses a limitation on her functional ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Pearson\u2019s second assignment of error questions the AU\u2019s finding that she can engage in light work. After concluding that Pearson\u2019s impairments prevented her from continuing to work as a cook, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e), the AU considered whether the impairments prevented her from doing other work, \u00a7 404.1520(f). Relying on the Secretary\u2019s medical-vocational guidelines, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1569 and Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, Rule 202.18, the AU concluded that based on an exertional capacity for light work and her age, education, and work experience, Pearson was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">In determining whether work exists for a claimant, reliance may be placed on the medical-vocational guidelines \u201conly if the guidelines\u2019 evidentiary underpinnings coincide exactly with the evidence of disability appearing on the record.\u201d <em>Lawler v. Heckler, </em>761 F.2d 195, 197 (5th Cir.1985) (citations omitted). Indeed, section 404.-1569 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-10\">[A]s we explain in \u00a7 200.00 of Appendix 2, we do not apply [the medical-vocational guidelines] if one of the findings of fact about the person\u2019s vocational factors and residual functional capacity is not the same as the corresponding criterion of a rule. In these instances, we give full consideration to all relevant facts in accordance with the definitions and discussions under vocational considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeNp\"><em>See also </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, \u00a7 200.00(a). Thus, before the guidelines may be applied, the claimant\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity (i.e., the maximum de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>gree to which the individual retains the capacity for sustained performance of the physical-mental requirements of jobs) ... must first be determined.\u201d Id. \u00a7 200.00(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The AU made the following factual finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-5\">The claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform the physical exer-tional and nonexertional requirements of work except for excessive heavy lifting and <em>prolonged standing and walking </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Despite that finding, the AU concluded that Pearson has the capacity to perform light work. But according to the regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-7\">Light work involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be very little, <em>a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, </em>or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls. <em>To be considered capable of performing a full or wide range of light work, you must have the ability to do substantially all of these activities.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b) (emphasis added). Moreover, the regulations state that the term \u201clight work\u201d has the same meaning it has in the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles, </em>published by the Department of Labor. Id. \u00a7 404.1567. According to the <em>Dictionary, </em>light work \u201cusually requires walking or standing to a significant degree.\u201d Dictionary of Occupational Titles 101 (Dept, of Labor) (4th Ed. Supp.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">The AU found that Pearson is not capable of prolonged standing or walking. It necessarily follows that she does not have a residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined by the regulations. Accordingly, the AU erred in using Rule 202.18 in deciding Pearson\u2019s disability status. We therefore must remand for further proceedings. On remand the Secretary may opt to introduce testimony, if available, of specific jobs Pearson can perform that fall within the light work category but require no more walking or standing than she is capable of performing. <em>See Lawler, </em>761 F.2d at 198. Or the Secretary may seek to establish that Pearson has an exertional functional capacity to perform sedentary work, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a) and Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, \u00a7 201.00, in which case resort to the medical-vocational guidelines may be appropriate. We, of course, express no view on either.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Pearson also contends that the AU erred in refusing her request for an orthopedic examination, a pulmonary function study, and a psychiatric exam. In <em>Jones v. Bowen, </em>829 F.2d 524, 526 (5th Cir.1987), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-12\">It is clear that the claimant has a burden of proving his disability by establishing a physical or mental impairment. <em>Cook v. Heckler, </em>750 F.2d 391, 393 (5th Cir.1985); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(5)(A). Under the applicable regulations, if sufficient medical or other evidence is not provided by the claimant, the secretary is required to make a decision based on the information available. See 20 CFR \u00a7 404.1516 (1986). Under some circumstances, however, a consultative examination is required to develop a full and fair record. 20 CFR \u00a7 404.1517 (1986). The decision to require such an examination is discretionary. In <em>Turner v. Califano, </em>563 F.2d 669, 671 (5th Cir.1977), we stated \u201c[t]o be very clear, \u2018full inquiry\u2019 does not require a consultative examination at government expense unless the record establishes that such an examination is <em>necessary </em>to enable the administrative law judge to make the disability decision.\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">We concluded in <em>Jones </em>that a claimant must \u201craise a suspicion concerning such an impairment necessary to require the AU to order a consultative examination to discharge his duty of \u2018full inquiry\u2019 under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1444.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We are persuaded that Pearson\u2019s testimony, as corroborated by Dr. McDonald\u2019s report recommending \u201ca forced vital capacity and blood gas determination\u201d to qualify \u201cthe extent of her respiratory compromise secondary to her obesity,\u201d raises the requisite suspicion. On remand the Secretary is to secure a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>pulmonary function study by a qualified medical expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED. The matter is REMANDED to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-12\">. 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 10.10 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-14\"><em>Obesity. </em>Weight equal to or greater than the values specified in Table I for males, Table II for females (100 percent above desired level) and one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-15\">A.History of pain and limitation of motion in any weight bearing joint or spine (on physical examination) associated with x-ray evidence of arthritis in a weight bearing joint or spine; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-22\">B.
