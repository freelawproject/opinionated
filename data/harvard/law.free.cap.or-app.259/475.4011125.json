J.</author>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction that included, among others, one count of tampering with a witness, ORS 162.285, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s imposition of an upward departure sentence of 48 months\u2019 incarceration on that count. Defendant contends that the trial court erred in concluding that both the state and the witness were particularly vulnerable victims for purposes of applying the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d aggravating factor under OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, defendant argues that the state, not the witness, is the \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of the crime of tampering with a witness and that the legislature did not intend for the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d aggravating factor to apply to the state. Defendant also contends that, even if the state could be considered a particularly vulnerable victim under that rule, there were not compelling reasons to depart from the presumptive sentence. The state responds that the witness is, in fact, the victim for purposes of the rule and that the state provided compelling reasons to depart.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we agree with the state and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Because defendant was convicted, we summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the state and provide only those facts that are relevant to the sentencing issue. <em>State v. Enemesio, </em>233 Or App 156, 158, 225 P3d 115, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>rev den, </em>348 Or 414 (2010). Defendant and the witness at issue, O\u2019Connor, were in an intimate relationship in 2007 when defendant assaulted her. The police arrested him for the assault but, upon his release from jail, he returned to O\u2019Connor\u2019s residence and assaulted her again. When she reported that assault to the police, defendant threatened to hurt her family unless she lied to the police about it, so she told police that she had fallen. Eventually, however, defendant went to prison for his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Upon his release from prison, defendant resumed his relationship with O\u2019Connor, staying at her apartment from time to time. After several months, however, before leaving on a trip, O\u2019Connor moved defendant\u2019s belongings onto the back porch and told defendant that she did not want him staying at her apartment anymore. When she returned from the trip to find that defendant had broken into her apartment, she called police. Defendant was again arrested and sent to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Defendant called O\u2019Connor three times from jail. In the first call, defendant pleaded with O\u2019Connor to tell police that he had been living in the apartment with permission and told her to explain that she had reported him because she was having \u201cdelusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In the second call (about 10 minutes after the first), defendant asked O\u2019Connor to tell police that she might have left the door open and might have authorized him to stay. He wanted them to \u201cbe together on this\u201d in order to get him out of trouble. O\u2019Connor became frustrated with defendant\u2019s attempts to persuade her to change her story and told defendant that she would not lie and that she was not a \u201ccrazy person.\u201d Defendant inquired about which psychiatric medications O\u2019Connor was still taking and commented that she had stopped taking one of them the prior week. He asked O\u2019Connor about which medications she was taking during a third call as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Defendant was charged with several crimes, including three counts of tampering with a witness. The jury found him guilty of two of those counts; verdicts on those counts were merged into a single conviction. At sentencing, the state sought an upward departure sentence based on, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>among others, the vulnerable victim aggravating factor in OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(B). According to the state, defendant exploited O\u2019Connor\u2019s psychological frailty in order to attempt to induce her to testify falsely. The state pointed to evidence of his phone calls to her from jail, in which he alluded to his knowledge of her physical limitations, mental health issues, and medications. According to the state, defendant was \u201cclearly in a position [to know] that [O\u2019Connor] was of a * * * mental and physical, fragile, or limited state during this time period and [defendant] took advantage of that * * * \u201d Defendant argued in response that the state, and not the witness, is the \u201cprimary victim\u201d in a witness tampering case and that O\u2019Connor was not a victim at all, much less a vulnerable victim under the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The court concluded in a letter ruling that both the state and O\u2019Connor were \u201cvictims\u201d for purposes of the rule and that the state had proved the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt. As to O\u2019Connor, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201c*** O\u2019Connor is *** a victim because she suffered psychological and social harm as a result of [defendant\u2019s] attempts to pressure her. In both the jail telephone calls and her trial testimony, * * * O\u2019Connor was obviously distraught over [defendant\u2019s] efforts to pressure and manipulate her. Based on years of manipulating and taking advantage of * * * O\u2019Connor, [defendant] knew of her particular vulnerability. This vulnerability increased the threat * * * of harm to which * * * O\u2019Connor was subject, both in the short term (being successfully manipulated into testifying falsely) and in the long term (continuing in the abusive relationship with [defendant]).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The court then imposed an upward departure sentence of 48 months\u2019 incarceration on the witness tampering conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">On appeal, defendant essentially renews his argument that neither the state nor O\u2019Connor was a \u201cvictim\u201d under the rule. In defendant\u2019s view, the rule\u2019s reference to a vulnerable victim must be to the \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of the substantive crime (here, tampering with a witness). We recently considered a similar argument in <em>State v. Teixeira, </em>259 Or App 184, 313 P3d 351 (2013). There, the defendant asserted, in part, that \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of the \u201cmultiple victims\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>aggravating factor under OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(G) is congruent with \u201cthe victim of the crime for purposes of ORS 161.067.\u201d <em>Teixeira, </em>259 Or App at 187.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, according to the defendant in that case, the \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of the sentencing guidelines is the person who is a victim within the meaning of the specific substantive statute defining the relevant offense. The state, on the other hand, asserted that \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of sentencing departures is defined by ORS 131.007, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">\u201cAs used in * * * ORS chapters 136, 137 and 144, except as otherwise specifically provided or unless the context requires otherwise, \u2018victim\u2019 means the person or persons who have suffered financial, social, psychological or physical harm as a result of a crime * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We concluded that the meaning of the term \u201cvictim\u201d under the sentencing guidelines is broader than urged by the defendant, but \u201cnarrower than the meaning of\u2018victim\u2019 under ORS 131.007\u201d urged by the state. <em>Teixeira, </em>259 Or App at 192. Instead of adopting either of those constructions, we examined the text, context, and history of the rule and concluded that, for purposes of the sentencing guidelines, \u201ca \u2018victim\u2019 is a person who is directly, immediately, and exclusively injured by the commission of the crime \u2014 not persons injured only by subsequent, additional criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Here, we apply the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d set forth in <em>Teixeira </em>in considering the vulnerable victim aggravating factor under OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(B). Based on that definition, we conclude that the trial court correctly concluded that O\u2019Connor was a victim of witness tampering for purposes of the sentencing guidelines. In particular, as set forth above, the court concluded that O\u2019Connor was a victim of defendant\u2019s crime because \u201cshe suffered psychological and social harm as a result of [defendant\u2019s] attempts to pressure her,\u201d she was \u201cdistraught over [defendant\u2019s] efforts to pressure and manipulate her,\u201d and her vulnerability increased the threat of harm to which she was subject, \u201cboth in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>short term (being successfully manipulated into testifying falsely) and in the long term (continuing in the abusive relationship with [defendant]).\u201d Because O\u2019Connor was \u201cdirectly, immediately, and exclusively injured by the commission of the crime,\u201d <em>Teixeira, </em>259 Or App at 199, she is a victim for purposes of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The question remains, however, whether the court\u2019s findings of fact and its reasons for justifying the departure are supported by evidence in the record and constitute substantial and compelling reasons for departure as a matter of law. ORS 138.222(3); <em>State v. Wolff, </em>174 Or App 367, 369, 27 P3d 145 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s explanation was sufficiently supported by the evidence in the record. Again, OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(B) provides that the court may impose an upward departure sentence if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201c[t]he offender knew or had reason to know of the victim\u2019s particular vulnerability, such as the extreme youth, age, disability or ill health of victim, which increased the harm or threat of harm caused by the criminal conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">As we explained in <em>Enemesio,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201c[t]hat factor qualifies as an aggravating factor only when \u2018the court determines that the offender\u2019s knowledge of or disregard for the victim\u2019s vulnerability increased the potential harm attributed to the offender\u2019s criminal conduct.\u2019 <em>Oregon Sentencing Guidelines Implementation Manual </em>130 (1989).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">233 Or App at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Here, the evidence in the record establishes that defendant and O\u2019Connor were in an intimate relationship when defendant assaulted her and that he assaulted her again upon his release from jail. He contacted her several times from jail and made repeated attempts to persuade her to lie to police. Those efforts included questioning her mental health and whether she was taking her psychiatric medications. The evidence establishes that O\u2019Connor was particularly vulnerable, given her psychiatric issues, and that she was distraught over defendant\u2019s attempts to pressure and manipulate her. Defendant\u2019s comments regarding her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>mental health and medication establish that he was aware of her vulnerability; as the trial court noted, he had \u201cyears of manipulating and taking advantage of [her].\u201d The court\u2019s findings and analysis are supported by the evidence and constitute substantial and compelling reasons for departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\"> OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">\u201cSubject to the provisions of sections (2) and (3) of this rule, the following nonexclusive list of mitigating and aggravating factors may be considered in determining whether substantial and compelling reasons for a departure exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">\u201c(b) Aggravating factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">\u00ab* * * \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">\u201c(B) The offender knew or had reason to know of the victim\u2019s particular vulnerability, such as the extreme youth, age, disability or ill health of victim, which increased the harm or threat of harm caused by the criminal conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-12\"> In addition, the state asserts that defendant\u2019s argument that the state is not a particularly vulnerable victim is unpreserved and that, in all events, the trial court did not err in identifying the state as a vulnerable victim for purposes of OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(B). Given our disposition of the case, we need not address those arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\"> The crime at issue in <em>Teixeira </em>was burglary, and the \u201c\u2018victim\u2019 of a burglary for purposes of ORS 161.067(2) \u2018is the person who possesses <em>the property interest </em>violated.\u2019\u201d <em>Teixeira, </em>259 Or App at 188 (quoting <em>State v.
