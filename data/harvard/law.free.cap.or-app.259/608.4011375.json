Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 9; US Const, Amend IV.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state argued, and the trial court agreed, that the challenged warrantless search was authorized by defendant\u2019s consent to an earlier warrantless search. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that defendant\u2019s consent to the earlier search did not authorize the later search. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We begin with the facts, which we state in accordance with the trial court\u2019s findings. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 74-75, 854 P2d 421 (1993) (when reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, an appellate court is bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, provided that the findings are supported by constitutionally sufficient evidence). On July 26, 2010, Lincoln City Police Officer Shawn Carter was on routine patrol, driving a marked patrol car on Highway 101. At approximately 12:30 a.m., he saw a blue car traveling northbound. He ran a records check based on the car\u2019s license plate number and learned that the car\u2019s registration had expired in 2009. Based on that information, Carter turned on his patrol car\u2019s overhead and emergency lights to initiate a traffic stop. In response, the blue car pulled into a parking lot and parked. Carter parked behind it.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Carter approached defendant, the blue car\u2019s driver. He asked her for her driver\u2019s license, the car\u2019s registration, and proof that the car was insured. Defendant told Carter that she did not have a driver\u2019s license and gave him her identification card. She also told him that the car did not belong to her and that there were no registration or insurance papers in the car. Carter took defendant\u2019s identification card to his patrol car to run a records check.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Lincoln City Police Officer Trenton Morrill came to the parking lot to serve as a cover officer. Carter requested that Morrill ask defendant if she would consent to a search of her car. While Carter remained in his patrol car to complete the records check and write defendant a citation, Morrill approached defendant, who was still seated in the driver\u2019s seat of the blue car, and asked her if she had any contraband in the car. Defendant said that she did not. Morrill then asked defendant if she would consent to a search of the car, and defendant said that she would. Defendant got out of the car to allow Morrill to search it.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Morrill noticed that the car was \u201cfull of all kinds of personal belongings.\u201d He saw a small cooler and opened it, but did not discover any contraband. He then said to defendant, \u201cWow. You have a whole bunch of clothes in the back of here,\u201d or \u201cWow. There\u2019s a whole bunch of clothes in the backseat.\u201d According to Morrill, who could not recall defendant\u2019s exact words when he testified at the suppression hearing, defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t really want you to look in there\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t want you looking through that.\u201d Morrill understood defendant\u2019s reply to mean that \u201cshe didn\u2019t want [him] to be rooting through in the back seat of the car.\u201d Morrill stopped searching and walked back to Carter\u2019s patrol car. He told Carter that defendant had told him that she did not want him to look under the clothes in the back seat. He then told Carter, \u201cThis is your stop * * * at this point. Whatever you want to do. I\u2019m here to stand by and be your cover officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Carter completed the citation and walked back to defendant, while Morrill remained nearby. Defendant had gotten back into the car and was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. Carter spoke to her through the driver\u2019s window. He gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>her the citation and told her that she was \u201cfree to go.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Carter also told defendant that she would not be able to drive away; she would have to leave on foot or wait for someone to come and pick her up. At the suppression hearing, Carter testified that he told defendant that she was \u201cfree to go\u201d several times and that he was \u201cvery clear about that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Carter did not walk away from defendant\u2019s car after giving defendant the citation. He stayed at her window as she put the citation and her identification card into her purse and got ready to leave the car. Because he was curious, Carter asked defendant why she had limited Morrill\u2019s search. Defendant seemed surprised and said that she did not know why Morrill had stopped searching.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Defendant got out of the car and she and Carter took a few steps away from it. While defendant was getting herself organized and ready to leave, Carter asked her if he could search the car. He said, \u201cSo you don\u2019t mind if I search your car?\u201d or \u201cWhy can\u2019t I search the rest of your car?\u201d In response, defendant agreed that Carter could search the car, and, during the subsequent search, Carter searched the glove compartment and discovered, <em>inter alia, </em>a small baggie that contained a crystalline substance that Carter recognized as methamphetamine and two glass pipes containing a light-colored residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The state charged defendant with unlawful possession of methamphetamine, ORS 475.894. Defense counsel filed a motion to suppress the results of Carter\u2019s search of defendant\u2019s car, arguing that defendant\u2019s consent to Carter\u2019s search was invalid because it was the product of an unlawful stop, and, therefore, Carter\u2019s search violated her state and federal constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. At the hearing on the motion, defense counsel argued that, although Carter had lawfully stopped defendant for driving a car without a current registration, Carter\u2019s conduct after he gave defendant the citation constituted a second stop, and that stop violated defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>constitutional rights because it was not supported by reasonable suspicion. Relying in part on <em>State v. Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, 964 P2d 1007 (1998), defense counsel argued that, although Carter told defendant that she was free to go, Carter\u2019s conduct indicated otherwise, in that he did not walk away from defendant\u2019s car after issuing her the citation; instead, he remained by her door and began to question her about why she had limited Morrill\u2019s search. According to defense counsel, Carter\u2019s actions were akin to those of the officer in <em>Toevs, </em>who, at the conclusion of a traffic stop, returned the defendant\u2019s identification and told him that he was free to go, but asked for consent to search before giving the defendant the opportunity to leave. 327 Or at 529. Under <em>Toevs, </em>defense counsel argued, there must be a \u201ctemporal break\u201d between a traffic stop and an unrelated request for consent to a search. In this case, defense counsel posited, there was no such break:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">\u201cSo what we have here is from the testimony of the officer, nobody left. Nobody got in their car. Officer Morrill didn\u2019t get in his car and drive away. Officer Carter didn\u2019t return to his vehicle. He was right there. He moved out of the way so she could get out of the car. But there\u2019s no break. There\u2019s just no break between the traffic stop in this case and then the request [to] search.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Thus, defense counsel argued, the evidence seized during Carter\u2019s search should be suppressed as the product of an unlawful stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The state did not respond to defense counsel\u2019s argument that Carter\u2019s conduct after issuing the citation constituted a second stop. Instead, the state argued that defendant\u2019s consent to Morrill\u2019s search authorized Carter\u2019s later search. The state\u2019s theory, as articulated by the prosecutor, was that defendant\u2019s consent to Morrill was valid because it was obtained during an \u201cunavoidable lull\u201d in the traffic stop, <em>State v. Rodgers, </em>219 Or App 366, 372, 182 P3d 209 (2008), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom State v. Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or 610, 227 P3d 695 (2010), and that, when Carter requested consent to search after he issued defendant the citation and told her that she was free to go, he was simply \u201cclarifying any limitations\u201d that defendant had placed on her initial consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The prosecutor agreed with defense counsel that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a temporal break,\u201d but contended that the trial court did not \u201cneed to get into that analysis, because *** the point of the consent being given was at the conversation with Officer Morrill, and all Officer Carter was doing was confirming how much she had limited that afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The trial court accepted the state\u2019s theory, concluding that defendant\u2019s consent to Morrill authorized Carter\u2019s later search. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to deny the Motion to Suppress. I think the search was authorized by consent that Morrill got at the time he initially was asked to go up and see if she\u2019d give consent to search the car based on Carter\u2019s suspicions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201c[A]nd the temporal lull isn\u2019t a part of this one. The consent was there and Carter was clarifying that consent. [Defendant] said, \u2018Well, go ahead.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Thereafter, defendant waived her right to a jury trial and proceeded to a stipulated facts trial. The trial court convicted defendant of unlawful possession of methamphetamine, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">As mentioned, on appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress, arguing that the state failed to carry its burden of proving that Carter\u2019s warrantless search of her car was conducted pursuant to an exception to the state and federal warrant requirements. As in the trial court, the state\u2019s only argument in response is that Carter\u2019s search was authorized by defendant\u2019s consent to Morrill\u2019s search. In its brief, the state asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">\u201cCarter\u2019s search was lawful under the consent defendant gave Morrill. In short, that search was supported by the valid consent defendant gave Morrill, which was still in place when Carter found the drugs. Whatever the effect of Carter\u2019s post-citation exchange with defendant, it did not invalidate the previous consent to search obtained by Morrill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">(Internal footnote omitted.) Thus, the state does not respond to defendant\u2019s argument that Carter conducted a second stop that was unsupported by reasonable suspicion, and it does not contend that defendant\u2019s consent to Carter was independently sufficient to justify Carter\u2019s search.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Although defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was based on both the state and federal constitutions, we address only her state claim because it is dispositive. Article I, section 9, protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures. Warrantless searches and seizures are <em>per se </em>unreasonable unless they fall within \u201cone of the few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>295 Or 227, 237, 666 P2d 802 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). The state bears the burden of proving that a warrantless search or seizure falls within such an exception. <em>Id. </em>Whether the state has carried that burden is a question of law, which we review for errors of law. <em>See id. </em>at 238 (\u201cOur function is limited to determining whether legal principles were correctly applied.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Consent is an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Weaver, </em>319 Or 212, 219, 874 P2d 1322 (1994). To prove that a warrantless search was justified by a defendant\u2019s consent, the state must prove that the consent was (1) voluntary and (2) not tainted by prior unlawful police conduct. <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 20-21, 115 P3d 908 (2005); <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>317 Or 27, 38-41, 854 P2d 399 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Under Article I, section 9, a police officer may ask a driver to consent to a search during a lawful traffic stop, provided that the request does not extend the duration of the stop. <em>Rodgers, </em>219 Or App at 370-71; <em>see State v. Gomes, </em>236 Or App 364, 371, 236 P3d 841 (2010) (concluding that, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rodgers IKirkeby, </em>\u201cthere are no Article I, section 9, implications if an inquiry unrelated to the traffic stop occurs during a routine stop but does not delay it\u201d). Thus, an officer may ask a driver for consent to search during an \u201cunavoidable lull\u201d in a traffic stop, such as when the officer is waiting for the results of a records check. <em>State v. Dennis, </em>250 Or App 732, 737-38, 282 P3d 955 (2012) (applying the \u201cunavoidable lull\u201d analysis); <em>State v. Jones, </em>239 Or App 201, 208, 245 P3d 148 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 230 (2011) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>But, an officer may not ask a driver for consent to search in lieu of completing a traffic stop. <em>Rodgers, </em>219 Or App at 372; <em>see Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or at 623 (\u201cPolice authority to detain a motorist dissipates when the investigation reasonably related to that traffic infraction, the identification of persons, and the issuance of a citation * * * is completed or reasonably should be completed.\u201d). In other words, the officer may not ask for consent \u201cinstead of expeditiously proceeding with the steps necessary to complete the stop.\u201d <em>State v. Nims, </em>248 Or App 708, 713, 264 P3d 235, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012); <em>see State v. Alvarado, </em>257 Or App 612, 631, 307 P3d 540 (2013) (\u201cAs soon as police were able to issue defendant a citation, their authority to detain defendant evaporated.\u201d); <em>State v. Huggett, </em>228 Or App 569, 575, 209 P3d 385 (2009), <em>rev dismissed, </em>348 Or 71 (2010) (an officer may not inquire \u201cabout unrelated matters as an alternative to going forward with the next step in processing the [traffic violation], such as the writing or issuing of a citation\u201d). An officer may neither extend a stop nor initiate a second stop without reasonable suspicion to do so. <em>See Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or at 623 (\u201cOther or further conduct by the police, beyond that reasonably related to the traffic violation, must be <em>justified </em>on some basis other than the traffic violation.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)); <em>State v. Kentopp, </em>251 Or App 527, 534, 284 P3d 564 (2012) (\u201c[A]t the point that the officer had the results of the defendant\u2019s records check, the officer had all of the information that he needed to complete the traffic stop and, therefore, the officer needed reasonable suspicion to lawfully extend the stop[.]\u201d (discussing <em>State v. Klein, </em>234 Or App 523, 531-32, 228 P3d 714 (2010)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>On appeal, defendant does not dispute that Carter lawfully stopped her to investigate a traffic violation. Nor does she dispute that Morrill\u2019s request for consent occurred during an unavoidable lull and, therefore, authorized Morrill\u2019s search of the car. But, she does dispute the state\u2019s claim, which the trial court accepted, that her consent to Morrill\u2019s search authorized Carter\u2019s later search. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that defendant\u2019s consent to Morrill\u2019s search expired when Morrill terminated his search and, therefore, did not authorize Carter\u2019s later search.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">As described, defendant assented to Morrill\u2019s request to search. Morrill began his search and then defendant limited her consent; after he remarked that she had a lot of clothing in the back of the car, she told him, \u201cI don\u2019t really want you to look in there\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t want you looking though that.\u201d Morrill then terminated his search, as evidenced by his actions and the responses by both defendant and Carter. Morrill walked away from defendant\u2019s car, and defendant got back in the car and sat in the driver\u2019s seat. Morrill told Carter, \u201cThis is your stop * * * at this point. Whatever you want to do. I\u2019m here to stand by and be your cover officer [,]\u201d thereby conveying that he was done with his search. Carter completed the citation, issued it to defendant, told her that she was free to go, and watched as she prepared to leave the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Thus, it was apparent to defendant that Morrill\u2019s search \u2014 the only search to which defendant had consented\u2014 was over. Just as the scope of a defendant\u2019s consent turns on what a \u201c\u2018typical reasonable person would have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect[,]\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Arroyo-Sotelo, </em>131 Or App 290, 295, 884 P2d 901 (1994) (brackets in <em>Arroyo-Sotelo </em>omitted) (quoting <em>Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 US 248, 251, 111 S Ct 1801, 114 L Ed 2d 297 (1991)), so, too, does the temporal duration of a given search and, with it, the duration of a suspect\u2019s consent. <em>See State v. Fugate, </em>210 Or App 8, 13, 150 P3d 409 (2006) (the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>of consent \u201cturns on what a reasonable person would have intended\u201d). Where a reasonable person would perceive that a consent search has terminated, the suspect\u2019s consent to that search cannot be used to support a later search. <em>See Arroyo-Sotelo, </em>131 Or App at 295 (looking at the \u201ctotality of the circumstances of the particular case\u201d when evaluating the scope of consent under Article I, section 9). Under the particular circumstances of this case, defendant\u2019s consent expired with the obvious termination of Morrill\u2019s search.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Carter\u2019s search was a separate search, and it required a separate consent. The state does not argue that it had such a separate consent. Although Carter asked defendant if he could search the car and defendant agreed, the state \u2014 which conceded in the trial court that there was no temporal break between Carter\u2019s issuance of the citation and his questioning about defendant\u2019s consent \u2014 has not argued, either in the trial court or on appeal, that defendant\u2019s consent to Carter provided a separate justification for Carter\u2019s search.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In sum, the state failed to prove that Carter\u2019s search was authorized by an exception to the warrant requirement. The state\u2019s only argument regarding Carter\u2019s search was that it was authorized by defendant\u2019s consent to Morrill\u2019s search. But the two searches were separate and required separate consents. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\"> Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> Although Carter had stopped defendant for driving a car without a current registration, during the stop he learned that defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended, and he cited her for driving while suspended.
