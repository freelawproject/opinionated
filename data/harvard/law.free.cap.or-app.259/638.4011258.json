Father contends that the juvenile court erred in proceeding with the permanency hearing after attempts to call him at the prison failed. We agree and, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The facts are not in dispute. In December 2011, father and mother had a violent altercation in M\u2019s presence. M was six years old at the time. The police responded to the altercation and found methamphetamine-related paraphernalia at the scene. Both parents were arrested and later charged with possession of methamphetamine, endangering the welfare of a minor, and fourth-degree assault; in addition, father was charged with strangulation. On the day of parents\u2019 arrest, the police contacted the Department of Human Services (DHS), which took protective custody of M, placed her with her maternal grandmother, and later arranged for her to receive regular counseling. M subsequently tested positive for methamphetamine. In February 2012, the juvenile court asserted jurisdiction over M.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">DHS offered father services aimed at enabling him to resume custody of M, including batterers\u2019 intervention, drug and alcohol evaluation, supervised visitation with M, and parenting classes. Father began participating in batterers\u2019 intervention services. He also completed a drug and alcohol evaluation, and the evaluator recommended that father engage in treatment because he was using prescription opiates. Father did not comply with that recommendation; at the time, he evidently indicated that he did not want to participate in treatment because he was suffering pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">In June 2012, father was arrested for several probation violations, and his probation was revoked. He was incarcerated as a result, with an expected release date in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>early August 2013. Drug and alcohol treatment and batterers\u2019 intervention services were not available to father in prison, but he did participate in other programs, the nature of which the record does not reveal. Father told M\u2019s DHS caseworker, Dusseau, that he wanted to receive drug and alcohol treatment and resume batterers\u2019 intervention services when he was released. He also said that he planned to move into an addiction-recovery community home like an \u201cOxford House.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The permanency hearing was held in March 2013. At issue were whether the juvenile court should change the permanency plan from reunification and, if so, whether to change it to adoption or guardianship. As the hearing was set to begin, the court attempted to call the prison where father was housed so that father could participate in the hearing telephonically, but the prison telephone was busy. After a second unsuccessful attempt, the court announced that the hearing would proceed. Father\u2019s counsel objected to proceeding in father\u2019s absence, explaining that father wanted to be present, but the court overruled that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In her opening statement, father\u2019s counsel told the court in general terms about father\u2019s participation in services in prison and his plans following his release:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">\u201cYour Honor, [father] is in prison and his anticipated release date is approximately August 2nd or 3rd of 2013. There may be some \u2014 we might not have any evidence, actually, upon \u2014 not having [father] on the phone. There are some reports indicating that [father] maybe hasn\u2019t made the best use of his time in prison, however, in speaking to him and talking to him about his programming he reports to me that he\u2019s been participating in programming, has made progress in services while in prison, and has been put on the waiting list for a parenting class. I believe that the dispositional order requires him to participate in a domestic violence intervention program. If he were here today to testify by phone he would tell the Court that upon his release he \u2014 and he has already, and I don\u2019t think this is contested, made numerous contacts with the agency, DHS, to ensure that he transitions into [a batterers\u2019 intervention program] immediately upon his release. He is prepared to do that. He will be on post-prison supervision when he gets out so in terms of any kind of issue pertaining to alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>drug and alcohol problems will be addressed through his post-prison supervision. He has a clean and sober place to live.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In addition, father\u2019s attorney asserted that father opposed changing the permanency plan but \u2014 if the court did change it \u2014 would prefer a plan of guardianship to a plan of adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In the evidentiary phase of the hearing, Dusseau, the DHS caseworker, testified that drug and alcohol treatment and batterers\u2019 intervention services were the only services that father would need to complete so M could return to his care. She added that the batterers\u2019 intervention was the \u201cbiggest concern\u201d and that father would need to make \u201csignificant progress\u201d with that for six months following his release. On cross-examination, Dusseau agreed that it would be possible for father to \u201ctransition right into the program\u201d upon his release and that it was possible that he could make sufficient progress that M could be returned to his care in less than six months. She explained that, under the circumstances, father would have to be \u201cwell established in that program and making documented progress in order to consider returning [M] to his care sooner than that.\u201d Dusseau also stated that DHS would \u201cfeel comfortable\u201d returning M to father\u2019s care in an Oxford House-type home.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">DHS also presented testimony from M\u2019s maternal grandmother and from her counselor. The counselor testified that M needed \u201ca safe, predictable, nurturing environment with a caretaker who puts her mental, emotional, and social needs first,\u201d and he opined that adoption was the best option for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Father\u2019s sole witness was his own mother, who testified only about the ability of various family members to maintain contact with M.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">At the end of the hearing, the juvenile court found that it was not possible for M to be returned to the custody of either parent within a reasonable time. Specifically, with respect to father, it found that father \u201cwould not be in a position to have custody of [M] before early 2014 at the earliest,\u201d which, it explained, \u201cwould not be a reasonable amount of time.\u201d The court went on to conclude that the permanency plan should be changed to adoption. Accordingly, it entered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>judgment changing the permanency plan and ordering DHS to file petitions to terminate mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">On appeal, father first argues that the juvenile court erred in holding the permanency hearing in his absence. He relies on ORS 419B.875(2), which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\u201cThe rights of the parties include, but are not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">\u201c(c) The right to call witnesses, cross-examine witnesses and participate in hearings [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Father contends that the right to participate in hearings includes the right to testify about the issues before the court. In his view, the trial court denied him a fundamentally fair proceeding when it decided to proceed in his absence, depriving him of that right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">DHS responds, first, that father\u2019s argument is not preserved for appeal. We reject that argument without discussion. Second, DHS argues that, because ORS 419B.875(2) does not specifically mention the right to testify or the right to be present, a parent does not have those rights at a permanency hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DHS contends that father did, in fact, participate in the hearing, through counsel, who told the court about father\u2019s involvement in programming in prison and explained father\u2019s position. According to DHS, there is no basis for suggesting that father\u2019s participation in the hearing would have been more effective had he been present by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Neither we nor the Supreme Court has ever construed the right to \u201cparticipate in hearings,\u201d as that term is used in ORS 419B.875(2)(c). We readily conclude, however, that a party\u2019s right to participate includes the right to testify in the party\u2019s own behalf. That conclusion is inescapable given the other rights listed in subsection (2) of the statute. Those rights include \u2014 independent from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>right to \u201cparticipate\u201d \u2014 the \u201cright to appear with counsel.\u201d ORS 419B.875(2)(b). If appearing with (or through) counsel counted as \u201cparticipat[ing] in hearings,\u201d as DHS argues, then subsection (2)(c) of the statute would be superfluous. We construe statutes \u201cso as to give effect to all relevant provisions\u201d and not in a way that would render some provisions \u201csurplusage.\u201d <em>State v. Mayes, </em>220 Or App 385, 389, 186 P3d 293 (2008). Moreover, in addition to granting the right to \u201cparticipate,\u201d subsection (2)(c) also affords the right to call witnesses. The provision cannot plausibly be understood to allow a party to <em>call </em>witnesses but not to <em>be </em>a witness. Participating in a hearing solely through counsel cannot substitute for participating as a witness if a party wishes to offer his or her own testimony, which father did in this case. Accordingly, we agree with father that the juvenile court erred in proceeding with the hearing in his absence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">We turn to the question of whether the court\u2019s error was prejudicial. <em>See Cler v. Providence Health System-Oregon, </em>349 Or 481,490, 245 P3d 642 (2010) (we will reverse a judgment based on a lower court\u2019s error only if that error substantially affected a party\u2019s rights). In that regard, DHS contends that there is no reason to believe that father\u2019s personal participation would have been more effective than his participation through counsel. In support of that argument, DHS quotes the opening statement made by father\u2019s attorney, in which the attorney described, in general terms, what father would have said had he been able to testify. We understand DHS\u2019s argument to be that those statements by father\u2019s attorney adequately substituted for the evidence that father would have given had he been able to personally participate in the hearing. For at least three reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">First, the attorney\u2019s factual assertions about father\u2019s participation in services (both accomplished and planned)\u2014 whether they are considered as part of the attorney\u2019s opening statement or as part of an offer of proof \u2014 are not themselves evidence. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that the juvenile court gave those assertions evidentiary weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Second, even if we assumed that the juvenile court gave substantive weight to the attorney\u2019s statements, those general assertions about father\u2019s participation in programming could not substitute for the more detailed testimony that father presumably would have been able to give, and that DHS would have been able to test on cross-examination. Such details could have been significant in light of DHS caseworker Dusseau\u2019s testimony that whether M could be returned to father\u2019s care in less than six months following his release would depend on how father did in the batterers\u2019 intervention program and whether he was making documented progress. If father had been given an opportunity to discuss his participation in prison programs and to convince the court that he was dedicated to actively participating in other programs, including batterers\u2019 intervention, after his release, he might have been able to persuade the court that he could be reunited with M within a reasonable time. Thus, father\u2019s testimony could have influenced the court\u2019s finding as to when he might be able to resume custody of M and, in turn, its conclusion as to whether any compelling reason existed for DHS not to promptly file a termination petition. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.498(2)(b)(A) (a compelling reason for concluding that filing a termination petition would not be in a child\u2019s best interests includes a determination that the parent \u201cis successfully participating in services that will make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home within a reasonable time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Finally, in the context of a permanency hearing\u2014 particularly one in which a parent hopes to convince a court to adopt guardianship as the plan, rather than adoption, if it changes the plan at all \u2014 it is critical for the court to hear the parent\u2019s personal account of his or her participation in services, plans for the future, and reasons for desiring a plan that will allow the parent to maintain contact with the child. Counsel\u2019s representations about what testimony the parent would have given are no substitute for the court hearing the parent\u2019s own plea to be allowed to maintain some sort of relationship with his or her child. The parent\u2019s demeanor, credibility, and persuasiveness in delivering that plea (whether observed visually or, as would have been the case here, through hearing the parent\u2019s speech patterns, tone, and pitch of voice) may be critical to the court\u2019s ultimate determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>We recognize that the record does not demonstrate unequivocally that father\u2019s testimony would have influenced the juvenile court\u2019s decision regarding the appropriate permanency plan for this child. Ordinarily, we will not reverse a trial court\u2019s judgment based on the possibility that excluded evidence might have affected the outcome of the proceeding unless the appellant made an offer of proof showing that the exclusion of the evidence was prejudicial. <em>See </em>OEC 103(l)(b) (evidentiary error is not presumed to be prejudicial, and error may not be predicated on the exclusion of evidence unless a substantial right of a party is affected and the substance of the excluded evidence was made known to the court). But this case does not involve ordinary evidentiary error. As explained above, father was not simply denied the ability to testify as to particular facts; he was denied the opportunity to speak directly to the juvenile court at a time when the court had to determine whether it believed that father\u2019s progress in services meant that a petition to terminate his parental rights should not be filed, either because the possibility of reunification within a reasonable time presented a compelling reason for DHS not to file such a petition, or because a permanency plan other than adoption would be more appropriate. Under those circumstances, the assertion by father\u2019s attorney that father wished to participate at the permanency hearing was adequate to establish that he was prejudiced by the denial of that right. And in the circumstances of this case, that offer of proof was sufficient even with respect to the facts to which father might have testified, given that his attorney had no way of knowing that father would not be present at the hearing and, therefore, no reason (or opportunity) to prepare a more detailed offer of proof about father\u2019s participation in prison services or his plans for pursuing services after his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court erred by proceeding with the permanency hearing in father\u2019s absence, over the objection by father\u2019s attorney, and that father was prejudiced by that error. The remedy for that error is reversal of the permanency judgment and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In two other assignments of error, father challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that \u201cthere are no compelling reasons that would justify continuing the current plan of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>reunification or otherwise not proving the plan of adoption\u201d and its decision to change the permanency plan to adoption. Because the permanency judgment must be reversed because of the denial of father\u2019s right to participate in the permanency hearing, we do not reach those assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\"> Mother supports the change in the permanency plan and is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-11\"> ORS 419B.875 expressly applies to jurisdictional hearings under ORS 419B.100 and termination hearings under ORS 419B.500. DHS does not contend that the rights enumerated in ORS 419B.875(2) do not also apply to permanency hearings. Accordingly, we assume, without deciding, that those rights do apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\"> DHS has not argued that father waived his right to participate in the hearing; consequently, we need not address what conduct by a parent might amount to a waiver of that right.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
