The state argues that the post-conviction court erroneously concluded that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to testimony regarding \u201ctreatment recommendations\u201d rendered his performance constitutionally inadequate. Further, the state argues that, in any event, petitioner failed to establish that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the testimony prejudiced petitioner. We agree with the state that the post-conviction court erred and, accordingly, reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We state the facts consistently with the findings of the post-conviction court, which are binding on us if there is evidence to support them. <em>Derschon v. Belleque, </em>252 Or App 465, 466, 287 P3d 1189 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 208 (2013). At the time that the abuse underlying petitioner\u2019s convictions came to light, petitioner shared physical custody of his two children, seven-year-old C and her older sibling, N, with their mother, petitioner\u2019s ex-wife. The dissolution of petitioner and his ex-wife\u2019s marriage had been contentious, and petitioner\u2019s relationship with his ex-wife, who had primary custody of both children, was strained. While driving the children to his ex-wife\u2019s house at the conclusion of a visit, petitioner became upset when one of the children expressed a desire not to live with petitioner. During the outburst that followed, petitioner threatened to kill his ex-wife and punched the rearview mirror of his car, breaking it and cutting his hand. Petitioner\u2019s conduct upset the children, and, when they arrived at their mother\u2019s house, the children told her and their stepfather what petitioner had said and done.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Thereafter, petitioner\u2019s ex-wife contacted Haines, an officer in the Portland Police Bureau\u2019s Domestic Violence Reduction Unit. Haines conducted a series of individual interviews with petitioner\u2019s ex-wife and the children, and, although initially focused on petitioner\u2019s threatening behavior, the interviews revealed that petitioner had engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>unconventional conduct around the children. Specifically, petitioner\u2019s ex-wife said that petitioner chose to be nude in his home in front of the children and that he sometimes \u201ccuddled\u201d with C while nude. C confirmed petitioner\u2019s behavior and also indicated that petitioner had touched her vaginal area. That prompted Haines to stop the interview, consult with a detective from the bureau\u2019s Child Abuse Team, and schedule a sexual-abuse evaluation for C with CARES Northwest, a child-abuse-assessment center.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">At CARES, C underwent a medical examination, performed by a staff physician, Dr. Bays, and an interview with Findley, a staff social worker and interviewer. During the interview with Findley, C again disclosed that petitioner had cuddled with her while he was nude and that, while cuddling, petitioner had touched her chest and vaginal area. She also said that she had felt petitioner\u2019s erect penis on her leg. After the evaluation, Bays and Findley prepared a report containing multiple treatment recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">During an interview with a detective regarding his conduct with C, petitioner fully admitted that he was often nude in his home in front of the children. He also acknowledged that he sometimes \u201ccuddled\u201d with and \u201ccaressed\u201d C while he was nude. Notwithstanding those admissions, petitioner adamantly denied touching C in any sexual way, although he conceded that he may have inadvertently touched C\u2019s vaginal area.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">A grand jury subsequently indicted petitioner on eight counts of first-degree sexual abuse and two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor. Petitioner pleaded not guilty and proceeded to a jury trial. At trial, as pertinent to this appeal, the state called Findley, who offered the following testimony about the CARES treatment recommendations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">\u201cWe recommended [C] not to have any direct contact with [petitioner] at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">\u201cWe also recommended that [petitioner] have a full psychological evaluation with attention paid to anger management and a sex offender evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">* \u2021 \u2021 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u201cWe recommended further investigation by *** law enforcement into the allegations of abuse. We also recommended [for the] need to evaluate [the] safety of [N] who has had ongoing contact with [petitioner].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not object to that portion of Findley\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The jury found petitioner guilty of four counts of first-degree sexual abuse and both counts of endangering the welfare of a minor. Petitioner appealed, and we affirmed his convictions. <em>State v. Logan, </em>203 Or App 639,129 P3d 281, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 359 (2006). He then sought post-conviction relief, alleging 58 claims of inadequate assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">At issue on appeal is petitioner\u2019s claim that trial counsel performed inadequately by failing to object to Findley\u2019s testimony about the CARES treatment recommendations. Specifically, identifying the excerpts of Findley\u2019s testimony set out above, petitioner alleged that those recommendations \u201cleft [the jury] with the impression that [C\u2019s] allegations must be true,\u201d because \u201ca professional was making recommendations which supported that finding.\u201d Apparently due to the number of claims raised by petitioner, Findley\u2019s testimony about the CARES treatment recommendations received little attention from petitioner or the state at the post-conviction hearing, and neither party addressed it in the party\u2019s trial memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The state did present an affidavit in which petitioner\u2019s trial counsel responded to petitioner\u2019s allegations. Although the affidavit did not directly address the CARES treatment recommendations, it explained trial counsel\u2019s general approach to evidentiary objections at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">\u201cAs a criminal defense lawyer, although there was always a balance to be maintained so that jurors would not perceive that I was disinterested or uninvested in my clients\u2019 innocence, my general approach and belief about objections at jury trials was conservative. I believed, and continue to believe, that jurors often particularly suspect that a criminal defense lawyer making constant objections, whether upheld or not, is trying to keep information from them, and that promoting this sort of feeling can lead them to link their own distaste for such methods to defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cBased on this general belief, I did not object whenever possible, but only when I was confident that there was an evidentiary violation <em>and </em>that it would be harmful and important in the context of my overall trial strategy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">(Emphasis in original.) Trial counsel explained, both in his affidavit and through testimony at the post-conviction hearing, that his trial strategy had been to portray petitioner as an individual who exercised poor judgment and to suggest that, in light of the contentious nature of petitioner\u2019s relationship with his ex-wife, C may have misperceived or been motivated to distort petitioner\u2019s unconventional, but innocent, behavior toward her.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The only discussion of trial counsel\u2019s conduct regarding the CARES treatment recommendations at the post-conviction hearing occurred during the examination of Cohen, a defense attorney whom petitioner had called as an expert witness. When asked whether he found fault in trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of the treatment recommendations, Cohen answered, \u201cyes,\u201d but explained that he had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d as to the nature of the fault. After acknowledging that \u201cthe rules are different for CARES\u201d and that \u201cthe case law in Oregon! is] pretty broad [in] allowing [CARES testimony] to come in,\u201d the expert explained that he thought that \u201cyou still have to make your record.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cohen then opined that the testimony could have been impeached through a defense witness; that counsel should have objected to it on the basis that Findley \u201clack[ed] the specific expertise\u201d to make recommendations regarding petitioner and petitioner\u2019s other child, neither of whom Findley had met; and that the treatment recommendations were ultimately \u201canother way *** of backing up [C\u2019s] allegation [s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>At the close of the post-conviction hearing, petitioner and the state each submitted written closing arguments. Petitioner addressed the CARES treatment recommendations in his written closing arguments, but only to restate the basic allegation in his post-conviction petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state did not address the treatment recommendations directly. The post-conviction court subsequently issued a written order that, after rejecting each of petitioner\u2019s other claims, granted petitioner a new trial on the ground that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the CARES treatment recommendations amounted to constitutionally deficient assistance of counsel under both the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">In doing so, the post-conviction court reasoned, among other things, that the testimony about the CARES treatment recommendations went \u201cbeyond relaying [C\u2019s] statements or even discussing [C\u2019s] consistency in making the statements and into recommendations for treatment as if [C\u2019s] statements were true.\u201d It also reasoned that, \u201c[w]hile not a direct comment on honesty, [the recommendation that petitioner be evaluated] amounts to an indirect comment on credibility from an expert in the field of child sexual abuse investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The post-conviction court then went on to determine whether trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Findley\u2019s testimony regarding the treatment recommendations had prejudiced petitioner. Focusing solely on the vouching aspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>of Findley\u2019s testimony \u2014 that is, that it constituted an impermissible comment on C\u2019s credibility \u2014 the post-conviction court concluded that it had. After examining existing case law, the court noted that Findley\u2019s testimony was \u201csimilar to opinion evidence that a victim is diagnosed with [having suffered] sexual abuse\u201d and that, under <em>State v. Wilson, </em>121 Or App 460, 855 P2d 657 (1993), that type of diagnosis did not amount to impermissible vouching. Nevertheless, the court reasoned, Findley\u2019s testimony went \u201cone step further\u201d by recommending that <em>petitioner </em>receive evaluations. According to the post-conviction court, that extra step \u201cencroache[d] into an area where the jury\u2019s discretion bee [ame] supplanted.\u201d On that basis, the post-conviction court granted petitioner a new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state filed written objections to the post-conviction court\u2019s order, which were denied. A judgment granting petitioner post-conviction relief followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The state contends on appeal that, at the time of petitioner\u2019s trial, a reasonable trial attorney could have concluded that an objection to Findley\u2019s testimony about the CARES treatment recommendations would have failed under <em>Wilson </em>and, hence, was not an appropriate objection to make. Second, it contends that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to object to that portion of Findley\u2019s testimony was strategic and supported trial counsel\u2019s defense strategy. Finally, it contends that counsel\u2019s failure to object to admission of the treatment recommendations did not prejudice petitioner because the evidence was admissible under <em>Wilson. </em>Petitioner responds that the treatment recommendations were inadmissible notwithstanding <em>Wilson </em>because they amounted to a comment on the credibility of petitioner, not merely C.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>A claim of inadequate assistance of counsel under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution requires a petitioner to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, (1) that trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment and (2) that the petitioner suffered prejudice as a result \u2014 that is, that trial counsel\u2019s failure had a tendency to affect the result of the prosecution. <em>Hayward v. Belleque, </em>248 Or App 141, 147-48, 273 P3d 926 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 208 (2013) (citing <em>Trujillo v. Maass, </em>312 Or 431, 435, 822 P2d 703 (1991)). Under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a petitioner must make a functionally equivalent showing. <em>Montez v. Czerniak, </em>237 Or App 276, 278 n 1, 239 P3d 1023 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 571 (2011). Specifically, the petitioner must show that trial counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and that there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 US 668, 688, 694, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Because we conclude it to be dispositive, we turn to the issue of prejudice. Whether a petitioner has demonstrated prejudice is a legal question that may depend on the post-conviction court\u2019s findings. <em>Wyatt v. Czerniak, </em>223 Or App 307, 311, 195 P3d 912 (2008). We thus review the post-conviction court\u2019s ruling on prejudice for legal error and for whether the facts found by the post-conviction court are supported by the record. <em>Derschon, </em>252 Or App at 466. We are bound by the post-conviction court\u2019s findings if there is evidence in the record to support them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">To establish prejudice on a claim based on a trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of evidence, a petitioner must establish that the objection would have been well taken when the criminal case was tried. <em>Hayward, </em>248 Or App at 150 (citing <em>Peiffer v. Hoyt, </em>339 Or 649, 660, 125 P3d 734 (2005)). The petitioner must then establish that, given the totality of the circumstances, the admission of the objectionable evidence had a tendency to affect the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Cunningham v. Thompson, </em>188 Or App 289, 296, 71 P3d 110 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 327 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>With those standards in mind, we turn to the law in effect at the time of petitioner\u2019s criminal trial in 2001. At that time, the Oregon Supreme Court had repeatedly made it clear that, \u2018\u201cin Oregon, a witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes [another] witness is telling the truth.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 284, 844 P2d 195 (1993) (quoting <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 438, 657 P2d 1215 (1983)); <em>see </em>also, <em>e.g., State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 629-30, 756 P2d 620 (1988) (same); <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 444, 687 P2d 751 (1984) (same). However, those cases did not stand for the proposition that <em>all </em>evidence tending to bolster the credibility of a witness is inadmissible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The Oregon Supreme Court articulated in <em>Middleton </em>the distinction between inadmissible vouching as to the credibility of a witness and admissible evidence that merely tends to bolster the credibility of a witness. There, the defendant was convicted of the first-degree rape of his 14-year-old daughter. After describing the rape consistently on a number of occasions, the child recanted her allegations in a written statement. At trial, the child testified that the defendant had raped her, and the defendant impeached her testimony with her written recantation. Later in the trial, over the defendant\u2019s objections, two social workers who worked with sexually abused children testified that the child\u2019s behavior was consistent with typical reactions of child victims of intrafamilial sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">On review, the Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence amounted to an impermissible comment on the child\u2019s credibility. The Supreme Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">\u201cDefendant contends that the evidence given by the experts here was a direct effort to support the credibility of the complaining witness. It is true that[,] if the jurors believed the experts\u2019 testimony, they would be more likely to believe the victim\u2019s account. Neither of the experts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>directly expressed an opinion on the truth of the victim\u2019s testimony. Much expert testimony will tend to show that another witness either is or is not telling the truth. This, by itself, will not render evidence inadmissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><em>Middleton, </em>294 Or at 435 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Thus, as conceived in <em>Middleton, </em>the issue reduced to whether the testimony at issue \u201cdirectly expressed an opinion on the truth\u201d of another witness\u2019s statement or merely \u201ctend[ed] to show that another witness either is or is not telling the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, a witness\u2019s opinion on the truth of another witness\u2019s statement need not be explicit in order to be direct. Hence, whether a statement falls into the former category or the latter is not always obvious. But an examination of the court\u2019s treatment of the issue in two subsequent cases, <em>Milbradt </em>and <em>Keller, </em>and of our application of that line of cases in <em>Wilson, </em>helps clarify the distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In <em>Milbradt, </em>the defendant was convicted of a number of sexual offenses against two young women who had cognitive impairments. On review, the Supreme Court concluded that a psychologist\u2019s testimony \u2014 specifically that he saw no evidence of deception on the part of the victims and that what the victims had reported represented their experiences \u2014 constituted improper vouching. Quoting <em>Middleton, </em>the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">\u201c\u2018We expressly hold that in Oregon a witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth.\u2019 An opinion that a person is not deceptive, could not lie without being tripped up, and would not betray a friend (to wit: the defendant) is tantamount to the same thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">305 Or at 629-30 (quoting <em>Middleton, </em>294 Or at 438).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Similarly, in <em>Keller, </em>a case involving first-degree sexual abuse of a five-year-old child, the court dealt with expert testimony from a CARES doctor about the child\u2019s CARES evaluation. After citing both <em>Middleton </em>and <em>Milbradt, </em>the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">\u201cDr. Bays testified on direct examination during the state\u2019s case-in-chief that \u2018[tjhere was no evidence of leading or coaching or fantasizing\u2019 during the child\u2019s interview at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>C.A.R.E.S. and that, in that interview, the child was \u2018obviously telling you about what happened to her body.\u2019 Each of those statements amounts to testimony that the child was credible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Keller, 315 Or at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In <em>Wilson, </em>we applied that line of cases to a CARES diagnosis of sexual abuse. There, a child reported that the defendant had repeatedly sexually abused her. The child was taken to CARES for a sexual-abuse evaluation. After reviewing an interview with the child and conducting a medical examination, which revealed no physical evidence of abuse, Dr. Bays diagnosed the child with having been sexually abused. The defendant objected to the admission of Bays\u2019s diagnosis, on the grounds that \u201cany comment on an alleged diagnosis * * * would be a direct comment with regards to the credibility of the [child.]\u201d 121 Or App at 462. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">On appeal, the defendant argued that \u201cBays\u2019 diagnosis of the child should have been excluded, because the jury could have inferred from that diagnosis that Bays believed the child\u2019s statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465. After discussing <em>Middleton </em>and <em>Keller, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument. We first distinguished <em>Keller </em>on the basis that Bays had not testified that the child \u201chad not been coached or led and had not fantasized the incident\u201d \u2014 that is, she had not directly commented on the credibility of the child. <em>Id. </em>We then concluded that the diagnosis was admissible, even though it tended to indicate that the child was telling the truth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cBays testified that, on the basis of her evaluation of the child\u2019s interview, physical examination andhistory, she diagnosed the child as having been sexually abused. <em>Although, if believed,, Bays\u2019 testimony supported the child\u2019s testimony, that does not render it a direct comment on the child\u2019s credibility. It was an opinion as to the proper medical diagnosis. </em>A medical doctor is not precluded from testifying as to her medical diagnosis simply because the jury may infer from that testimony that another witness is or is not telling the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-9\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>From those cases, we glean that, under <em>Wilson, </em>the dispositive question at the time of petitioner\u2019s criminal trial was whether Findley\u2019s testimony about the treatment recommendations was directed, either expressly or implicitly, at the credibility of C \u2014 or of any other witness \u2014 or whether it simply allowed an inference in support of C\u2019s testimony. With that in mind, we return to the merits, under <em>Wilson, </em>of an objection to Findley\u2019s testimony about the CARES treatment recommendations as an impermissible comment on the credibility of C. As noted, the post-conviction court acknowledged the similarity between the treatment recommendations at issue here and the diagnosis of sexual abuse in <em>Wilson. </em>It also acknowledged that, given <em>Wilson, </em>\u201cthe fact that [Findley\u2019s] testimony, if believed, supports the credibility of [C\u2019s] statements does not amount to a direct comment on credibility.\u201d We agree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">As noted, petitioner challenged Findley\u2019s testimony about three treatment recommendations: that C have no contact with petitioner, that petitioner receive a psychological and a sexual-offender evaluation, and that N\u2019s safety be evaluated in light of her ongoing contact with petitioner. Unlike the testimony in <em>Milbradt </em>and <em>Keller, </em>Findley\u2019s testimony did not implicate C\u2019s capacity for lying; it did not identify any evidence of leading or coaching on the part of C \u2014 or the lack thereof; and it offered no opinion on whether C was obviously testifying about what had happened to her body. Thus, under <em>Wilson, </em>it was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Of course, like the testimony in <em>Wilson, </em>Findley\u2019s testimony would allow the jury to draw inferences in support of C\u2019s credibility. Regarding the first and second recommendations \u2014 that C have no contact with petitioner and that petitioner undergo evaluations \u2014 the jury could infer that, at the time of Findley\u2019s initial interview with C, he found her allegation that petitioner had abused her to be credible enough to warrant that C have no further contact with petitioner pending further investigation of petitioner. And the post-conviction court relied on that aspect of Findley\u2019s testimony in concluding that petitioner had suffered prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>In doing so, the post-conviction court characterized Findley\u2019s testimony as going \u201cone step further\u201d by recommending that petitioner be evaluated. Petitioner makes a similar argument on appeal, contending that Findley\u2019s testimony about the treatment recommendations would have been impermissible under <em>Wilson </em>because \u201cit was not simply a \u2018diagnosis\u2019 of abuse suffered by a victim, but was a \u2018diagnosis\u2019 of the defendant being an abuser,\u201d and as such was a comment on the credibility of <em>both </em>C and petitioner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The state argues in response that the treatment recommendations were \u201cmore innocuous\u201d and, therefore, fell short of the \u201cfull-blown medical diagnosis\u201d of sexual abuse approved in <em>Wilson. </em>However, whether or not Findley\u2019s testimony went further \u2014 or was more innocuous \u2014 than the diagnosis in <em>Wilson, </em>the pertinent inquiry is whether the difference between the two rendered the treatment recommendations \u201ca direct comment on *** credibility\u201d as that phrase was used in <em>Wilson. </em>It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Although the post-conviction court did not rely on the third treatment <em>recommendation- </em>\u2014 viz., that N\u2019s safety be evaluated \u2014 in determining prejudice, we conclude that it, too, was admissible under <em>Wilson. </em>We acknowledge that that part of Findley\u2019s testimony could inferentially support C\u2019s testimony in at least two ways. First, it would allow the jury to infer that Findley believed that petitioner\u2019s temper posed a threat to N\u2019s safety. On that point, the jury had heard evidence of the contentious nature of petitioner\u2019s divorce and petitioner\u2019s violent outburst while driving the children to his ex-wife\u2019s house. Second, it would allow the jury to infer that Findley believed C when she said that petitioner had engaged in abusive conduct toward N. However, under <em>Wilson, </em>the fact that Findley\u2019s testimony allowed for those inferences did not render it an impermissible comment on C\u2019s credibility, and, accordingly, any objection to it would have failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>For those reasons, we conclude that petitioner failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Findley\u2019s testimony about the CARES treatment recommendations prejudiced petitioner. It follows that the post-conviction court erred in granting relief to petitioner on the ground that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Reversed on appeal; affirmed on cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> Petitioner filed a cross-appeal, raising four assignments of error. We reject those assignments without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\"> In explaining that \u201cthe rules are different for CARES,\u201d Cohen referred back to his answer to an earlier question. Asked to explain his use of the term \u201cvouching statements,\u201d Cohen had testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\u201cYou\u2019re talking about two categories. You\u2019re talking about case law authorized vouching, which is not what we call it, * * * which is what happens when CARES comes in because they are a medical facility and says we diagnosed that this child was sexually abused by the defendant. That is not considered vouching, * * * even though I respectfully disagree * * *. However, any other form of vouching is verboten.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Notably, the post-conviction hearing \u2014 and, thus, Cohen\u2019s testimony \u2014 occurred before the Oregon Supreme Court decided <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), which dealt with the admissibility of expert evidence in sexual-abuse cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\"> The entirety of petitioner\u2019s closing argument about the treatment recommendations was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">\u201cTrial [counsel also] failed to object to the CARES social worker recommending that Petitioner\u2019s other child be evaluated for safety concerns [as well] as recommending that Petitioner have an anger control assessment. By making those recommendations, the jury was left with the impression that the allegations must be true since a professional was making recommendations which supported that finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\"> The post-conviction court also reasoned that trial counsel should have objected under OEC 401, OEC 403, and OEC 404 to Findley\u2019s testimony about the treatment recommendation regarding N\u2019s safety, on the basis that that part of Findley\u2019s testimony was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. Despite that conclusion, both the state and petitioner frame the issue on appeal to be whether Findley\u2019s testimony about N was inadmissible as an improper comment on C\u2019s or petitioner\u2019s credibility \u2014 which was the post-conviction court\u2019s focus when it concluded that petitioner had suffered prejudice as a result of the admission of Findley\u2019s testimony. As it is, notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to defend the trial court\u2019s ruling, we conclude that any objection under OEC 401, OEC 403, or OEC 404 to Findley\u2019s testimony about the treatment recommendation regarding N\u2019s safety would have failed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b348-5\"> In reaching its conclusion, the post-conviction court also considered <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), which had been decided roughly one month before the entry of the post-conviction court\u2019s order. Under <em>Southard, </em>the post-conviction court noted, \u201cthe diagnosis and treatment would be inadmissible.\u201d However, although <em>Southard </em>was decided before the post-conviction court entered its order, it postdated plaintiff\u2019s trial by nearly eight years. As the state points out, because trial counsel\u2019s performance is to be viewed as of the time of trial, we have held that a failure to anticipate <em>Southard\u2019s </em>holding does not render representation constitutionally inadequate. <em>Umberger v. Czerniah, </em>232 Or App 563, 565, 222 P3d 751 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 13 (2010) (\u201cTo render assistance that is constitutionally adequate, trial counsel need not be clairvoyant.\u201d). To the extent that the post-conviction court relied on <em>Southard </em>in concluding that trial counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient, it erred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> The Supreme Court further examined the issue of vouching evidence in the context of CARES testimony in 2010 in <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 234 P3d 117 (2010). However, because our analysis is limited to the law in effect at the time of petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, we do not consider the effect of <em>Lupoli </em>on the admissibility of the evidence in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b354-5\"> By their terms, Findley\u2019s treatment recommendations were a \u201cdiagnosis\u201d of neither C nor of petitioner. Petitioner\u2019s characterization of Findley\u2019s testimony as a \u2018\u201cdiagnosis\u2019 of the defendant being an abuser\u201d calls to mind the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Sanchez-Alfonso, </em>352 Or 790, 801-02, 293 P3d 1011 (2012) (no basis under OEC 702 for admission of CARES report that \u201c[the victim] was physically abused by [the defendant]\u201d). Here, however, petitioner raised no claim alleging that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the treatment recommendations on the ground that they violated OEC 702.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
