The trial court revoked that probation in 2011 based on defendant\u2019s conviction on new criminal charges in Marion County. Those convictions are the subject of defendant\u2019s appeal in <em>State v. Steltz (A149320), </em>259 Or App 212, 313 P3d 312 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Here, defendant argues that, if we vacate his 2011 convictions from Marion County, we \u201cshould also vacate the judgment of revocation in this case\u201d and remand for reconsideration. In <em>Steltz, </em>we did not vacate defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial, as he had urged. Instead, we accepted only one of defendant\u2019s arguments \u2014 that the Marion County court erred by failing to merge some of his convictions into others. Accordingly, we reversed and remanded with instructions that the court merge certain convictions. Defendant does not argue that merger of some of the Marion County convictions, standing alone, would entitle him to reconsideration of the probation-revocation decision in this case. Rather, his argument in this case is pinned solely on his hope that we would vacate all of his Marion County convictions in <em>Steltz. </em>Because defendant did not obtain that result in <em>Steltz, </em>his appeal in this case presents no basis for reversal of the order revoking his probation on his 2004 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
