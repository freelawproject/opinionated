After observing a crack in defendant\u2019s windshield, a sheriffs deputy stopped defendant\u2019s pickup truck and, in the course of the stop, discovered that defendant\u2019s license was suspended. Defendant contends that the officer lacked objective probable cause to believe that the windshield crack placed defendant in violation of either ORS 815.020 or ORS 815.270. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The facts are not in dispute. Jackson County Sheriffs Deputy McKay was traveling north when he saw a pickup truck turn south onto the same road; he observed that the pickup truck\u2019s windshield was cracked. The only description of the crack that appears in the record was provided at the motion to suppress hearing during the state\u2019s direct examination of McKay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">\u201c[MCKAY]: I noticed a large crack going through the windshield of that vehicle and that is why I stopped the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">\u201c[STATE]: And can you describe that crack for us, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">\u201c[MCKAY]: The crack was going from \u2014 stretching from the passenger side across the windshield all the way to the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">\u201c[STATE]: And what part of the windshield was it located, down near the wipers or up towards the ceiling of the cab?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">\u201c[MCKAY]: It was more up. It was more in the area to where it could have, I guess, impeded the vision of the driver. So it would have been kind of in the eyesight area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">\u201c[STATE]: And was any portion of that a spiderweb crack?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">\u201c [MCKAY]: It was off to the passenger side, so off to the right of the driver there was some spiderwebbing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u201c[STATE]: Okay. And then the line goes all the way across from the passenger side to the driver\u2019s side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">\u201c[MCKAY]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">\u201c[STATE]: And it\u2019s basically a level line all the way across maintaining at that somewhere in the eye level area the whole way across?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">\u201c[MCKAY]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">\u201c[STATE]: Depending on the height of the driver, obviously?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">\u201c[MCKAY]: Yeah, exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">\u201c[STATE]: Now, did you feel like that violated any statutes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">\u201c[MCKAY]: Yes. I believe that would be operating an unsafe vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">\u201c[STATE]: And what about a crack would make it an unsafe driving situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-12\">\u201c[MCKAY]: Well, there\u2019s *** numerous things that I believe makes it unsafe. For one, you have a crack going roughly through the eyesight of a driver. So he\u2019s not only focusing down the road from what he\u2019s looking at, he also has something in his vision that is gonna be \u2014 his eye is gonna be focusing on somewhat. So he\u2019s kind of looking back and forth. In addition to [that] you have spiderwebbing off to the right so if he\u2019s looking to the right clearing for a turn or if he\u2019s looking at oncoming traffic coming from the right, that\u2019s gonna be in the way of his vision as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">McKay went on to explain that he was concerned that light could potentially refract off the crack into the passenger compartment of the vehicle. He was also concerned that the crack had compromised the integrity of the windshield so that it would not offer the same protection as an uncracked windshield in the event that an object struck it.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">As noted, McKay stopped defendant because of the cracked windshield. During the course of that stop, McKay learned that defendant\u2019s license had been suspended. McKay accordingly issued defendant a citation for a violation of ORS 811.182 \u2014 driving while suspended \u2014 and ORS 815.220\u2014 obstruction of vehicle windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Defendant filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the traffic stop, contending that McKay lacked probable cause to believe that he had committed a traffic violation and that suppression was therefore required under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">\u201cIn order to stop and detain a person for a traffic violation, an officer must have probable cause to believe that the person has committed a violation. Probable cause has two components. First, at the time of the stop, the officer must subjectively believe that a violation has occurred, and second, that belief must be objectively reasonable under the circumstances. For an officer\u2019s belief to be objectively reasonable, the facts, <em>as the officer perceives them, </em>must actually constitute a violation. Thus, an officer\u2019s belief may be objectively reasonable even if the officer is mistaken as to the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><em>State v. Stookey, </em>255 Or App 489, 491, 297 P3d 548 (2013) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, McKay stated that, although he had cited defendant for driving with an obstructed window under ORS 815.220, he had listed the wrong statute in the citation. Thus, the state made no argument that it was objectively reasonable for McKay to think that defendant\u2019s windshield placed him in violation of ORS 815.220. Instead, the state argued \u2014 as it does in this appeal \u2014 that the facts that McKay perceived constituted a violation of both ORS 815.020 \u2014 operation of an unsafe vehicle \u2014 and ORS 815.270 \u2014 operation of a vehicle that is loaded or equipped to obstruct the driver. <em>See State v. Boatright, </em>222 Or App 406, 410, 193 P3d 78, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 503 (2008) (stating that \u201cprobable cause may be based on a mistake as to <em>which </em>law the defendant violated\u201d and that \u201cin order to satisfy the objective component, the facts that the officer perceives to exist must establish the elements of <em>an </em>offense, even if not the offense that the officer believed the defendant committed\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The trial court denied the motion to suppress. It concluded that the stop was supported by probable cause because the facts that McKay perceived about the windshield made it objectively reasonable for him to conclude that the condition of defendant\u2019s windshield placed him in violation of ORS 815.020. Defendant subsequently pleaded no contest to the charge of driving while suspended pursuant to a plea agreement that preserved, in writing, his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">On appeal, defendant contends that McKay lacked an objectively reasonable basis for stopping him because the facts, as McKay perceived them, did not constitute a violation of either ORS 815.020 or ORS 815.270. Before turning to the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments under those two statutes, we first address the state\u2019s contention that defendant failed to adequately present the trial court with the statutory interpretation argument under ORS 815.020 that he now advances and that it is, consequently, unpreserved for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The Supreme Court has summarized the policies underlying the preservation requirement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201cPreservation gives a trial court the chance to consider and rule on a contention, thereby possibly avoiding an error altogether or correcting one already made, which in turn may obviate the need for an appeal. Preservation also ensures fairness to an opposing party, by permitting the opposing party to respond to a contention and by otherwise not taking the opposing party by surprise. Finally, preservation fosters full development of the record, which aids the trial court in making a decision and the appellate court in reviewing it. Our jurisprudence, thus, has embraced the preservation requirement, not to promote form over substance but to promote an efficient administration of justice and the saving of judicial time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">\u201cPreservation rules are pragmatic as well as prudential. What is required of a party to adequately present a contention to the trial court can vary depending on the nature of the claim or argument; the touchstone in that regard, ultimately, is procedural fairness to the parties and to the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219-20, 191 P3d 637 (2008) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). Thus, to preserve an argument for appeal, \u201ca party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately * * <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The record reveals that defendant adequately preserved his argument under ORS 815.020. The trial court clearly understood that the state was relying on that statute as support for its argument that there was probable cause for the stop; the court explicitly asked defense counsel why the statute did not apply to support probable cause. Defense counsel responded that ORS 815.020 did not apply because the windshield crack was insufficient to render the vehicle unsafe under the statute. That is, at its core, the same issue that defendant raises in this appeal. <em>See State v. Hitz, </em>307 Or 183,188, 766 P2d 373 (1988) (noting the distinction \u201cbetween raising an <em>issue </em>at trial, identifying a <em>source </em>for a claimed position, and making a particular <em>argument\u201d </em>and that \u201c [t]he first ordinarily is essential, the second less so, the third least\u201d (emphasis in original)). Although defendant\u2019s arguments concerning a proper interpretation of ORS 815.020 are undoubtedly more fully articulated in this appeal than they were before the trial court, the policies underlying the preservation requirement were served in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We therefore turn to the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments; in addressing those arguments, we are mindful that it is the state\u2019s burden to establish the lawfulness of a war-rantless traffic stop. <em>E.g., State v. Ordner, </em>252 Or App 444, 447, 287 P3d 1256 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 280 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The unsafe vehicle statute, ORS 815.020, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of operation of an unsafe vehicle if the person does any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201c(a) Drives or moves on any highway any vehicle which is in such unsafe condition as to endanger any person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u201c(b) Owns a vehicle and causes or knowingly permits the vehicle to be driven or moved on any highway when the vehicle is in such unsafe condition as to endanger any person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">We recently addressed the proper application of ORS 815.020 in <em>Stookey, </em>255 Or App 489, a case with facts similar to those presented here. There, the defendant was stopped for driving a vehicle with a single horizontal crack in its windshield. The trooper who made the stop asserted that the crack was at the defendant\u2019s eyesight level and that he believed that the crack could be distracting and dangerous. <em>Id. </em>at 492. The state argued that the trooper had objective probable cause to believe that the crack established a violation of ORS 815.020 for two reasons. First, the state contended that the crack was \u201cin such unsafe condition as to endanger any person\u201d because the crack would have interfered with the defendant\u2019s line of sight. The defendant responded that the statute requires not just that the windshield crack pose some heightened risk of harm, but that it create a \u201cprobable\u201d risk of harm. We agreed with the defendant, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u201cIt is not enough that defendant\u2019s cracked windshield caused some minimally higher risk of harm by creating the possibility of interference with defendant\u2019s vision and, thus, negligibly increasing the risk of a collision. Rather, the interference had to be such that it exposed someone to a danger <em>ofprobable </em>harm or loss. On the record before us, we cannot say that the trooper could have objectively believed that the single crack would expose defendant or another person to a danger of <em>probable </em>harm or loss by interfering with defendant\u2019s vision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 499 (emphasis in original). Second, the state argued that it would be objectively reasonable for the trooper to believe that the defendant was committing a traffic violation because the crack compromised the physical integrity of the windshield, such that it was more likely to shatter in the event of a hail storm or other similar circumstance. <em>Id. </em>at 499-500. We rejected that argument for the same reason that we did the first:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u201cFor purposes of that theory, the only relevant fact from the trooper\u2019s testimony is that he saw a single crack. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>trooper did not testify that he saw a \u2018spiderweb\u2019 of cracks, or that the single crack was unusually deep. It would not be objectively reasonable to believe that, due to a single crack, a windshield was in such a dangerous condition that it was <em>probable </em>that it would inflict harm or loss upon a person, especially given that, at least as the state and trial court theorized, the risk from the windshield had to be triggered by an event such as a hail storm, flying rock, or collision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 500 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">As noted, defendant contends that there is insufficient evidence from which to conclude that the state of his windshield, as perceived by McKay, posed a probable risk of harm or loss. The state attempts to distinguish <em>Stookey </em>from the present case by pointing out that McKay not only observed a \u201clarge\u201d crack, but that he also saw \u201csome spider-webbing\u201d in the crack \u201coff to the right of the driver.\u201d The state also emphasizes McKay\u2019s testimony that the spider-webbing was positioned so that it was \u201c[going to] be in the way of [defendant\u2019s] vision\u201d if defendant was looking to the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The difficulty for the state\u2019s position is that there is insufficient evidence about the nature of the crack to conclude that McKay\u2019s observations made it objectively reasonable to believe that the windshield created the <em>probable </em>risk of harm or loss necessary to establish a violation of ORS 815.020. \u201c[W]hether a windshield crack poses a danger depends on the characteristics of the crack.\u201d <em>Stookey, </em>255 Or App at 499. The only information adduced about the crack at the motion to suppress hearing that distinguished this crack from the one in <em>Stookey </em>was that there was \u201csome spiderwebbing\u201d of the crack. The only indication about the spiderwebbing\u2019s location was the minimally informative statement that it was on the passenger\u2019s side \u201coff to the right of the driver\u201d such that it would \u201cbe in the way of [defendant\u2019s] vision\u201d if defendant was looking to the right, and even that statement was made only in the context of explaining McKay\u2019s belief that the crack would be distracting. There was no evidence whatsoever about the size or extent of the spiderwebbing or about its effect on the opacity of the windshield. Although there may well be instances where a windshield crack interferes with a driver\u2019s vision to the point where driving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>vehicle creates a <em>probable </em>risk of harm or loss, the state has not carried its burden to establish that it was objectively reasonable for McKay to conclude that such was the case here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on the ground that there was probable cause at the time of the stop for McKay to conclude that defendant had violated ORS 815.020.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">As it did before the trial court, the state urges, as an alternative ground upon which to affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress, that McKay had an objectively reasonable belief that the condition of defendant\u2019s windshield established a violation of ORS 815.270(l)(b). ORS 815.270 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle that is loaded or equipped to obstruct the driver if the person is operating a vehicle that is loaded or equipped or where baggage or an encumbrance does any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">\u201c(a) Substantially obstructs the driver\u2019s views to the rear, through one or more mirrors and otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201c(b) Obstructs the driver\u2019s view to the front or sides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">\u201c(c) Interferes with control of the driving mechanism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">\u201c(d) Prevents the free, unhampered operation of the vehicle by the driver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The state argues that the facts that McKay perceived about the windshield crack established a violation of that statute, either because the windshield crack was an \u201cencumbrance\u201d or because the windshield crack rendered defendant\u2019s vehicle \u201cequipped\u201d to obstruct the driver\u2019s view. Defendant responds that the statute is violated only when an extrinsic object is placed on or within a vehicle and that intrinsic conditions of the car do not violate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">No prior case has analyzed whether a windshield crack may suffice to establish a violation of ORS 815.270. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>therefore discern the legislative intent behind the statute by applying the statutory interpretation analysis of <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), and <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). We do so by examining the text of the statute in context and any relevant legislative history. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Because the legislature has not provided a definition of \u201cencumbrance,\u201d we look to the dictionary to assist us in determining the term\u2019s ordinary meaning. The relevant definition of encumbrance provides, \u201c2 : something that encumbers : a burden that impedes action or renders it difficult: IMPEDIMENT * * * \u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>747 (unabridged ed 2002). Although it is conceivable that \u2014 under that definition alone \u2014 a windshield crack may be an impediment that \u201cobstructs the driver\u2019s view,\u201d our task is not finished, for \u201cwe do not simply consult dictionaries and interpret words in a vacuum.\u201d <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 96, 261 P3d 1234 (2011). Accordingly, we look to the context in which the word \u201cencumbrance\u201d appears. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAs a part of context, [a] court considers, among other things, other provisions of the same statute, or other related statutes, <em>prior versions of the statute, </em>and this court\u2019s decisions interpreting the statute.\u201d <em>Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 411, 939 P2d 608 (1997) (emphasis added). The current version of ORS 815.270 was enacted as part of a sweeping 1983 overhaul of Oregon\u2019s motor vehicle laws. Or Laws 1983, ch 338. The legislature explained that the overhaul was not designed to effect substantive changes to the code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cIt is not the purpose or intent of the Oregon Legislative Assembly to change the law by enacting the revision of the Oregon Vehicle Code contained in chapter 338, Oregon Laws 1983. The intent of the assembly is to make the law relating to vehicles easier to use, amend, and understand by simplifying the language, establishing a single set of definitions for the code, eliminating confusing references, eliminating verbiage, eliminating some confusing use of terminology and standardizing the presentation of prohibitions and penalties, all in accordance with existing interpretation and use of the vehicle code, and rearranging existing concepts under the vehicle code in a more logical fashion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 3. We thus look to the prior version of ORS 815.270 for indications of the legislature\u2019s intended definition of \u201cencumbrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The prior version of the unsafe-load statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not provide for a violation when an encumbrance obstructed the driver\u2019s view, but rather only when an encumbrance interfered with control of the vehicle. That version read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201c(1) A driver shall not operate a vehicle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201c(a) Which is loaded or equipped so as to substantially obstruct the driver\u2019s views to the rear, through one or more mirrors and otherwise, or to obstruct the driver\u2019s view to the front or sides or to interfere with control or with the driving mechanism; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">\u201c(b) When a person is in the driver\u2019s lap or in the driver\u2019s embrace, or where baggage or an encumbrance prevents the free unhampered operation of the vehicle by the driver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\"><em>Former </em>ORS 487.625 (1981), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 978.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> What sort of encumbrance did the legislature contemplate as sufficient to prevent the \u201cfree unhampered operation of the vehicle\u201d? The answer is suggested by the other types of items that were identified as sufficient to do so, <em>viz., </em>a person in the driver\u2019s lap or embrace, or baggage. Those items suggest that only an object that was extrinsic to the motor vehicle was sufficient to establish a violation of <em>former </em>ORS 487.625(l)(b). Although the statute may now be violated by an encumbrance that obstructs the driver\u2019s view, nothing in ORS 815.270 suggests that the legislature intended the term \u201cencumbrance\u201d to mean something other than an item that is extrinsic to the vehicle. We thus conclude that an encumbrance, for purposes of ORS 815.270, is an item that is extrinsic to the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>It remains to determine whether a vehicle with a cracked windshield is, or may be, \u201cequipped\u201d so as to obstruct the driver. ORS 815.270(l)(b). The relevant definition of \u201cequipped\u201d states: \u201cTo provide with what is necessary, useful, or appropriate: as a (1) : to supply with material resources (as implements or facilities): to fit out * * * b : to make ready or competent for service or action or against a need ***.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 768. Although that definition of \u201cequipped\u201d suggests that affixed vehicle parts or components may violate the statute, we do not perceive, in the legislature\u2019s use of that word in context, the intent to broadly depart from the other ways in which the statute may be violated. The term \u201cbaggage\u201d plainly implies items that are extrinsic to the vehicle. The relevant definition of \u201cload\u201d provides: \u201c1 a : to put a load in or on (a means of conveyance).\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1325. Thus, the statute is violated by certain loads or baggage or encumbrances, <em>i.e., extrinsic </em>objects; it would be incongruous if the legislature intended to establish a violation for an <em>intrinsic condition </em>of the vehicle, such as a cracked windshield, in the same section.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our conclusion on that point is reinforced by the fact that a violation of ORS 815.270 is a Class C traffic infraction, whereas a violation of the obstructed window statute is a Class D infraction. As we pointed out in <em>Stookey, </em>the legislature</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">\u201capparently considered the harm posed by a driver\u2019s decreased ability to see the road through the windshield, and it classified a condition \u2014 an obstructed window\u2014 posing that type of harm as a Class D violation. Thus, it would be incongruous for a similar condition \u2014 a cracked windshield \u2014 posing a similar type of harm to constitute a [different class of] violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>Stookey, </em>255 Or App at 498. The legislature also apparently considered the harm posed by baggage or loads that obstruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>a driver\u2019s view and chose to classify that harm as a Class C violation. Read as a whole and in context, ORS 815.270 does not demonstrate the legislative intent that an intrinsic condition of a vehicle could violate that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The only prior appellate opinion that has addressed ORS 815.270 is consistent with that understanding. In <em>State v. Zigler, </em>100 Or App 700, 788 P2d 484 (1990), the police received a tip that a man was loading a drug lab into a car. An officer responded and observed the defendant driving the car; the officer stated that \u201cthe trunk was open, obscuring the vision of the driver\u201d and that there were items \u201cpiled up in the back seat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702 (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets omitted). We concluded that the officer had probable cause to stop the defendant when he observed a traffic offense, and we cited \u2014 without further explanation\u2014 ORS 815.270 as the offense committed. The state argues that <em>Zigler </em>supports its position that the unsafe-load statute can be violated by a motor vehicle\u2019s intrinsic <em>condition </em>\u2014 viz., the open trunk. An examination of the defendant\u2019s brief in that case reveals, however, that the officer who conducted the traffic stop perceived that the trunk lid was propped open by items that the defendant had loaded into the trunk.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, the officer who stopped the defendant stated that he could see, from his position behind the defendant\u2019s car, several items, such as \u201cpapers,\u201d sticking up over the trunk lid in the back seat, a fact that we noted in the opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 702. In other words, extrinsic items were obstructing the defendant\u2019s vision over the trunk lid, which was itself apparently open because of a load in the trunk of the car. <em>Zigler </em>thus does not stand for the proposition that an intrinsic characteristic of the vehicle may violate ORS 815.270. Given the foregoing, we conclude that McKay lacked objective probable cause to believe that the condition of defendant\u2019s windshield established a violation of ORS 815.270.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Having concluded that the stop of defendant was unsupported by probable cause, we turn to whether suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>of the evidence obtained from the stop is required. Evidence that is the product of an unlawful stop is properly suppressed only if the defendant establishes a \u201cminimal factual nexus \u2014 that is, at minimum, the existence of a \u2018but for\u2019 relationship \u2014 between the evidence sought to be suppressed and prior unlawful police conduct ***.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 25, 115 P3d 908 (2005). If the defendant establishes that there is a minimal factual nexus, the burden shifts to the state to show that \u201cthe evidence did not derive from the preceding illegality.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">The state argues that there is no minimal factual nexus because the state already knew the status of defendant\u2019s license \u2014 by virtue of its license database \u2014 before the traffic stop. That argument is foreclosed for the reasons explained in <em>Stookey, </em>255 Or App at 495 n 4 (citing <em>State v. Backstrand, </em>231 Or App 621, 629, 220 P3d 748 (2009), <em>rev allowed, </em>350 Or 130 (2011)). The state does not argue that the evidence did not derive from the preceding illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\"> Defendant also contended that the stop was unlawful under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In this appeal, defendant cites only Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution as a basis for reversing the trial court. We therefore confine our opinion to questions of Oregon law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-12\"> We reach a similar conclusion with respect to McKay\u2019s additional stated concern that the windshield would more easily shatter in the event that an object struck it. As was the case in <em>Stookey, </em>the record is insufficient to conclude that the windshield\u2019s integrity gave rise to a probable risk of harm or loss under ORS 815.020, especially given that the hypothesized danger, an object shattering the windshield on impact, was a contingent possibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\"> In interpreting a statute, we draw no conclusions from the title of the offense described. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 2 (\u201cThe names given offenses in the vehicle code do not establish or limit the elements of the offense described but are merely for the convenience of the readers [of the code] * * *.\u201d). Additionally, the boldface title of the section does not inform our understanding of the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>See </em>ORS 174.540; <em>Church v. Grant County, </em>187 Or App 518, 526 n 4, 69 P3d 759 (2003) (\u201cIn the context of statutory construction, a statute\u2019s caption is of no legal significance.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b480-10\"> No prior appellate decision addressed <em>former </em>ORS 487.625.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\"> On that point, we are also convinced by the fact that the motor vehicle code contains extensive, specific, and detailed provisions that create violations for certain intrinsic vehicle components. <em>See </em>ORS 815.140 - 815.175 (tire requirements); ORS 815.180 - 815.190 (mudguard and fender requirements); ORS 815.195 - 815.205 (emission standards); ORS 815.210 - 815.222 (windows); ORS 815.225 - 815.230 (horns); ORS 815.235 - 815.237 (mirrors); ORS 815.245 (ground clearance requirement); ORS 815.250 (exhaust system); ORS 815.255 (speedometer). If the legislature intended for certain intrinsic vehicle conditions to constitute a traffic violation, one would naturally expect the legislature to articulate those conditions in the appropriate place in the statutory scheme rather than a section that addresses unsafe loads and baggage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\"> According to the defendant\u2019s opening brief, one officer testified that the trunk lid was \u201cresting on some material in the back.\u201d Another testified that the trunk was six to eight inches ajar and was tied shut with some type of rope or wire. A civilian witness stated that she could see a bicycle sticking out of the trunk.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
