On appeal, she argues that her conduct constituted second-degree forgery, ORS 165.007, and that the court plainly erred by entering a conviction for first-degree forgery. The state concedes that the trial court plainly erred in that regard and urges us to remand for entry of a conviction for second-degree forgery instead. We agree with and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Under ORS 165.007(1), a person commits the crime of forgery in the second degree if, with intent to injure or defraud, the person \u201c(a) [f]alsely makes, completes or alters a written instrument; or (b) [u]tters a written instrument which the person knows to be forged.\u201d The crime is elevated to first-degree forgery if \u201cthe written instrument is or purports to be,\u201d among other things, \u201c[p]art of an issue of money, securities, postage or revenue stamps, or other valuable instruments issued by a government or governmental agency.\u201d ORS 165.013(l)(a)(A). Defendant was charged with first-degree forgery based on the following allegation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">\u201cThe defendant *** did unlawfully, knowingly, and with intent to injure and defraud, utter a United States Treasury check, a written instrument, that purported to be a part of an issue of United States Treasury check issued by United States Treasury, a governmental agency, defendant knowing said written instrument, to be forged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The state proceeded to trial, and defendant was ultimately convicted, on the theory that a United States Treasury check is a \u201cvaluable instrument\u201d issued by the federal government for purposes of ORS 165.013(l)(a)(A). Although the validity of that theory was not challenged below, the parties now agree that the theory is foreclosed by our decision in <em>State v. Tarrence, </em>161 Or App 583, 590, 985 P2d 225 (1999). In <em>Tarrence </em>we held, based on the text, context, and legislative history of ORS 165.013, that the phrase \u201cother valuable instruments issued by a government or governmental agency\u201d does not include government-issued checks. 161 Or App at 589-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>We agree with the parties\u2019 contentions that, under <em>Tarrence, </em>the state alleged and proved the crime of second-degree forgery rather than first-degree forgery, and that the trial court plainly erred in entering a conviction for the more serious offense. We further agree that, given the nature and gravity of the error, the lack of any conceivable strategic reason for failing to object, and the ease by which the error can be remedied, this court should correct the error by reversing the conviction and remanding for entry of a judgment of conviction for second-degree forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Conviction for first-degree forgery reversed; remanded for entry of a judgment of conviction for second-degree forgery and for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
