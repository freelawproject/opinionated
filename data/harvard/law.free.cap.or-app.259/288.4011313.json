He raises 17 assignments of error. With the exception of his contentions relating to merger of the guilty verdicts for first-degree kidnapping, we reject defendant\u2019s arguments without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">With respect to kidnapping, the state charged, and the jury found defendant guilty of, four counts of first-degree kidnapping for each of two victims: Counts 1 through 4 pertained to victim NH, with each count representing an alternative theory of kidnapping; Counts 8 through 11 pertained to victim RS, again with each count representing a different theory of the crime. Over defendant\u2019s objection, the court entered eight separate convictions for first-degree kidnapping. On appeal, defendant contends that the court erred in failing to merge the verdicts in Counts 1 to 4 into a single conviction for first-degree kidnapping and, similarly, in failing to merge the verdicts in Counts 8 to 11 into a single conviction for first-degree kidnapping. The state concedes the error, and we accept that concession as well founded. <em>State v. Roberts, </em>239 Or App 37, 43, 243 P3d 155 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 217 (2011); <em>State v. Hylton, </em>210 Or App 104, 105-06, 150 P3d 47 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 473 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Convictions for first-degree kidnapping in Counts 1 through 4 reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for one count of first-degree kidnapping, reflecting that defendant was found guilty on four theories; convictions for first-degree kidnapping in Counts 8 through 11 reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for one count of first-degree kidnapping, reflecting that defendant was found guilty on four theories; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
