Pitts, </em>258 Or App 676, 310 P3d 1162 (2013), in which we rejected his first assignment of error without discussion, reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment omitting a unitary assessment and offense surcharge as to his second and third assignments of error, and otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Defendant asserts that we should reconsider our decision in this case because, although defendant \u201cfailed to inform the court that he was withdrawing his second and third assignments of error,\u201d after briefing was complete \u201cthe trial court entered an \u2018amended judgment\u2019 omitting the erroneous monetary obligations.\u201d Under the circumstances, defendant contends that his second and third assignments of error were moot when this court issued its decision and, because the court rejected without discussion the only other issue raised by defendant on appeal, \u201cthe correct disposition in this case is to affirm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We agree with defendant. On April 12, 2013, the trial court entered an amended judgment omitting the unitary assessment and offense surcharge that we addressed in our original decision in this case. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error are moot. <em>See State v. Balogh, </em>209 Or App 162,163-64,146 P3d 335 (2006) (granting reconsideration because the defendant\u2019s assignment of error had \u201cbecome moot by the time we decided it\u201d). We therefore allow defendant\u2019s petition for reconsideration, withdraw our former opinion, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Petition for reconsideration allowed; former opinion withdrawn; affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
