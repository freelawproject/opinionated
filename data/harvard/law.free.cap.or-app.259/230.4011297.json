Husband seeks entry of a judgment specifically enforcing the terms of the marital settlement agreement. Husband also appeals from a supplemental judgment, contending that the trial court erred in denying his petition for attorney fees and costs. Wife cross-appeals from the dissolution judgment, assigning error both to the trial court\u2019s denial of her discovery request and to its refusal to hear certain evidence related to the parties\u2019 financial circumstances. Wife seeks to have the trial court\u2019s dissolution judgment set aside and to have the case remanded for a trial. Husband has moved to dismiss wife\u2019s cross-appeal on the ground that she accepted the benefits of the dissolution judgment. On husband\u2019s appeal, we reverse and remand the dissolution judgment and vacate the supplemental judgment. As to wife\u2019s cross-appeal, we deny husband\u2019s motion to dismiss and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Because we conclude that this is not an \u201cexceptional case,\u201d we decline to exercise our discretionary authority to review the record <em>de novo. </em>ORS 19.415; ORAP 5.40(8)(c). If the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by evidence in the record, we will not disturb them, <em>Christensen and Christensen, </em>253 Or App 634, 641, 292 P3d 568 (2012), and we recite the following facts from the trial court\u2019s findings in accordance with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Husband and wife were married in 2001 after signing a premarital agreement. That agreement provided that each party would, in the event of a divorce, receive his or her separate property as listed in a schedule attached to the agreement. In May 2008, wife filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage. Wife contested the validity of the premarital agreement, but the trial court concluded that it was enforceable. That ruling is not challenged in this appeal. Eventually, the parties agreed to mediation in order to reach a settlement for the disposition of the property that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>was not covered by the premarital agreement. Pursuant to the mediation, they each signed a handwritten settlement agreement that awarded them each portions of the property that was not allocated by the premarital agreement and that purported to \u201cresolve [] all claims between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Based on that agreement, husband\u2019s counsel proposed a \u201cStipulated General Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage,\u201d which was forwarded to wife\u2019s attorney. After some disagreement over the terms, husband\u2019s counsel eventually submitted a proposed judgment to the trial court. Several weeks later, however, wife hired a new attorney and objected to the proposed judgment, arguing that the settlement agreement should not be enforced. Wife maintained that she had signed the settlement agreement under duress, owing to various actions of her previous attorney and the side effects of recent kidney surgery. Wife also took the position that the settlement agreement\u2019s property division was inequitable. The proposed judgment was never entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">After a two-day hearing in August 2010, the trial court issued a letter opinion that included a lengthy valuation of the parties\u2019 assets and 13 specific findings and conclusions. The court found, among other things, that the parties had negotiated the settlement agreement at arm\u2019s length; that neither party had been coerced or improperly induced to enter the agreement; that \u201c[wife] and [husband] entered into the mediated settlement agreement freely and voluntarily\u201d; and that the agreement did not \u201cviolate the law or contravene public policy.\u201d Based on its interpretation of the agreement, however, the court also made an \u201cadjustment\u201d to the proposed settlement by ordering husband to pay wife an additional $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The court\u2019s reasoning for the adjustment requires an understanding of two distinct aspects of the parties\u2019 financial affairs: a line of credit and the \u201cBaldocci loan.\u201d While the divorce action was pending, both parties retained access to a line of credit secured by their jointly owned ranch property. Approximately five months before the mediation that produced the settlement agreement, husband informed wife that he had drawn down the line of credit and deposited the drawn funds \u2014 approximately $266,000 \u2014 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>an account titled in his name only. Husband told wife that the drawdown \u2014 which was for the maximum amount then available \u2014 was necessary to limit wife\u2019s spending, which he considered to be excessive during that time period. The settlement agreement provided that wife was to receive the ranch property subject to both the line of credit \u2014 as drawn down by husband \u2014 and a mortgage. The agreement also required husband to make monthly spousal support payments of $15,000 to wife, but allowed husband to receive credit for that obligation by making payments on the line of credit and mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">That brings us to the Baldocci loan. At some point during the parties\u2019 marriage \u2014 the precise date is unclear from the record \u2014 husband made a loan of approximately $ 300,000 to a Ms. Baldocci.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wife acknowledged at the August hearing that she had learned \u2014 before the settlement mediation \u2014 that husband had given money to Baldocci and also that she had known that the funds that husband had given to Baldocci came out of husband\u2019s separate bank account. Wife stated that she did not know the precise amount of the loan before the mediation, but that she had learned that husband had given Baldocci funds when she saw checks from his separate account made out to Baldocci. The only evidence at the hearing indicated that the Baldocci loan was made from husband\u2019s separate bank account; the settlement agreement awarded husband \u201call accounts in his name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">After taking evidence on the above-described transactions, the trial court adjusted the settlement agreement by ordering that husband pay wife $300,000 in addition to what was provided for in the agreement. In its letter opinion, the court made two determinations of particular relevance. The first states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\u201cThe Court specifically finds that the mediated settlement agreement without the distribution of the marital asset of the loan to * * * Baldocci, with the values of the property adjusted as discussed above, is within the range of possible property divisions that are just and proper in all of the circumstances of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Immediately following that statement, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">\u201cThe Court further finds that with the adjustment of the mediated settlement agreement with the award of the loan to *** Baldocci to [wife] continues the settlement agreement to be within the range of possible property divisions that are just and proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">After some confusion arose between the parties as to what the judgment should provide, the trial court explained, at an October hearing, its reason for making the $300,000 adjustment. The court stated that it considered it inequitable for husband to draw down on the line of credit and then \u2014 pursuant to the settlement agreement \u2014 reduce the amount of spousal support that he owed by the amounts that he paid back on the line of credit. In an effort to rectify that perceived inequity, the court turned to the Baldocci loan, which, so far as the record reveals, had nothing to do with the line of credit beyond the fact that its outstanding balance of $300,000 approximated the amount that husband had withdrawn on the line of credit. Based on the court\u2019s conclusion that the Baldocci loan was a marital asset not allocated by the settlement agreement, it awarded the balance of that loan to wife.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Husband first contends that the trial court erred by purporting to \u201cadjust\u201d the mediated settlement agreement because the trial court found that the settlement agreement was just and proper in its original form. The \u201cjust and proper\u201d standard is provided by ORS 107.105(l)(f), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201c(1) Whenever the court renders a judgment of marital annulment, dissolution or separation, the court may provide in the judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">\u201c(f) For the division or other disposition between the parties of the real or personal property, or both, of either or both of the parties as may be just and proper in all the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u201c[B]ecause in many cases a range of possible property divisions likely would be just and proper, a trial court ordinarily should accept a marital settlement agreement that provides for a division of property within that range.\u201d <em>Grossman and Grossman, </em>338 Or 99, 107, 106 P3d 618 (2005). ORS 107.104(1) provides that \u201c [i] t is the policy of this state [] (a) to encourage the settlement of suits for marital * * * dissolution * * * \u201d There is a strong judicial preference for settlement agreements, one that is grounded in respect for the freedom to contract, for the right of the parties to rely on agreements made between them, and for the idea that the parties\u2019 own resolution of their dispute ought to be accorded \u201cgreat weight.\u201d <em>McDonnal and McDonnal, </em>293 Or 772, 779, 652 P2d 1247 (1982). Thus, \u201cagreements made in anticipation of a dissolution are generally enforceable and accepted by the court when they are equitable given the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 778. That is, if a court is presented with a marital settlement agreement that the court determines provides for a \u201cjust and proper\u201d property division, the court should accept that settlement agreement and enter a judgment reflecting the settlement\u2019s terms. <em>Grossman, </em>338 Or at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The difficulty with husband\u2019s first argument is that it is grounded on the mistaken predicate that the trial court did, in fact, conclude that the marital settlement agreement was just and proper in its original form. That is not what the court concluded, however. It stated that the marital settlement agreement was just and proper \u201cwithout the distribution of the marital asset of the loan to * * * Baldocci.\u201d <em>See </em>259 Or App 234. In other words, the court concluded that the marital settlement agreement did not, by its terms, provide for a distribution of the balance owing on the Baldocci loan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, as we explain below, the marital settlement agreement <em>did </em>distribute the balance owing on the Baldocci loan, and, accordingly, there is no conclusion from the trial court that the marital settlement agreement \u2014 as written \u2014 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>just and proper. Thus, although husband is correct that, under <em>Grossman, </em>a trial court should ordinarily enter a judgment consistent with a settlement agreement after it has determined that the agreement provides for a just and proper division of the parties\u2019 marital property, there was no such determination in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Husband next urges that the trial court erred in treating the Baldocci loan in a manner contrary to the provisions of the marital settlement agreement. We agree with husband that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, in interpreting the settlement agreement. <em>See Grossman, </em>338 Or at 101, 107-08 (reviewing the interpretation of a marital settlement agreement that had not been reduced to judgment as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The marital settlement agreement provides that \u201c[husband] receives the cash value on the life insurance on his life and <em>all accounts in his name\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It also purports to \u201cresolve [] all claims between the parties.\u201d Additionally, two important findings of the trial court go unchallenged in this appeal. The first is that \u201c[t]he parties intended the mediated settlement agreement to resolve all issues regarding the marital property distribution, spousal support, and joint liabilities.\u201d The second is that \u201c[wife] believed that the mediated settlement agreement had concluded the issues pertaining to the property division * * * \u201d Thus, the parties\u2019 intent is clear: The marital settlement agreement was designed to provide a disposition for all of the parties\u2019 marital property. Wife does not contend on appeal that the court was correct in concluding that the marital settlement agreement did not account for the Baldocci loan, nor does she contest husband\u2019s assertion that she was aware of the Baldocci loan prior to mediation. She also does not dispute husband\u2019s assertion that there was no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>indicating that the Baldocci loan came from anywhere other than husband\u2019s separate account. The trial court\u2019s interpretation \u2014 and corresponding \u201cadjustment\u201d \u2014 of the agreement was flawed as a matter of law; under the terms of the settlement agreement, husband alone was entitled to repayment on the Baldocci loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Although we conclude that the trial court erred in interpreting the agreement, we are not in a position to provide husband with the relief that he seeks, <em>viz., </em>requiring the trial court to specifically enforce the settlement agreement. A trial court is not automatically required to accept an agreement that has been entered into by the parties. The Supreme Court has made clear that \u201c[application [of the just and proper standard in ORS 107.105(l)(f)] is ultimately the duty of the court, not of the parties.\u201d <em>Norris and Norris, </em>302 Or 123,126, 727 P2d 115 (1986); <em>see also Grossman, </em>338 Or at 107 (\u201cThis court, while emphasizing the critical importance of settlement agreements, repeatedly has recognized the authority of the trial court in a dissolution proceeding to make a just and proper distribution of marital property.\u201d). As we have explained above, we are not reviewing this case <em>de novo </em>and there has been no determination that the settlement agreement \u2014 as properly interpreted \u2014 represents a \u201cjust and proper\u201d division of the parties\u2019 divisible property under ORS 107.105(l)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We therefore remand for the trial court to make that determination in the first instance. It is probable, however, that issues relating to one of husband\u2019s additional arguments will arise on remand, and we therefore find it prudent to address that argument. <em>See State v. Langley, </em>331 Or 430, 440-41, 16 P3d 489 (2000) (applying that methodology). Specifically, husband asserts that there is no evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s stated reason for awarding the Baldocci loan to <em>wife </em>\u2014 i.e., husband\u2019s \u201cmi scon - duct\u201d with respect to the parties\u2019 line of credit. Wife argues that the court properly found that husband had engaged in misconduct with respect to the line of credit and that the $300,000 award to wife can be sustained as an exercise of the court\u2019s equitable powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">As noted, husband\u2019s purported misconduct consisted of drawing down on the parties\u2019joint line of credit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>then signing a settlement agreement that (1) awarded wife the ranch property subject to the drawn-down line of credit and (2) afforded him the right to credit his repayment of those borrowed funds against his monthly spousal support payments. However, the trial court found that wife \u201cknowingly assumed responsibility for the total amount of the line of credit along with being awarded the [ranch property].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That finding is not challenged in this appeal. Moreover, the court found that wife freely and voluntarily signed an agreement that unequivocally allowed husband to deduct amounts that he paid back on the line of credit against his spousal support payments. It is thus uncontroverted that wife not only knew about the effects of husband\u2019s purported \u201cmisconduct,\u201d but actually structured her negotiated bargain around those effects. In short, there is nothing in the record to support a finding that husband acted inequitably, which was the court\u2019s stated reason for awarding wife an additional $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">As noted, it is Oregon\u2019s policy \u201c [t] o encourage the settlement of suits for marital *** dissolution ***.\u201d ORS 107.104(l)(a). In the context of settlement agreements incorporated into judgments, the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that public policy requires that persons of full age and competent understanding shall have the utmost liberty of contracting, and that their contracts, when entered into freely and voluntarily, shall be held sacred and shall be enforced by courts of justice; and it is only when some other overpowering rule of public policy intervenes, rendering such agreements unfair or illegal, that they will not be enforced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\"><em>McDonnal, </em>293 Or at 779 (quoting <em>Feves v. Feves, </em>198 Or 151, 159-60, 254 P2d 694 (1953)). Because Oregon has a policy of promoting settlement agreements, that statement is equally applicable where the parties have manifested their intent to be bound to an agreement that has not yet been reduced to judgment. <em>See Grossman, </em>338 Or at 107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>(\u201c [B] ecause in many cases a range of possible property divisions likely would be just and proper, a trial court ordinarily should accept a marital settlement agreement that provides for a division of property within that range.\u201d); <em>McDonnal, </em>293 Or at 779 (\u201cThe parties\u2019 own resolution of their dispute should be accorded great weight. *** Where parties have foregone their opportunity to litigate disputes and have chosen instead to enter into an agreement their reliance on the agreement can be presumed.\u201d). Although there may be cases in which it is appropriate for a trial court to disregard a marital settlement agreement because of a party\u2019s inequitable conduct, it would \u2014 in light of Oregon\u2019s policy of promoting settlement agreements \u2014 be an abuse of discretion to do so in the particular facts of this case, where the parties have not only considered the effect of the perceived misconduct, but structured their bargain around it. <em>See, e.g., Githens and Githens, </em>227 Or App 73, 90, 204 P3d 835, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 42 (2009) (we review a just and proper determination for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Husband also contends that the trial court erred in denying his request for attorney fees that he incurred in the course of litigating the validity of the settlement agreement. Because we are reversing the trial court\u2019s property division, we vacate the trial court\u2019s supplemental judgment that denied husband those attorney fees. <em>See Garza and Garza, </em>201 Or App 318, 330, 118 P3d 824 (2005); <em>Proctor and Proctor, </em>204 Or App 250, 252, 129 P3d 186, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 672 (2006) (\u201cIn light of our decision to reverse and remand the property division for reconsideration, we vacate the trial court\u2019s decision on attorney fees and remand for reconsideration of that issue as well.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We now turn to wife\u2019s cross-appeal, in which she argues that a discovery order of the trial court improperly prevented her from investigating \u2014 and presenting evidence to the court of \u2014 husband\u2019s separate assets.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Wife first filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>a request for production of documents several months after she initiated the dissolution proceedings. After the premarital agreement was adjudged enforceable, wife\u2019s counsel continued to request discovery materials from husband. In one letter sent to husband\u2019s attorney, wife\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cIf we can reach some understanding with regards to [our discovery requests and another matter], then we are more than willing to mediate.\u201d Husband\u2019s counsel eventually sought a protective order to limit disclosure related to husband\u2019s business assets. The record indicates that the trial court did not directly rule on the motion for a protective order, or on wife\u2019s request for production, but instead set \u201cparameters\u201d on the discovery. The court indicated that, in light of the premarital agreement, it would permit discovery into certain of husband\u2019s separate property, but explicitly deferred ruling on the discovery issues in order to see if the parties could reach a mutually agreeable property division without court interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Husband\u2019s counsel subsequently conveyed a substantial amount of the requested discovery materials to wife\u2019s counsel, but withheld certain other materials on the ground that they were not relevant in view of the premarital agreement. The parties then negotiated and signed their settlement agreement, which purported to \u201cresolve [] all claims between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Several months after the parties signed their agreement, wife\u2019s new counsel filed a request for production of documents. The trial court stated that it would not order wife\u2019s requested discovery in the event that it found that the settlement agreement was enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Wife maintains that the trial court\u2019s limitation on discovery necessarily resulted in a settlement that was not just and proper in all of the circumstances under ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>107.105(l)(f), because all of the <em>circumstances </em>\u2014 i.e., the extent and nature of husband\u2019s separate assets \u2014 were not before the court at the hearing. She specifically contends that two statutes compel discovery in this case. ORS 107.105 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">\u201c(1) Whenever the court renders a judgment of marital annulment, dissolution or separation, the court may provide in the judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">\u2021 * 5\u00a1\u00ed *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">\u201c(f) For the division or other disposition between the parties of the real or personal property, or both, of either or both of the parties as may be just and proper in all the circumstances. In determining the division of property under this paragraph, the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\u00ab\u00edfc * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">\u201c(F) The court shall require full disclosure of all assets by the parties in arriving at a just property division.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">In addition, wife cites ORS 107.089, which provides that, upon the request of one party to a dissolution proceeding, the other party must furnish copies of certain documents such as tax returns, deeds to real property in which a party has an interest, certificates of title, and information related to stock ownership.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Although she does not cite with any specificity the documents that she seeks, to the extent that wife relies on ORS 107.089 as necessitating discovery, we conclude that she waived that argument by signing the settlement agreement. \u201c[I]t is possible to waive *** statutory rights.\u201d <em>McMillan v. Follansbee, </em>194 Or App 145, 154, 93 P3d 809 (2004). \u201cAs with contractual waiver, the waiver of a statutory right is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Wife\u2019s discovery requests were pending before the trial court at the time that she voluntarily signed the settlement agreement, which, again, purported to \u201cresolve [] all claims between the parties.\u201d To the extent that wife did not have as full a view of husband\u2019s separate assets as she wished at the mediation, she relinquished any right to conduct a more thorough inquiry by signing that agreement. Husband\u2019s counsel provided a substantial amount of information before the mediation, while simultaneously refusing to turn over other requested items. At that point, wife could have refused to settle and persisted in her discovery requests. She chose to settle, and she did so while apparently content with knowing what discovery materials she wanted but did not have.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Additionally, allowing wife additional discovery under ORS 107.089 would be inconsistent with Oregon\u2019s statutory policy of \u201cencourag[ing] the settlement of suits for marital annulment, dissolution or separation.\u201d ORS 107.104(l)(a). To allow one party to attack the validity of a settlement agreement by claiming a lack of discovery would undercut the incentive for the other party to negotiate in the first place. It is entirely probable that divorcing parties may desire to end their property disputes as quickly and painlessly as possible. As such, parties may wish to bargain away certain property, rights, and interests in order to spare the time and expense of fully litigating their dissolution. <em>See McDonnal, </em>293 Or at 779 (\u201cWhere parties have foregone their opportunity to litigate disputes and have chosen instead to enter into an agreement their reliance on the agreement can be presumed.\u201d). Oregon\u2019s policy of promoting settlement agreements is better served by protecting reliance on those agreements than by allowing parties to second-guess their own litigation choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The fact that wife waived her right to discovery under ORS 107.089 does not end the inquiry. ORS 107.105(l)(f)(F) provides that a court \u201cshall require full disclosure of all assets\u201d when arriving at a just and proper division in all the circumstances. Wife urges that this language requires a trial court to order full discovery irrespective of whatever actions the parties have taken. It is at least implicit in prior decisions, however, that a trial court may presume that parties who have reached a settlement agreement after an arm\u2019s length negotiation have already sufficiently considered the nature and extent of each other\u2019s holdings. In <em>McDonnal, </em>for instance, the Supreme Court held that a court may approve a settlement agreement without engaging in an analysis of the statutory factors set out in ORS 107.105(l)(c) (1981), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 1999, ch 587, \u00a7 1 and Or Laws 2011, ch 115, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 293 Or at 778. That statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>authorized a court to either review and approve a proposed settlement agreement or to award spousal support in a \u201cjust and equitable\u201d amount in the absence of an agreement. ORS 107.105(l)(c) (1981). It also commanded that, \u201c[i]n making such support order, the court <em>shall </em>consider [a list of statutory factors].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the question presented was whether the text of that statute required the trial court to consider the entire list of statutory factors in cases where the parties themselves proposed a spousal support value in a settlement agreement. Despite the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d \u2014 a term also found in ORS 107.105(l)(f)(F)\u2014 the Supreme Court concluded that the parties could voluntarily obviate the court\u2019s statutory obligation to conduct a detailed inquiry by presenting their own agreement to the court: \u201cWe do not read the statute to require the court to apply an analysis of the statutory factors to the circumstances of each case when confronted with a proposed agreement.\u201d <em>McDonnal, </em>293 Or at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Although the result in <em>McDonnal </em>was partly based on the text of that spousal support statute, the case was not an outlier. Oregon law affords wide latitude to parties in crafting settlement agreements, and it even allows parties to create enforceable terms that a trial court itself could not impose. <em>See Patterson and Kanaga, </em>242 Or App 452, 471, 255 P3d 634, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 216 (2011) (\u201c[T]he fact that a marital settlement agreement contains terms other than those that a court could order absent the agreement does not necessarily mean that the agreement violates the law or is clearly contrary to public policy.\u201d); <em>see also Reeves and Elliott, </em>237 Or App 126, 130, 238 P3d 427 (2010) (parties may stipulate to support terms that a court itself could not order absent an agreement); <em>Mclnnis and Mclnnis, </em>199 Or App 223, 240,110 P3d 639, <em>rev dismissed, </em>338 Or 681 (2005) (through settlement agreements, parties may waive their statutory right to seek modification of spousal support); <em>Eidlin and Eidlin, </em>140 Or App 479, 483-84, 916 P2d 338 (1996) (parties may provide for a more permissive basis to seek modification of a spousal support award than a court would be allowed to provide for under the relevant statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>In light of the foregoing, and this state\u2019s policy of favoring settlement agreements, the asset disclosure provision of ORS 107.105(l)(f)(F) does not impose a requirement on trial courts to compel complete discovery in order to permit one party to reexamine the circumstances underlying a voluntary settlement agreement. Although there may well be situations where it is appropriate for a trial court to order discovery of a party\u2019s separate assets after being presented with a voluntary settlement agreement, the facts of this case demonstrate why ORS 107.105(l)(f)(F) does not create a strict requirement that it do so. First, wife argues that the nature and extent of husband\u2019s separate property under the premarital agreement is a \u201ccircumstance\u201d that must be considered under ORS 107.105(l)(f), but it is just as easy to classify her relinquishment of any claim to that property as a circumstance as well. Moreover, the fact that wife voluntarily signed a settlement agreement is a circumstance, as is the fact that she signed that agreement while some of her discovery requests were outstanding. <em>See Conrad and Conrad, </em>191 Or App 283, 292, 81 P3d 749 (2003) (stating that ORS 107.105(l)(f) reflects a legislative intent to require \u201cfull and frank disclosure of all circumstances <em>materially </em>bearing on the dissolution judgment\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added)). In view of both the statutory policy favoring settlement agreements and the unique factual circumstances of this case, the trial court did not err in refusing to order discovery of husband\u2019s separate assets in making its property division under ORS 107.105(l)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Finally, the trial court informed the parties, before the August hearing, that it was not going to hear evidence relating to certain of husband\u2019s separate assets because of the premarital agreement. Wife assigns error to that decision on the ground that the trial court was required to consider the nature and extent of husband\u2019s separate property in reaching a just and proper property distribution. Leaving aside that wife does not identify any particular piece of evidence or testimony that the trial court improperly refused to admit into evidence at the hearing, we reject wife\u2019s argument for the same reasons that we reject her discovery arguments: The trial court was not required, on the facts of this case, to consider the nature and extent of husband\u2019s separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>assets \u2014 covered by the premarital agreement \u2014 after it was presented with a settlement agreement that was freely and voluntarily entered into by wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">On appeal, general judgment reversed and remanded as to property division, otherwise affirmed; supplemental judgment vacated and remanded. On .cross-appeal, husband\u2019s motion to dismiss denied; affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> Baldocci\u2019s name is spelled at least three different ways in the trial court record; we adopt the spelling used in the court\u2019s letter opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-10\"> At the October hearing, the trial court agreed to award wife an additional $300,000 in cash rather than require assignment of the note to wife; the dissolution judgment so provides.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b258-5\"> Any confusion created on this point by the language of the trial court\u2019s letter opinion was cleared up at the October hearing, when the court stated: \u201cI don\u2019t find that there\u2019s any reason not to take that $300,000 as an asset that was not appropriately distributed by that agreement and still needs to be distributed. If they had <em>forgotten </em>about the house, it still would have been something that needed to be distributed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\"> Husband also argues that ORS 107.104(l)(b) required the trial court to enter a judgment incorporating the settlement\u2019s terms. That statute is inapposite. It declares \u2014 through reference to ORS 107.104(2) \u2014 that, once a marital settlement agreement has been reduced to a judgment, it is the policy of this state \u201c [\u00b6] or courts to enforce the terms of settlements * * * to the fullest extent possible, except when to do so would violate the law or would clearly contravene public policy.\u201d ORS 107.104(l)(b). Because the marital settlement agreement was not reduced to a judgment at the time that the trial court was considering whether to enforce its provisions, the statute does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> The trial court valued the ranch property at $1,823,000 before the line of credit and mortgage were considered. With the Baldocci award to wife factored in, the trial court\u2019s uncontested valuations show a distribution to husband of $1,079,486 and a distribution to wife of $1,240,498, not including $840,000 in spousal support paid out over five years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\"> During the pendency of this appeal, husband filed a motion to dismiss wife\u2019s cross-appeal, contending, in part, that she should be precluded from challenging the judgment of dissolution because she accepted the benefits of both that judgment and the marital settlement agreement. <em>See generally Hofer v. Hofer, </em>244 Or 88, 415 P2d 753 (1966) (discussing when a party may be barred from appealing a dissolution judgment after accepting benefits under that judgment). With respect to that basis for the motion to dismiss, the Appellate Commissioner deferred a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ruling to the panel hearing the merits of the case. Although husband asserts that wife has accepted the benefits of the judgment\u2019s provisions, husband has not offered any evidence indicating that wife has accepted those benefits since the entry of the dissolution judgment on February 8, 2011. With respect to husband\u2019s assertion that wife\u2019s cross-appeal should be dismissed because she accepted the benefits of the settlement agreement before the entry of judgment, husband points us to no law that would support such a conclusion. Husband\u2019s motion to dismiss wife\u2019s cross-appeal on those grounds is therefore denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\"><em> </em>ORS 107.089 states, in. relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">\u201c(1) If served with a copy of this section as provided in ORS 107.088, each party in a suit for legal separation or for dissolution shall provide to the other party copies of the following documents in their possession or control:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">\u201c(a) All federal and state income tax returns filed by either party for the last three calendar years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">\u201c(b) If income tax returns for the last calendar year have not been filed, all W-2 statements, year-end payroll statements, interest and dividend statements and all other records of income earned or received by either party during the last calendar year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\">\u201c(c) All records showing any income earned or received by either party for the current calendar year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-15\">\u201c(d) All financial statements, statements of net worth and credit card and loan applications prepared by or for either party during the last two calendar years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-16\">\u201c(e) All documents such as deeds, real estate contracts, appraisals and most recent statements of assessed value relating to real property in which either party has any interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u201c(f) All documents showing debts of either party, including the most recent statement of any loan, credit line or charge card balance due;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201c(g) Certificates of title or registrations of all automobiles, motor vehicles, boats or other personal property registered in either party\u2019s name or in which either party has any interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201c(h) Documents showing stocks, bonds, secured notes, mutual funds and other investments in which either party has any interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201c(i) The most recent statement describing any retirement plan, IRA pension plan, profit-sharing plan, stock option plan or deferred compensation plan in which either party has any interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">\u201c(j) All financial institution or brokerage account records on any account in which either party has had any interest or signing privileges in the past year, whether or not the account is currently open or closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">\u00ab:}: s*:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">\u201c(5) The provisions of this section do not limit in any way the discovery provisions of the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure or any other discovery provision of Oregon law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b265-12\"> That conclusion is reinforced by the language of a letter sent by wife\u2019s attorney six months before the mediation, which stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">\u201cWe want the discovery we originally requested.
