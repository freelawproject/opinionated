J.</author>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Defendant appeals a supplemental judgment for restitution in the amount of $36,911.89 for property that defendant stole in a robbery at a Rite Aid pharmacy. Defendant contends that the court erred by awarding restitution to Rite Aid based on the retail value of the stolen property. According to defendant, the proper measure of economic damages for purposes of restitution was the wholesale value of the property and any profits lost by the store as a result of the theft. We reject defendant\u2019s argument and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A jury convicted defendant of a number of crimes arising from robberies that defendant committed at a Newport Rite Aid pharmacy on March 10, 2010, and July 11, 2010. In the March 10 robbery, defendant entered the Rite Aid, brandished what appeared to be a handgun, and demanded that the pharmacist give him the store\u2019s entire supply of Oxycontin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The pharmacist filled a plastic bag with the store\u2019s unopened bottles of the drug, which contained thousands of tablets of assorted dosages. Defendant grabbed the bag and fled. He returned to rob the Rite Aid pharmacy a second time on July 11, 2010, making off with four bottles of tablets.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">A Rite Aid pharmacist testified at defendant\u2019s trial about the quantity and value of the Oxycontin tablets that defendant had stolen in the March 10 robbery. She used the store\u2019s controlled-drugs auditing program to determine the number of tablets that defendant had taken and another computer program to calculate the value of the tablets. As she explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">\u201c[w]e have a program that checks the price, if someone wants to pay a cash price for a pill. So I just entered in the drug name, the code for that drug and bottle size, and the quantity missing, and used that dollar amount to estimate the cost.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The trial court also admitted into evidence an exhibit that listed the quantity of Oxycontin tablets taken on March 10 and their calculated value, totaling $36,911.89. The state did not present any evidence about the value of the drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>that defendant stole in the July 11 robbery. As noted, the jury convicted defendant for a number of crimes related to the robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">After entering a judgment on defendant\u2019s convictions, the trial court entered a supplemental judgment awarding restitution to Rite Aid in the amount of $36,911.89, based on the retail value of the Oxycontin tablets that defendant had stolen on March 10. In making that award, the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the proper measure of Rite Aid\u2019s economic damages was \u201cwhat it cost Rite Aid to basically replace the inventory that was taken.\u201d The court did not award restitution for the tablets taken in the July 11 robbery because the state failed to present evidence by which to determine the value of those tablets.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">When a person is convicted of a crime and the \u201ccourt finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages,\u201d the court shall order the defendant to \u201cpay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages as determined by the court.\u201d ORS 137.106(l)(a). For purposes of such an award, \u201ceconomic damages\u201d includes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201cobjectively verifiable monetary losses including but not limited to *** reasonable and necessarily incurred costs due to loss of use of property and reasonable costs incurred for repair or for replacement of damaged property, whichever is less.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">ORS 31.710(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Defendant contends on appeal that Rite Aid would be made economically whole if it were paid the cost to replenish its Oxycontin inventory at the Newport store, that is, if it were paid the wholesale cost of the tablets that defendant stole, plus any lost profits that it suffered from sales that it could not make while awaiting the replacement of the store\u2019s inventory. The state did not present evidence by which to make those calculations. Hence, in defendant\u2019s view, the state failed to present evidence by which the court could award restitution to Rite Aid for its economic damages. Defendant is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The economic damages that a court may award as restitution to a crime victim are the economic damages that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the victim could recover against the defendant in a civil action for the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>State v. Onishchenko, </em>249 Or App 470, 476, 278 P3d 63, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012). Here, the applicable civil action that Rite Aid could bring against defendant would be an action for conversion of the Oxycontin tablets.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Conversion \u201c\u2018is an intentional exercise of dominion or control over a chattel which so seriously interferes with the right of another to control it that the actor may justly be required to pay the other the <em>full value </em>of the chattel.\u2019\u201d <em>Mustola v. Toddy, </em>253 Or 658, 663, 456 P2d 1004 (1969) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) Torts </em>\u00a7 222A(1) (1965)) (emphasis added). In a civil action for conversion, \u201c[t]he Oregon Supreme Court \u2018has [long] held that the measure of damages for the conversion of personal property is the reasonable market value of the goods converted at the time and place of conversion.\u2019\u201d <em>Hayes Oyster Co. v. Dulcich, </em>170 Or App 219, 226, 12 P3d 507 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 544 (2005) (quoting <em>Hall v. Work, </em>223 Or 347, 357, 354 P2d 837 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The state presented evidence of the retail price at which Rite Aid sells the Oxycontin tablets that defendant stole. No other evidence of value was presented to the trial court. In light of the record, the trial court did not err in finding the market value of the Oxycontin tablets to be their retail value nor in awarding restitution to Rite Aid on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\"> Oxycontin is a brand name for the generic drug oxycodone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\"> Defendant relies on <em>Willamette Quarries v. Wodtli, </em>308 Or 406, 412, 781 P2d 1196 (1989), as support for his proposed measure of Rite Aid\u2019s economic damages. That case concerns the recovery of lost profits as damages for breach of a contract and is inapposite to the award of damages in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
