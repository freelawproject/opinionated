Specifically, he contends that the QDRO divides his pension benefits in a manner that is inconsistent with the division provided for in the parties\u2019 dissolution judgment. We agree and, accordingly, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Husband and wife were married for just over 10 years, during which time husband was employed by Georgia Pacific. Husband\u2019s employment provided him with a defined benefit pension plan. When the parties divorced, their property was divided according to a dissolution judgment, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">\u201c[Wife] shall be entitled to receive one-half of the monthly benefits that [husband] is entitled to receive from his pension, as set forth in Exhibit !C,\u2019 which is by this reference incorporated herein, if and when he receives those payments pursuant to the terms of his agreement with the union. [Wife] shall not have any right to claim any retirement benefits which accrue to [husband] after March 1, 1985.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Exhibit C provides that husband was \u201c100% vested\u201d in the benefit that he had accrued as of December 31, 1984, which was a monthly pension benefit of $215.25. It further estimated the monthly benefit that husband could potentially earn by continuing to work until he was 65 years old to be $971.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Husband continued to work for Georgia Pacific for more than 13 years following the dissolution. During that time, the value of his retirement benefits increased. After he had filed for retirement, but before he began to receive any benefits, wife petitioned the court for a QDRO that would effectuate the dissolution judgment\u2019s division of husband\u2019s pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>At a show cause hearing on wife\u2019s petition, wife contended that the trial court should enter a QDRO that calculated her interest in husband\u2019s pension according to the \u201ctime rule.\u201d Typically, the time rule is used to calculate a nonemployee spouse\u2019s interest in the benefits of a defined benefit plan. <em>Kiser and Kiser, </em>176 Or App 627, 632 n 1, 32 P3d 244 (2001). The time rule provides that the nonemployee spouse\u2019s interest is determined by dividing the marital portion of the retirement benefits, at the time of retirement, in half.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe marital portion is determined by multiplying the benefit to be divided by a fraction, the numerator of which is the years (or months) of service during which the couple were married and the denominator is the total years (or months) of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, under the time rule, the nonemployee spouse\u2019s interest in the retirement benefits is calculated by multiplying the employee spouse\u2019s benefits at the time of retirement by a fraction representing the portion of the number of years worked during which the parties were married and dividing the resulting number in half.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Husband challenged wife\u2019s petition, contending that she was seeking to circumvent the division of his pension benefits that the dissolution judgment provided for. Husband contended that the dissolution judgment provided that wife was entitled to one half of the pension benefits that he had accrued at the time of dissolution and that wife was not entitled to any benefits that accrued under husband\u2019s pension after that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In essence, the parties\u2019 dispute focused on whether the dissolution judgment provided that wife\u2019s interest in husband\u2019s pension was to be determined based on husband\u2019s pension benefits at the time of dissolution or by applying the time rule to husband\u2019s benefits at the time that he retired. Under husband\u2019s construction of the dissolution judgment, wife would have a smaller interest in husband\u2019s ultimate pension benefits than she would under her construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The trial court agreed with wife\u2019s construction of the dissolution judgment. Consequently, it calculated wife\u2019s interest in husband\u2019s pension benefits by applying the time rule to the benefits at the time of retirement. The court then entered a QDRO that provided for that division of the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\">Husband appeals, contending that the court incorrectly construed the dissolution judgment and that it erred in entering a QDRO that divides his pension benefits by applying the time rule to his benefits at the time of retirement. In response, wife contends that the dissolution judgment unambiguously provides that husband\u2019s benefits are to be divided among the parties by applying the time rule to husband\u2019s pension benefits at the time of his retirement. In the alternative, wife contends that the provision providing for the division of husband\u2019s pension benefits is ambiguous and that extrinsic evidence, such as the \u201coverall nature\u201d of the dissolution judgment, demonstrates that the dissolution court intended to use the time rule to divide husband\u2019s pension benefits among the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Thus, the parties\u2019 dispute reduces to a question of construction of the dissolution judgment. We therefore examine the language of the dissolution judgment to determine whether the provision concerning the division of husband\u2019s pension benefits is ambiguous. \u201cA provision in a judgment is ambiguous if it is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>Neal and Neal, </em>181 Or App 361, 365, 45 P3d 1011 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Husband contends that the provision at issue unambiguously provides that wife is entitled to 50 percent of the pension benefits that he had accrued at the time of dissolution. He explains that the language of the provision providing that wife \u201cshall be entitled to receive one-half of the monthly benefits that [husband] is entitled to receive from his pension, as set forth in Exhibit \u2018C,\u2019\u201d limits the property that the provision divides between the parties to the benefits listed in Exhibit C, which are the benefits that husband had accrued at the time of dissolution. Husband contends that the provision reiterates that limitation by stating that wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201cshall not have any right to claim any retirement benefits which accrue to [husband] after March 1,1985.\u201d He contends that the provision, by prohibiting wife from claiming any retirement benefits that accrue to husband after March 1, 1985, clearly indicates that wife\u2019s interest in his benefits is limited to those benefits that he had accrued at the time of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">In response, wife contends that the dissolution judgment unambiguously provides that husband\u2019s benefits are to be divided among the parties according to the time rule. She contends that the first sentence of the provision provides that she is entitled to one-half of husband\u2019s monthly benefits when he receives them. Wife acknowledges that, under her interpretation of that sentence, she would be entitled to one-half of <em>all </em>of husband\u2019s pension benefits when he receives those benefits; she nonetheless contends that the second sentence, which provides that she is not entitled to any benefits that accrue to husband after March 1,1985, limits the scope of the first sentence by describing the marital portion of the pension benefits, which is the portion of husband\u2019s pension benefits at retirement that could be allocated to the years during which the parties were married.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Husband has the better of the arguments. To begin with, we disagree with wife\u2019s contention that the provision provides that wife\u2019s interest is to be calculated at the time that husband receives his benefits. The first sentence of the provision provides that wife \u201cshall be entitled to receive one-half of the monthly benefits that [husband] is entitled to receive from his pension, as set forth in Exhibit \u2018C,\u2019 * * * if and when he receives those payments pursuant to the terms of his agreement with the union.\u201d That sentence provides the timing for when wife is entitled to receive her interest in the benefits, which is <em>\u201cif and when </em>[husband] receives those payments\u201d; it does not provide the timing for when wife\u2019s interest in the benefits is to be calculated. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Instead, the sentence expressly links wife\u2019s interest in husband\u2019s pension to the benefits that he is entitled to receive \u201cas set forth in\u201d Exhibit C. The benefit that Exhibit C <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>provides that husband is entitled to receive is the monthly pension benefit that he had accrued as of December 31, 1984.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">To construe the dissolution judgment to provide that wife\u2019s interest in the pension benefits is to be calculated based on the benefits that husband has accrued at the time of retirement would ignore both the provision\u2019s express reference to the benefits that husband is entitled to receive \u201cas set forth\u201d in Exhibit C and the express limitation on the benefits that wife is not to receive. We therefore conclude that wife\u2019s construction of the provision is not reasonable. <em>Cf. Hoffman Construction Co. v. Fred S. James &amp; Co., </em>313 Or 464, 473, 836 P2d 703 (1992) (explaining that a construction that renders language meaningless is unreasonable). Consequently, we conclude that the dissolution judgment unambiguously provides that wife\u2019s share of husband\u2019s pension benefits is not appropriately calculated under the time rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The dissent reasons that the QDRO did not modify or conflict with the dissolution judgment, but rather \u201cimplemented the property division in the judgment.\u201d 259 Or App at 274-75 (Armstrong, P. J., dissenting). We do not agree that the judgment is susceptible to that interpretation, because the dissolution judgment unambiguously reflects the intent to give wife a one-half interest in the benefits that husband was entitled to receive at the time of the dissolution \u201cas set forth\u201d in Exhibit C. If the dissolution judgment intended to invoke the time rule, Exhibit C \u2014 which, again, was incorporated into that judgment \u2014 is entirely superfluous, for wife\u2019s portion of the benefits could be calculated as needed without reference to any of the figures contained in that exhibit. Moreover, we note that the QDRO conflicts with what wife requested during the divorce proceedings. In her pretrial statement to the trial court, wife not only identified the then-present value of husband\u2019s pension benefit at retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>as \u201capproximately $225.00 per month,\u201d she then stated that \u201c[wife] requests that she be awarded <em>a one-half interest in this pension plan vested to date.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The division of retirement benefits at dissolution is a property division that is not subject to modification unless the property award was based on the enhanced earning capacity of one of the parties. ORS 107.135(l)(e); <em>Tiley and Tiley, </em>147 Or App 262, 266, 936 P2d 367, <em>rev den, </em>325 Or 491 (1997). Wife did not petition the trial court to modify the dissolution judgment according to ORS 107.135(l)(e). As a result, wife is not entitled to a division of husband\u2019s retirement benefits contrary to the division provided for in the dissolution judgment. Because the dissolution judgment unambiguously provides that wife\u2019s share of husband\u2019s pension benefits is not to be calculated by using the time rule, the trial court erred in entering a QDRO that calculated wife\u2019s interest in husband\u2019s pension benefits by using the time rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\"> A QDRO is a judgment, decree, or order that creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee\u2019s right to receive all or a portion of a retirement plan participant\u2019s benefits payable under an Employee-Retirement-Income-Security-Act-qualified employee benefit plan. 29 USCA \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B). Generally, an employee\u2019s retirement benefits may not be assigned or alienated. 29 USCA \u00a7 1056(d)(1). However, there is an exception to that rule for QDROs. <em>See </em>29 USCA \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\"> We have specifically noted that, \u201cwhen retirement benefits have not matured and are thus not presently liquid, it is equitable to look to the value of the benefit at retirement\u201d and that \u201ca defined benefit plan * * * is not appropriately divided on the basis of the account balance or contributions made as of the date of dissolution.\u201d <em>Kiser, </em>176 Or App at 631-32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\"> We are mindful of the discrepancy between the date provided in the dissolution judgment and the date given in Exhibit C. Because husband contends only that the trial court erred in concluding that wife\u2019s share of the benefits is appropriately calculated under the time rule, we are not called upon to decide which of the two dates applies to limit that portion of the benefits that wife is entitled to share in and we therefore express no opinion on the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b293-6\">ARMSTRONG, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5A\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In reversing the trial court, the majority ultimately\u2014 and erroneously \u2014 concludes that the trial court\u2019s qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) conflicts with the underlying dissolution judgment that it was designed to implement. It does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">To reach its conclusion, the majority reasons as follows: The dissolution judgment expressly provides that wife is not entitled to claim any pension benefits that accrued to husband after the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage. By applying the time rule, the QDRO awards wife pension benefits that accrued to husband after the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage. Hence, the QDRO impermissibly modified the property division in the dissolution judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The majority\u2019s conclusion is based on a misunderstanding of the time rule when applied to pension benefits that accrue under a defined-benefit plan. A division of pension benefits entails three separate determinations by a dissolution court: the court must determine the marital portion of the benefits, it must determine the value of the marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>portion, and it must divide the marital portion between the parties. Here, the actual <em>division </em>of husband\u2019s retirement benefits is not in dispute \u2014 both parties acknowledge that wife is entitled to one half of the marital portion of those benefits. However, the parties do dispute the dollar amount of wife\u2019s half interest, which implicates both the apportionment and the value of the marital portion of husband\u2019s pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">As the majority acknowledges, the time rule is typically used to calculate the marital portion of a pension benefit. 259 Or App at 267; <em>see, e.g., Kiser and Kiser, </em>176 Or App 627, 631-32, 632 n 1, 32 P3d 244 (2001). The rule is not complicated: the marital portion is simply represented by a fraction \u2014 the coverature fraction. The numerator of the fraction represents the duration of employment service during which the parties were married; the denominator represents the total duration of employment service. In the context of a defined-benefit plan, the time rule ignores other factors\u2014 such as contribution amounts, account balances, increases in salary, or the vesting of benefits over different periods of service \u2014 because benefits under a defined-benefit plan are understood to appreciate on a straight-line basis. In other words, the benefits are deemed <em>to accrue </em>in a straight line, that is, in equal increments for each year of participation in the defined-benefit plan. <em>See Kiser, </em>176 Or App at 631-32, 632 n 1; <em>Caudill and Caudill, </em>139 Or App 479, 483-84, 912 P2d 915 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">After establishing the marital portion of a given pension plan \u2014 that is, the portion of the benefits <em>that accrued </em>during the marriage \u2014 through application of the time rule, the value of that portion may be determined simply by multiplying the coverature fraction by the total value of the benefits due under the pension plan. The total value of the benefits, in turn, can be either the actuarial present value of the benefits, <em>see, e.g., Richardson and Richardson, </em>307 Or 370, 378, 796 P2d 179 (1989); <em>Reich and Reich, </em>150 Or App 311, 313, 946 P2d 319 (1997), or the value of the benefits as they are distributed, <em>see, e.g., Cave and Cave, </em>85 Or App 336, 338, 736 P2d 215 (1987). <em>See also Kiser, </em>176 Or App at 632. The court then divides that amount between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Thus, while the time rule reflects a specific conception of the appreciation of pension <em>benefits </em>\u2014 viz., accrual in <em>equal </em>increments for each year of participation in the defined-benefit plan \u2014 when properly applied it does <em>not </em>have the effect that the majority attributes to it. That is, it does <em>not </em>result in an award of benefits that accrue <em>after </em>the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage. We have recognized that proposition since at least 1987. <em>See, e.g., Cave, </em>85 Or App at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In <em>Cave, </em>the dissolution court awarded the wife one-half of the husband\u2019s monthly pension payments \u201cto the extent that those benefits ha[d] vested and accrued on the date that [the] decree bee [ame] final,\u201d including \u201cany future cost of living increases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The husband appealed, arguing that the award of future cost-of-living increases improperly expanded the wife\u2019s share of his pension benefits beyond the marital portion. We disagreed, reasoning that, by the judgment\u2019s terms, \u201cany future cost-of-living increases will be based solely on that portion of the pension vested as of the date of the decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That conclusion recognizes a distinction between the apportionment and the valuation of pension benefits; thus, when a pension benefit\u2019s value is not concretely determined in the dissolution judgment \u2014 thereby leaving the value of the marital portion undefined \u2014 an increase in the pension benefit\u2019s value before that value is concretely determined does <em>not </em>result in an award of benefits that can be understood to have accrued <em>after </em>the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Turning to the application of the time rule here, the court generated a coverature fraction, the numerator of which was 10.42 (husband\u2019s years of service during the marriage) and the denominator of which was 23.58 (husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>total years of service under the plan). That results in a marital <em>portion </em>\u2014 viz., the amount of husband\u2019s pension benefits <em>that accrued before March 1, 1985 </em>\u2014 of 44.18 percent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court then awarded wife one-half of that amount \u2014 22.09 percent of husband\u2019s pension benefits \u2014 through the entry of the QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Nothing about that process conflicts with or modifies <em>any </em>provision of the dissolution judgment; the QDRO simply awarded wife her share of husband\u2019s pension benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>that had accrued <em>before </em>March 1, 1985. In the language of the judgment, wife was awarded \u201cone-half of the monthly benefits that [husband] is entitled to receive from his pension * * * if and when he receives those payments * * * [and she has no] right to claim any retirement benefits which accrue [d] to [husband] after March 1, 1985.\u201d Because the QDRO did not modify the dissolution judgment\u2019s division of property but, rather, implemented the property division in the judgment, I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\"> Conversely, when a dissolution court intends to foreclose the possibility of an increase in value of a given pension benefit \u2014 and, consequently, the value of the marital portion \u2014 it is not difficult to do that. The court can (and would have, even in 1986) simply state that value in the dissolution judgment. <em>See, e.g., Sands and Sands, </em>59 Or App 653, 658, 651 P2d 1387 (1982), <em>rem\u2019d on other grounds, </em>295 Or 443, 666 P2d 834 (1983) (\u201cwife is awarded $190 per month\u201d); <em>Rogers and Rogers, </em>45 Or App 885, 897-98, 609 P2d 877, <em>modified on recons, </em>47 Or App 963, 615 P2d 412 (1980), <em>modified on recons, </em>50 Or App 511, 623 P2d 1108 (1981) (altering dissolution judgment to award wife \u201c$500 per month, payable to her from the total benefits, as and when husband receives them.\u201d); <em>Vinson and Vinson, </em>48 Or App 283, 287, 616 P2d 1180 (1980) (awarding wife \u201c$624 per month, payable as and when husband receives payment\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-5\"> Although husband petitioned to dissolve the parties\u2019 marriage in 1985, the trial court entered the dissolution judgment on January 28, 1986. The judgment provided that the dissolution would become effective one month later, on February 28, 1986. However, in an apparent oversight, most of the printed dates in the judgment refer to 1985. The trial court noticed and corrected some of those dates but left others unchanged \u2014 including the March 1, 1985, date in the provision that divided husband\u2019s retirement benefit, which appears to have been a clerical error, given that the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage became effective precisely one year later, on February 28,1986. The trial court acknowledged that clerical error at the QDRO hearing in 2012 but declined to correct it, despite its authority to do so. <em>See </em>ORCP 71 A (\u201cClerical mistakes in judgments *** arising from oversight * * * may be corrected by the court at any time on its own motion or on the motion of any party and after such notice to all parties who have appeared, if any, as the court orders.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Although that error has no material effect on my analysis, it is worth noting that, given the majority\u2019s opinion today, the trial court will be in an unenviable position if it elects to correct the error on remand. How would it value the marital portion of husband\u2019s pension benefits as of March 1,1986? The majority provides no guidance, except to foreclose the established method by which Oregon courts perform that valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">To a lesser extent, the trial court will face that same difficulty in determining the value of husband\u2019s pension benefits as of March 1, 1985, which highlights another error that I believe lurks beneath the surface of the majority\u2019s analysis. The majority believes, at least implicitly, that Exhibit C to the original dissolution judgment in some way establishes the value of the marital portion of husband\u2019s pension benefits, despite a disparity between the valuation date in Exhibit C for the estimated value of husband\u2019s pension benefits, <em>viz., </em>December 31, 1984, and the date on which wife\u2019s interest in husband\u2019s pension benefits ends under the dissolution judgment, <em>viz., </em>March <em>1, </em>1985. While it may be easy enough\u2014 although still improper \u2014 to dismiss the two-month discrepancy between those dates as immaterial and to continue to assign significance to the dollar amount identified in Exhibit C, it is much more difficult to do that when Exhibit C represents an estimate of the value of husband\u2019s pension benefits on a date that is 14 months <em>before </em>wife\u2019s interest in those benefits ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Furthermore, because husband will receive his pension benefit in a lump sum, rather than in monthly payments over his remaining life, the court will have to fashion a QDRO that determines wife\u2019s share of the lump sum. Given the majority\u2019s conclusion that the time rule cannot be applied, it is not obvious how the court should do that. Nor is it obvious that the result will be different from the result produced under the QDRO that the court entered and the majority rejects.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
