She assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress evidence discovered after a drug-detection dog, Maverick, knocked over her purse while sniffing it and scattered some of its contents onto the ground, including a baggie of methamphetamine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Maverick\u2019s handler, Deputy Dipietro, testified at the suppression hearing that Maverick was \u201ctrained to get to the closest point of the odor that he is able to get. So if he smells the odor coming out of [a] purse, and it\u2019s open, he\u2019s going to put his nose into it,\u201d and that Maverick was trained to \u201calert\u201d aggressively, meaning that he barks, bites, and scratches at the source of the odor once he has pinpointed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Defendant advances a two-part argument on appeal. First, she contends that Maverick\u2019s \u201caggressive\u201d conduct in relation to her purse constituted a search. Second, she argues that the search was unlawful because it was not supported by probable cause. The state responds, among other things, that defendant\u2019s probable cause argument is unpreserved and, in any event, that no search occurred because \u201cnothing in the record begins to suggest that Dipietro intended or expected Maverick to scatter the contents of the purse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">We address only the second part of defendant\u2019s argument, which is dispositive. Defendant\u2019s sole argument with respect to the purported unlawfulness of any search is that the state failed to establish that Maverick\u2019s drug-detection capabilities were sufficiently reliable to furnish probable cause for that search. That argument is unpreserved. Defendant asserts that, although she did not challenge Maverick\u2019s reliability at the suppression hearing, the issue is preserved for appeal because (1) the state, which had the burden of proof on the issue, presented pertinent evidence and argued to the court that Maverick was sufficiently reliable and (2) the court ruled on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The record bears out defendant\u2019s assertion that the state presented evidence on the issue to the trial court\u2014 approximately 13 transcript pages of Dipietro\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>were devoted to the training and certification that he and Maverick received and Maverick\u2019s performance in the field. However, the state\u2019s argument on the issue was cursory, and defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court ruled on the issue depends on an inference that it did so implicitly \u2014 an inference that we are not convinced is warranted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given that the state touched on the issue only in passing and that defendant did not address it at all, the court may not have understood that it was being asked to rule on whether the state had established Maverick\u2019s reliability and, consequently, may not have considered the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Moreover, what is certain is that the trial court did not have the benefit of defendant\u2019s contention that the state did not sufficiently establish Maverick\u2019s reliability and thus did not have the opportunity to consider the purported deficiencies in the state\u2019s proof that defendant now asserts on appeal. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s newly expressed challenge to Maverick\u2019s reliability is not preserved for our review. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (to preserve an argument for appeal, \u201ca party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Because defendant does not advance a preserved argument supporting her contention that the purported search was illegal, we have no basis for reversing the trial court\u2019s ruling on the suppression motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we need not decide whether Maverick\u2019s conduct amounted to a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\"> In asserting that the court ruled on the issue, defendant cites the court\u2019s statement that Maverick\u2019s conduct was \u201cpart of the search process and that\u2014 that the officer then had the right to look in the purse, to see what might be in there.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\"> Defendant does not ask that we review for plain error, and, in any event, the alleged error is not beyond reasonable dispute. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (the prerequisites for plain error review include that the legal point is \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
