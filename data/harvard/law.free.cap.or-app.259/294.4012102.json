The trial court\u2019s findings of fact are binding on appeal if there is sufficient evidence in the record to support them. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). The following facts are taken from or are consistent with the trial court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Defendant was driving a Buick automobile when Officer Andrew Connolly saw him run a red light. Connolly activated his overhead lights, and defendant pulled into a parking lot. After defendant parked, Connolly blocked defendant\u2019s car into a parking space with his patrol car. Connolly asked for defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, insurance card, and registration. When defendant gave Connolly his license and insurance card,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Connolly recognized defendant from a previous encounter. During that encounter, defendant led police on a high speed chase, and police found ammunition and a knife in or near defendant\u2019s car. Connolly was also aware that defendant had been involved in another high speed chase, after which defendant had been subdued, and that defendant had a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon. Based on those safety concerns, Connolly called for backup. He also asked defendant if there were drugs, weapons, or anything illegal in the car. Defendant replied, \u201cNot that I know of[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>A second officer arrived and \u201cmaintained on the car\u201d with defendant. Connolly returned to his patrol car to write up a citation. After completing the citation, Connolly deactivated his lights, walked back to defendant\u2019s car, and returned defendant\u2019s documents. Connolly stood at the driver side window, facing the door. He gave defendant the citation and explained the court process. He told defendant that he was \u201cfree to go[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Connolly then asked for consent to search defendant\u2019s car. Defendant did not consent. Instead, he asked why Connolly wanted to search his car, and Connolly replied that he had safety concerns based on their previous encounter. Defendant remarked that Connolly\u2019s patrol car was parked so close to his car that \u201che didn\u2019t feel that he could move.\u201d Connolly offered to move his patrol car. Defendant did not say whether \u201che wanted [Connolly] to move the car or not[.]\u201d Defendant again asked why Connolly wanted to search his car. Connolly reiterated his safety concerns, asking for consent to search a second time. Defendant \u201cnever answered that question yes or no[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Defendant then said that he ran the red light because he had been \u201clooking in the rearview mirror at a fat lip.\u201d That remark \u201cled to the defendant talking about having been in a fight\u201d the night before. Connolly and defendant discussed whether defendant wanted to press charges against the person who injured him, but defendant said that he did not know if he wanted to press charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Seven to 10 minutes had elapsed since Connolly issued the citation. The second officer was still on the scene. While still standing at defendant\u2019s window talking with defendant, Connolly saw a for-sale sign for a 1998 Buick on defendant\u2019s rear floorboard. Connolly then remembered that the insurance card defendant had given him earlier was for an Acura, not for a Buick. Connolly asked defendant if the Buick was his, and defendant said that it was. Connolly then asked if defendant had insurance on the Buick. Defendant said that his parents took care of the insurance and that his mother had told him that the Buick was currently insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Connolly asked for the insurance card back, and defendant handed it over. Connolly said that he would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to verify the insurance information before defendant would be allowed to leave. Connolly returned to his patrol car and called the insurance company. He was told that defendant\u2019s parents did, in fact, insure four cars, but that the Buick was not one of them. Connolly went back to defendant\u2019s car and told defendant that he was under arrest for knowingly giving an officer false information about liability insurance. ORS 806.055.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Incident to that arrest, Connolly searched defendant\u2019s pocket and found a Visine bottle containing heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress all statements made by him and all physical evidence seized from him. He contended, among other things, that he had been subjected to an unlawfully \u201cexpanded\u201d traffic stop that violated his rights under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant did not argue that the initial stop was unlawful, but asserted that it became unlawful when Connolly, without reasonable suspicion, inquired into matters unrelated to the traffic infraction and prevented him from driving away. The state responded that defendant\u2019s motion should be denied because the stop was not unlawfully extended or, even if it was, the police did not exploit that illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">After a hearing, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. The court found that Connolly\u2019s initial request to search was \u201cwell grounded [.]\u201d It further found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">\u201cthat the stop was terminated, that the defendant was free to leave, that he could have just indicated that he did want to leave and did not. Whether or not the burden is on him to do or the State to make that possible so he doesn\u2019t have to ask that question is a matter for appellate review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In accordance with the trial court\u2019s ruling, the evidence was admitted at defendant\u2019s jury trial, and defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Defendant appeals, renewing the arguments he made to the trial court. He does not assert that Connolly\u2019s initial question \u2014 whether there was anything illegal in the car \u2014 was unlawful. Rather, he contends that he was subjected to an unlawfully extended traffic stop when, after issuing a citation and telling defendant that he was free to go, Connolly made an unrelated request to search defendant\u2019s car. <em>See State v. Gant, </em>237 Or App 74, 78, 239 P3d 269 (2010) (an officer unlawfully extends the scope of an otherwise lawful stop \u201cif the officer questions the person about matters unrelated to the basis for the stop without reasonable suspicion of further criminal activity\u201d). To support his argument, he cites <em>State v. Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or 610, 624, 227 P3d 695 (2010): \u201c[P]olice inquiries unrelated to a traffic violation, when combined with physical restraint or a police show of authority, may result in a restriction of personal freedom that violates Article I, section 9.\u201d Defendant relies upon three cases for the proposition that a person can be restrained, even when an officer says that the person is free to leave: <em>State v. Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, 964 P2d 1007 (1998); <em>State v. Dominguez-Martinez, </em>321 Or 206, 895 P2d 306 (1995); and <em>State v. Alvarez, </em>234 Or App 544, 228 P3d 683, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 57 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The state does not argue that Connolly\u2019s request to search was related to the traffic stop or justified by a reasonable suspicion of further criminal activity. Rather, the state responds that the stop was not unlawfully extended because defendant was free to leave but voluntarily chose to stay. It contends that Connolly twice told defendant that he could go \u2014 once by expressly stating that defendant was free to go, and once by offering to move his patrol car. The state further asserts that Connolly was not required to move his patrol car or take some other action to <em>prove </em>that he meant what he said. Rather, according to the state, Connolly\u2019s assurance that he would move his car was enough to show that defendant was truly at liberty to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Thus, we are required to determine, under the totality of the circumstances, whether the police conduct \u201ctransgressed the limits of Article I, section 9, resulting in an unlawful seizure and, if so, whether the evidence *** should be suppressed because it is a product of an unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>seizure.\u201d <em>Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or at 624. Although we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact to the extent that those findings are supported by evidence in the record, we review without deference whether the trial court correctly applied the law to those facts. <em>Id. </em>at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">As noted, Article I, section 9, precludes unreasonable seizures. \u201c[A] traffic stop is a temporary seizure that occurs when an officer restrains a person\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement.\u201d <em>State v. Amaya, </em>176 Or App 35, 43, 29 P3d 1177 (2001), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>336 Or 616, 89 P3d 1163 (2004). While an officer may stop and briefly detain a motorist to investigate a noncriminal traffic violation, \u201c[p]olice authority to detain a motorist dissipates when the investigation reasonably related to that traffic infraction, the identification of persons, and the issuance of a citation (if any) is completed or reasonably should be completed.\u201d <em>Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or at 623. Accordingly, when a police officer has all of the information necessary to complete a traffic investigation but, instead of ending the encounter, \u201claunch [es] an investigation into a matter that is unrelated to the infraction, [the officer has] unlawfully extended the stop.\u201d <em>State v. Alvarado, </em>257 Or App 612, 627, 307 P3d 540 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">For example, in <em>Dominguez-Martinez, </em>a trooper stopped the defendant and his passenger for a traffic infraction. The trooper leaned his arm on the passenger\u2019s door, said that he would not issue a citation, and told the men that they were free to go. Almost immediately, however, without removing his arm, the trooper asked if the men were transporting contraband and asked to search the car. The court concluded that that trooper\u2019s questioning subjected the defendant to a continued detention. <em>Dominguez-Martinez, </em>321 Or at 213. In conducting its analysis, the court remarked, \u201c[A]t the same time that the trooper was telling [the men] that they were free to go, he stood in the open doorway, and defendant could not have driven away.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">This case is significantly similar to <em>Dominguez-Martinez. </em>By asking defendant for consent to search after issuing a citation, Connolly began a line of questioning that was unrelated to the traffic stop and unsupported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Further, during that unlawful questioning, the police restricted defendant\u2019s freedom of movement. Connolly stood at defendant\u2019s window, looking into defendant\u2019s car. A second officer was present on the scene. Although the record does not indicate precisely where the second officer stood, the presence of a second officer is \u201ca relevant consideration when determining whether there was a show of police authority that restrained defendant\u2019s liberty.\u201d <em>State v. Courtney, </em>242 Or App 321, 333, 255 P3d 577, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 401 (2011). Finally, and most importantly, Connolly physically blocked defendant with his patrol car, such that defendant could not leave. <em>See State v. Mesenbrink, </em>106 Or App 306, 309, 807 P2d 319, <em>rev den, </em>312 Or 235 (1991) (a stop occurs \u201cwhen an officer\u2019s vehicle blocks a vehicle in a manner that would prevent it from being driven away\u201d). The following interchange between defense counsel and Connolly is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">\u201cQ *** [Y]ou told him he was free to go, but he wasn\u2019t actually able to leave at that point, was he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201cA If [defendant] had asked me to move my patrol car at that point, I would have moved my patrol car and he would have been on his way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201cQ But without asking you, he couldn\u2019t have left; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">\u201cA No. Well, it depends what time frame you\u2019re talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">\u201cQ His car was blocked in; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">\u201cA At that point, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">\u201cQ Did it stop being blocked in at some point in time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">\u201cA No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Like the defendant in <em>Dominguez-Martinez, </em>defendant here could not have driven away. In fact, the physical restraint involved in this case is even more pronounced than in <em>Dominguez-Martinez', </em>while the trooper there restricted the defendant\u2019s movement with his body, the officer here prevented defendant\u2019s progress with his patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">In arguing that the stop had ended, the state deem-phasizes the fact that defendant was physically blocked and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>emphasizes Connolly\u2019s and defendant\u2019s verbal exchanges. In particular, the state stresses that Connolly offered to move his patrol car and did nothing bullying or intimidating to suggest that his offer was not genuine. But the state overlooks the principle that an officer\u2019s conduct may negate an officer\u2019s assurance that a stop has ended. As the Oregon Supreme Court explained in <em>Toevs,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">\u201cwhen an officer tells a driver that he or she is free to go, that factor certainly can weigh in favor of concluding that a traffic stop indeed had ended. However, our case law demonstrates that, when viewing the totality of the circumstances, an officer\u2019s <em>conduct </em>after stating that a driver is free to go may <em>negate </em>such a statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">327 Or at 537 (emphasis in original). Although Connolly offered to move his patrol car, he never actually moved it; instead, he continued to question defendant while defendant was still restrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The state finally argues that, when Connolly offered to move his patrol car, \u201c[defendant did not ask Connolly to move his car.\u201d We reject that argument because the obligation to unambiguously end traffic stops does not fall on citizens; it falls on law enforcement officials. <em>See State v. Primeaux, </em>230 Or App 470, 476, 216 P3d 887 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 664 (2011) (state has the burden to prove that the original traffic stop had ended).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Thus, under the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the continued interrogation of defendant was not justified by reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, was unrelated to the traffic infraction, and significantly restricted defendant\u2019s freedom of movement. By their conduct, the officers continued to detain defendant in an extended traffic stop, and defendant was unlawfully seized under Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Having concluded that defendant was subjected to an unlawfully extended stop, we now consider whether the challenged evidence should be suppressed. When a defendant seeks to suppress evidence based on a constitutional violation, the defendant must establish a \u201cminimal factual nexus \u2014 that is, at minimum, the existence of a \u2018but for\u2019 relationship \u2014 between the evidence sought to be suppressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>and prior unlawful police conduct[.]\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 25, 115 P3d 908 (2005) (citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>335 Or 511, 520-21, 73 P3d 282 (2003)). \u201c[M]erely showing that one thing occurred after <em>another </em>\u2014 i.e., a factual relationship based <em>only </em>on temporal proximity \u2014 does not satisfy the minimal factual nexus standard.\u201d <em>Courtney, </em>242 Or App at 227. However, when police discover evidence as the result of unlawful investigatory actions, \u201cit is logical to conclude that *** the evidence would not have been discovered \u2018but for\u2019 the unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">As noted, defendant seeks to suppress all statements made by him and physical evidence seized from him, contending that that evidence would not have been discovered \u201cbut for\u201d the unlawful extension. He relies upon <em>State v. Ayles, </em>348 Or 622, 631-32, 237 P3d 805 (2010), where the court found a \u201cbut for\u201d connection between an unlawful stop involving the retention of the defendant\u2019s identification and a search based on the defendant\u2019s consent because the unlawful police conduct made the defendant available for questioning. Defendant contends that the <em>Ayles </em>reasoning applies in this case- \u2014 \u201cbut for\u201d the unlawfully extended stop, the police would not have been in the position to ask him questions about his insurance, would not have been able to invoke the search incident to arrest exception to search his person, and would not have discovered the heroin in his pocket. The state responds that there is no factual nexus between the illegality and the discovery of the evidence. It contends that subsequent intervening circumstances \u2014 Connolly\u2019s offer to move his patrol car, defendant\u2019s decision to stay, and defendant\u2019s lawful arrest \u2014 broke the causal chain. <em>See Hall, </em>339 Or at 35 (listing \u201cthe existence of any intervening circumstances\u201d as a factor to be considered when determining the existence of a causal connection).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We conclude that defendant has established the required factual nexus. Like the defendant in <em>Ayles, </em>defendant was not free to leave, and the illegal police conduct made defendant\u2019s car available for additional scrutiny and defendant available for questioning. Because that scrutiny and questioning directly yielded evidence that led to defendant\u2019s arrest, we conclude that the statements and heroin would not have been discovered \u201cbut for\u201d the unlawful police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>After a defendant establishes the existence of a minimal factual nexus between the challenged evidence and unlawful police conduct, the state may seek to establish that that evidence is nonetheless admissible by showing that it did not derive from \u2014 \u201cor, stated differently, was [not] obtained by \u2018exploitation\u2019 of \u2014 the unlawful stop.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 22. To make that showing, the state must prove that the disputed evidence (1) would have been inevitably discovered; (2) was independently obtained; or (3) was sufficiently attenuated from the unlawful police conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 25. Determining whether the state has met its burden involves a fact-specific inquiry into the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The state contends that the evidence in this case did not derive from the preceding illegality. The state first argues that the evidence was independently obtained because Connolly developed probable cause for the arrest on his own, as if a \u201clight bulb just went on in [his] head.\u201d The trial court\u2019s findings confirm that Connolly did not <em>independently </em>develop probable cause. According to the trial court, \u201cThe officer then noticed the for-sale sign, then put two and two together in terms of* * * the insurance card the defendant had given him which recited to an Acura, not a Buick, and at least at that point had suspicion that there was a crime.\u201d We are bound by that finding. Because Connolly \u201cput two and two together\u201d immediately after he saw the sign, the state cannot show that the sign did not prompt the suspicion, which served as the basis for Connolly\u2019s probable cause. Thus, the arrest was not caused completely by circumstances that were unrelated to the unlawful extension of defendant\u2019s detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The state alternatively contends that the unlawful extension is sufficiently attenuated from defendant\u2019s arrest. We disagree. <em>State v. Broughton, </em>221 Or App 580, 193 P3d 978 (2008), <em>rev dismissed, </em>348 Or 415 (2010), is instructive. In <em>Broughton, </em>what began as a lawful stop based on a traffic infraction became unlawful when the officer detained the defendant by telling her that he had just seen her leave a known drug house. In response, the defendant told the officer that she had been at the house to return some clothes. After the defendant made that statement, the officer decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>that the defendant was lying because he had seen her go into the house with nothing in her hands. The officer\u2019s suspicion that the defendant was lying then prompted the officer to request consent to search the defendant\u2019s car and person. The defendant consented and drug evidence was found. In determining that that evidence should have been suppressed, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">\u201cBut for the unlawful extension of the traffic stop, the officer would not have decided that defendant was lying about the reason for her visit to the Alpine Street house, which prompted him to request consent to search defendant\u2019s car and defendant\u2019s person. Because the unlawful extension of the traffic stop and defendant\u2019s consent occurred in close temporal proximity, and because no intervening circumstances or mitigating factors exist, we agree with defendant that her consent derived from the officer\u2019s unlawful extension of the stop and that the evidence should therefore be suppressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">This case is much like <em>Broughton. </em>But for the unlawful extension, Connolly would not have seen the sign, which led him to believe that there was something wrong with defendant\u2019s insurance. Connolly\u2019s suspicion then prompted him to ask defendant questions about his insurance and to demand the return of defendant\u2019s insurance card. In the same way that the defendant in <em>Broughton </em>consented to being searched in response to the officer\u2019s request, defendant here made statements about his insurance in response to Connolly\u2019s questioning, not on his own initiative. Further, defendant made the challenged statements only seven to 10 minutes after Connolly began the unlawfully extended stop, so those events occurred in close temporal proximity.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">In the end, we conclude that Connolly\u2019s request to search defendant\u2019s car and the unlawful extension of defendant\u2019s detention started a chain of events that led directly to defendant\u2019s arrest and discovery of the evidence. If Connolly had not unlawfully asked defendant for consent to search his car, he would not have been looking into defendant\u2019s car, would not have seen the for-sale sign, would not have become suspicious about defendant\u2019s insurance, and would not have asked the questions that elicited defendant\u2019s response and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>led to defendant\u2019s arrest. Therefore, the discovery of the evidence incident to that arrest is not attenuated from the illegal police conduct. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\"> Defendant raises additional bases, arguments, and authorities for reversing the trial court\u2019s decision in a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief. Because we reverse and remand on the basis that the officers conducted an unlawfully extended stop in contravention of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, we do not discuss the other bases, arguments, and authorities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\"> Defendant was unable to produce a registration certificate.
