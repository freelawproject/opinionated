Mother asserts that the court erred in concluding that she had not made sufficient progress toward ameliorating the conditions that gave rise to the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the children. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The juvenile court took jurisdiction over the children in February 2012, primarily because of mother\u2019s \u201cuse of alcohol and/or controlled substances.\u201d In February 2013, the court held a permanency hearing. At the time of the hearing, W was seven years old and A was approximately 14 months old. As a result of both this case and an earlier case, W had been in foster care for nearly half of her life. A had been in foster care for all of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">After the hearing, the court issued a permanency judgment for each child concluding that the Department of Human Services (DHS) had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family but that mother had not made sufficient progress to make it possible for the children to safely return home. Regarding mother\u2019s progress, both judgments state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">\u201cMother is involved in the case and has not made sufficient progress toward meeting the expectations set forth in the service agreement, letter of expectation and/or case plan, and the child cannot be safely returned to mother\u2019s care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">The judgments further state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">\u201cThe case plan of reunification should be changed to a different plan because *** notwithstanding the reasonable reunification efforts of DHS, the child cannot be safely returned to the care of either mother or father at the time of the hearing, and the evidence does not support a determination under ORS 419B.476(4)(c) and (5)(c) that further efforts by the agency will make it possible for the child to safely return home within a reasonable time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Mother appeals, arguing that the juvenile court did not have authority to change the permanency plans for the children from reunification to adoption. Changes to permanency plans are governed by ORS 419B.476. As relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>here, ORS 419B.476(2) provides that, at a permanency hearing, if the permanency plan is reunification, the court shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">\u201cdetermine whether [DHS] has made reasonable efforts * * * to make it possible for the ward to safely return home and whether the parent has made sufficient progress to make it possible for the ward to safely return home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">On appeal, mother challenges the court\u2019s conclusion that she had not made sufficient progress. We view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s disposition and assess whether, when so viewed, the record was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. P., </em>257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Mother makes two alternative arguments. First, she argues that the state failed to prove that she had not made sufficient progress for the children to safely return home <em>at the time of the permanency hearing.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Second, she argues that, even if the state proved that she had not made sufficient progress for the children to return home at the time of the permanency hearing, it failed to prove that she had not made sufficient progress for the children to return home <em>within a reasonable period of time.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">We reject mother\u2019s first <em>argument </em>\u2014 viz., that the state failed to prove that she had not made sufficient progress for the children to safely return home at the time of the permanency hearing \u2014 because it is unpreserved. At the permanency hearing, mother informed the court that she had been clean and sober for approximately six months, was employed, and had housing. She had started outpatient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>treatment but had stopped when her health insurance stopped paying for it. She was attending AA and NA meetings and participating in individual counseling. Mother asserted that she was making progress, but she did not assert that she was ready for the children to return to her care immediately. To the contrary, she asked for a \u201c90-day extension\u201d to show that she could continue to make progress. Thus, mother did not preserve her appellate argument that, \u201cby the time of the permanency hearing, mother was clean and sober and her children could return to her care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">We also reject mother\u2019s second <em>argument </em>\u2014 viz., that the state failed to prove that she had not made sufficient progress for the children to return home within a reasonable period of time \u2014 because, even assuming that the state was required to prove that fact, it presented sufficient evidence to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">As mother acknowledges, <em>in Dept. of Human Services v. D. L. H, </em>251 Or App 787, 284 P3d 1233, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>253 Or App 600, 292 P3d 565, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 649 (2012), we held that \u201cthere is no statutory requirement under ORS 419B.476 or any other authority that requires the juvenile court to find that a parent cannot be reunited with the child within a reasonable time before the court changes the plan from reunification to adoption.\u201d Mother argues that <em>D. L. H. </em>was wrongly decided. She contends that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201creading ORS 419B.476(2)(a) in context of the related provisions and policies of the juvenile code illuminates that the court\u2019s central inquiry at a permanency hearing is whether the department has presented sufficient evidence to prove that the parent\u2019s progress toward ameliorating the adjudicated bases for jurisdiction is insufficient to allow the child to return home within a reasonable period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">The state responds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">\u201cThere is no requirement that the juvenile court consider whether a child can safely be returned to parent \u2018in a reasonable time\u2019 when deciding whether to change the permanent plan for the child from reunification to adoption. Because the court was not required to make that finding, whether there is evidence to support it is irrelevant and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>court was authorized to change the children\u2019s permanency plans.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We need not revisit <em>D. L. H. </em>because the juvenile court in this case considered whether mother had made sufficient progress for the children to be returned within a reasonable time and determined that she had not, and the court\u2019s determination is supported by the record. At the permanency hearing, the court acknowledged that mother had taken some steps to address her substance abuse problems but expressed concern about whether those steps justified continuation of the plan for reunification. The court told mother, \u201cI think you\u2019ve done some good work * * *. It\u2019s a matter of, particularly with [W,] this [has] really been going on a long time for her, and she can\u2019t afford to wait longer for the court to decide what we\u2019re doing here.\u201d The court also observed, \u201cIt seems like the time has come and gone to move to the plan of adoption for [W and A].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In the permanency judgments, the court found that mother has a \u201clongstanding history of substance abuse\u201d and has had \u201cdifficulty establishing a stable lifestyle.\u201d The court also found that mother had \u201cengaged in individual counseling on and off,\u201d but, because of mother\u2019s mental health and addiction diagnoses, \u201clonger term therapy is recommended.\u201d The court also indicated that mother\u2019s progress was belated and incomplete and, in light of the children\u2019s circumstances, did not justify continuation of the plan for reunification. Specifically, the judgment regarding W states, \u201cGiven mother\u2019s relatively recent efforts to engage in only some of her recommended services and given the child\u2019s history, it is appropriate to authorize moving to the concurrent plan [of adoption].\u201d Similarly, the judgment regarding A states, \u201cMother has never parented the child and given her relatively recent efforts to engage in only some of her recommended services, it is appropriate to authorize moving to the concurrent plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Thus, the permanency hearing record and the judgments establish that the court considered and rejected mother\u2019s claim that she had made sufficient progress for the children to safely return to her care within a reasonable time. Simply put, the court concluded that, although mother was making some progress, it was not reasonable to wait to change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the permanency plan. That conclusion is supported by the record, including evidence of mother\u2019s history of substance abuse combined with her belated and incomplete progress through treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Under ORS 419B.476(4)(c), if the court had concluded that \u201cfurther efforts [would have made] it possible for the [children] to safely return home within a reasonable time,\u201d the court could have ordered mother to \u201cparticipate in specific services for a specific period of time and make specific progress within that period of time.\u201d But the court did not. To the contrary, as set out above, the court concluded that \u201cthe evidence does not support a determination under ORS 419(b).476(4)(c) and (5)(c) that further efforts by the agency will make it possible for the child to safely return home within a reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\"> Specifically, mother argues that, \u201cby the time of the permanency hearing, mother was clean and sober and her children could return to her care.\u201d According to mother,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">\u201cthe department failed to present any evidence to prove that mother continued to have a substance abuse problem that endangered the health and safety of her children. Instead it was undisputed that, at the time of the permanency hearing, mother had been clean and sober for roughly six months, was compliant with her outpatient drug and alcohol treatment, and had reengaged in counseling. Further, mother had a job and housing for her children\u2019s immediate return to her care.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-10\"> Mother contends that, \u201c[e]ven if the children could not immediately return home, the department failed to present any evidence that waiting an additional 90 days (as mother requested) was an unreasonable amount of time for mother\u2019s children to wait in light of their specific needs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
