Youth appeals the resulting judgment, contending that the juvenile court erred in ordering him to pay for his psychological evaluation as a condition of probation. The court ordered youth to \u201cpay and complete a Psychological Evaluation and follow all treatment recommendations,\u201d reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">\u201cI do think it\u2019s \u2014 in a way \u2014 a way of making amends also given the fact that nobody is asking for restitution, which could be substantial, and for the expense that the system has undergone in terms of police time investigating, that asking you to pay the cost of your psychological evaluation is more than reasonable, so I am going to direct that to occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The state concedes, and we agree, that ordering youth to pay for his own psychological evaluation was outside the court\u2019s dispositional authority under ORS 419C.446(2). That statute provides that \u201c[t]he court may specify particular requirements to be observed during the probation consistent with recognized juvenile court practice,\u201d followed by a nonexclusive list of such requirements. However, the court\u2019s authority under the \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d text of ORS 4190.446(2) is not unlimited; rather \"'any additional requirement must be of the same kind as those specifically set out in the statute.\u2019\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Ware, </em>144 Or App 614, 616-17, 927 P2d 1114 (1996) (quoting <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Gallagher, </em>79 Or App 39, 41, 717 P2d 1242 (1986)). We agree with the parties in this case that ordering youth to pay for a psychological evaluation is not \u201cof 'the same kind\u201d as those requirements enumerated in ORS 4190.446(2). Accordingly, the court erred in imposing it as a condition of youth\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment deleting the requirement that youth pay for his psychological evaluation; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
