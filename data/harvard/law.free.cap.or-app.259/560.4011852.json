J.</author>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">A jury convicted defendant of unlawful possession of methamphetamine, ORS 475.894, and unlawful delivery of methamphetamine within 1,000 feet of a school, ORS 475.892.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant appeals, raising four assignments of error, three of which assert that the trial court erred in entering a judgment based on a nonunanimous jury verdict. We reject those assignments of error without discussion. Defendant asserts in his first assignment of error that the court erred by allowing a detective\u2019s testimony regarding defendant\u2019s credibility. The state concedes that the admission of that testimony was error, but argues that it was harmless. We conclude that admission of that testimony was not harmless and, therefore, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Our review to determine whether an evidentiary error was harmless requires us to review all pertinent portions of the record. <em>State v. Sierra-Depina, </em>230 Or App 86, 88, 213 P3d 863, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 290 (2009). With that standard in mind, the facts of this case are as follows. Following up on a tip suggesting that defendant had manufactured methamphetamine in a motel room, Baker City Detective Rilee followed defendant to a restaurant across from Baker High School. Once there, Rilee observed defendant carry a brown paper bag from his truck into the restaurant, and informed Oregon State Detective Conner, who was also observing the area, of what he had seen. A few minutes later, Conner entered the restaurant where he observed defendant sitting at a table with a woman, Chase. Defendant left the bag with Chase upon leaving the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Connor questioned Chase after defendant\u2019s departure and searched the bag that defendant had left with her. The bag contained about 20 grams of methamphetamine and related paraphernalia, including two glass pipes with white methamphetamine-like residue on them and a leather case with \u201cM Watts\u201d (defendant\u2019s first initial and last name) written on it. During questioning, Chase told Connor that she had set up methamphetamine deals in the past and was at the restaurant setting up a methamphetamine deal for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Meanwhile, another officer, Davidson, conducted a traffic stop with defendant. When Rilee arrived he questioned defendant, who denied any knowledge of the methamphetamine and paraphernalia found in Chase\u2019s possession. According to defendant, Chase owned the methamphetamine found in the bag and was responsible for writing \u201cM Watts\u201d on the leather case. The officers searched defendant\u2019s truck, however, and discovered a man\u2019s coat with a methamphetamine pipe in the pocket. At trial, defendant claimed that he was in Baker City to hunt, fish, and possibly buy car parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Officer Rilee testified at trial that, based on his training and experience, defendant\u2019s pauses during their conversation indicated deception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">\u201cI asked * * * if he\u2019d ever been with somebody that had purchased methamphetamine or if he has ever purchased methamphetamine. I asked [defendant] if he had ever sold methamphetamine. And then after another pause I received a reply of, \u2018No.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">After answering questions about his training in analyzing answers to interview questions, Rilee gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Given [your interrogation] training and experience, did you use any of that education as it relates to what you saw in [defendant\u2019s] responses to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">\u201c[Rilee]: Yes. I have been trained to look at all facets of a person\u2019s answers that they give; the verbal cues, the tone and pitch of their voice, the, you know \u2014 whether or not they\u2019re sitting closed up and they\u2019re not accepting anything you tell them or whether they\u2019re open and looking at you and they seem receptive to your questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">\u201cAs far as when I interview somebody and I\u2019m getting answers right away and keep getting answers right away\u2014 there\u2019s no pausing \u2014 as soon as I ask another question and there\u2019s a pause\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\">\u201cWhen I asked a question, after numerous immediate answers and somebody pauses, <em>that\u2019s an indicator to me that there\u2019s a deceptive answer.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">(Emphasis added). Defendant\u2019s counsel unsuccessfully objected to those statements. The judge later instructed the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the testimony was Rilee\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d and \u201c[i]t may be worth something, [or] it may be worth nothing,\u201d and that they should consider it and draw their own opinions. Defendant testified later in the trial regarding his version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">On appeal, defendant contends that Rilee\u2019s testimony was an improper comment on credibility. <em>See State v. Lowell, </em>249 Or App 364, 368, 277 P3d 588, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012) (explaining that a witness may not give an opinion as to whether or not he believes another witness, or that another witness is honest or truthful). He argues that the admission of that testimony was not harmless, and that the court\u2019s jury instruction did not cure \u2014 but actually worsened \u2014 the resulting prejudice. The state concedes that Rilee\u2019s testimony was erroneously admitted. We agree with the state\u2019s concession in that regard. <em>See id. </em>The state argues, however, that the error was harmless. In support of its position, the state points to Connor\u2019s and Rilee\u2019s observation of defendant\u2019s activities in the restaurant, the methamphetamine and paraphernalia found in the bag that defendant had taken from his truck, and the methamphetamine paraphernalia found in defendant\u2019s truck during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">A judgment of conviction will be affirmed, despite the erroneous admission of evidence, if there is little likelihood that the error affected the verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). In evaluating whether evi-dentiary error is harmless, we do not weigh the evidence or act as factfinder, but instead look at the likely effect of error on the verdict. <em>Id. </em>We first determine the issue to which our harmless error analysis applies and then analyze the erroneously admitted evidence in light of other evidence in the record pertaining to that issue. <em>State v. Johnson, 225 </em>Or App 545, 550, 202 P3d 225 (2009) (citing <em>State v. Ennis, </em>212 Or App 240, 262, 158 P3d 510, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 223 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Here, we cannot conclude that the erroneous admission of Rilee\u2019s testimony was harmless. The focus of our harmless error analysis is the jury\u2019s determination that defendant <em>knowingly </em>possessed and delivered methamphetamine under ORS 475.892. As the jury was instructed, a necessary element of both counts is a finding that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>acted with knowledge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The erroneous admission of evidence that relates to such a \u201ccentral factual issue\u201d is more likely to affect the jury\u2019s determination and less likely to be harmless. <em>State v. Roller, </em>201 Or App 166, 173, 118 P3d 804 (2005) (citing <em>State v. Marrington, </em>335 Or 555, 566, 73 P3d 911 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">To find defendant guilty, the jury must have found that defendant acted with knowledge. If the jury believed Chase, it would believe that defendant acted with full knowledge that the bag contained methamphetamine. However, if the jury believed defendant, it would believe that defendant had no knowledge of the methamphetamine or paraphernalia recovered that day. Thus, the jury had to assess credibility in order to determine whether or not defendant acted with the requisite knowledge. In these circumstances, Rilee\u2019s testimony regarding defendant\u2019s credibility was likely to be harmful. <em>See Lowell, </em>249 Or App at 370 (explaining that, because the case hinged on a credibility contest between the parties, testimony regarding the credibility of either was likely to be harmful).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Further, the jury\u2019s determination was likely affected by Rilee\u2019s testimony that he had the training and experience to make such a credibility determination. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that there was a significant risk that a detective\u2019s testimony that a defendant was not credible affected the jury\u2019s verdict because it was couched in terms of his expertise and training in detecting untruthfulness). In view of those circumstances, we cannot conclude that there is little likelihood that the error affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Convictions for unlawful possession of methamphetamine and unlawful delivery of methamphetamine within 1,000 feet of a school reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> The jury also acquitted defendant of two related charges: unlawful possession of a firearm, ORS 166.250, and unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine, ORS 475.886.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\"> The court\u2019s jury instruction defined \u201cknowingly\u201d as an act carried out \u201cwith an awareness either that his conduct is of a particular nature or that a particular circumstance exists.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
