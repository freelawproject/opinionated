J.</author>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Plaintiffs are property owners who use only organic and sustainable farming and forestry practices. Some of their neighbors use pesticides and other chemicals that, plaintiffs allege, migrate onto their property and into their persons. In an earlier case, plaintiffs Hale and Wroncy filed an action against a neighbor alleging that the chemical intrusion was a trespass. <em>See Hale v. Klemp, </em>220 Or App 27, 184 P3d 1185 (2008). The neighbor raised an affirmative defense based on ORS 30.930 to 30.947, commonly known as the \u201cRight to Farm and Right to Forest Act\u201d (the Act), which provides immunity to property owners who are sued for trespass or nuisance resulting from agricultural and forestry practices unless the practice is alleged to have caused death or serious injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hale and Wroncy then voluntarily dismissed their action against the neighbor, pursuant to ORCP 54 A, but \u2014 based on the fact that their complaint had <em>alleged </em>trespass \u2014 they had to pay defendants\u2019 attorney fees. <em>See Hale, </em>220 Or App at 34 (construing ORS 30.938<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In this case, plaintiffs name the state as defendant and seek a declaratory judgment that the Act deprives them of a remedy in violation of the Remedy Clause in Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution, which provides that, \u201cevery man shall have remedy by due course of law for injury done him in his person, property, or reputation.\u201d On the state\u2019s motion under ORCP 21 A, the trial court dismissed the case with prejudice, determining that plaintiffs had not stated a justiciable controversy. Plaintiffs appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>On an appeal from a grant of a motion to dismiss, we assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts alleged in the complaint. <em>Doe v. Lake Oswego School District, </em>353 Or 321, 297 P3d 1287 (2013). We review legal conclusions for errors of law. <em>Becker v. Pieper, </em>176 Or App 635, 641, 32 P3d 912 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Plaintiffs allege that their property, crops, animals, and persons have suffered or will suffer injury caused by the drift of chemicals onto their properties from the surrounding properties. Further, plaintiffs believe that they are unable to pursue common-law remedies for their neighbors\u2019 alleged nuisance and trespass because, under the Act, generally accepted, reasonable, and prudent farm and forest practices are in most instances immune from liability for nuisance and trespass, and the availability of attorney fees acts as a deterrent. ORS 30.930(2), (4); ORS 30.936(1); ORS 30.938. They therefore brought this action against the state, seeking a declaration that the Act, by depriving them of a remedy, violates Article I, section 10. Without reaching the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional argument, the trial court concluded that plaintiffs had not alleged a justiciable controversy and granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss on that basis. The court did not explain its reasoning orally or in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On appeal, the state argues that the trial court\u2019s disposition was correct because a declaration that the Act is unconstitutional \u201ccould not affect the ability of plaintiffs\u2019 neighbors, who are not parties, to nonetheless invoke the Act\u2019s immunity provision in a future lawsuit.\u201d Plaintiffs, for their part, contend that their complaint alleges present facts \u2014 the existence of the Act and Article I, section 10 \u2014 and that a judgment in their favor would have the effect of clarifying their \u201crights\u201d under the \u201cconstitution [and] statute.\u201d ORS 28.020.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In particular, they assert that a declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>that the Act violates Article I, section 10, will clarify their right to seek relief from their neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The declaratory judgment statutes, ORS 28.010 to 28.160, have an uneasy relationship with the constitutional concept of justiciability. The statutes announce that their purpose \u201cis to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status and other legal relations, and [they are] to be liberally construed and administered.\u201d ORS 28.120. \u201cDeclaratory judgment is preventive justice, designed to relieve parties of uncertainty by adjudicating their rights and duties <em>before wrongs have actually been committed\u201d Beason v. Harcleroad, </em>105 Or App 376, 380, 805 P2d 700 (1991) (emphasis added); <em>see also Recall Bennett Committee v. Bennett, </em>196 Or 299, 322, 249 P2d 479 (1952) (\u201c[T]he action for declaratory judgment \u2018is an instrumentality to be wielded in the interest of preventative justice [.]\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Cobb v. Harrington, </em>144 Tex 360, 190 SW 2d 709 (1945) (quoting Anderson, <em>Declaratory Judgments </em>\u00a7 3 at 12).)). The statutory authority to issue declaratory judgments, however, is constrained by constitutional justicia-bility requirements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has held that the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act does not give courts authority to issue declaratory rulings \u201cin a vacuum; they must resolve an actual or justiciable controversy.\u201d <em>TVKO v. Howland, </em>335 Or 527, 534, 73 P3d 905 (2003); <em>Brown v. Oregon State Bar, </em>293 Or 446, 449, 648 P2d 1289 (1982). Courts cannot exercise jurisdiction over nonjusticiable controversies because a court cannot render advisory opinions. <em>Pendleton School Dist. v. State of Oregon, </em>345 Or 596, 604, 200 P3d 133 (2009). Thus, if a claim for a declaratory judgment does not involve a justiciable controversy, a court does not have jurisdiction to consider it. <em>Hudson v. Feder, </em>115 Or App 1, 5, 836 P2d 779, <em>rev den, </em>314 Or 727 (1992). The tension is apparent between declaratory judgments, which are invoked \u201cto settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status and other legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>relations,\u201d ORS 28.020, and justiciability requirements, which prohibit advisory opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">To accommodate the declaratory judgment statutes with the constitutional justiciability requirement, the Supreme Court and this court invoke the following language from <em>Brown, </em>293 Or at 449:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201cIn order for a court to entertain an action for declaratory relief, the complaint must present a justiciable controversy. Justiciability is a vague standard but entails several definite considerations. A controversy is justiciable, as opposed to abstract, where there is an actual and substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interests. <em>Cummings Constr. v. School Dist. No. 9, </em>242 Or 106, 408 P2d 80 (1965). The controversy must involve present facts as opposed to a dispute which is based on future events of a hypothetical issue. <em>Id. </em>A justiciable controversy results in specific relief through a binding decree as opposed to an advisory opinion which is binding on no one. <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\"><em>See also TVKO, </em>335 Or at 534 (\u201cTo be justiciable, a controversy must involve a dispute based on present facts rather than on contingent or hypothetical events.\u201d); <em>Morgan v. Sisters School District #6, </em>353 Or 189, 195-96, 301 P3d 419 (2013) (citing <em>TVKO); Poddar v. Clatsop County, </em>167 Or App 162, 164-65, 2 P3d 929, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>168 Or App 556, 7 P3d 677, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 193 (2000) (citing <em>Brown). </em>The leading cases, then \u2014 despite a variety of considerations and outcomes \u2014 establish two irreducible requirements for justiciability: The dispute must involve present facts, and it must be a dispute in which a prevailing plaintiff can receive meaningful relief from a losing defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Regarding the \u201cpresent facts\u201d requirement, the Supreme Court has held that, if the dispute involves the interpretation of an existing statute that could'apply to a party in the future, that situation itself creates a present fact. For example, in <em>Pendleton School Dist., </em>the plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring that the had legislature failed adequately to fund the school district, contrary to a newly enacted constitutional amendment. The state maintained that, especially with respect to future biennia, the case did not present a justiciable controversy. The court disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u201cThe issue whether Article VIII, section 8, imposes a duty on the legislature to fund the public school system at a specified level every biennium presents a set of present facts regarding the interpretation of a constitutional provision; it is not simply an abstract inquiry about a possible future event. <em>See Savage [v. Munn], </em>317 Or [283,] 292 [, 856 P2d 298 (1993)] (\u2018The workings of Measure 5 are \u201cpresent facts,\u201d not simply possible future events.\u2019); <em>Brown, </em>293 Or at 450 (\u2018present facts\u2019 were \u2018plaintiff\u2019s existing statutory duty\u2019 in particular factual context). <em>Compare Tillamook [Co. v. State Board of Forestry], </em>302 Or [404,] 413 [, 730 P2d 1214 (1986)] (matter not justiciable when parties sought declaratory judgment to prohibit speculative future legislation, as that would be advisory opinion).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">345 Or at 606. In a situation predating <em>Pendleton School Dist, </em>this court reached a similar conclusion. In <em>Advocates for Effective Regulation v. City of Eugene, </em>160 Or App 292, 981 P2d 368 (1999), the plaintiffs challenged a local initiative imposing limits on the use of toxic substances and creating a Toxics Board to implement the limitation. Plaintiffs claimed (among other things) that the initiative conflicted with state law. <em>Id. </em>at 298. At the time of the challenge, the local initiative had never been enforced; in fact, the Toxics Board had not even promulgated implementing rules. <em>Id. </em>In rejecting the city\u2019s claim that the question was merely hypothetical and therefore not justiciable, we first observed, \u201cA facial challenge to the validity of an enactment generally presents *** a concrete controversy\u201d and is therefore justiciable. <em>Id. </em>at 299. We went on to identify the issue as \u201cwhether the Initiative \u2014 independent of any future action by the Toxics Board \u2014 \u201d conflicted with state law. We held, \u201cThat question is not hypothetical, and its answer requires no speculation as to future facts. Either the Initiative on its face conflicts with state law, or it does not.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We are unable to discern a meaningful distinction between the present case and <em>Pendleton School Dist. </em>and <em>Advocates for Effective Regulation. </em>Indeed, the facts in this case are more compelling than the facts in those cases. In <em>Pendleton School Dist., </em>the court held that an action <em>not yet taken </em>by the legislature \u2014 failure to appropriate sufficient funds <em>in future biennia </em>to meet constitutional requirements \u2014 created a present, concrete controversy. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Advocates for Effective Regulation, </em>the allegedly unlawful local action had not even been completely implemented. Here, the legislature has already acted and plaintiffs seek only a judgment declaring that the enactment is unconstitutional. Under <em>Pendleton School Dist. </em>and <em>Advocates for Effective Regulation, </em>the controversy between plaintiffs and the state involves \u201cpresent facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Thus, the question here reduces to whether the court can provide plaintiffs \u201cspecific relief through a binding decree as opposed to an advisory opinion which is binding on no one.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>293 Or at 449. As the state correctly points out, plaintiffs\u2019 neighbors are not parties to this case and are, for that reason, technically speaking, not bound by its outcome:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u201cBecause plaintiffs\u2019 neighbors are not parties to this case, a declaratory judgment against the state cannot bind them and will not provide plaintiffs with the relief they seek \u2014 the ability to sue their neighbors. In other words, even if plaintiffs obtained a judgment against the state declaring the Act unconstitutional, their neighbors could nonetheless raise the Act\u2019s [grant of] immunity in any future nuisance or trespass action that plaintiffs file. Because plaintiffs cannot obtain a meaningful judicial remedy <em>in this action, </em>the case is not justiciable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">(Emphasis added.) We are reluctant to attribute to the state the untenable position that a judicial decision declaring a statute to be unconstitutional has no effect on nonparties in the same jurisdiction, who would therefore remain at liberty to assert the unconstitutional statute and litigate its validity <em>de novo. </em>If that were the case, every public school in the country except those in Topeka, Kansas, would have remained free to engage in racial segregation until that particular school relitigated <em>Brown v. Board of Education, </em>347 US 483, 74 S Ct 686, 98 L Ed 873 (1954). That is not the law. <em>See Cooper v. Aaron, </em>358 US 1, 18, 78 S Ct 1401, 3 L Ed 2d 5 (1958) (decision in <em>Brown </em>binds nonparties such as Ohio officials). We presume, instead \u2014 because of the phrase <em>\u201cin this action\u201d </em>\u2014 that the state\u2019s argument is that a judgment in this case would not have an actual concrete impact on plaintiffs\u2019 rights <em>vis-a-vis </em>an allegedly trespassing or nuisance-producing neighbor until the occurrence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>hypothetical events that are <em>not </em>alleged. A declaration that the Act is unconstitutional would provide relief to plaintiffs only if (1) they continue to have the motive and means to bring an action in trespass or nuisance against a neighbor within the jurisdiction of the court that finally decides this action; (2) the hypothetical action is one that <em>would have conferred </em>immunity under the Act \u2014 that is, the hypothetical action involved a farm, farming practice, forestland, forest practice, and pesticide as those terms are defined in the Act, ORS 30.930<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and did not claim death or serious physical injury, ORS 30.936(2)(b); and (3) the hypothetical action does not settle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mindful that \u201cthe difference between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>a potential injury * * * and a speculative one * * * is not self-evident\u201d and that \u201c[s]orting one from the other is as much art as science,\u201d <em>Morgan v. Sisters School District #6, </em>241 Or App 483, 494, 251 P3d 207 (2011), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>353 Or 189, 301 P3d 419 (2013), we nonetheless conclude that a judgment declaring the Act unconstitutional will have a concrete impact on plaintiffs in this case only if several contingencies occur. The connection is too speculative. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\"> The primary operative section of the Act, ORS 30.936, provides, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201c(1) No farming or forest practice on lands zoned for farm or forest use shall give rise to any private right of action or claim for relief based on nuisance or trespass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u201c(2) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to a right of action or claim for relief for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">\u201c(a) Damage to commercial agricultural products; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">\u201c(b) Death or serious physical injury as defined in ORS 161.015.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-11\"> ORS 30.938 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-12\">\u201cIn any action or claim for relief alleging nuisance or trespass and arising from a practice that is alleged by either party to be a farming or forest practice, the prevailing party shall be entitled to judgment for reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred at trial and on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\"> ORS 28.020 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">\u201cAny person interested under a deed, will, written contract or other writing constituting a contract, or whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected by a constitution, statute, municipal charter, ordinance, contract or franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under any such instrument, constitution, statute, municipal charter, ordinance, contract or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b405-5\"> At least with respect to one aspect of justiciability' \u2014 standing\u2014the Supreme Court has held that there is no constitutional constraint on the legislature\u2019s authority to create justiciable controversies. <em>Kellas v.
