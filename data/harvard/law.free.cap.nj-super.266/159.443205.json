Schmid, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>535, 423 A.2d 615 (1980), <em>appeal dismissed sub nom. Princeton Univ. v. Schmid, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>100, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>867, 70 L.Ed.2d 855 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Plaintiffs argue that they should have been allowed to distribute leaflets at the defendants\u2019 privately owned shopping malls under the three-part test in <em>Schmid, </em>and that privately owned shopping malls have an obligation to accommodate plaintiffs\u2019 exercise of free speech rights under common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Our review of the record in light of the arguments presented satisfies us that the findings and conclusions of the Chancery Judge are amply supported by the record. <em>See Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). The qualitative weight of the factors involved in application of the <em>Schmid </em>test balances here in favor of the mall owners, particularly in light of the Chancery Judge\u2019s findings, adequately supported by the record, of the essentially commercial nature of the shopping malls. <em>Cf. State v. Guice, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>607, 621 A.2d 553 (Law Div.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 alternative' grounds for relief based on a claim that New Jersey\u2019s common law requires (or should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>construed or modified to require) that the mall owners allow plaintiffs to engage in expressional activity on defendants\u2019 properties. Such a modification of the common law is not supported by precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In light of our determination, we need not address the cross-appeal of the defendants JMB Income Properties, Ltd.-XI<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Prutaub Joint Venture in which they assert that a finding in favor of plaintiffs would constitute a taking of defendants\u2019 properties and a denial of their right of free speech. We also find it unnecessary to address plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to various regulations adopted by certain of the malls restricting the scope, nature and extent of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Ciolino in his written decision of July 25, 1991 reported at 266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>195, 628 A.2d 1094 (Ch.Div.1991).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-12\"> Incorrectly denominated \"J.M.B.
