The State argues that the trial court erred in: (1) admitting evidence concerning defendant\u2019s \u201cillusory\u201d 1987 site plan approval which was conditioned upon a permanent access defendant had relinquished to the State in 1983; (2) admitting \u201cspeculative evidence\u201d that defendant\u2019s site plan would be reapproved based on access to and from the condemned property by way of an unimproved easement in which defendant had no legal interest; (3) admitting the evidence in contravention of a pretrial order, thereby violating the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine; and (4) excluding testimony regarding a 1983 appraisal of the subject property. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Defendant originally owned 16.3 acres of undeveloped land in Eatontown fronting on Hope Road, near its intersection with State Highway 36 and the Garden State Parkway. In a negotiated settlement on October 12, 1983, the State acquired the front-westerly 7.155 acres of defendant\u2019s parcel, as well as defendant\u2019s access to Hope Road, for the purpose of constructing ramps for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the Route 18 freeway. The 1983 deed provided that defendant would have a temporary right of access from its remaining 9.164-acre parcel (the subject property), across the State\u2019s parcel to Hope Road \u201cuntil such time as the aforesaid Freeway is constructed and open for traffic and/or an alternate means of access is provided by the construction of Ferncliff Drive Extension to [defendant\u2019s] remaining lands.\u201d Ferncliff Drive, an existing roadway, was to be extended to the easterly corner of the subject property, to provide access for the property by way of the extension and other public streets to Wyckoff Road. The extension was also intended to provide a means of access for a cemetery, contiguous to the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In 1985 or 1986, the owner of the property to the east of the subject property negotiated with the Borough of Eatontown and the State for changes in the proposed Ferncliff Drive extension to accommodate a subdivision known as Deepwood Estates. Deep-wood\u2019s developer sought to provide access to the cemetery by a means other than the proposed Ferncliff Drive extension. Sometime prior to 1988, the developer and defendant conveyed a twenty-foot easement across their properties to the Borough for the purpose of providing access to and from the cemetery to Wyckoff Road. The \u201ccemetery\u201d easement runs easterly through a portion of defendant\u2019s property and bends in a southerly direction across the Deepwood tract several hundred feet where it connects with Wyckoff Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The subject property is in the PB0-200 zone, which permits office use. On October 26,1987, defendant obtained final site plan approval for a 99,900 square-foot office complex. However, the approval was expressly subject to defendant\u2019s right of access to Hope Road across the 7.155-acre parcel defendant had deeded to the State in 1983. The resolution granting the approval provided that any change in plans concerning a different means of ingress and egress \u201cwill constitute a major change requiring reapplication and public notice.\u201d Thereafter, the State constructed the Route <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>18 ramp, thereby precluding defendant\u2019s use of the Hope Road access.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">On May 3, 1988, the State filed its present complaint condemning the subject property. Prior to trial, the State moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude defendant\u2019s appraisal report and related trial testimony \u201cbased upon permanent access to Hope Road, ... or along any permanent way other than Ferncliff Drive Extension.\u201d By order dated May 13, 1992, Judge McGann granted the State\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">During trial, the State\u2019s appraiser, Cornelius Guiney, testified that the subject property\u2019s highest and best use was residential subdivision and development, notwithstanding that the PBO-200 zone permitted commercial and office building use. Based on his conversations with residents and municipal officials, Guiney was of the view that it was unlikely the Borough would ever approve a site plan for defendant\u2019s proposed office complex because of the traffic it would generate onto adjoining residential streets by way of the Ferncliff Drive extension. He rejected the existing site plan approval because it was premised on nonexistent access to Hope Road. Relying upon residential-sale comparables in nearby towns, Guiney concluded that the property was valued at $687,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Defendant\u2019s appraiser, John Brody, evaluated the property at $1,650,000. He reached that figure using three comparable commercial sales located on Hope Road, within one mile of the property, adjusting for time, location and topography. Over the State\u2019s objection, Brody treated the subject property as having a valid site plan approval for development of an office building, and adjusted its value upward accordingly. Ignoring the 1983 deed providing for permanent access by way of Ferncliff Drive, Brody assumed alternative access, probably over the \u201ccemetery\u201d easement. Notwithstanding the State\u2019s continued objection, Brody was permitted to express his view that the municipality would look favorably upon this means of access because \u201cit\u2019s a very logical course.\u201d He explained that the easement to Wyckoff Road is through undeveloped lands and would act as \u201ca nice buffer zone\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>between Deepwood Estates and the commercial development on defendant\u2019s tract. However, Brody also stated that defendant\u2019s use of the Ferncliff Drive extension as its means of ingress and egress to and from the office complex would not affect his appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The State argues that Brody should not have been permitted to value the property based on the 1987 site plan approval, since that approval had no legal viability, defendant having relinquished its right of access to Hope Road. It also contends that the trial court committed reversible error by permitting defendant to hypothesize that the site plan would be reapproved based on defendant\u2019s use of the \u201ccemetery\u201d easement from the subject property to Wyckoff Road. The State points out that the easement is only twenty-feet wide, is unimproved, and defendant has no property interest in it. It argues that, consequently, the only ingress and egress available for the purposes of measuring the probability of site plan approval was the Ferncliff Drive extension conveyed by the State to defendant in its 1983 deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">When property is taken under the Eminent Domain Act of 1971, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-1 to -50, the measure of damages is the fair market value of the property as of the date of taking, \u201cdetermined by what a willing buyer and a willing seller would agree to, neither being under any compulsion to act.\u201d <em>State v. Silver, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>507, 513, 457 A.2d 463 (1983). \u201cFair market value\u201d is that value assigned by knowledgeable parties freely negotiating under normal market conditions \u201cbased on all surrounding circumstances at the time of the taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 457 A.2d 463. A determination of fair market value requires the antecedent finding as to highest and best use of the property. <em>State v. Cooper Alloy Corp., </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 567-68, 347 A.2d 365 (App.Div.1975); <em>State v. Mehlman, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>587, 590, 289 A.2d 539 (App.Div.1972); 4 Nichols, <em>Law of Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 12B.14, at 138-39 (3rd ed. 1990). \u201cHighest and best\u201d use has been defined as \u201c[t]he reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>ably probable and legal use of ... an improved property, which is physically possible, appropriately supported, financially feasible, and that results in the highest value.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v. City of Perth Amboy, </em>10 <em>N.J.Tax, </em>114, 145 (1988) (alterations in original) (quoting American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, <em>The Appraisal of Real Estate </em>169 (9th ed. 1987)), <em>aff'd, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 567 A.2d 597 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>628, 583 A.2d 324 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The market value, for condemnation purposes, is not limited to value for the use to which the land is actually devoted. Nichols, <em>supra, </em>at 139. It is well-settled that \u201cthe owner shall receive the fair market value of the land for <em>any use </em>for which it has a commercial value in the immediate present or in reasonable anticipation in the near future.\u201d <em>State v. Gorga, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>113, 116, 138 A.2d 833 (1958) (emphasis added). The \u201cinquiry into relevant facts at the time of the taking may include those that have a bearing on an available future use of the property.\u201d <em>Silver, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 515, 457 A.2d 463. However, \u201c[t]he potential use must be reasonable, and within the realm of possibility in the not too distant future. The property must be available for the potential use asserted, and adaptable for the particular purpose.\u201d Nichols, <em>supra, </em>at 140-44 (footnotes omitted). Mere speculation, conjecture or uncertainty must be avoided. <em>Id. </em>at 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The permissible uses under the existing zoning ordinance bear crucially upon value. <em>Gorga, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>at 116, 138 A.2d 833; <em>State v. Inhabitants of Phillipsburg, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 541, 573 A.2d 953 (App.Div.1990). Nevertheless, when the proposed use is the property\u2019s \u201chighest and best\u201d use but, due to zoning restrictions the property is not available for that use, the condemnee is entitled to show \u201cthe probability of a zoning change and its affect on market value.\u201d Nichols, <em>supra, </em>at 139. Chief Justice Weintraub, in <em>Gorga, </em>stated the proposition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">It is generally agreed that <em>if </em>as of the date of taking <em>there is a reasonable probability of a change in the zoning ordinance in the near future, </em>the influence of that circumstance upon the market value as of that date may be shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>[26 <em>N.J. </em>at 116, 138 A.2d 833 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Thus, \u201cif the parties to a voluntary transaction would as of the date of taking give recognition to the <em>probability </em>of a zoning amendment in agreeing upon value, the law will recognize the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 138 A.2d 833 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">This view is conceptually no different than the general approach taken respecting the prospect of subdivision approval of a condemned site. In that context,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">[t]he market value of the condemned land insofar as that value is presently enhanced by the property\u2019s adaptability for subdivision may be shown, except where the courts have determined the evidence to be misleading in some aspect, but the possible future value of each prospective lot if a subdivision was made may not be shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">[Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Evidence of Proposed or Possible Subdivision or Platting of Condemned Land on Issue of Value in Eminent Domain Proceedings, </em>26 AL.i2.3d 780, 786, \u00a7 2(a) (1969) (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The admissibility of this evidence is within the discretion of the court, and ordinarily depends upon the adaptability and availability of the site for the proposed subdivision, and evidence that the developer has taken some steps toward obtaining the subdivision. <em>Ibid. </em>For example, in <em>Phillipsburg, </em>we held that it was error to permit an expert to testify concerning the value of the condemned property based on subdivided lots. 240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 542, 573 A.2d 953. We concluded that the land should have been evaluated as unsubdivided, vacant land, and it was error to permit the jury to value the tract as if it were divided into building lots at the time of taking, since no subdivision plat had been prepared and there were no water, sewer, electric or other improvements to serve the hypothesized subdivision. <em>Id. </em>at 541, 573 A.2d 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>These principles governing the prospect of a zoning change and subdivision approval should apply with respect to the prospect of a site plan approval, at least where, as here, the site is zoned for the proposed use and the condemnee has taken steps to obtain such approval as of the date of taking. The trier of fact may receive evidence that a willing buyer, without compulsion, would recognize the probability of site plan approval in the near future when determining market value. However, whether there is <em>any </em>evidence supporting such a view is, in the first instance, a question for the trial court to resolve. <em>Cf. Gorga, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>at 117, 138 A.2d 833. The market value of the condemned land, insofar as that value may be enhanced by the property\u2019s adaptability for such proposed use may be shown, since it bears upon the question as to the highest and best use of the property: \u201c[t]he reasonably probable and legal use of ... [the condemned property], which is physically possible, appropriately supported, financially feasible, and that results in the highest value.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>10 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 145 (quoting <em>The Appraisal of Real Estate, supra, </em>at 269).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The first evidentiary dispute during trial centered around defendant\u2019s introduction of its 1987 site plan approval for its office complex, conditioned on a right-of-way to Hope Road across the property the State had acquired in 1983. It is clear that the site plan, at the date of taking, had no viability because defendant no longer had access to Hope Road. Thus, it was error for the trial court to have allowed Brody to testify that a premium should be added to the value of the property because site plan approval had been acquired. For example, Brody testified that he made a \u201cpositive 10 percent\u201d adjustment \u201cbecause the subject had approvals.\u201d We agree with the State that this testimony erroneously permitted the jury to add a premium to the value of the property based on a site plan approval that was no longer legally viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The central question for jury resolution was whether, from the viewpoint of a willing buyer and a willing seller, it was reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>probable the planning board would grant defendant\u2019s <em>re application </em>for site plan approval, and to what extent that prospect would affect the selling price. As noted, Brody testified that reapproval was probable based on defendant\u2019s access to Wyckoff Road by way of the \u201ccemetery\u201d easement. However, Brody\u2019s premise presupposed that defendant would have acquired an interest in that easement sufficient to service vehicular traffic generated by its proposed office complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The prospect of acquiring the off-site easement, and the township\u2019s willingness to accept it as a means of ingress and egress to Wyckoff Road, is not intrinsically different from the reasonable probability of a zoning change. <em>See Salem Country Club, Inc. v. Peabody Redev. Auth., </em>21 <em>Mass.App. </em>433, 487 N.E.2d 864, 865-66, <em>review denied, </em>396 <em>Mass. </em>1107, 489 N.E.2d 1263 (1986). The trier of fact should be permitted to consider the potential uses of the subject property based on its present zoning, and its adaptability to the proposed use as an office complex. In addition, it should be allowed to consider the reasonable probability that the owner will surmount development handicaps, such as acquiring reasonable access, so that the site may be developed as proposed. <em>Id. 21 Mass.App. </em>433, 487 N.E.2d at 866; <em>cf. United States ex rel. Tennessee Valley Auth. v. Powelson, </em>319 <em>U.S. </em>266, 275-76, 63 <em>S.Ct. </em>1047, 1052-53, 87 <em>L.Ed. </em>1390, 1397-98 (1943) (value of land in combination with other parcels); <em>State v. Jeans, </em>80 <em>Or.App. </em>582, 723 P.2d 344, 346 (same), <em>review denied, </em>302 Or. 342, 728 P.2d 867 (1986). Whether favorable action by the public entity \u201c Vas so likely to eventuate and so imminent as to deserve being taken into account, is a matter for demonstration\u2019 through evidence.\u201d <em>Salem Country Club, </em>487 N.E.2d at 865 (quoting <em>Skyline Homes, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>362 <em>Mass. </em>684, 290 <em>N.E.2d </em>160, 162 (1972)). Of course, value cannot be established by guess or conjecture. <em>State v. Faps Realty Corp., </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>44, 49, 484 A.2d 35 (App.Div.1984). Before submission of the question to the jury, there must be some showing of the reasonable probabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ty of such eventuality, and that a willing buyer and a willing seller would consider that probability in reaching a selling price.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The problem here is that the jury instruction did not focus upon these pertinent principles. The trial court charged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajc\">The zoning, planning and building laws and regulations limit the way a property can be used. If the property is zoned only for one family houses, then industrial or other uses could not be considered as [its] highest and best use, even though there would be otherwise a great demand for such uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">In making a decision of the highest and best use, you may consider where there is a reasonable probability as to permit a use in the future, which would make the property more or less valuable. Similarly, you may consider whether there was a reasonable probability that the subject property would receive a use variance for a particular purpose. You heard some testimony about that. Parties negotiating a price for the sale of the property on May 3rd, may have been governed by those signs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">It\u2019s your job to determine whether or not there were indications that the approval for construction of an office building would not be granted because permanent access was available only along Ferncliff Drive extension, which traversed a residential area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">When defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the charge on the basis that it did not address alternative means of ingress and egress, and left the impression that if the Ferncliff Drive extension was never built, defendant would not obtain site plan approval because its property would be landlocked, the judge gave the following supplemental instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">I should tell that under any circumstances, access has to be granted. It can be over residential or other areas, but access has to be granted. They can\u2019t have this property landlocked, it can\u2019t be just dropped in the middle of some place. Okay, just so you know that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">The State objected to the supplemental charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">The jury instruction, as supplemented, had the clear capacity to convince the jury that the Ferncliff Drive extension access could be disregarded, and the \u201ccemetery\u201d easement was a viable alternative because some \u201caccess has to be granted.\u201d The charge does not identify by whom access is to be granted. More important, it does not explain that there must be a reasonable probability, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>a willing buyer\u2019s and a willing seller\u2019s point of view, that defendant would, in the immediate future acquire an interest in the easement and secure approval from the municipality to utilize it as a means of access to Wyckoff Road. It is true Brody testified that the municipality would no doubt look favorably upon the \u201ccemetery\u201d easement as a viable access alternative. Also, there was evidence, although not conclusive, that the State may have expressed an intention to relinquish its plan to extend Ferncliff Drive, and may have consented to the creation of the \u201ccemetery\u201d easement as an alternative access route. However, no evidence was adduced concerning whether defendant could acquire an expanded easement from the owner of Deepwood Estates or the Borough, or that the State would provide that easement by way of condemnation. Properly charged, the jury may have concluded that the \u201ccemetery\u201d easement was not a probable access alternative, and thus the only available access was by way of the Ferncliff Drive extension. If the jury so found, its valuation of the property, based on the State\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony, may have been altered substantially.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">If, as the State argues, the Ferncliff Drive extension was the only available means of ingress and egress, the jury instruction must address whether it was reasonably probable, from a willing buyer\u2019s and a willing seller\u2019s viewpoint, the planning board would grant site plan approval for the office complex with that means of access. As noted, the State\u2019s expert testified that the board would reject the plan because of probable resistance by nearby residents because of anticipated traffic from the project. The judge suggested that this may be so in his charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">It\u2019s your job to determine whether or not there were indications that the approval for construction of an office building would not be granted because permanent access was available only along Ferncliff Drive extension, which traversed a residential area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">However, the instruction must also make clear that site plan approval will be based on whether or not an applicant satisfies the standards of the site plan ordinance and the Munici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>pal Land Use Law (MLUL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-1 to -129, not solely on expected public resistance. The question is whether, from the viewpoint of the willing buyer and willing seller, the applicant will face any <em>legal </em>impediment to approval if it meets the appropriate standards, including providing for safe and convenient vehicular traffic access. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-41b; <em>see also State v. F &amp; J, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19, 29, 593 A.2d 352 (App.Div.1991). Consideration must also be given to whether, if the applicant satisfies all pertinent standards, the site plan may be legally denied based entirely on off-site conditions, such as vehicular traffic that may be generated on existing roadways. <em>See Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Inc. v. North Brunswick Tp., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 515, 475 A.2d 71 (App.Div.1984); <em>Lionel\u2019s Appliance Ctr., Inc. v.

The order provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">The subject property acquired within this condemnation action shall be valued with only temporary access to Hope Road and with permanent access only along the extension of Ferncliff Drive and that no testimony shall be permitted ... with regard to any other means of access.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The State now argues that evidence concerning the \u201ccemetery\u201d easement should not have been permitted because the pretrial order constituted the \u201claw of the case.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Under the law of the case doctrine, \u201cwhere there is an unreversed decision of a question of law or fact made during the course of litigation, such decision settles that question for all subsequent stages of the suit.\u201d <em>Slowinski v.

Hale, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 410-11, 317 A.2d 731 (App.Div.1974)). <em>See also Lanzet v. Greenberg, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>168, 192, 594 A.2d 1309 (1991); <em>State v. Reldan, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>187, 203, 495 A.2d 76 (1985). The doctrine is grounded in the policy that once an issue is litigated in a suit, relitigation of that issue should be avoided if possible. <em>Daniel v. State, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>563, 581, 571 A.2d 1329 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>325, 585 A.2d 343 (1990). However, when a judge of equal position resolves an issue on an interlocutory basis, the doctrine \u201cis discretionary and the court is never irrevocably bound by its prior interlocutory ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 571 A.2d 1329 (quoting <em>Sisler v. Gannett Co., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>153, 159, 536 A.2d 299 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>304, 540 A.2d 1283 (1988)). Moreover, the doctrine \u201cshould be applied flexibly to serve the interests of justice.\u201d <em>Reldan, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 205, 495 A.2d 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Here, the pretrial order was entered to make clear that defendant\u2019s temporary access to Hope Road, provided by the State in its 1983 deed, did not constitute a permanent means of access from the subject property. Judge McGann properly observed that the only permanent access granted by that deed was by way of the Ferncliff Drive extension. However, on defendant\u2019s motion to clarify the order, it pressed its argument that the Ferncliff Drive extension may also mean \u201cFerncliff Drive extension to Wyckoff Road\u201d; that is, by way of the \u201ccemetery\u201d easement which runs generally in the course of the State\u2019s proposed extension of Ferncliff Drive. Defense counsel did not want to be precluded from presenting such evidence during the course of the trial. Judge McGann responded \u201cI again am not going to include that here, nor am I precluding it here.\u201d The judge added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>You know, we\u2019re making a record here and if push comes to shove, ask the trial judge to give me a call on the telephone but I\u2019m not saying that. That\u2019s the trial judge\u2019s job to figure that one out, not mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">We have a declaration of taking showing Ferncliff Drive access but we\u2019re not quite sure where that was supposed to go. That may be arguable one way or the other. But that\u2019s not for me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">We agree with defendant that the pretrial rulings by Judge McGann did not foreclose it from presenting evidence of access to and from the subject property by means other than the Ferncliff Drive extension. It appears that the Judge McGann left that question to the trial court, resolution of which would depend upon the evidence adduced during trial. We therefore cannot say that there was a violation of the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">We find unpersuasive and without merit the State\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in excluding the State\u2019s expert\u2019s 1983 appraisal of the subject property. The trial court properly exercised its discretion under <em>Evidence Rule </em>4 by concluding that admission of that appraisal would no doubt result in extensive and confusing testimony concerning the State\u2019s 1983 acquisition of the 7.155-acre front parcel from defendant, particularly since that acquisition was by voluntary settlement, rather than condemnation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-10\"> Recently, this court slated the principle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-11\">A jury may consider the prospect of a change in the permitted use if on the date of taking a willing seller and a willing buyer reasonably would have considered the change sufficiently likely that it would affect the selling price. <em>[State v. Caoili, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>591, 593, 621 A.2d 546 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted </em>(1993).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
