The jury also acquitted defendant of purposeful murder, one count of first degree robbery and one count of second degree burglary. The court sentenced defendant to a 40 year term of imprisonment, with 30 years of parole ineligibility, for murder, and concurrent terms of four years imprisonment for burglary and nine months imprisonment for theft. The court merged defendant\u2019s robbery convictions into his conviction for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">The State\u2019s evidence showed that defendant, who was then 16 years old, committed the murder jointly with Donald Slover, an 18 year old, who was tried separately. The victim was Martin Vinson, who lived in an old school bus parked in a Woodland Township junkyard where he worked. After consuming a substantial amount of alcoholic beverages, defendant and Slover went to the junkyard during the early morning hours of August 2, 1988 to rob Vinson. The two young men entered Vinson\u2019s school bus and struck him with multiple blows on the head, with defendant wielding a metal pipe and Slover a flashlight in the attack. These blows crushed Vinson\u2019s skull and caused his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The most damaging testimony against defendant was given by his friend, Stephen DeFrank. According to DeFrank, defendant came to his house during the late morning of August 2, 1988, and said that he and Slover had just killed Vinson. Defendant told DeFrank that they had decided to rob Vinson because he owed Slover money. When they arrived at Vinson\u2019s school bus, Slover and Vinson got into an argument and Slover hit Vinson over the head several times with a flashlight. Defendant and Slover then had a discussion outside Vinson\u2019s bus in which they agreed that \u201csomebody had to take him out or kill him.\u201d After defendant and Slover got back into the bus, defendant used a metal pipe to hit Vinson over the head \u201c[mjore than a couple of times.\u201d As defendant was hitting Vinson, Slover asked for Vinson\u2019s wallet, which defendant took from Vinson\u2019s back pocket and gave to Slover.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In addition, defendant gave a statement to the police in which he admitted involvement in the murder, stating that, after waking up following a night of drinking, he and Slover talked about robbing Vinson. They then entered Vinson\u2019s bus, at which time Vinson \u201cjumped up ... and ... was coming at\u201d them. Slover grabbed a flashlight and defendant grabbed a pipe, and each of them struck Vinson in the back of his head two or three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Defendant testified on his own behalf that he and Slover consumed an extremely large amount of alcohol and marijuana before the murder. According to defendant, he went to the junkyard with Slover with the intent of finding motorcycles with which to go \u201cjoyriding.\u201d But sometime after they arrived at the junkyard, Slover walked over to Vinson\u2019s school bus and defendant followed him. Slover opened the door of the bus and when he got to the top of the stairs, Vinson \u201cjumped out.\u201d Slover then picked up a flashlight and hit Vinson over the head. According to defendant, Vinson came towards him, so he picked up a pipe and also hit Vinson over the head several times. Vinson then fell to the floor. Slover said, \u201c[gjrab the wallet,\u201d and defendant did so, throwing it to Slover. Defendant claimed that he did not intend to hurt, kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>or rob Vinson, but was simply defending himself because he thought Vinson was attacking him.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Defendant also presented testimony by a psychiatrist who expressed the opinion that defendant was suffering from extreme intoxication when Vinson was killed, resulting in a \u201cprostration of faculties,\u201d and causing defendant to be \u201cunable to act with knowledge and purpose with ... respect to the criminal charges against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">On appeal, defendant makes the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">I. PHOTOGRAPHS AND SLIDES OF THE VICTIM SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED INADMISSIBLE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">II. THE COURT SHOULD HAVE GRANTED DEFENDANT A JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL, WHICH ERROR CLEARLY PROVIDED AN UNJUST RESULT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO GRANT A NEW TRIAL, WHICH ERROR RESULTED IN A MANIFEST DENIAL OF JUSTICE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">1. The trial court\u2019s charge to the jury on intoxication improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant, constituting reversible error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">2. The defendant\u2019s motions for mistrial should have been granted on the ground that his right to a fair trial was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s impermissible comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">3. The court erred in deeming codefendant\u2019s statement to police admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-13\">4. The charge given to the jury by the court assumed defendant to be guilty, constituting grounds for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">Defendant\u2019s only substantial argument is that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation in ruling that Slover\u2019s statement to the police inculpating him would be admissible for the limited purpose of impeaching Slover\u2019s subsequent exculpatory statement. Defendant\u2019s other arguments are clearly without merit and do not require discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">During trial, defendant indicated his intention to call John Dobran, who had been incarcerated with Slover, to testify that Slover told him he had killed Vinson and that defendant left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>bus before Slover administered the fatal blows.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2Defendant offered this testimony pursuant to <em>Evidence Rule </em>63(10) as a declaration against penal interest. The trial court ruled that Dobran\u2019s testimony would be admissible but that if he testified, the prosecution would be permitted under <em>Evidence Rule </em>65 to introduce portions of Slover\u2019s statement to the police which placed primary responsibility for the murder upon defendant for the purpose of impeaching Slover\u2019s later statement to Dobran. The court indicated that it would instruct the jury that the statement could not be used as independent evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt but only to show that Slover \u201csaid several different things on the subject.\u201d In light of this ruling, defendant did not call Dobran as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\"><em>Evidence Rule </em>65 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">Evidence of a statement or other conduct by a declarant inconsistent with a statement received in evidence under an exception to Rule 63, is admissible for the purpose of discrediting the declarant, though he had no opportunity to deny or explain such inconsistent statement. Any other evidence tending to impair or support the credibility of the declarant is admissible if it would have been admissible had the declarant been a witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Slover\u2019s statement to the police placing primary responsibility for the murder upon defendant was inconsistent with his alleged subsequent statement to Dobran which substantially exculpated defendant. Therefore, under <em>Rule </em>65, Slover\u2019s statement to the police was admissible for the purpose of impeachment. <em>See State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>v. Pierro, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 284-85, 601 A.2d 757 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>564, 606 A.2d 374 (1992); <em>see also United States v. Wuagneux, </em>683 <em>F.2d </em>1343, 1357-58 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>814, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>69, 78 L.Ed.2d 83 (1983); <em>Henderson v. State, </em>765 S.W.2d 336, 338 (Mo.Ct.App.1989); <em>State v. Kline, </em>11 <em>Ohio App.3d </em>208, 210-213, 11 <em>OBR </em>330, 333-336, 464 <em>N.E.2d </em>159, 162-65 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Nevertheless, defendant argued at trial, and again argues on appeal, that the trial court\u2019s ruling that Slover\u2019s statement to the police was admissible for the purpose of impeachment violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause. In <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 <em>U.S. </em>123, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1620, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>476 (1968), the Court held that the introduction of an inculpatory out-of-court statement by a eodefendant who does not take the stand violates a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. But a codefendant\u2019s or accomplice\u2019s out-of-court statement may be introduced for a purpose other than proving the truth of what it asserts without violating a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. Thus, in <em>Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>409, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2078, 85 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>425 (1985), after the defendant testified that his confession had been coerced by the Sheriff reading an accomplice\u2019s confession and directing him to say the same thing, the trial court allowed the State to impeach defendant by introducing the accomplice\u2019s confession to show that it was different from defendant\u2019s confession in a number of material respects. The Supreme Court held that this use of the accomplice\u2019s confession for the purpose of impeachment did not violate defendant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMV\">The <em>nonhearsay </em>aspect of [the accomplice\u2019s] confession\u2014not to prove what happened at the murder scene but to prove what happened when [defendant] confessed\u2014raises no Confrontation Clause concerns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">Had the prosecutor been denied the opportunity to present [the accomplice\u2019s] confession in rebuttal so as to enable the jury to make the relevant comparison, the jury would have been impeded in its task of evaluating the truth of [defendant\u2019s] testimony and handicapped in weighing the reliability of his confession. Such a result would have been at odds with the Confrontation Clause\u2019s very mission\u2014to advance \u201cthe accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Moreover, unlike the situation in <em>Bruton, 391 US, [123,] 134, 20 L Ed </em>2d 476, <em>88 </em>S Ct 1620, [1627,] there were no alternatives that would have both assured the integrity of the trial\u2019s truth-seeking function and eliminated the risk of the jury\u2019s improper use of evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 414-15, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2081-82, 85 L.Ed.2d at 431-32.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">We believe that the same reasoning is equally applicable to this case. If unrebutted, an alleged accomplice\u2019s statement that he was solely responsible for a crime can be extremely strong evidence for the defense. However, such a statement can be seriously discredited by evidence that the accomplice made a statement on another occasion that the defendant was involved in the crime. Thus, if the jury had been denied the opportunity to hear Slover\u2019s statement inculpating defendant, its ability to evaluate the truthfulness of Slover\u2019s statement exculpating defendant would have been significantly impeded. Therefore, as in <em>Street, </em>it was necessary for the jury to hear both of Slover\u2019s statements \u201cto advance \u2018the accuracy of the truth-determining process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2082, 85 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 432. And as in <em>Street, </em>\u201cthere were no alternatives,\u201d such as the separate trials of codefendants suggested in <em>Bruton, </em>\u201cthat would have both assured the integrity of the trial\u2019s truth-seeking function and eliminated the risk of the jury\u2019s improper use of evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">We also note that if Slover had actually testified at defendant\u2019s trial that he was solely responsible for Vinson\u2019s murder, the State could have used Slover\u2019s prior inconsistent statement in cross-examining him. <em>Evid.R. </em>20; <em>State v. DiRienzo, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>360, 383, 251 A.2d 99 (1969). Thus, if the State were precluded by the Confrontation Clause from using Slover\u2019s prior inconsistent statement to impeach his out-of-court statement to Dobran, defendant would enjoy a significant strategic advantage in being able to present Slover\u2019s exculpatory statement in hearsay form. The State not only would be deprived of the opportunity of cross-examining Slover but also would be prevented from using one of the most effective techniques of witness impeachment, the intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>duction of a prior inconsistent statement. The hearsay rule and the Confrontation Clause both reflect the view that live testimony with an opportunity for face-to-face confrontation is the most reliable method of determining the truth. <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>171, 182, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2775, 2782, 97 L.Ed.2d 144, 156-57 (1987); <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>56, 63, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 2537, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 606 (1980). Therefore,. the Confrontation Clause should not be construed to impose limitations upon the impeachment of out-of-court statements admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule which would not apply to in-court testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Our conclusion that the State could have introduced Slover\u2019s statement to the police for impeachment purposes is also supported by the line of cases which hold that \u201c[b]ecause \u2018hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause are generally designed to protect similar values,\u2019 and \u2018stem from the same roots,\u2019 ... no independent inquiry into reliability is required when the evidence \u2018falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u2019\u201d <em>Bourjaily v. United States, supra, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>at 182-83, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2782, 97 L.Ed.2d at 157 (citations omitted); <em>accord Ohio v. Roberts, supra, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>at 65-66, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2538-39, 65 L.Ed.2d at 607-08. The rule codified in <em>Evidence Rule </em>65 that evidence admissible under an exception to the rule against hearsay is subject to impeachment by the same methods which could be used if the declarant had testified at trial is as \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d as the hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest codified in <em>Evidence Rule </em>63(10). See <em>Carver v. United States, </em>164 <em>U.S. </em>694, 697-98, 17 <em>S.Ct. </em>228, 229-30, 41 <em>L.Ed. </em>602, 603-04 (1897); <em>Fed. R.Evid. </em>804(b)(3), 806; <em>Unif.R.Evid. </em>804(b)(3), 806;. <em>compare </em>3A <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7\u00a7 884, 887 (Chadbourne rev. 1970) <em>with </em>5 <em>Wigmore on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 1477 (Chadbourne rev. 1974). Therefore, the trial court correctly concluded that the State could impeach the credibility of Slover\u2019s out-of-court statement exculpating defendant by showing that he made another out-of-court statement which inculpated defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\"> Slover\u2019s alleged statement to Dobran is referred to in this opinion as exculpatory because it assigned a lesser responsibility for the offense to defendant than did the State\u2019s evidence at trial. However, this statement indicated that defendant had participated in the robbery of Vinson and in tact inflicted the first blow upon him. Therefore, while this statement negated defendant\u2019s guilt of purposeful or knowing murder, it could have supported a verdict for felony murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-10\"> The Uniform Rules of Evidence and Federal Evidence Rules include similar provisions. <em>Unif.R.Evid. </em>806; <em>Fed.R.Evid. </em>806.
