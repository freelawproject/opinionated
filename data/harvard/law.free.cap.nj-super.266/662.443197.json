AUendorf (plaintiff) was struck and injured by the automatic door of a self-service elevator in an office building owned and operated by defendant Kaiserman Enterprises (Kaiserman), which contracted with defendant Amtech Reliable Elevator Company/American Building Maintenance Industries, Inc. (Amtech) for the maintenance and repair of its elevators. Before trial, the trial court dismissed plaintiffs punitive damage claims against Kaiserman and Amtech. Subsequently, the court bifurcated the issues of liability and damages. In the liability trial, a jury found Amtech negligent and Kaiserman and plaintiff not negligent. In the damages trial, a second jury returned a verdict of $25,000 in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Amtech appeals from the order memorializing the verdict in the liability trial and plaintiff appeals from the court\u2019s order dismissing her claims for punitive damages and from the jury verdict in the damages trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">On its appeal, Amtech argues that the trial court erred in submitting a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction to the jury. To place this issue in context, it is necessary to outline briefly the relevant evidence presented at the liability trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">The elevator in which plaintiff was injured had two door safety devices: (1) a rubber safety edge running along the side of the door, which was designed to immediately reopen the door if it contacted any object while the door was closing, and (2) an electric eye in the side of the door, which was designed to immediately reopen the door if the electric beam emitting from the eye was broken by any object in the beam\u2019s path while the door was closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">On July 5, 1986, an Amtech service mechanic was dispatched to Kaiserman\u2019s building because a moving company left a large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>rubber \u201canti-skid device\u201d wedged under the bottom of the elevator door, which was not allowing it to close. The service mechanic discovered that the rubber safety edge on the elevator door had been bent by an object wedged underneath it. Therefore, he straightened out the safety edge \u201cas best as [he] could.\u201d At the same time, he tried to readjust the electric eye so that it would not be activated by the bend in the rubber safety edge. The service mechanic felt that both safety devices were \u201cfunctional\u201d when he left Kaiserman\u2019s building on July 5, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Around 9 a.m. on July 24, 1986, the day of the accident, Amtech received a call from Kaiserman reporting that the elevator door \u201ckeeps getting stuck.\u201d Consequently, Amtech dispatched a service mechanic to the Kaiserman building. However, the service mechanic\u2019s work sheet indicated that he had been sent to the Kaiserman building to perform \u201croutine maintenance\u201d rather than in response to a \u201ctrouble call.\u201d Although the service mechanic had no specific recollection of this assignment, he asserted that routine maintenance would include a check of the elevator door\u2019s safety systems and that if there had been a problem with either system he would have recorded it on his work sheet. Moreover, he would have taken the elevator out of service if he could not repair the system. The service mechanic\u2019s work sheet did not indicate a problem with any of the elevator\u2019s systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Plaintiffs accident occurred only a few hours later, around 2 p.m. According to plaintiff, she was entering the elevator behind her two-year-old daughter when the door \u201cclosed\u201d upon her and \u201cpinned\u201d her against the door frame, half in and half out of the elevator. The door did not give at all, pushing her with increasing pressure against the wall. Finally, as the elevator made a grinding noise indicating that it was about to move, plaintiff was able to push through the door into the elevator.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Amtech sent another service mechanic back to the Kaiserman building shortly after the accident. He reported that the rubber safety edge was operating but that the electric eye was inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Plaintiff presented an expert in the field of professional engineering who expressed an opinion based on his review of Amtech\u2019s service records and other evidence developed in discovery that the electric eye safety device was known to be out of service for a long enough time prior to the accident to have been repaired. He further testified that the elevator was generally in a poor state of repair during the period prior to plaintiffs accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">We are satisfied that this evidence provided a sufficient foundation for the court to submit a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction to the jury. In <em>Brown v. Racquet Club of Bricktown, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>280, 288-92, 471 A.2d 25 (1984), the Court explained the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\"><em>Res ipsa loquitur, </em>a Latin phrase meaning \u201cthe thing speaks for itself,\u201d is a rule that governs the availability and adequacy of evidence of negligence in special circumstances. The rule creates \u201can allowable inference of the defendant\u2019s want of due care\u201d when the following conditions have been shown: \u201c(a) the occurrence itself ordinarily bespeaks negligence; (b) the instrumentality [causing the injury] was within the defendant\u2019s exclusive control; and (c) there is no indication in the circumstances that the injury was the result of the plaintiffs own voluntary act or neglect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">[A] plaintiff need not exclude all other possible causes of an accident as a condition of entitlement to the doctrine, provided he can show that it is more probable than not that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of the mishap. As long as the facts permit a reasonable inference that defendant\u2019s control over the instrumentality under the circumstances was such that some act of negligence on its part was a contributing cause of the resulting accident, an explanation dissipating separate inferences of different acts of negligence by defendant or others does not defeat the application of <em>res ipsa loquitur.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">To the same effect, the Court in <em>Vespe v. DiMarco, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>430, 437, 204 A.2d 874 (1964), quoting <em>Rose v. Melody Lane of Wilshire, </em>39 <em>Cal.</em>2d 481, 247 P.2d 335, 339 (1952), stated that \u201c[t]he doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>concerns a type of circumstantial evidence upon which plaintiff may rely to discharge his burden of proving defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>See also Eaton v. Eaton, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>628, 637-42, 575 A.2d 858 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>The condition for application of the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine that the \u201cinstrumentality\u201d causing the injury must have been within the defendant\u2019s \u201cexclusive control\u201d can be satisfied even though the instrumentality was \u201cin joint control of two defendants in which event the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>will apply against both of said defendants.\u201d <em>Meny v. Carlson, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>82, 94, 77 A.2d 245 (1950). \u201cThe word \u2018exclusive\u2019 when used to define the nature of the control necessary to invoke the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>does not connote that such control must be several and the defendant singular and never plural.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 77 A.2d 245; <em>accord Hillas v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>105, 113, 293 A.2d 419 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>82, 299 A.2d 80 (1972); <em>see Smith v. Claude Neon Lights, Inc., </em>110 <em>N.J.L. </em>326, 330-32,164 A 423 (E. &amp; A. 1933) (application of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>warranted in a situation where both the building owner and the company hired to maintain an illuminated electric sign on the roof of the building had \u201cpartial possession and control\u201d of the sign when a smaller sign attached by the maintenance company fell injuring plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">If the evidence presents a factual issue as to how an accident occurred, and the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine would be applicable under only one version of the accident, the court should give a \u201cconditional\u201d <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction, under which the jury is directed first to decide how the accident happened and to consider <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>only if it finds that the accident occurred in a manner which fits the doctrine. <em>Terrell v. Lincoln Motel, Inc., </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 59-61, 443 A.2d 236 (App.Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">If the jury accepted plaintiffs version of how the accident occurred, this was an appropriate case for application of the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>Certainly, an automatic door closing like a vise upon a person attempting to enter an elevator is an occurrence, similar to the collapse of the stairway involved in <em>Brown v. Racquet Club of Bricktown, supra, </em>which bespeaks negligence. <em>Cf. Rose v. Port of N.Y. Auth., </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>129, 136, 293 A.2d 371 (1972) (\u201cMembers of the public passing through automat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ic doors, whether in an airport, office building or supermarket do so generally without sustaining injury.\u201d). Also, the jury could reasonably have found that Kaiserman and Amtech were in joint exclusive control of the elevator around the time of the accident. And there was no indication that the elevator malfunction was the result of plaintiffs own voluntary act or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The trial court properly instructed the jury that the application of the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine was conditional upon the jury accepting plaintiffs version of how the accident occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">You may recall that I have said to you that the mere happening of an accident itself provides no basis for liability, and that liability must be proven. And in the ordinary negligence case, the mere fact that an accident happened, with nothing more, does not furnish evidence that it was caused by anyone\u2019s negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">The plaintiff must point to a negligent act or omission on the part of the defendant or defendants. However, sometimes, under certain circumstances, the very happening of an occurrence itself, can be indicative of negligence. Therefore, <em>if you find, number one, that the accident or incident took place as testified to by the plaintiff, </em>under circumstances which would suggest that in the ordinary course of events, it would not have happened without a lack of due care by one or both defendants. And, number two, at the time of the accident, defendants or one of them, had exclusive control or management of the accident\u2014of the elevator, causing the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">Number three, and there is no evidence the mishap is attributable to the plaintiffs own voluntary act or neglect. Then, if you find those three, you may find that the accident and the resulting injury were the result of the negligence by defendants or one of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">Now you will note that I say that you may so find; you are not compelled or required to so find. You should in this regard consider all the facts and circumstances of this case in evidence, including any evidence which the defendants have offered to negate this explanation, or to show that it is not applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">Amtech argues that <em>Hillas v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., supra, </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 111-16, 293 A.2d 419, holds that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>may not be applied to a company responsible for the maintenance of an automatic elevator. However, the plaintiff in <em>Hillas </em>never requested a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction, so the only question on appeal was whether the trial court\u2019s failure to give that instruction was \u201cplain error,\u201d which the court said should turn on whether \u201cthe principle of <em>res ipsa </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number><em>loquitur </em>is <em>clearly applicable.\u201d </em>The court concluded that the doctrine was not \u201cclearly applicable\u201d because there was evidence that another elevator passenger could have created the condition which caused plaintiffs accident. In contrast, plaintiff in this case obtained a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>instruction and there was no evidence that the malfunction of the elevator as described by plaintiff could have been caused by any party other than defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\"> We also reject any broad rule that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>may never be applied to an elevator maintenance company. The application of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>should not turn on the nature of a business enterprise conducted by a defendant but rather upon the circumstances of the specific accident which is the subject of a suit. As the court noted in <em>Hillas, </em>\u201cthe proper test of the applicability of the doctrine is whether there is evidence from which the court can find that in the ordinary course of things, the mishap, more likely than not, was the result of defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112. Accordingly, the courts in other jurisdictions have held that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>may be applied to an elevator maintenance company if plaintiff presents sufficient evidence of the company\u2019s control over the elevator. <em>See, e.g. Rogers v. Dorchester Assocs., </em>32 N.Y.2d 553, 347 N.Y.S.2d 22, 26, 300 <em>N.E.2d </em>403, 407 (1973); <em>Carney v. Otis Elevator Co., </em>370 <em>Pa.Super. </em>394, 536 A.2d 804 (1988); <em>Johnson v. Otis Elevator Co., </em>225 <em>Pa.Super. </em>500, 311 A.2d 656, 657 (1973); <em>see generally </em>John D. Perovieh, Annotation, <em>Liability of Installer or Maintenance Company For Injury Caused By Door of Automatic Passenger Elevator, </em>64 AL.I2.3d 1005 \u00a7 4 at 1011-1013 (1975); John D. Perovieh, Annotation, <em>Liability of Installer or Maintenance Company for Injury Caused By Failure of Automatic Elevator To Level At Floor, </em>63 AL.I2.3d 996 \u00a7 5 at 1005-1006 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Amtech not only agreed to \u201cregularly and systematically examine\u201d and \u201cmaintain\u201d the elevator and its \u201csafety devices,\u201d but had in fact sent one of its employees to the Kaiserman building only a few hours before the accident to service the specific elevator which caused plaintiffs injuries. Therefore, Amteeh\u2019s connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>the elevator which caused plaintiffs injury was sufficiently immediate and direct to support a finding that it had \u201ccontrol\u201d of that elevator, and thus the trial court correctly concluded that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Amtech also argues that (1) plaintiff did not establish any negligence on the part of the defendant Amtech; (2) plaintiffs expert\u2019s opinion was a \u201cnet opinion\u201d and therefore inadmissible; (3) in finding for defendant Kaiserman and against Amtech, the jury\u2019s verdict was contrary to both the law and instructions; (4) the conduct of plaintiff and counsel for plaintiff may have improperly influenced the jury; (5) plaintiffs liability expert was improperly allowed to testify; and (6) the court improperly allowed evidence of prior accidents and the functioning of the elevator to be presented to the jury. These arguments are clearly without merit and do not require discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">On her appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion to strike all testimony elicited by defendants regarding several occasions when she passed out prior to the accident. Plaintiff presents a similar argument regarding defendants\u2019 evidence of the histories of her sisters having passed out. According to plaintiff, defendants failed to present expert testimony that these medical histories tended to show either that plaintiffs alleged accident-related \u201cseizure disorder\u201d was not caused by the accident or that it existed before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">A party seeking to present evidence of a prior injury or condition relating to an issue of medical causation must show that the evidence has some \u201clogical relationship to the issue in the case.\u201d <em>Paxton v. Misiuk, 34 N.J. 453, </em>460, 170 A.2d 16 (1961). Moreover, this logical relationship generally must be established by appropriate expert medical opinion. See <em>Ratner v. General </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>Motors Corp., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>197, 203-06, 574 A.2d 541 (App.Div.1990). The general test of admissibility of such evidence is \u201cone of possibility rather than probability.\u201d <em>Paxton v. Misiuk, supra, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>at 461, 170 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Defendant satisfied these requirements through the testimony of Dr. Raquel E. Gur, a neuropsychiatrist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">Q. Doctor, you were asked about past history of Lisa Allendorf. Were you aware that she had complaints of passing out before the accident in July of 1986? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">Q. Were you aware that she complained of a chest pain problem which was very severe chest pain that I think she indicated was like a heart attack, she had difficulty breathing and she would either pass out or come close to passing out, this was before the accident in July of \u201986; were you aware of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">Q. Would that change your opinion any concerning the seizure disorder that she has alleged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">A. If you recall, when Mr. Zonies described the behavior that Ms. Allendorf presented, I was saying, I would see something like that and I believe every physician in practice will do, you get a differential. And I said this is a type of behavior, syncopal, passing out could be related to heart, could be related to brain, could be related to pulmonary, I mentioned toxic abuse, et cetera. You have to go through all of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">If I know and based on the information that you provided which I was not aware of with the details that you gave me on the behavior observed, I said that the possibility of seizure based on this behavior described is now moving higher in my list and I will be more aggressive in checking out, getting to the bottom of it with the information that you provided on passing out. That\u2019s a possibility. I would even say cardiac possibility will apply. I will pursue it further. And remember I said in a young person after a routine exam, cardiac examination, I wouldn\u2019t have pursued it that much. If there was expressed pain, 1 would check a little bit more in the family story and so this was moving upper and higher in the list for cardiac. So, I would have pursued both work ups at the same time in order not to be negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-12\">Q. Did Lisa Allendorf tell you that her sister, one of her sisters was passing out and has passed out on occasion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-13\">THE WITNESS: I did not have\u2014no, she did not provide me with this information. When I investigated family story, I asked about family story, I asked if there\u2019s any medical, neurological or psychiatric history in the family which could be pertinent many times in the evaluation of an individual. She said, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-14\">Q. Would the fact that her sister passes out on occasion be of any significance to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">Q. Why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">A. It might be significant relating to cardiac disease and it might also be significant, as I said, in the differential of passing out or in the terminology syncope, a seizures disorder is in the differential. Seizures sometimes run in families, pseudoseizures, namely behavior that is consistent with seizure but no electrical changes in the brain runs in families, too. In other words, research has shown that people have pseudoseizures if somebody in the family has a history of passing out which they have observed is a higher proportion. That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">Q. Concerning the pseudoseizures you just mentioned, would the fact that the sister passing out have been contributed to mitral valve prolapse or a female problem be of any significance to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">A. I think that every piece of information is important. The mitral valve prolapse would point to the cardiac origin for that and then I would have pursued more aggressively a cardiac workup in a young person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">In addition, the evidence that plaintiff had episodes of passing out prior to the accident was admissible for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of her testimony that she was \u201cin perfect health\u201d and had never had \u201cany problem with blacking out\u201d prior to the accident. <em>Evid.R. </em>20; <em>see also Evid.R. </em>607, effective July 1, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">Plaintiff also argues that Amtech improperly suggested that she suffered from \u201cmitral valve prolapse.\u201d However, this condition was referred to in a medical history given by plaintiff which she offered in evidence. In any event, plaintiff testified that her sister suffered from mitral valve prolapse and that while she may have speculated that she too suffered from this condition, this was never confirmed by any test or doctor\u2019s diagnosis. One of plaintiff\u2019s medical experts confirmed that \u201cthere is no documentation of a mitral valve prolapse\u201d and that she had \u201ca normal echocardiogram.\u201d In light of these explanations of plaintiffs reference to \u201cmitral valve prolapse\u201d in her medical history, the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that there was no competent evidence she actually suffers from this condition did not have a clear capacity to lead to an unjust result. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>Bussell v. DeWalt Prods. Corp., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>223, 231, 519 A.2d 1379 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 summary judgments with respect to her punitive damage claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">As the court indicated in <em>Nappe v. Anschelewitz, Barr, Ansell &amp; Bonello, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>37, 49, 477 A.2d 1224 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">To warrant a punitive award, the defendant\u2019s conduct must have been wantonly reckless or malicious. There must be an intentional wrongdoing in the sense of an \u201cevil-minded act\u201d or an act accompanied by a wanton and wilful disregard of the rights of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Plaintiff failed to present any evidence from which a jury could have found that Amtech\u2019s conduct was wantonly reckless or malicious. Plaintiff presented no evidence that Amtech was aware that the elevator had previously caused an injury or that it was malfunctioning in a manner which made it probable that someone would suffer injury. Plaintiffs evidence did no more than establish Amtech\u2019s negligence in maintaining the elevator.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">We also conclude that plaintiffs evidence fell short of establishing a basis upon which a jury could find that Kaiserman had acted in a wantonly reckless or malicious manner. Although Kaiserman was aware of a prior accident on July 11, 1986, which caused injury to another person using the elevator and also possessed an inspection report dated July 9,1986, which indicated that the electric eye was not operating, this evidence would not support a finding that Kaiserman intended someone to be injured in its elevator or that it was aware there was a high probability of injury. To the contrary, the uncontradieted evidence was that the elevator appeared to be functioning adequately except when the prior accident occurred on July 11, 1986 and when the elevator became stuck on the morning of July 26,1986. Moreover, Kaiser-man did not simply ignore the problems with the elevator but instead called Amtech to service it.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">In addition, we note that plaintiff presumably presented whatever evidence she had of Kaiserman\u2019s alleged wrongdoing at trial and that the jury found this evidence insufficient to establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Kaiserman was even negligent. It follows <em>a fortiori </em>that this evidence would have been insufficient for the jury to find that Kaiserman\u2019s conduct was malicious or wantonly reckless. <em>See Edwards v. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>448, 460-63, 526 A.2d 242 (App.Div.1987) (conduct which is more culpable than ordinary negligence is essential to a successful claim for punitive damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
