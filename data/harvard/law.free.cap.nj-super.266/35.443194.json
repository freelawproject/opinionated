Haas. The gravamen of plaintiffs complaint is that its disability insurance policy issued to defendant should be rescinded because of material misrepresentations made by him in his application for insurance. Alternatively, plaintiff seeks a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>declaration that the policy does not cover defendant\u2019s medical condition, retinitis pigmentosa. In dismissing plaintiffs complaint, the trial court concluded that the policy\u2019s incontestability clause barred plaintiffs action. The incontestability clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG\">10.2 INCONTESTABLE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">a. After Your Policy has been in force for two years, excluding any time You are disabled, We cannot contest the statements in the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">b. No claim for loss incurred or disability beginning after two years from the Date of Issue will be reduced or denied because a disease or physical condition existed before the Date of Issue unless it is excluded by name or specific description.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">We hold that the incontestability clause bars an action to rescind instituted after two years from the inception of the policy, even if the insured\u2019s representations are fraudulent. We also conclude that the clause precludes the carrier from denying coverage based on the policy\u2019s definition of \u201csickness\u201d and on its preexisting condition exclusion. However, if defendant becomes disabled during the period of contestability, part (a) of the incontestability clause, by its terms, tolls the running of the two-year period, and part (b) has no application. We therefore affirm in part, but reverse in part for a determination as to when defendant became disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">On January 20, 1987, defendant applied for disability insurance with plaintiff. In response to questions in the application concerning his \u201cmedical history,\u201d he answered that he was not under observation or treatment, had not be examined by or consulted a physician in the last five years, and never had any known indication of, or been treated for, any disease or impairment of the eyes. Defendant also answered \u201cno\u201d to the question: \u201cHas any person had any surgical operation, treatment, special diet, or any illness, ailment, abnormality, or injury, not mentioned above, within the past five years?\u201d On March 5, 1987, plaintiff issued the disability policy to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">On December 1, 1990, defendant notified plaintiff of his intention to file a disability claim. On January 7, 1991, he executed a proof of claim form, stating that on December 1, 1990, he became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>totally disabled as a result of retinitis pigmentosa, a loss of central vision. Defendant also submitted a \u201cdisability attending physician statement,\u201d completed by Dr. Leo Maseiulli, stating that defendant\u2019s symptoms first appeared on November 1, 1989. Dr. Masciulli responded \u201cyes\u201d to the question: \u201cHas patient ever had same or similar condition?\u201d and listed \u201cDr[s], Sidarsky [sic] &amp; Poole [New York City] 1985\u201d as defendant\u2019s treating physicians. Dr. Maseiulli also reported that when defendant came to him on November 1, 1990, he was seeking a \u201csecond opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Plaintiffs investigation of the claim revealed that beginning on October 20, 1983, defendant had been evaluated in the New York University Retinal Clinic. Dr. Ronald E. Carr, one of defendant\u2019s physicians, stated in a letter to Dr. Sudarsky dated August 9, 1984, that defendant \u201chad been told of retinitis pigmentosa in the past and indeed shows findings quite typical for this problem.\u201d It is also undisputed that defendant\u2019s medical records, dating back to 1985, disclosed that he has had a history of retinitis pigmentosa since at least that date. On or about October 17, 1991, plaintiff filed the present complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">For the purposes of defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion, he admitted that his misrepresentations in the application were fraudulent. The trial judge nevertheless granted the motion, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">I don\u2019t find that there is any way that you can get around the fact that [defendant] fits right into the mold of the person who is [saved] by the incontestable clause, and I find that the clause applies and the insurance company has to go through on it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Plaintiff acknowledges that it instituted its action beyond two years after issuance of the policy. Nevertheless, relying on <em>Johnson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>423, 251 A.2d 257 (1969), plaintiff argues that the clause pertains only to equitable fraud, and does not bar an action based, as here, on a claim of legal fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>In <em>Johnson, </em>the disability policy contained the following incontestability clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">Time Limit on Certain Defenses: (a) After two years from the date of policy no misstatements, <em>except fraudulent misstatements, </em>made by the applicant in the application for this Policy shall be used to void this Policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in this Policy) commencing after the expiration of such two year period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 436 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">This clause essentially tracked the statutory language required to be inserted in policies under <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:38-13.2(A) (now repealed). The Court rejected the insurer\u2019s argument that the phrase \u201cexcept fraudulent misrepresentations\u201d preserves the concept of equitable fraud beyond the contestability period, reasoning that \u201cthe provision can have no significance\u201d unless the phrase \u201crequires an intent to deceive.\u201d 53 <em>N.J. </em>at 438, 251 A.2d 257. It noted that a contrary interpretation would frustrate the apparent intent of the clause \u201cto improve the position of the insured.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, it concluded \u201cthe statute ... boils down to the proposition that <em>after </em>two years the policy may not be voided for a misstatement in the application unless the misstatement is \u2018fraudulent\u2019 as we have defined the word____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441, 251 A.2d 257 (emphasis added). Since the insured\u2019s misrepresentation on his application was not made with intent to deceive, the insurer\u2019s attempt to rescind was barred because it came after expiration of the two-year period. <em>Id. </em>at 443, 251 A.2d 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">What is fatal to plaintiffs argument is that <em>Johnson </em>involved a different incontestability clause than the clause pertinent here. <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:26-5 requires that all health insurance policies contain one of two incontestability clauses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4B\">a. After 2 years from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy shall be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability ... commencing after the expiration of such 2-year period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-11\">[or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-12\">(2) A policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (a) until at least age 50 or, (b) in the ease of a policy issued after age 44, for at least 5 years from its date of issue, may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>contain in lieu of the foregoing the following provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the insurer\u2019s option) under the caption \u201cINCONTESTABLE\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">After this policy has been in force for a period of 2 years during the lifetime of the insured, (excluding any period during which the insured is disabled) it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the application,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">b. No claim for loss incurred or disability ... commencing after 2 years from the date of issue of this policy shall be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of loss and existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Plaintiff chose the incontestability clause under <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:26-5a(2) which does not contain the \u201cexcept fraudulent misrepresentations\u201d phrase. By opting for the clause under \u00a7 5a(2), plaintiff elected to forego preserving its indefinite right to rescind the policy based on legal fraud. We can only assume it did so because it gained the benefit of the phrase \u201cexcluding any time You are disabled,\u201d which tolls the two-year period during the time the insured is disabled. In any event, the analysis under <em>Johnson </em>is clearly not dispositive. We would contravene the clear meaning of the policy, and indeed the statute, were we to graft the \u201cexcept fraudulent misrepresentations\u201d phrase upon the clause pertinent here. <em>See Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Manzo, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>104, 112, 584 A.2d 190 (1991). The clause must be interpreted as plainly written and as required by statute. <em>Ibid. </em>Since plaintiff instituted its action after the policy was in force for two years, it \u201ccannot contest the statements in the application\u201d even if made with intent to deceive. <em>See Lindsay v. United States Life Ins. Co., </em>80 <em>N.J.Super. </em>465, 470,194 A.2d 31 (Law Div.1963) (incontestability clause, which does not contain \u201cexcept fraudulent misrepresentations\u201d phrase, bars even claims of legal fraud after the contestability period has lapsed).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">As stated, part (b) of the incontestability clause, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">No claim for loss incurred or disability beginning after two years from the Date of Issue will be reduced or denied because a disease or physical condition existed before the Date of Issue unless it is excluded by name or specific description.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Plaintiff contends that part (b) has no effect where the remedy sought is the denial of coverage, rather than rescission of the policy. It first points to the fact that a \u201csickness\u201d covered by the policy is defined as one \u201cwhich first manifests itself after the Date of Issue and while Your Policy is in force.\u201d Plaintiff argues that since defendant\u2019s retinitis pigmentosa manifested itself prior to the effective date of the policy, there is no \u201csickness\u201d and hence no coverage. Alternatively, it claims that it may deny coverage under the preexisting condition exclusion, which provides \u201c[w]e will not pay benefits for a Pre-existing Condition if it was not disclosed on Your application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Many out-of-state cases and authorities support plaintiffs argument that, despite the passage of the contestable period, the carrier may deny a claim if not covered, or if excluded by a preexisting condition clause. <em>See Button v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>847 F.2d 584, 588 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>909, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>261, 102 L.Ed.2d 250 (1988); <em>Keaten v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>648 <em>F.2d </em>299, 301 (5th Cir. Unit B Aug. 1981); <em>Massachusetts Casualty Ins. Co. v. Forman, </em>516 <em>F.</em>2d 425, 428-29 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>914, 96 <em>S.Ct </em>1114, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>319 (1976); <em>see also </em>Annotation, <em>Construction of Incontestable Clause Applicable to Disability Insurance, </em>13 <em>A.L.R.3d </em>1383, 1392-97 (1967); 18 George J. Couch, <em>Couch on Insurance, </em>\u00a7 72:65 (2d ed. 1983). For example, applying Georgia law, the Fifth Circuit in <em>Reaten </em>held that after the period of contestability has run under a disability policy, \u201cthe insurer is only barred from contesting the validity of the policy itself, e.g., on grounds of fraud in the procurement, etc. ... It still reserves the right to deny any claim if it is not within the coverage as stated under the policy\u2019s terms.\u201d 648 F.2d at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Similarly, in <em>Form,an, </em>the Fifth Circuit held that the \u201cfirst manifestation\u201d provision in the definition of \u201csickness\u201d entitled the carrier to deny coverage because the insured\u2019s sickness first manifested itself prior to the issuance of the policy, despite the passage of the two-year period under the incontestability clause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>516 F.2d at 429. The court acknowledged that the clause provided that no claim for disability commencing after two years from the date of issue of the policy shall be denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition existed prior to the effective date of the policy. <em>Ibid. </em>However, it reasoned that this clause did not bear upon coverage because it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">only prohibits denials of claims based on the prior <em>existence </em>of a disease. Such denials are irrelevant here because a disease is covered no matter when it existed, so long as it was not first manifested prior to the policy date. Thus subparagraph B has no effective field of operation. Giving it some scope of operation by reading \u201cexisted\u201d as \u201cexisted and manifested\u201d goes beyond the language of the clause and is contrary to the general principle that incontestable clauses do not operate to extend coverage beyond that contracted for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ5\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">There is persuasive authority expressing a contrary view. <em>See Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Altman, </em>795 <em>F.Supp. </em>216, 221-22 (E.D.Mich.1992); <em>Wischmeyer v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>725 <em>F.Supp. </em>995, 1003 (S.D.Ind.1989); <em>Fischer v. Massachusetts Casualty Ins. Co., </em>458 <em>F.Supp. </em>939, 944-45 (S.D.N.Y.1978); <em>see also </em>Annotation, <em>supra, </em>at 1397-98. In <em>Wischmeyer, </em>the court had before it an incontestability clause drafted in accordance with an Indiana statute, which is essentially the same as the clause involved here. The court rejected the carrier\u2019s argument that the insured\u2019s preexisting condition was not covered because it did not \u201cmanifest\u201d itself during the policy period. 725 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1003-04. It found that the clause, as interpreted, strikes a \u201cclear balance based on policy reasons, and to allow coverage provisions of a policy to prevail over the statutorily required clauses is to thwart the mandate of the legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">We find Wischmeyer\u2019s reasoning persuasive and consistent with New Jersey\u2019s settled rules concerning the construction of insurance contracts. An insurance policy should \u201cbe read as the ordinary policyholder would understand it.\u201d <em>Kissil v. Beneficial Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>555, 561, 319 A.2d 67 (1974); <em>see also Kievit v. Loyal Protect. Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>475, 488,170 A.2d 22 (1961) (\u201cthe court\u2019s goal in construing an accident insurance policy is to effectuate the reasonable expectations of the average member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>of the public who buys it\u201d). Also, because insurance policies are contracts of adhesion and not readily understood, courts resolve ambiguities in such contracts against insurance companies, \u201cand in line with an insured\u2019s objectively-reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165,175, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992); <em>see also Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 495 A.2d 406 (1985). Indeed, our Supreme Court has observed that \u201cif an insured\u2019s \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 contravene the plain meaning of a policy, even its plain meaning can be overcome.\u201d <em>Voorhees, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 175, 607 A.2d 1255; <em>Werner Indus., Inc. v. First State Ins. Co., </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>30, 35-36, 548 A.2d 188 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">We believe that the ordinary insured would read part (b) of the incontestability clause as subsuming any disclaimer by the carrier that the sickness \u201cfirst manifest[ed] itself\u2019 prior to the inception of the policy. The clause cannot be any clearer: if the disability begins two years after the date of issue, the claim cannot be \u201cdenied\u201d because a disease or physical condition \u201cexisted before the Date of Issue.\u201d Reaten\u2019s holding that the clause bars only an action for rescission is unavailing, since the word \u201cdenied\u201d must sensibly include not only actions for rescission, but a \u201cdenial\u201d of coverage when that denial is based on a preexisting condition. In our view, parts (a) and (b) of the incontestability clause strike a fair balance: the carrier may seek rescission or deny coverage at any time during the two-year period, and even after if, during the contestability period the insured becomes disabled. But if the insured becomes disabled after expiration of the contestability period, the carrier is barred from raising any challenge, by way of rescission or \u201cdenial\u201d of coverage, if the challenge is predicated on the insured\u2019s preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">We also reject the subtle distinction made by the <em>Forman </em>court between the terms \u201cexistence\u201d and \u201cmanifested.\u201d Nowhere in the incontestability clause is the term \u201cmanifest\u201d used. Therefore, the ordinary insured would not know, as plaintiff suggests, that the clause does not mean what it says by virtue of the phrase \u201cfirst manifested\u201d used in another policy provision. <em>See Wischmeyer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>725 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1003-04. Also, we question whether a reasonable insured would grasp the subtle distinction between the two words, even if a distinction exists. Finally, plaintiff\u2019s argument frustrates the underlying purpose of the incontestability clause: \u201cto put a checkmate upon litigation,\u201d 1A John A. Appleman &amp; Jean Apple-man, <em>Insurance Law &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 311, at 311 (1981), and \u201cto give the insured a sense of security after the stated period elapses.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>at 442, 251 A.2d 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The same is true with respect to the preexisting condition clause which, as stated, reads \u201cWe will not pay benefits for a Pre-existing Condition if it was not disclosed on Your application.\u201d If the clause may be interpreted to permit <em>denial </em>of coverage for a disability beginning after two years from the date of issue, it is in direct conflict with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:26-5b, which unambiguously states that no such claim \u201cshall be ... <em>denied </em>on the ground that a <em>disease or physical condition ... existed </em>\u201d before the date of issue, (emphasis added). <em>See N.J.S.A </em>17B:26-25 (any policy provision conflicting with applicable statute shall be deemed amended to conform with statute). There is at least, in reading the incontestability and preexisting condition clauses together, an ambiguity which must be construed in favor of the insured. <em>See Werner, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 35, 548 A.2d 188; <em>Altman, </em>795 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 223. We therefore conclude that if defendant\u2019s disability began after the expiration of the two-year period, plaintiff may not deny coverage based on defendant\u2019s preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Although we reject plaintiff\u2019s arguments concerning the incontestability clause and its right to deny coverage, we agree that summary judgment was improperly granted. As stated, part (a) of the incontestability clause provides that \u201c[ajfter your policy has been in force for two years, <em>excluding any time You are disabled, </em>We cannot contest the statements in the application.\u201d (emphasis added). There has been no discovery in this case, and thus summary judgment has prevented plaintiff from inquiring into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>defendant\u2019s health since the date of the issuance of the policy, March 5, 1987. In view of the unquestioned manifestations of symptoms prior to December 1, 1990, and defendant\u2019s prior treatment dating back to 1985, plaintiff may well establish that defendant\u2019s disability commenced during the two-year contestability period. If so, the contestability bar under paragraph (a) would be tolled. <em>See Wischmeyer, </em>725 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Johnson </em>should be read to invalidate the tolling provision is without merit, since <em>Johnson </em>did not involve an incontestability clause with tolling language. Moreover, defendant\u2019s argument would have us nullify statutory language. It would also lead to an unjust result. Since the incontestability clause does not have the \u201cexcept for fraudulent misstatements\u201d phrase, the insured could misrepresent with intent to deceive in his application, wait two years and one day to file a claim despite his intervening disability, thus immunizing himself from challenge by the carrier. Such a result would effectively condone fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">When defendant became disabled is also important in determining whether subparagraph (b) of the incontestability clause bars plaintiffs challenge. If the facts establish that defendant was disabled during the two-year period, then part (b) of the incontestability clause has no application, and the insurer can raise its defenses. <em>See Wischmeyer, </em>725 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1005. If on the other hand, defendant did not become disabled until more than two years after the policy was issued, then part (b) is fully applicable. <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiff should have the opportunity to develop its proofs with respect to this issue through discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
