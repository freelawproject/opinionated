(Rollin\u2019) in the amount of $17,776 by the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County. The Greens raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">1. Whether the lien releases executed by Rollin\u2019 and the subcontractor released the builder or owner from the mechanic\u2019s lien;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">2. Whether Rollin\u2019 could apply all payments by the contractor on a first in-first out basis to the subcontractor\u2019s only account with Rollin\u2019 for the three projects all parties were involved in; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-11\">3. Whether Rollin\u2019 was estopped from raising non-payment and claiming a lien when it had full control of funds sufficient to satisfy the subcontractor\u2019s account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">Rollin\u2019 cross appeals, contending that the court erred in finding that Rollin\u2019 was not entitled to recover the full amount of its lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The Greens at Hilton Run in St. Mary\u2019s County is one of several separate limited partnerships established to build multifamily housing projects.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Case Edwards Development, Inc. is a general partner in each of the limited partnerships. The contractor for the projects, Case Edwards Construction Company, Inc. (Case Edwards), subcontracted with Duane Lundberg T/A Bay Central Installation (Lundberg) to furnish and install the vinyl siding. Lundberg, in turn, solicited Rollin\u2019 to provide the siding and related materials at $60 per square<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the projects. Lundberg had only one account with Rollin\u2019 and all purchases, regardless of the project, were charged to that account. Rollin\u2019 credited all payments, made jointly to Lundberg and Rollin\u2019 by Case Edwards, to the oldest outstanding invoices first.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">At issue are the 773 squares of siding and materials delivered by Rollin\u2019 to the Hilton Run project, also known as the Lexington Park project, between April 2 and June 15, 1988.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On March 31,1988, Lundberg\u2019s account of payments due by it to Rollin\u2019 stood at $66,368.26 for deliveries to the other two projects. When Lundberg\u2019s account totalled $95,-137.78 at the end of April, Rollin\u2019 requested a meeting with Case Edwards to discuss Lundberg\u2019s arrearage. No payments toward the Lexington Park project had been made prior to the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The May 2 meeting attended by Lundberg, Case Edwards and Rollin\u2019<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> revealed that Lundberg had misled the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>parties as to his labor costs. He had been receiving checks from Case Edwards for labor (which he allegedly overstated), as well as the joint checks for materials (which he allegedly understated). Rollin\u2019 was not aware Lundberg had received compensation for his labor costs in a separate check. In order to insure that Rollin\u2019 would receive the full balance due it, and to ensure that Lundberg would continue to provide labor to finish the projects as Case Edwards wished, Rollin\u2019 proposed 1) that the joint checks for labor and materials issued by Case Edwards be given directly to Rollin\u2019 rather than Lundberg, and 2) that Rollin\u2019 would credit itself $60 per square of siding installed, plus $5 per square on the arrearage, and pay Lundberg his labor costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Although the parties agreed to implement the Rollin\u2019 proposal, each had a different interpretation as to its application. According to Rollin\u2019, it was to pay the third-party labor costs first as presented by Lundberg, and then to credit the rest to Lundberg\u2019s account. According to The Greens, Rollin\u2019 was to pay itself first, collect the additional $5/square, and then pay the third-party labor costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Six of the joint checks distributed to Rollin\u2019 related to the Lexington Park project before Lundberg was terminated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">Date Check No. Amount</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiB\">5/03/88 21198 8,164.80</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Z\">5/12/88 21270 16,329.60 <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ait\">5/19/88 21423 10,108.80</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWo\">5/27/88 21597 9,552.60</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgA\">6/10/88 21849 6,403.60</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArTR\">6/15/88 22115 14,094.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4c\">64,653.40</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-16\">Another check, number 22722 dated 7/19/88, in the amount of $7,840.80 was issued to Rollin\u2019 on July 19, 1988, bringing the total disbursed to Rollin\u2019 to $72,494.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-17\">According to Mark Winkler, an officer of Rollin\u2019, the joint checks were distributed by Richard Norton (Norton), then president of the corporation. Norton \u201cwould try to ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>tain how many squares [Lundberg] had done the week before, and how many squares the draws were based on, and pay him.\u201d Winkler further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">\u201cLundberg would come in requesting a certain amount of money. Rick would determine, or try to make a determination how many squares this particular check was based on his applying. And try to base what he gave [Lundberg] on the reasonableness of that figure. And try to get for us no less than sixty dollars a square.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Norton\u2019s uncontroverted testimony corroborated Winkler\u2019s summary. Norton also testified that Rollin\u2019 paid Lundberg\u2019s labor before it paid itself from the first two checks. Handwritten notations on the check stubs of the next four checks indicate that the Rollin\u2019 paid itself for a certain amount of squares and then gave the balance to Lundberg. The stub of the last check was not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Five undated, unwitnessed form lien releases were signed by Norton and Lundberg. Norton\u2019s name appeared on the line for \u201cstairwork.\u201d No signature appeared on the owner\u2019s signature line. All the releases had handwritten notes in the margins indicating \u201cBay Central,\u201d and two mentioned \u201cRollin\u2019 Supply.\u201d Three had check numbers written on them, and two releases indicated (according to Norton\u2019s testimony) what had been released:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\"><em>Release</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Date Check No. Released</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzSC\">1 5/19/88 21473</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AML\">2 6/10/88</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD08\">3 6/10/88 21849 Bldg # 7 33 sq Bldg # 10 30 sq</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A--\">5/27/88 21597</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUJ\">5/27/88 Bldg # 2 16 sq Clubhs 25 sq</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-20\">Norton testified that the purpose of his signature was merely to signify that Rollin\u2019 had received a check. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>testified that six buildings and a clubhouse had been completed by the time Lundberg was terminated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">On December 12, 1988, Rollin\u2019 petitioned to establish and enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien in the amount of $39,516.74 against The Greens. The Greens did not contend that Rollin\u2019 failed to comply fully with the statutory requirements under Md.Real Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-104 <em>et seq. </em>(1974, 1988 Repl. Vol.), and the trial court proceeded as if the lien was perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The parties stipulated that Rollin\u2019 received $72,494.20 in joint checks subsequent to the May 2 arrangement. The trial judge determined Rollin\u2019 paid Lundberg $36,694.80 from the joint checks for labor, although the amount is actually $1,000 higher.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Of the amount allocated to labor, $28,604 was directly related to the Lexington Park project. The parties agreed that the fair market value of the 773 squares and accessories was $60 to $62 per square; the judge assigned a value of $60 per square, thereby placing a value of $46,380 on the 773 squares. The court then held that the lien releases were too vague to determine the true nature and extent of any release. Rollin\u2019, therefore, \u201cwas entitled to take out all amounts then due it on account of the Lexington Park job, and the other two jobsites as well,\u201d but it could not achieve a lien status greater than that represented by materials incorporated into the Lexington Park jobsite, e.g., $46,380. After determining that Rollin\u2019 had not looked after its financial interests when it paid Lundberg\u2019s labor costs, the lower court credited The Greens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>$28,604 and established a lien in the amount of $17,776 in favor of Rollin\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Both parties appealed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Although we review the case on both the law and the evidence, we \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous.\u201d Md.Rule 8-131; <em>Landover Ass. Ltd. Partnership v. Fabricated Steel Prod. Inc. </em>35 Md.App. 673, 682, 371 A.2d 1140 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\n<em>Lien Releases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The Greens urges this Court to find that the trial court erred in determining that the five lien releases executed by Rollin\u2019 with Lundberg were ineffective. According to The Greens, Rollin\u2019 knew which buildings were released and should be estopped from claiming a lien. Rollin\u2019, on the other hand, contends that the judge was correct in not taking the releases into account. We hold that the trial judge was not clearly erroneous in determining that the lien releases are \u201cprobative only of the fact that some portion of the potential lien has been released.\u201d The lower court could not reconstruct what had happened; nor can this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The Greens argues that, upon an examination of the totality of the circumstances, \u201cthe only possible inference is that Norton executed each release to show receipt of a check for the payment of a certain amount of material.\u201d Lonnie Spraberry, a Case Edwards employee, testified that Lundberg would send an invoice to Case Edwards when a building was completed, specifying the building number. Case Edwards would then prepare the check and lien release which were sent out simultaneously. Each check stub indicated the project number, the Lundberg invoice number, a date and the amount paid. The person picking up the check was given the lien release. According to Spraberry, a letter was then sent out by the accounting department stating that \u201cyou won\u2019t get another check until you sign the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>lien release and we have it in our possession.\u201d The Greens notes that Norton released a specific number of squares on two of the forms, and that the testimony showed Norton attempted to determine \u201chow many squares this particular check was based on.\u201d From these facts The Greens concludes that Norton, \u201cpersonally knew what amount of material was involved,\u201d and that . Rollin\u2019 is thus estopped from claiming a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The trial judge was not clearly erroneous in determining that three of the releases were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">\u201cprobative only of the fact that some portions of the potential lien had been released, [as] one cannot determine from the document what is the true nature and extent of the release.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">It is not readily apparent how a general lien release for a specific project can be effective when the materials paid for, as indicated by the May 12, 1988 check stub, encompassed more than one project. Although the forms provided plenty of space for descriptive detail as to just what was released, The Greens merely inserted the project name; it was Norton who limited two of the releases to a certain amount of material for specific buildings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Seven checks were issued, moreover, but only five releases were signed. Even if we were to find The Greens\u2019 argument persuasive, some portion of the lien was clearly not released.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The property owner has long had the burden of proof to establish the precise scope and extent of any release. <em>Maryland Brick Co. of Baltimore City v. Dunkerly, </em>85 Md. 199, 213, 36 A. 761 (1897). The Greens failed to meet that burden when it did not prove to the trial court which buildings or what materials had been released. Whether or not Rollin\u2019 could \u201cfigure it out\u201d is irrelevant. Certainly material providers should ensure the accuracy of any lien release they sign, but the deliberate purpose of the mechanics\u2019 lien law is to establish property owners as a second or \u201cback-up\u201d source of payment for the unpaid material provider since it is the owners who receive the ultimate benefit of the materials, and who, as a practical matter, control the cash. <em>Hill v. Parkway Indus. Center, </em>49 Md.App. 676, 678, 435 A.2d 472 (1981). The trial court correctly maintained the lien against the Lexington Park project.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">We note, however, that Norton\u2019s testimony reveals that Rollin\u2019 did execute a release on some of the materials delivered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Attorney]: Do you know who put that handwriting on [the lien release]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">[Norton]: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">Q: What did you \u2014 why did you put that on there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">A: Due to the fact I could not release a lien on that particular building because it was not completed. I could not sign a release of lien on a building that was not completed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">Q: You would put down how much you are releasing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">Q: One shows Building [7-33] squares or something like that. Those you are [sic] putting down how much you were releasing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">A: Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">Although the three general lien releases are too vague to have any effect, the releases with Norton\u2019s handwritten notations, combined with his testimony, were specific enough to be effective. Rollin\u2019 released 66 squares in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>third release and 41 squares in the fifth release, a total of 107 squares. Thus, of the 773 squares delivered to the project, Rollin\u2019 can establish a lien for only 666 squares of siding.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\n<em>Accounting Procedures</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The Greens next complains that Rollin\u2019 was required to separate the three projects, and to credit the proper project as indicated on the check stub, rather than simply to credit Lundberg\u2019s account on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. Rollin\u2019 maintains that it could allocate the check funds under the FIFO accounting method in the absence of directions to the contrary by the debtor, Lundberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The proper allocation of credits to an account in the context of the mechanic\u2019s lien was explained by Judge Collins in <em>T Dan Kolker, Inc. v. Shure, </em>209 Md. 290, 301-302, 121 A.2d 223 (1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\u201cOf course, it is true as a general rule that the debtor has the right, if he so elects, to make the application of payments in the first instance and, if he omits to do so, the creditor may make the appropriation. If neither make any appropriation, the law appropriates the payment according to the justice of the case and usually to the payment of the earliest and most onerous debt.\u201d (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-8\"><em>See also German Lutheran Church v. Heise, </em>44 Md. 453, 471 (1873); <em>Clark-King Constr. v. Salter, </em>269 Md. 494, 500, 307 A.2d 485 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The fact that the materials were furnished for three separate projects, although Lundberg had only one account with Rollin\u2019, does not affect the outcome. In <em>Bounds v. Nuttle, </em>181 Md. 400, 30 A.2d 263 (1943), the material providers had paid off the contractor\u2019s old debts owed them on <em>other </em>jobs before applying the owner\u2019s payments to the materials used in the owner\u2019s project. The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">\u201cIf the contractors did not use part of the money received by them from the [owners] to pay bills which they owed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>to the [material providers], this was entirely within their rights, and it was also <em>entirely within the rights of the [material providers] to receive this money and credit it on old bills, </em>provided there was no arrangement or agreement that this was done for the purpose of permitting the [material providers] to collect again by means of a lien from the [owners].\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">181 Md. at 407, 30 A.2d 263. Lundberg, the debtor-subcontractor, occupies the same position as the debtor-contractor in <em>Bounds. </em>Thus, the breakdown of payment by project made on the check stubs issued by Case Edwards is irrelevant \u2014 Case Edwards was not the debtor and could not direct the manner of payment to Lundberg\u2019s account. The evidence shows that Lundberg did not instruct Rollin\u2019 to credit his account in any particular manner or to direct payments to certain bills. Furthermore, The Greens made no allegations of collusive billing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The Court of Appeals has since qualified the <em>Bounds </em>holding in <em>Dickerson Lumber Co. v. Herson, </em>230 Md. 487, 187 A.2d 689 (1963). In <em>Dickerson, </em>the contractor had several accounts for various projects with the material provider, who was aware of the contractor\u2019s weak financial position. The Court found it significant that the material provider also knew that the joint checks it received originated from bank drafts (under the construction loan) for the Herson project:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201cWe think that it was clearly the duty of the [material supplier] and of its officers to apply funds received by [it] from [the contractor] known to have been derived from the Herson payments to the payment of charges against the Herson job rather than to apply such amounts to the payment of other indebtedness of [the contractor] to the [material supplier].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">230 Md. at 492, 187 A.2d 689. <em>Dickerson, </em>however, is factually inapposite. Lundberg had only one account with Rollin\u2019 and all funds were credited to that account. The evidence does not indicate that Rollin\u2019 knew the source of the funds distributed by Case Edwards. The owner\u2019s name, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The Greens at Hilton Run I Limited Partnership, did not appear on the checks or the check stubs. The parties, moreover, are the same<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for all the projects, which would make it difficult, if not impossible, for Rollin\u2019 to trace the funds. We are not persuaded that the trial court was clearly erroneous in finding that Rollin\u2019 could use the FIFO accounting method when crediting payments to Lundberg\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\n<em>Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Finally, The Greens argues that Rollin\u2019 was estopped from raising non-payment and claiming a lien when it had full control of the checks. It claims the trial court erred in finding that Rollin\u2019 was only partially estopped to the extent that it did not pay itself first before paying Lundberg\u2019s third-party labor costs. Rollin\u2019 cross appeals, contending that it is entitled to the full amount of the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Where the owners fail to take precautions against a contractor or subcontractor known to be in financial straits, the law does not protect them. In <em>Bounds v. Nuttle, </em>for instance, the owners signed a contract obligating \u201cthem to pay the contractors and the contractors alone\u201d despite having notice that the contractors were \u201cnot taking care of bills for which liens might subsequently be laid.\u201d 181 Md. at 406, 30 A.2d 263. The Court of Appeals noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201cIf [the owners\u2019] failure to protect themselves against an impecunious contractor causes them to have to pay twice for materials, it is their own fault. The mechanic\u2019s lien law was passed to cover just such a situation and to protect material men. The theory of it is that the owner gets the benefit of the material, and he has control of the money. If he negligently and carelessly pays the money out to the contractor without taking precautions to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>that it is applied to the payment of the materials which go in the building, then he must stand the loss rather than the material man, who has no opportunity to protect himself once he has delivered the materials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">181 Md. at 406, 30 A.2d 263. <em>See also Dickerson Lumber Co. v. Herson, supra; N.S. Stavrou, Inc. v. Beacon Supply Co., Inc., </em>249 Md. 451, 240 A.2d 278 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The Greens, acting through Case Edwards, took precautionary measures to protect itself by virtue of the joint check arrangement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After May 2, 1988, furthermore, the checks were given to Rollin\u2019 rather than Lundberg, as they had been previously. This arrangement also gave Rollin\u2019 the means to protect itself, as it then controlled distribution of the cheeks. The events of the May 2, 1988 meeting, and the subsequent meetings in which Rollin\u2019 mediated between Case Edwards and Lundberg, show that both The Greens and Rollin\u2019 were well aware of Lundberg\u2019s precarious financial position.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Ordinarily, Rollin\u2019 would be estopped from establishing a mechanic\u2019s lien. In this case, however, Rollin\u2019 was also obligated to pay Lundberg\u2019s third-party labor costs under the May 2 agreement. In a similar joint check case, the Court of Appeals found that the material provider (Beacon Supply) in <em>N.S. Stavrou, Inc. v. Beacon Supply Co., Inc., supra, </em>was also charged, albeit impliedly, with paying the subcontractor\u2019s (Densco, Inc.) labor costs under a joint check agreement. The same contractor, subcontractor and material provider were involved in three school construction projects. Beacon Supply had petitioned to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien against Stavrou, the contractor. Stavrou ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>gued that Beacon had to bear the loss when Beacon applied the check proceeds only towards payment for materials which it had supplied, giving the rest to the subcontractor, when it was within its power and control to apply the proceeds to future payments. The Court of Appeals found this argument unpersuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">\u201c[H]ow then ... could Stavrou [the contractor] have reasonably expected Densco to survive from April 9, 1964, the date of the first billing, to September 23, 1964, the date of the last billing, a period in excess of 5 months, if Densco was not to receive any reimbursement for money expended on labor? How was Densco to keep its work force intact and meet its operating expenses?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2O\">249 Md. at 455, 240 A.2d 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In this case, the parties stipulated that Rollin\u2019 received $72,494.20 for the Lexington Park project. Lundberg was paid $37,694.80 for labor. The lower court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">\u201cUpon receipt of each Case Edward check, [Rollin\u2019] was entitled to take out all amounts then due it on account of the Lexington Park job, and the other two jobsites as well. That it chose to maintain, as did its counterpart, Case Edward, a payment to Duane Lundberg for his labor submittals, it is at fault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The $46,380 lien in favor of Rollin\u2019 was therefore reduced by $28,604, the amount attributable to labor on the Lexington Park project, to $17,776. In effect, the trial judge ruled that Rollin\u2019 was estopped as to <em>any </em>payment it made toward Lundberg\u2019s labor costs <em>before </em>the Lundberg account had been paid in full. By May 2, Lundberg\u2019s account totalled $95,137.78 for all three projects, including one month of deliveries to Lexington Park. Rollin\u2019 would have had to receive over $95,000 in payments before any of Lundberg\u2019s third party labor costs were met. At the time of trial Rollin\u2019 was still owed $33,372.35. Quite obviously, none of Lundberg\u2019s labor costs would have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Unlike the contractor in <em>Stavrou, </em>Case Edwards agreed that Lundberg\u2019s labor costs were to be paid in the May 2 meeting. The purpose of the joint check arrangement after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>that date was clearly for the mutual protection of the three entities (Case Edwards, Lundberg, and Rollin\u2019) involved in the same multifamily housing projects. The arrangement denied Lundberg his profit, but kept him on the job so that 1) the projects would be completed, and 2) the arrearage on his Rollin\u2019 account would be paid. It is certain that the parties did not intend Rollin\u2019 to protect itself exclusively \u2014 if it had, no labor costs would have been paid, the vinyl siding would not have been installed, and the projects would not have been completed. In the absence of any clear directions as to how the checks were to be distributed, Rollin\u2019 was entitled to allocate the funds in a reasonable manner. The evidence showed that Norton would try to ascertain how many squares Lundberg had installed the week before (labor), and how many squares the check applied to (materials). The amount given to Lundberg was based on the reasonableness of the labor costs balanced against the need for Rollin\u2019 to reimburse itself for materials. Rollin\u2019 reasonably distributed the funds in accordance with the purposes of the joint check arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">As a result, The Greens cannot prevail in its assertion that Rollin\u2019 was estopped from raising nonpayment and claiming a lien. Notwithstanding its full control of the disbursement of funds, it was under an obligation, agreed to by all pertinent parties, to take reasonable measures to keep Lundberg afloat and not to cause work on all projects to collapse. For precisely the same reasons that The Greens cannot prevail on this estoppel argument, Rollin\u2019 is entitled to prevail (in major measure) on its cross-appeal. Except to the extent that several specific releases reduced its lien from one of 773 squares to one of 666 squares of siding, it was entitled to assert its full lien in the amount of $39,960.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ST.
