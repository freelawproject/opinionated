Both parties agree that Judge Ross dismissed the suit for reason that appellant failed to comply with the requirements of the Maryland Tort Claims Act, State Gov\u2019t Article \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 through 12-109. The docket entries show, however, that the dismissal was entered pursuant to Md.Rule 2-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">This litigation is the result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on October 14, 1983 on Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard near Pennsylvania Avenue in the City of Baltimore. Appellant alleges that, while stopped in traffic, his vehicle was struck by an automobile owned by the State of Maryland, Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene and operated by Gross. Suit was filed, and the case progressed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City somewhat normally until August 8,1989 when the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City sent to the parties a notification of contemplated dismissal pursuant to Md.Rule 2-507.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 30, 1990 when counsel for appellant participated in a hearing on the Rule 2-507 issue, he was confronted by an oral motion to dismiss made by appellees on the basis of a failure to comply with the requirements of the Maryland Tort Claims Act. Judge Ross was persuaded by appellees\u2019 motion, and on the same date he made the following notation for the file, \u201cMotion denied. Dismiss. This case is not viable because of failure to comply with Md.Tort Claims Act C.J. \u00a7 5-406 1983 Cum.Supp.\u201d The docket entries, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>reflect that the dismissal was pursuant to Rule 2-507. The entry reads, \u201cCase dismissed under 2-507 \u2014 Judgment in favor of Defendant for costs of suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Appellant subsequently moved for reconsideration, arguing that he was surprised by the oral motion to dismiss which was based on an alleged Tort Claims Act violation. On June 20, 1990, Judge Ross granted the motion for reconsideration and set appellant\u2019s motion to defer dismissal for hearing on July 9, 1990. On July 9, 1990, appellant failed to appear for the hearing and Judge Ross, in effect, denied appellant\u2019s motion to defer dismissal. Judge Ross noted for the file, \u201cDismiss plaintiff failed to comply with Md.Tort Claims Act, no viable claim.\u201d The clerk, however, entered the following docket entry, \u201cDismissed under Rule 2-507 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">On July 17, 1990, appellant filed another motion for reconsideration. In this motion, he pointed out that on June 5, 1990 and July 13, 1990 appellant\u2019s counsel received notices from the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City informing appellant that a hearing was scheduled on July 26, 1990. Counsel stated that he was first advised of the July 9 hearing when a member of Judge Ross\u2019 staff telephoned at 4:20 p.m. on July 9, 1990. An attorney was dispatched to Judge Ross\u2019 chambers only to learn that the motion had already been decided. Attached to appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration were copies of the notices from the Clerk dated June 5, 1990 and July 13, 1990 indicating a hearing date of July 26, 1990. Judge Ross refused to reconsider the dismissal, and this appeal ensued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Appellant raises issues for our consideration as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqJX\">1. Did the circuit court err when it dismissed the appellant\u2019s ease pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-507?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>2. Did the circuit court err when it ruled that the appellant had failed to meet the notice requirement of the Maryland Tort Claims Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">(a) Should the Maryland Tort Claims Act be read in conjunction with the other statutory \u2022 provisions which limit the use of sovereign immunity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">(b) Is the U.S.F. &amp; G. a proper designee of the treasurer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">(c) If the court finds that U.S.F. &amp; G. is not a designee within the meaning of the Act, then did the trial court err in dismissing the suit based on technical deviations which were not fatal to appellant\u2019s claim, making dismissal of the suit inequitable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">(d) Is appellee estopped from arguing that appellant has failed to meet the notice requirements of the Act?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">In our view of the law relevant to the facts of this case, it is only necessary for us to discuss Md.Rule 2-507 and former Md.Trans.Code Ann. \u00a7 17 \u2014 107(b) as it related to the Maryland Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">First with regard to Rule 2-507, we stated in <em>Dypski v. Bethlehem, Steel Corp., </em>74 Md.App. 692, 699-700, 539 A.2d 1165 (1988) (citations omitted), \u201cMd.Rule 2-507 was promulgated to remove \u2018dead\u2019 cases from the docket, not to penalize plaintiffs for the procrastination of their attorneys.\u201d We do not wish to dwell upon the Rule 2-507 dismissal since it is abundantly clear (and admitted by both parties) that the dismissal appealed from was not based upon Rule 2-507 but rather upon the impact of the Maryland Tort Claims Act. We can only assume that, had the Rule 2-507 question been the only consideration before Judge Ross, he would have exercised his discretion in determining whether to strike the dismissal using the criteria set out in <em>Powell v. Gutierrez, </em>310 Md. 302, 529 A.2d 352 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">It is clear that appellant has failed to comply with the requirements of the Maryland Tort Claims Act. If he were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>required to proceed under the Act the dismissal by the trial court would be appropriate. It is apparent to us, however, that former \u00a7 17-107(b) of the Trans. Art., in effect at the pertinent time, made it unnecessary for appellant to comply with the Tort Claims Act in order to maintain this suit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Azjs\">Trans. Art. \u00a7 17-107(b) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">(b) Defense of sovereign immunity \u2014 An owner or lessee of any motor vehicle registered under Title 13 [Vehicle Laws \u2014 Certificates of Title and Registration of Vehicles] of this article may not raise the defense of sovereign or governmental immunity, to the extent of benefits provided by the security accepted by the Administration under \u00a7 17-103 [vehicle liability insurance policy] of this subtitle, in any judicial proceeding in which the plaintiff claims that personal injury, property damage, or death was caused by the negligent use of the motor vehicle while in government service or performing a task of benefit to the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Appellees recognize that \u00a7 17-107(b) constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity enacted by the legislature prior to the advent of the Tort Claims Act. They insist, however, that former \u00a7 17-107(b) must be read in conjunction with the Tort Claims Act to the end that the procedures set out in the Tort Claims Act must be followed before a suit allowed by \u00a7 17-107(b) could have been prosecuted. We disagree. Had the legislature desired that the requirements of the Tort Claims Act be applicable to \u00a7 17-107(b) it would have stated accordingly. Rather, the legislature provided in Maryland Tort Claims Act, State Gov\u2019t Article, \u00a7 12-103, \u201cThis subtitle does not: (1) limit any other law that: (i) waives the sovereign immunity of the State or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>units of the State government in tort____\u201d We understand the foregoing to mean that the enactment of the Tort Claims Act did not limit the effectiveness of former \u00a7 17-107(b), and a suit may have been brought pursuant to \u00a7 17-107(b) irrespective and independently of the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In a similar case, <em>Collier v. Nesbitt, </em>79 Md.App. 729, 558 A.2d 1242 (1989), we held that the procedural requirements of the Tort Claims Act did not apply to suits filed under Trans. Art. \u00a7 7-702 which waives sovereign immunity with respect to cases against the State Mass Transit Administration. What we said in <em>Collier, </em>79 Md.App. at 733, 558 A.2d 1242, applies with equal force to the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">We perceive no conflict between \u00a7 12-106 and \u00a7 7-702, nor do we perceive a pre-emption issue. Rather we see two statutes each with a different focus. While both effect a waiver of sovereign immunity, they do so to varied extents. Section 7-702 of the Transportation Article pertains only to torts committed by MTA personnel in the course of their employment. By contrast, the Tort Claims Act is a gap-filler provision authorizing suits where no specific sovereign immunity waiver otherwise exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The Tort Claims Act was enacted subsequent to \u00a7 17-107(b). Had the legislature intended to superimpose the requirements of the Torts Claims Act on suits permitted by \u00a7 17-107(b), it would have done so. It is clear to us that this suit may have been brought pursuant to former \u00a7 17-107(b) independently of the requirements of the Tort Claims Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-9\">. Rule 2-507 provides <em>inter alia </em>that an action is subject to dismissal at the expiration of one year from the last docket entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\">. In distilling these facts, we lacked the assistance of appellant who failed to comply with this provision of Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 501(i): \u201cThe date of filing of each paper reproduced in the extract shall be stated at the head of the copy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\">. Effective July 1, 1988, subsection (b) was redesignated as subsection (c). 1988 Md.Laws ch. 787. Subsection (c) was later rewritten, 1990 Md.Laws ch. 546, \u00a7 3, and in its present form reads, \u201cAn owner or lessee of any motor vehicle registered under Title 13 of this article may not raise the defense of sovereign or governmental immunity as described under \u00a7 5-399.4 [Negligent use of motor vehicle while in government service] of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\">. Our holding applies equally to \u00a7 17-107(c), the recodified version of former \u00a7 17-107(b). <em>See </em>1990 Md.Laws Section 4, ch. 546 which provides that \u201cthe provisions of this Act are intended only to consolidate the current provisions on immunities ... and to make stylistic changes, and there is no intent to alter substantively any statutory or common-law immunities, limitations on liability, or prohibited actions.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
