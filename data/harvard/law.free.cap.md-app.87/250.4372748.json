On June 27, 1990, he was tried by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and was convicted of all three counts. He was committed to the custody of the Division of Correction for four years, with all but one year suspended in favor of five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Appellant raises the following issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-14\">Did the trial judge improperly deny appellant his right to a fair trial by directly impugning the integrity of defense counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>II.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">Did the trial judge improperly deny the appellant\u2019s right to cross-examine a witness about his bias, interest, or motive to falsify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">Did the Court err in admitting evidence of other crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">IY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">Did the trial judge err in refusing to recuse itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">V.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">Did the trial judge abuse his discretion in denying appellant\u2019s request for a postponement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">This case hinges on the trial court\u2019s reaction to the cross-examination of Dwayne Tolbert by defense counsel. On cross-examination, defense counsel sought to inquire into whether criminal charges were pending against Tolbert, a State\u2019s witness. The cross-examination occurred as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-13\">[MR. ALLEN:] Do you have any cases pending a [sic] criminal court of Baltimore City?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\">THE COURT: Mr. Allen, Mr. Allen, Mr. Allen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-15\">MR. STANLEY: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-16\">THE COURT: Come up please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-17\">(COUNSEL AND DEFENDANT APPROACH THE BENCH AND THE FOLLOWING ENSUED.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-18\">THE COURT: Mr. Allen, I heard you telling your client that you have been in this business for 42 years. \u2014 overheard you saying that. For 42 years you have known better than to ask that question that you are asking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYq\">MR. ALLEN: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-19\">THE COURT: Don\u2019t you ever do that again in this court. You know better than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-20\">MR. ALLEN: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>THE COURT: Now, what are you talking about? How is it ever \u2014 when somebody has a case pending to impeach the \u2014 of impeachment? How? Never is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">MR. ALLEN: You are right, Your Honor. I apologize to the court. I apologize to my brother here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">MR. STANLEY: \u2014prejudicial, I think it would be appropriate to \u2014 this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">THE COURT: \u2014of a case pending\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">MR. STANLEY: Your Honor, it is a case with Mr. Suggs. Mr. Suggs has another case coming up. Absolutely \u2014 as far as that 2001 \u2014 he stole the [furnace] out of 2001 North Avenue and took it to another place and he is going to be tried on that by me coming up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">MR. ALLEN: He has already convicted him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">MR. SUGGS: \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">MR. ALLEN: Keep still.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">THE COURT: And is this gentleman charged with stealing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">[MR. STANLEY]: He was involved in it. He is the one who took the police to it and showed them where it was and he got the serial number off of it. And he went back\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-14\">MR. ALLEN: This is another case. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this case, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-15\">MR. STANLEY: It does because you brought it up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-16\">MR. ALLEN: I brought what up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-17\">MR. SUGGS: \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-18\">MR. STANLEY: Your Honor, if I may make a suggestion. If we can \u2014 withhold a ruling, I might have requested a mistrial be noted, and after the case is finished then I would request a ruling on my motion for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-19\">THE COURT: All right. You all go back to counsel table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-20\">(COUNSEL AND DEFENDANT RETURNED TO THE TRIAL TABLE.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-21\">THE COURT: <em>Members of the jury, the comment Mr. Allen made was highly inappropriate. </em>This witness has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>not been convicted of any criminal activities, and that should not have been asked. Please disregard that comment by Mr. Allen. <em>Mr. Allen, don\u2019t ever do that again in this courtroom.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">MR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">THE COURT: Next question, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">[MR. ALLEN]: Mr. Tolbert, do you have any cases pending in court in which Mr. Suggs is a prosecuting witness concerning a ladder? Do you recall that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">MR. STANLEY: Your Honor, I object. This is absolutely unconscionable, what is going on right now. Your Honor, I respectfully move for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">THE COURT: <em>Sheriff, take a hold of Mr. Allen, please. Members of the jury, go to the jury room please. </em>Mr. Allen\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">MR. ALLEN: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">THE COURT: I have just told you not to do that again, ever, and you did the same thing. It is highly inappropriate to bring up any criminal charges not yet resulting in a conviction, and even if it results in a conviction, it has to fit into a category of a felony, treason, or an infamous crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">There has been no indication that this person is convicted, has been convicted, of a crime in that category. You may ask him that if you wish, and if he says, yes, that is the end of it. And if he says no, you can prove it otherwise if you have a certified copy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-13\">You have been a member of the bar for 42 years and it pains this judge to see [you] go out that way. This case is over. <em>You be [sic] barred from this courtroom forever and ever and ever.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-14\">MR. ALLEN: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-15\">THE COURT: Why [do] you persist in doing this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-16\">MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, it is a very difficult case and Mr. Suggs is a very difficult client, and I apologize for any inconvenience I have caused anybody if Your Honor please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>THE COURT: Mr. Suggs is feeding you questions. You made a response to him during the course of the trial and the jury probably heard that. He asked you some question. I don\u2019t know what he asked, but you told him \u201cBecause I am the lawyer and I have been doing it for 42 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">He is probably feeding you the questions that you are getting in trouble about now. And a lawyer who allows a client to do that, jeopardizing his own status at the bar, and you have just had your [sic] jeopardized in this courtroom because you can\u2019t come back in here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">MR. ALLEN: \u2014, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">THE COURT: Sir. Since you are age 18 or over, were you represented by a lawyer \u2014 have you ever been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude? Moral turpitude means something to indicate that you are a person of low moral character, such as a theft, a robbery, a murder, or an infamous crime, a felony, or treason? [<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">THE WITNESS: I was charged with accepting, um, stolen goods, about eight years ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">THE COURT: But you weren\u2019t convicted of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">THE WITNESS: I was given a fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">THE WITNESS: \u2014judgment before verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-12\">MR. STANLEY: Judgement before verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-13\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-14\">THE COURT: Mr. Allen, you cannot inquire any more about this witness\u2019s involvement in any criminal activity whatsoever unless you have a certified copy of a conviction to prove that he has just not told the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-15\">MR. ALLEN: I will not inquire, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>THE COURT: Bring that jury back, please. Now if you do that again, Mr. Allen, I am putting you in jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">MR. ALLEN: I understand, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">(JURY ENTERED THE COURTROOM)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">THE COURT: Members of the jury, you will note that the judge scolded Mr. Allen. Please don\u2019t hold that against him or otherwise let that interfere in your judgment. You are concerned with whether or not this defendant, [sic] guilty or not guilty, of unauthorized use of a van, unauthorized use of a beeper, and unauthorized use of keys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\"><em>The reason for the judge\u2019s action is because the defendant\u2019s lawyer was about ten miles out of limit. </em>The law is that you cannot bring up anything concerning one\u2019s past unless that results in a conviction, and a conviction has to be of a crime involving moral turpitude, a felony, or an infamous crime, to relate to credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">This witness has not been convicted, period, and it is improper for one to imply that. And how you show convictions is through a certified copy of a court document. Mr. Allen doesn\u2019t have that because it doesn\u2019t exist. <em>So please disregard the sideshow, if you will, and concentrate on whether or not the State has proven this defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of offenses he is charged with.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">MR. ALLEN: I have no further questions, Your Honor. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">Unfortunately neither the Court nor the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney recognized that Mr. Allen\u2019s question asked after the bench conference was quite different from that asked immediately prior to the bench conference. The initial question appeared to attempt to bring out criminal charges pending in general. Such an inquiry is, of course, not ordinarily permitted, and the trial judge was correct in intervening. The second question, however, clearly sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>to inquire into possible bias on the part of the witness, and, therefore, was entirely proper. It appears that the emotional overreaction of the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney to Mr. Allen\u2019s innocent question may have precipitated an equal overreaction on the part of the trial judge. Appellant asserts that his right to a fair trial was denied because the trial judge failed to \u201cdischarge his duties in a \u2018calmly judicial, dispassionate, and impartial\u2019 manner\u201d as required under <em>Spencer v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 71, 77, 543 A.2d 851 (1988) (quoting <em>Frantz v. United States, </em>62 F.2d 737, 739 (6th Cir.1933)). Appellant claims that the trial judge improperly directed comments from the bench toward defense counsel, which directly impugned the integrity of the defense counsel. <em>Spencer, </em>76 Md.App. at 78, 543 A.2d 851. <em>See State v. Runge, </em>317 Md. 613, 624, 566 A.2d 88 (1989). We agree with the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">When the court commanded the sheriff to \u201ctake a hold of Mr. Allen, please,\u201d the jury was still in the courtroom.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sheriff moved immediately behind Mr. Allen in a position to exercise control over him, and Mr. Allen was gathering his papers. When the jurors returned, the court informed them, \u201cThe reason for the judge\u2019s action is because the defendant\u2019s lawyer was about ten miles out of limit.\u201d Shortly thereafter the court asked the jury to \u201cdisregard the sideshow.\u201d This instruction did little, if anything, to remedy the prejudicial effect of the court\u2019s comments. As we announced in <em>Liner v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 381, 392, 489 A.2d 553 (1985), \u201cA judge may, and should, be firm; but he or she is not entitled to be a tyrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Under the totality of these circumstances, we hold that the trial judge\u2019s comments painted such a prejudicial portrait of the defense counsel as to deny appellant his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The State argues that under Md.Rule 8-131(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appellant\u2019s failure to object to the court\u2019s action precludes appellate review of this issue. We disagree. It can be inferred from the record that appellant\u2019s counsel did not object because he reasonably feared that he would personally incur the greater wrath of the already outraged trial judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, by trying to appease the court, defense counsel may well have acted in his client\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Appellant further contends that the trial judge improperly restricted the cross-examination of prosecution witness Dwayne Tolbert. Appellant argues that Tolbert should have been required to answer whether there were any cases pending against him in which the appellant was a witness for the prosecution. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees the right to cross-examine a witness about his bias, interest, or motive to falsify. This right is also guaranteed by Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>Brown v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 414, 418-19, 538 A.2d 317 (1988). It is possible that Tolbert testified against the appellant in order to satisfy his own vindictive grudge. As a result, under <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>320 Md. 300, 577 A.2d 356 (1990), appellant had \u201ca right to demonstrate this prejudice to the jury so that the jurors could accurately weigh the witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d This right is also dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>cussed in <em>Johnson and Walters v. State, </em>30 Md.App. 512, 516-17, 352 A.2d 371 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">The test of admissibility, therefore, is whether the question asked is directed at eliciting from a prosecution witness the fact that he may be under pressure to testify favorably for the State, as when he is under formal accusation, and/or incarceration awaiting trial. We do not mean to imply that any time a witness testifies against a criminal defendant his entire record of previous arrests becomes relevant to the inquiry. Only where there is some present possibility of coercion should such cross-examination be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The record previously cited disclosed that Tolbert and Suggs were both \u201cinvolved\u201d in another pending theft case. As a result, appellant should have been allowed to cross-examine Tolbert about that case. The court improperly denied this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The State urges that this issue is not preserved for appellate review because defense counsel failed to make a proffer of what he sought to elicit on cross-examination. <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 603, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984) (\u201c[T]he question of whether the exclusion of evidence is erroneous and constitutes prejudicial error is not properly preserved for appellate review unless there has been a formal proffer of what the contents and relevance of the excluded testimony would have been.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The record reflects, however, that defense counsel failed to make a proffer for the same reason that he failed to object to the court\u2019s impropriety; he was reasonably fearful of being held in contempt by the court. <em>See </em>Footnote 2, <em>supra. </em>In the first bench conference, the judge unambiguously expressed his extreme displeasure with the defense counsel\u2019s performance stating, \u201c[Djon\u2019t ever do that again in this courtroom.\u201d When defense counsel rephrased his question to the witness, the court, in the presence of the jury, commanded the sheriff to \u201ctake a hold of Mr. Allen.\u201d In the conference that followed, the judge told counsel that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>he was \u201cbarred from this courtroom forever and ever and ever.\u201d The court also informed the jury that \u201cdefendant\u2019s lawyer was about ten miles out of limit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We, therefore, disagree with the State\u2019s assertion that \u201cAt the bench the court afforded defense counsel every opportunity to make a complete proffer of the relevance of the question.\u201d For the reasons stated, we excuse appellant\u2019s failure to make a proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial judge denied appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial by directly impugning the integrity of defense counsel. We elect to review this issue despite appellant\u2019s failure to object to the court\u2019s action. Furthermore, the trial judge improperly denied the appellant\u2019s right to cross-examine a witness about the witness\u2019 bias, interest, or motive to falsify. Appellant did not waive our review of this issue, under the facts and circumstances of this case, by failing to make a proffer of what he sought to elicit on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In light of these conclusions, it is not necessary for us to address the other issues raised by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-16\">. The trial court incorrectly referred to crimes of moral turpitude as a category of offenses admissible for impeachment purposes. To the contrary, infamous crimes may be admitted to impeach a witness. Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 10-905. For a discussion on this point, <em>see Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 358-363, 535 A.2d 445 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel, at oral argument, stated that the videotape of the proceedings showed that the jury was still in the courtroom. We have reviewed the tape, and he is correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\">. Md.Rule 8-131(a) provides in relevant part: \"Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court ...\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\">. In <em>Liner v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 381, 392, 489 A.2d 553 (1985), we ruled that the trial judge acted in an \u201carbitrary, capricious [and] oppressive\u201d manner when he imposed three separate contempt orders on defense counsel. A careful reading of the case reveals that the lawyer did not waive appellate review by failing to object to the court\u2019s conduct. Apparently, counsel reasonably feared that any objection would result in the imposition of a more severe penalty personally against him and to the detriment of his client.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
