Testimony at trial indicated that Ms. Goshen had died from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>strangulation. Dr. Daniel Garner testified that DNA obtained from appellant\u2019s blood matched DNA obtained from semen found in Ms. Goshen\u2019s underpants. FBI Agent Gary Kanaski testified that a crime scene shoe print recovered from between Ms. Goshen\u2019s legs was similar to a shoe recovered from appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Testimony of witnesses indicated that Ms. Goshen, on the morning of October 13, 1987, approached a group of young men and offered to trade a Walkman radio and a watch for cocaine. Testimony also indicated that appellant, Ms. Gosh-en and a second male left 1410 Nova Avenue and walked in the direction of 1400 Nova Avenue. Tyrone Conley testified that appellant and Goshen went in the direction of the laundry room, and Conley subsequently saw someone in the laundry room smoking what he assumed was cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Appellant raises four issues for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">I. Did the trial court err in refusing to propound a requested <em>voir dire </em>question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">II. Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress certain evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">III. Was appellant denied a fair trial because of the admission of evidence of other crimes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">IV. Did the trial court err in admitting DNA related evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-12\">Did the trial court err in refusing to propound a requested <em>voir dire </em>question?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">One of the <em>voir dire </em>questions requested was No. 16 which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-14\">16. The defendant in this case is a black male and the alleged victim is a white female. This case involves allegations of rape or attempted rape, as well as the use of procurement of drugs and a strangulation homicide. Would these facts or allegations be of such nature that you feel you could not sit as a juror in such a case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>render an impartial verdict only on the facts presented to you in this trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney objected saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">Your Honor, with regard to defense question number 16, I don\u2019t have any problem with it except for the part that states, \u2018The defendant in this case is a black male and the victim is a white female.\u2019 I don\u2019t like to interject races into the case, the other portion of the question I have no problem with____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Upon asking the <em>voir dire </em>questions, the trial judge, in lieu of the requested question, inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">As I indicated to you before, this case involves allegations of a sex offense, it involves allegations of drugs, would that prejudice somebody so that they could not fairly and impartially decide this case based solely on evidence they\u2019re going to hear in this courtroom?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASV\">During the course of the jury selection, defense counsel used thirteen of his allotted twenty strikes. At the conclusion of the jury selection while the jurors were still present, the Court stated, \u201cAll right, Mr. Niland, there are 12 jurors sitting there, you satisfied?\u201d Mr. Niland replied, \u201cDefense is satisfied, Your Honor.\u201d Alternates were then selected and the remaining jurors were excused. The Court then proceeded to hear motions. As his second motion, Mr. Niland stated, \u201cNext, Your Honor, I'm going to except to the court\u2019s choosing not to give all of defendant\u2019s voir dire request number 16, as the State had previously objected.\u201d The trial judge replied, \u201cAll right. Anything else?\u201d This, apparently, sufficed as a denial as the court proceeded to other motions. At the conclusion of the motions hearing, the jury was brought in and sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">While not a model of clarity, we believe question 16, as framed, was intended to discern, among other things, whether any member of the jury panel would entertain prejudice against a black male accused of raping and murdering a white female. Clearly, the question, or one of similar import, should have been asked. In <em>Ham v. South </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Carolina, </em>409 U.S. 524, 93 S.Ct. 848, 35 L.Ed.2d 46 (1973), a black male was charged with marijuana possession. His defense was that he was the target of a frame-up because of his involvement in civil rights activities. The trial judge denied his request to interrogate the veniremen with respect to racial prejudice. The Supreme Court noted that there was no constitutional requirement demanding that the jurors be asked specific questions about racial prejudice. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court reversed the conviction, \u201c[sjince one of the purposes of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to insure \u2018these essential demands of fairness,\u2019 and since a principal purpose of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment was to \u2018prohibit the State from invidiously discriminating on the basis of race.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ham, </em>409 U.S. at 526-527, 93 S.Ct. at 850-851 (citations omitted). Thus, the only way to discover whether potential jurors held any racial bias against Ham for his civil rights involvement was to ask the jurors on <em>voir dire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The rule in Maryland is identical. As explained in <em>Thornton v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 205, 216, 355 A.2d 767 (1975), \u201cMaryland, like the Supreme Court, holds that whatever the ethnic background of the accused, he or she is not entitled to promiscuously probe for racial prejudice absent circumstances in the case warranting such inquiry.\u201d One such circumstance was enunciated in <em>Holmes v. State, </em>65 Md. App. 428, 501 A.2d 76 (1985), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>310 Md. 260, 528 A.2d 1279 (1987), wherein Judge Robert M. Bell, writing for this Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thoroughly analyzed the factual situation requiring a <em>voir dire </em>question designed to elicit prejudicial beliefs or attitudes. Judge Bell opined, \u201cOur review of the cases causes us to conclude that, in a criminal case, prejudice may be a factor because of the facts of the case when the complainant and the witnesses for the State are of a different race than the defendant, and the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>involves victimization of another person and the use of violence.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>65 Md.App. at 438-439, 528 A.2d 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The case now under consideration is similar to <em>Holmes </em>in that it appears, as in Holmes, the objection to the failure to give the requested instruction was waived. In <em>Trimble v. State, </em>321 Md. 248, 257, 582 A.2d 794 (1990), the Court of Appeals stated, \u201cDefense counsel\u2019s declaration of his satisfaction with the jury was an affirmative acceptance of those jurors who had been selected. Thus, he may not object now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Defense counsel did object to the court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction prior to the jury being sworn. He waited, however, until after he had announced acceptance of the jury and the remaining jurors were excused. We hold that his belated objection came too late. Since the jurors who had undergone <em>voir dire </em>on the case had been excused, it would have been necessary at that point to begin the entire process anew. Ideally, the objection should have been articulated to the trial judge following the <em>voir dire </em>and prior to jury selection. Even an objection lodged after the jury selection, but while the remaining panel was still available, could have been managed by the trial judge. But, certainly, it would be unreasonable to permit the objection after the jury was accepted and the remaining panel excused. We hold, therefore, that appellant\u2019s objection to the trial court\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>examination was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress certain evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Appellant objected to the introduction into evidence of one of his tennis shoes. In this connection, Detective Price testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">A. I entered the interview room again with Mr. Wilson, and this was approximately 6:00 a.m. I asked him to lift his foot up a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-11\">Q. Was he wearing tennis shoes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>A. He was wearing tennis shoes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\">Q. Was it a tennis shoe lift?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">A. Print, yes, it was. I looked at them, and they looked similar so I told him \u2014 I said, \u2018How about taking the shoe off a minute for me, please?\u2019 And he did so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">Q. And what happened after he took the shoe off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap6\">A. When he took the shoe off, I held the print up next to the shoe, and I looked at it, and I showed it to him, and I said, \u2018Look. Ray Charles could see that these are the same two, that they are a match,\u2019 and it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">Q. What did he do when you confronted him with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI_\">A. He then admitted that he was in the laundry room at 1400 Nova Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">Q. And that was where the body of Karen Goshen was found?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">The shoe was then seized by Detective Price without the benefit of a warrant. Appellant avers that the seizure of the shoe and the admission of Detective Price\u2019s testimony as to appellant\u2019s statement that he was at the crime scene was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">It is clear that appellant consented to the removal of his shoe. After seeing the comparison between his shoe and the crime scene shoe print, appellant admitted that he had been in the laundry room. Since he consented to the seizure of his shoe, appellant was not deprived of his Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See Gamble v. State, </em>318 Md. 120, 129, 567 A.2d 95 (1989). Even if appellant had not consented, the seizure of the shoe would have been permissible as the result of a search incident to a lawful arrest or as a search during administrative processing at the jail. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). Since the seizure of the shoe was proper, the court did not err in admitting appellant\u2019s statement which resulted from the comparison between appellant\u2019s shoe and the shoe print.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Appellant next complains that the seizure of a blood sample used in DNA testing was illegal for the reason that the search warrant used to obtain the blood was illegally obtained. Appellant avers that Detective White, in applying for the warrant, made material omissions in the affidavit used to support the warrant. Specifically, appellant complains that Detective White failed to include information inconsistent with the State\u2019s version of events, in that she included inculpatory evidence but failed to include exculpatory evidence favorable to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Appellant relies upon <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). In <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155, 98 S.Ct. at 2676, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">[W]here the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant\u2019s request. In the event that at that hearing the allegation of perjury or reckless disregard is established by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, and with the affidavit\u2019s false material set to one side, the affidavit\u2019s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause, the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">In the case at bar, a <em>Franks </em>hearing was held, in which appellant was able to question Corporal Nancy White, the officer who applied for the warrant. Appellant alleges that the mere omission of facts favorable to his position constituted an act of deliberate falsehood. In <em>Yeagy v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 1, 8, 491 A.2d 1199 (1985), Judge Rosalyn Bell, writing for this Court, pointed out that many Federal courts have applied the <em>Franks </em>rationale to omissions. The omission, however, must be made \u201cintentionally or with reckless disregard for accuracy; a negligent or innocent mistake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>does not suffice.\u201d <em>Yeagy, </em>63 Md.App. at 8, 491 A.2d 1199. Detective White testified that she excluded the conclusion of the FBI examiner that the hairs found at the scene and on the body were not those of appellant. The affiant further testified that she did not include appellant\u2019s denials that he committed the offense nor did she mention the evidence that another man was with Ms. Goshen near the time of her death. The detective also excluded an FBI report which stated that there was no conclusive match between the shoe print found at the crime scene and the appellant\u2019s shoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Detective White, however, also omitted a great deal of inculpatory information from her affidavit. She excluded an FBI report which concluded that the shoe print matched the size and design of the appellant\u2019s shoe. She did not mention that the appellant\u2019s blood was compared to semen found in the victim\u2019s pubic hair, and that this comparison revealed a consistency for PGM subgroup and ABH blood group substances. In fact, all FBI reports were excluded from the affidavit. Furthermore, Detective White testified that she did not purposely mislead the magistrate in her preparation of the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Based on this evidence, the trial court concluded that any omissions from the affidavit were not motivated by a reckless disregard for accuracy. As a result, the trial court ruled that probable cause for the issuance of the warrant was present and the warrant properly issued. It follows, therefore, that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in finding that there was no basis for suppression of the evidence stemming from the blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Appellant further complains that, during his interview with Detective White, appellant indicated he was not inclined to answer further questions. Despite this, appellant was subsequently questioned by Detective Price. Appellant\u2019s contention appears to be a misconception of what actually occurred. Detective White testified that she asked appellant to put in writing his admission that he was in the laundry room and saw Ms. Goshen\u2019s body, but appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>refused. Appellant\u2019s position rests upon his assertion that the trial judge found that appellant indicated that he did not wish to answer further questions. What actually transpired with respect to the trial judge is somewhat different than appellant\u2019s version. The judge stated, \u201cI understand what your point is. He said first he signs a paper that says I am willing to answer some questions, and then came a time where he said I am not willing to answer any more questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">When considered in context, the judge\u2019s statement is not a finding that appellant\u2019s version of what occurred is the correct one, rather, it is clear that the judge is merely stating defense counsel\u2019s position in order to assure defense counsel that the trial judge understood the issue under discussion. After a full argument on counsel\u2019s respective positions, the trial judge stated, \u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with what you have said except he could have cut it off at any time. That\u2019s why I am going to deny the motions to suppress any and all statements. The minute he said I want a lawyer it was cut off.\u201d The clear message in the foregoing statement is that the trial judge agreed with the legal principles put forth by defense counsel, but found as a matter of fact that questioning ceased upon appellant\u2019s request. It follows, therefore, that appellant\u2019s statements to Detective Price were properly admitted, since the trial judge found Detective White\u2019s version of what occurred more credible than appellant\u2019s version of what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">III.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">Did the trial court err in admitting evidence of other crimes?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">In the course of Detective White\u2019s testimony the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">Q. And after he denied knowing the victim, Karen Gosh-en, what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">A. We continued to talk. I told Mr. Wilson that I was aware of his arrest record, which\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>In response to an objection by defense counsel, the court admonished the jurors to strike from their minds the most recent question and answer given by Officer White. The jury is, of course, presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Crutchfield v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 101, 108-109, 555 A.2d 1070, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>318 Md. 200, 567 A.2d 449 (1989). The decision whether to grant a mistrial is left to the exercise of the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>State v. Crutchfield, </em>318 Md. 200, 567 A.2d 449 (1989). We perceive no abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Appellant\u2019s second complaint in this area is that the trial judge erred in permitting Detective Price to testify that appellant had told him that \u201che had gone to 1400 [Nova Avenue] with Gary and smoked ... cocaine.\u201d This evidence was not admitted to show appellant\u2019s criminal propensity; rather, it was admitted to show that he committed the crime for which he was being tried. If the admission of this testimony was in error, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Tyrone Conley, called to testify for appellant, stated that he saw appellant on October 13, 1987 with others smoking cocaine in the \u201claundrymat.\u201d The introduction of later testimony, without objection, to the same effect as the earlier objected to testimony, renders any error in the earlier ruling harmless. <em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 507, 403 A.2d 1221, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1021, 100 S.Ct. 680, 62 L.Ed.2d 654 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Did the trial court err in admitting DNA evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Appellant mounts a varied attack on the admission of DNA evidence by the trial court. Initially, appellant avers that Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 10-915 (Supp.1984) is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The State argues that appellant failed to preserve his objection to the constitutionality of the Act by failing to object when the State\u2019s forensic chemist testified that the DNA pattern from Wilson\u2019s blood matched the semen sample obtained from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>victim. We agree with the State\u2019s position. Under Maryland Rule 4-323(a), \u201cAn objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise, the objection is waived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s oral motion <em>in limine </em>is insufficient to preserve the issue for our review. In his motion <em>in limine, </em>counsel for the appellant objected to the introduction of DNA evidence, citing its \u201cscientific unreliability.\u201d During the pretrial hearing, the judge neither admitted nor denied the evidence. Instead, the case was reset for trial and the court announced that \u201cwe will deal with [the admissibility of DNA evidence] before the trial.\u201d The issue, however, was not addressed before trial. At trial the State\u2019s forensic chemist testified that he relied on the DNA evidence in order to implicate the appellant. This testimony was admitted without objection at the time it was offered. Under <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 356, 535 A.2d 445 (1988), \u201cIf the trial judge admits the questionable evidence, the party who made the motion <em>[in limine </em>] ordinarily must object at the time the evidence is actually offered to preserve his objection for appellate review.\u201d Furthermore, \u201ca motion <em>in limine </em>is not the equivalent of a continuing objection.\u201d <em>Beghtol v. Michael, </em>80 Md.App. 387, 393, 564 A.2d 82 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>318 Md. 514, 569 A.2d 643 (1990). As a result, we hold that defense counsel\u2019s mere motion <em>in limine </em>did not obviate the necessity for objection when the damaging evidence was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">At trial, the State\u2019s first witness was Corporal Nancy White through whom the State attempted to introduce statements made by the appellant. Defense counsel objected, and the following bench conference ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I just want to make it clear that I am going to have a continuing objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">THE COURT: That\u2019s what I was going to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>DEFENSE COUNSEL: I want to make it clear that I still want to maintain the following bases, I want to maintain the reasons that I set out in the motions hearings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG8f\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I also want to say that I want to maintain the position that I raised in the motions in limine with respect to the fact that what\u2019s contained in the statement do not constitute admissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">THE COURT: Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And I don\u2019t want to object to every answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">THE COURT: That\u2019s why I brought you up, you\u2019ll have a continuing objection to all the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-11\">THE COURT: All the statements. That we have more police officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-12\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: We have more police officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP-\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, each time I am going to object at least once when he offers each item.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-13\">THE COURT: Fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But I won\u2019t object to each question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-15\">THE COURT: Right. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">Under Maryland Rule 4-323(b), \u201cFor purposes of review by the trial court or on appeal, the continuing objection is effective only as to questions clearly within its scope.\u201d The scope of this continuing objection is confined to matters relevant to the appellant\u2019s statements. Defense counsel\u2019s broad and elusive comment, \u201cI want to maintain the reasons that I set out in the motions hearings\u201d was insufficient to inform the court of_the possibility that the defense was addressing theradmissibility of DNA evidence, especially when the discussion at hand focused on the statements. The motions hearings themselves substantially addressed whether to suppress statements and a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>warrant. The hearings relegated the DNA issue to a strictly cursory and limited discussion. In addition, any proper objection made by the defense regarding the chemist\u2019s DNA related testimony was waived by defense counsel\u2019s failure to object the second time the chemist testified on direct examination. <em>Robeson, </em>285 Md. at 506, 403 A.2d 1221. For these reasons, we rule that the trial court properly admitted DNA related evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Accordingly, we rule that appellant\u2019s objection to the trial court\u2019s refusal to propound a requested <em>voir dire </em>question came too late. The trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress certain evidence. Appellant was not denied a fair trial because of the admission of evidence of other crimes. Finally, the trial court properly admitted DNA related evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\">.
