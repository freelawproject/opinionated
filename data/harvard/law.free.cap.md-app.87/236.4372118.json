Thomas Ward, presiding) affirming the action of the Insurance Commissioner permitting appellee, Allstate Insurance Company (\u201cAllstate\u201d), to \u201cnon-renew\u201d appellant\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">We are asked to consider whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">I. The lower court erred in refusing to consider evidence not presented before the Insurance Commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">II. The lower court erred in affirming the order of the Insurance Commissioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\n<em>Facts and Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Zachary Fromberg was an insured of Allstate for thirty-three years, from 1956 through 1989. He was considered by Allstate to be an acceptable risk during that time. On May 10, 1989, Allstate notified Fromberg of its intention to refuse to renew his policy unless Fromberg chose to be excluded from that policy. The grounds for the non-renewal were three claims that Allstate had paid under the policy and a speeding ticket that Fromberg had received. Allstate had paid $542 when Fromberg hit a fixed object on 12/5/88; it paid $181 when Fromberg struck another vehicle while backing up on 12/24/86; and it paid $333 when Fromberg struck a second parked vehicle on 7/16/88. Fromberg had received the speeding ticket on 1/15/87.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">Allstate\u2019s non-renewal notice explained that [i]n determining whether a particular risk should be continued, Allstate relies on certain recognized independent research studies [that] have shown that people with accident and/or motor vehicle violation involvement are more likely to have future accidents than people without this involvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The notice then listed one such study, entitled \u201cBasic California Traffic Conviction and Accident Record Facts, December 1987\u201d (\u201cthe California Study\u201d). It cited a table containing accident and violation data developed in the California Study. The notice informed Fromberg that \u201c[a]pplying this table to your policy record indicates a significantly greater chance of future accidents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Abdu\">Fromberg protested the notice of non-renewal, pursuant to Article 48A, Section 240AA(d) of the Insurance Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 21, 1989, a hearing was held before a Hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>ing Examiner. Appellant was not represented by an attorney. Allstate produced a sole witness, Steve Kreseski, who testified that Allstate, due to its \u201ceffort to provide preferred coverage, seeks to insure those drivers that have a minimum amount of accident-involvement history.\u201d He explained that under Allstate\u2019s underwriting standards, \u201cany driver who has two or more occurrences within a three-year period shall be excluded from a multiple-driver policy or non-renewed.\u201d He added that given his driving record, Fromberg exceeded those standards. Kreseski further noted that Allstate\u2019s ability to surcharge for accidents was limited to the last two at-fault accidents<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that Allstate could not apply a surcharge for violations. Kreseski then referred to the California Study cited in Allstate\u2019s non-renewal notice. He stated that Allstate relied on the study for the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\">[a] driver who has had either traffic convictions or accident involvement is more likely to have an increased frequency of accident involvement than a driver who has had no previous traffic convictions or accident involvement history within that three-year period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">He explained that a driver like Fromberg, \u201cwho has had three accidents has a 4.48 times greater chance of subsequent accident, whereas a driver with one traffic violation has a 1.62 times greater chance of accident involvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"All\">Kreseski asked to introduce the affidavit of Matthew Stegle, an Allstate representative. This affidavit explained how statistical data drawn from the California Study was used by Allstate to estimate future accident involvement. It further described in-house studies that Allstate had performed to determine the frequency of accident involvement by the average Allstate insured. The affidavit included a three-page addendum that set forth data from the Califor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>nia study addressing the \u201cincreased chances of future accident involvement for drivers with prior accident/violation involvement compared with drivers without prior accident/violation involvement.\u201d Stegle explained that this data was used in Allstate\u2019s cancellation/non-renewal notices. The Hearing Examiner asked Fromberg if he wanted time to review the eight-page affidavit. Fromberg declined, and objected to the admission of the affidavit on the grounds of materiality. Fromberg\u2019s objection was noted and overruled. The Hearing Examiner admitted the document, \u201cwith the caveat that it will be given the appropriate weight that it merits when I review the evidence at a later point in time.\u201d Kreseski then concluded his testimony. Fromberg had no questions to ask him, and proceeded to give his own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The Hearing Examiner issued her Order on Hearing on behalf of the Insurance Commissioner on October 26, 1989. She ruled that Allstate had not violated sections 234A<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 240AA<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Insurance Code, and had met its \u201cburden of proof and production as set forth and required by Section 234A of Article 48A and <em>Crumlish v. Insurance Commissioner, et al, </em>70 Md.App. 182, 520 A.2d 738 (1987).\u201d She based these conclusions of law on the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Licensee proposed to nonrenew Policy No. 18 065 495 for the reasons set forth in its notice dated May 10, 1989; or in lieu of said nonrenewal, Licensee proposed to exclude ZACHARY FROMBERG from coverage under said policy for the reasons set forth in its notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">Complainant protested Licensee\u2019s proposed action and upon due consideration of the testimony and exhibits, I find, as a fact, that the Licensee utilizes underwriting standards which provide that it will not continue to insure any driver who has a frequency of losses, convictions for motor vehicle violations, or combination of losses and convictions (frequency is defined as at least two losses and/or convictions by any one operator).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">The Hearing Examiner finds that ZACHARY FROM-BERG has the following driving record:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">12/05/88 At-fault accident in which Zachary struck a light pole and for which Licensee paid $542.00 under collision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">12/24/86 At-fault accident in which Zachary backed into Claimant\u2019s vehicle and for which Licensee paid $81.00 under property damage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">07/16/88 At-fault accident in which Zachary struck Claimant\u2019s parked vehicle in a parking lot and for which Licensee paid $333.00 under property damage; and 01/15/88 Violation for speeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">The Hearing Examiner finds that the driving record of ZACHARY FROMBERG exceeds the Licensee\u2019s underwriting standards; and that the driving record of ZACHARY FROMBERG presents additional exposure to the Licensee which is not contemplated by its rating plan. The Licensee produced statistical data from an independent research study which demonstrated that ZACHARY FROMBERG belongs to a group or class of drivers who by virtue of 3 accidents has a 4.48 times greater chance of future accident involvement as compared to a driver with zero accidents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">The Licensee produced statistical data from an independent research study which demonstrated that ZACHARY <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>FROMBERG belongs to a group or class of drivers who by virtue of 1 conviction has a 1.62 times greater chance of future accident involvement as compared to a driver with zero convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">The Hearing Examiner finds that the statistical data presented is valid. The Licensee produced other statistical data which demonstrated there is a strong relationship between past accidents and violations and the probability for future accident involvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">The Hearing Examiner finds that the Licensee\u2019s rating plan does not provide for the imposition of an adequate rate for ZACHARY FROMBERG.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">The Hearing Examiner finds the Licensee\u2019s application of its underwriting standards to be reasonably related to its economic and business purpose. The Licensee\u2019s rating plan does not contemplate coverage for the additional exposure presented by the driving record of ZACHARY FROMBERG. Continuation of coverage for ZACHARY FROMBERG under circumstances where the Licensee will not receive an adequate rate for such additional exposure will adversely affect the Licensee\u2019s losses and expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Appellant then appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, in accordance with the procedures for appeal outlined in Article 48A, sections 240AA and 40 of the Insurance Code. On May 10, 1990, a hearing was held before Judge Thomas Ward. Fromberg was represented by an attorney at the hearing. On May 16, 1990, Judge Ward affirmed the Insurance Commissioner. Fromberg then noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Axu\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erroneously refused to consider new evidence that was not before the Insurance Commissioner. Specifically, appellant is referring to the California Study, which was not offered into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>evidence by Allstate at the first hearing. It was, however, referred to in two pieces of evidence that were admitted, namely the notice of non-renewal and the Stegle affidavit, and was cited in testimony by Allstate\u2019s representative, Kreseski. At the circuit court hearing, appellant proffered a copy of the California Study to show that (1) through the Stegle affidavit, Allstate had misrepresented mathematical computations contained within the study, and (2) Allstate in general had misapplied the California Study to appellant, the insured. Judge Ward refused to receive the Study into evidence. He stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">I\u2019m sympathetic with you, but you can\u2019t now rechange the record or put new evidence in. You can tell me what the existing record has that\u2019s inaccurate, but you\u2019ve got to use the record itself to show it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Appellant argued that in reviewing tables reproduced from a study without seeing the actual study, the Hearing Examiner had committed an error that substantially prejudiced appellant\u2019s rights, and had arrived at a decision that \u201cwas not supported by competent material and substantial evidence in view of the entire record\u201d and involved an error of law. The circuit court rejected appellant\u2019s argument that this alleged error should compel the court at least to remand the case to the Hearing Examiner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Appellant now argues that the court statutorily was required to consider the study. Pursuant to Article 48, section 40(4) of the Insurance Code, which addresses the de novo nature of appeals from the Insurance Commissioner, it is provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>[ujpon receipt of such transcripts and evidence the court shall hear the matter de novo as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. Upon hearing of the appeal, the court shall consider the evidence contained in the transcript, exhibits, and documents therein filed by the Commissioner, together with such additional evidence as may be offered by any party to the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals has determined that \u201cany party to the appeal [from the Insurance Commissioner] may offer additional evidence as a matter of right. Taking Sections 40(4) and (5) together, as we must, it is clear that this is the only meaning of \u201cde novo\u201d in Section 40(4).\u201d <em>Nuger v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>238 Md. 55, 61, 207 A.2d 619 (1965). To reach that conclusion, the <em>Nuger </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOR\">that under the old law additional evidence could be offered in the judicial proceedings on the appeal only if the court were satisfied that the evidence was material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the administrative proceedings, whereas under the new law any party to the appeal may offer additional evidence as a matter of right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Thus, it is clear that Fromberg had the right to introduce the California Study subject, of course, to general rules of evidentiary admissibility. The trial judge erred in denying that right. <em>See also Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>40 Md.App. 201, 208, 389 A.2d 422 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">It is well settled that \u201cthe basic standard for reviewing an administrative finding by the Insurance Commissioner is whether the finding is supported by \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 This means whether \u2018a reasoning mind\u201d reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>302 Md. 248, 266, 487 A.2d 271 (1985). <em>See also Miller v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>70 Md.App. 355, 365, 521 A.2d 761 (1987); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>67 Md.App. 727, 737, 509 A.2d 719 (1986). This is a narrow standard of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u201cand the decision of the administrative agency carries a presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Doctor\u2019s Hosp. v. Maryland Health Resources, </em>65 Md.App. 656, 667, 501 A.2d 1324 (1986). Reviewing courts are urged not to substitute their judgment for that of the agency from which the appeal arose. <em>See Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">With the foregoing concepts in mind, we address appellant\u2019s contention that the circuit court erred in not reversing the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Appellant urges that his rights were substantially prejudiced because the Commissioner received the Stegle affidavit into evidence without the California Study. If the Hearing Examiner had reviewed this study, appellant insists, she would have been aware that Allstate misrepresented data from the study, and she would not have found in favor of the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">To justify its decision not to renew Fromberg, Allstate had to prove that the underwriting standards that warranted this decision were \u201creasonably related to the insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes.\u201d Md.Ann.Code art. 48A, \u00a7 234A(a) (1986 &amp; Supp.1990). \u201cConclusory statements that the standard does relate are not enough to comply.\u201d <em>Crumlish v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>70 Md.App. 182, 190, 520 A.2d 738 (1987). In <em>Crumlish </em>we formulated a three question test that must be satisfied in order to sustain the burden of proof imposed by Section 234A.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">Facts must be produced which answer at least the following questions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">1. What is the statistical basis for the supposition that a person who has two or more chargeable losses within a 24 month period is more likely to have a chargeable accident within the next 12 months than a person who has had no accidents, one chargeable accident, or two or more nonchargeable accidents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">2. How valid is any such statistical evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>3. If there is statistical validity to the supposition, what direct and substantial adverse effect would it have upon [the insurer\u2019s] losses and expenses in light of its current approved rating plan?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 190, 520 A.2d 738. <em>See also Mirkin v. Medical Mutual Liability Ins. Soc. of Maryland, </em>82 Md.App. 540, 551, 572 A.2d 1126 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Appellant argues that the <em>Crumlish </em>test was not met because the data from the California Study was misused and misrepresented by Allstate and is not a valid statistical basis for Allstate\u2019s underwriting standard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The particular misrepresentation that appellant charges to Allstate is its use in the Stegle affidavit of a different correlation coefficient<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> than that contained in the study. In the affidavit\u2019s addendum, Stegle first reproduced two charts from the California Study, that respectively showed the likelihood (\u201ctimes-as-many factor\u201d) that those drivers with convictions during a two-year period would have accidents in the third year,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that those drivers who had had accidents during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>a two-year period would have accidents during the third year.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Stegle then created a chart that showed the \u201ccorrelation of prior conviction history and subsequent accident frequency based on California Study data.\u201d He specifically stated that he had computed the correlation coefficient by using the actual third-year accident frequency ratio rather than the \u201ctimes-as-many\u201d factor used in the California Study. This correlation coefficient was 0.994. The correlation coefficient for the first two charts, as computed by the study, was .079 and .045, respectively. Thus, the correlation coefficient computed by Stegle was higher than that arrived at by the California Study.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Appellant argues that the use of Stegle\u2019s coefficient negated the validity of the statistics underlying Allstate\u2019s underwriting standard and that if the Hearing Examiner had known that the correlation coefficient differed from that used in the study, it would not have found that Allstate satisfied its burden of proof. The Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings of fact demonstrated that she was persuaded that Allstate produced sufficient statistical evidence to support its underwriting standard. Her focus was not on the correlation coefficient, to which she did not even refer, but rather on the statistical data that showed that Fromberg belonged to a class of drivers \u201cwho by virtue of 3 accidents has a 4.48 times greater chance of future accident involvement as compared to a driver with zero accidents,\u201d and \u201cwho by virtue of 1 conviction has a 1.62 times greater chance of future accident involvement as compared to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>driver with zero convictions.\u201d This data satisfied Allstate\u2019s underwriting standards, which are based on the supposition that \u201cpeople with accident and/or motor vehicle violation involvement are more likely to have future accidents than people without this involvement.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>ACCIDENTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9U\">NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS FIRST TWO YEARS ACCIDENTS TIMES-AS-MANY FACTOR (THIRD YEAR)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqu\">0 1.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9S\">1 1.73</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApbX\">2 2.86</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abt\">3 4.48</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASg\">4+ 3.50</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The study apparently would have provided the correlation coefficient arrived at through use of a different method than Allstate\u2019s. We really do not know what effect this would have had upon the Hearing Examiner. Nor did the trial court. Thus, we do not know whether the appellant\u2019s rights were substantially prejudiced because the trial court and the Hearing Examiner did not review the actual study.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In <em>Muhl v. Magan, </em>313 Md. 462, 479, 545 A.2d 1321 (1988), Judge Lawrence Rodowsky observed for the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">Under \u00a7 40 the appeal from an order on hearing or from denial of a hearing is de novo. <em>Nuger </em>established early on that de novo review under \u00a7 40 does not permit a court to substitute its judgment for the expertise of the Commissioner. It is also settled that \u2018if an administrative function remains to be performed, a reviewing court may not modify the administrative agency\u2019s action even when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>a statute provides that the court may \u2018affirm, modify or set aside\u2019 because a court may not usurp administrative functions\u2019____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Although the trial court is not permitted to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency, where, as here, additional evidence is to be submitted that might have an impact on the decision of the administrative agency, the trial court is constrained to \u201cconsider the evidence contained in the transcript, exhibits, and documents therein filed by the Commissioner, together with such additional evidence as may be offered by any party to the appeal.\u201d Md.Ann.Code art. 48A, \u00a7 40(4) (1986). Upon considering the California Study together with the other evidence of record, the trial court must affirm the Commissioner unless it finds that \u201cthe substantial rights of the petitioned ] may have been prejudiced,\u201d <em>see </em>Md.Ann.Code art. 48A, \u00a7 40(5) (1986), for any of the reasons set forth in Article 48A, section 40(5), <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, Fromberg is entitled to a further hearing, wherein the court will consider the California Study along with the other evidence presented in the record. Should the trial court find that the Commissioner\u2019s \u201cfindings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions,\u201d <em>see </em>Md. Ann.Code art. 48A, \u00a7 40(5) (1986), that may have prejudiced the petitioner might have been different if the \u201cadditional evidence\u201d had been before the Commissioner, then the trial court should remand. It must not substitute its judgment for the expertise of the Commissioner. <em>Muhl v.
