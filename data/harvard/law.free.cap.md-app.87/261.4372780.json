The company employs a force of sales representatives to sell its products to area food stores, including Giant Food Stores. To this end, Halperin allowed each sales representative the use of a company car on a continuing basis for business purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Kathy Zinn worked for Halperin as a sales representative. As such, she had the use of a company car for business purposes. At the invitation of a Giant Food Store deli manager, a customer on Zinn\u2019s route, Zinn and several of her guests attended a pool party at the home of another Giant Food Store employee on June 15, 1986. As Zinn and her guests \u2014 Debra Lizzio (appellant), Steven Sprehe, and Richard Thiess \u2014 were driving home from the pool party in Zinn\u2019s company car, they were involved in a single vehicle accident. The three passengers filed individual suits against Zinn and Halperin in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, which the court consolidated. The car was insured under a business automobile policy with Continental Casualty Company (appellee) at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Continental denied coverage because it and its insured, Halperin, took the position that Zinn was not driving the car for business purposes when the accident occurred. Continental sought a declaratory judgment that Zinn was not an insured under the policy and that it therefore had no obligation to defend her in the tort action or to indemnify her for any judgments which the court might enter against her in that suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (Nationwide) (appellant), Lizzio\u2019s insurer, filed an intervenor\u2019s answer to the complaint for declaratory relief while the declaratory judgment action was pending.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court permitted intervention. Nationwide then sought a declaration that Zinn was an insured under the Continental policy or, alternatively, that Lizzio was entitled to benefits under the Continental policy\u2019s uninsured motorist and personal injury protection provisions even if the policy did not provide liability coverage for Zinn. The circuit court stayed the consolidated tort actions pending the outcome of the declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">On June 27 and 28, 1989, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (the Hon. Joseph S. Casula, presiding) held a hearing on the declaratory judgment action. The primary issue at trial was whether Zinn had Halperin\u2019s permission to use the company car at the time of the accident. On January 22, 1990, the circuit court held that Zinn was a non-permissive user of the Halperin vehicle and, therefore, that the Continental policy did not provide coverage for the accident. The court also held that Continental had no duty to defend or indemnify Zinn against any of her passengers\u2019 claims. Further, Continental had no legal obligation to pay the passengers (the tort plaintiffs) any money under the policy that it had issued to Halperin.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Lizzio, joined by Thiess and Sprehe, subsequently filed a motion to alter or amend the decision, which the court denied on May 16, 1990. On May 17, 1990, the court granted Halperin\u2019s motion for summary judgment that it had filed in the consolidated tort suit. Nationwide appeals to us from these rulings and asks us whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">I. The trial court was clearly erroneous when it found that Zinn was a \u201cnon-permissive\u201d user of the Halperin vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>II. A. The trial court impermissibly intertwined the issue of whether Zinn was a permissive or non-permissive user under the language of the policy with the issue of whether she was acting within the scope of her employment \u2014 an issue which the jury in the tort action properly must decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">B. The trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly erroneous and in derogation of public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">III. The trial court erred when it failed to find that Lizzio was entitled to personal injury protection benefits under the Continental policy regardless of Zinn\u2019s status under that policy and that Lizzio also was entitled to benefits under the Continental policy\u2019s uninsured motorist provisions if Zinn is not an insured for purposes of liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Preliminarily, we clarify the procedural posture of this case. After Nationwide filed its appeal, Halperin filed a motion to dismiss that part of the appeal concerning the summary judgment entered in its favor as to the three personal injury claims. Continental contended that the order granting the summary judgment was not subject to appeal because the claims against Zinn still were pending in those cases. Although we initially denied the motion, we ultimately granted the request upon Halperin\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Pursuant to Rule 8-602(e)(l)(B),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we remanded the case to the circuit court for that court to determine whether to enter final judgment under Rule 2-602(b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as to any or all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>of the three personal injury claims. The court declined to enter an order of final judgment for any of them. Thus, only those orders of the circuit court concerning the declaratory judgment in favor of Continental are before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">I. and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Nationwide contends that under the language of the Continental policy, Zinn had permission to use the company car at the time of the accident, <em>i.e., </em>she was a permissive user.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The policy provides that Continental \u201cwill pay all sums the <em>insured </em>legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered auto.\u201d The policy then defines an \u201cinsured\u201d as the policy holder or \u201c[ajnyone else ... while using <em>with your permission </em>a covered auto you own____\u201d (emphasis added). This latter provision generally is referred to as an omnibus clause. <em>See, e.g., </em>7 Am. Jur.2d <em>Automobile Insurance </em>\u00a7 248 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Nationwide contends that this language, by its plain meaning, means that anyone who used the car with Halperin\u2019s permission was an insured for purposes of coverage under the policy. Because Halperin had assigned the car to Zinn on a continuing basis, Nationwide reasons that she therefore had permission to use it when the accident occurred. Continental, on the other hand, contends that the language provides coverage only if Zinn used the vehicle within the scope of the permission given by Halperin. Because Zinn was using the car for personal, rather than business, purposes when the accident occurred, Continental argues that her use of the car fell outside the scope of Halperin\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In drafting an automobile insurance policy, insurers often will employ one of two standard provisions to define who, other than the policyholder, is an insured under the policy:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">(1) Any person while using the insured auto, provided the <em>actual use </em>thereof is within the permission of the named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>insured. <em>See, e.g., Kelsay v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>242 Md. 528, 532-33, 219 A.2d 830 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">(2) Any other person while using the insured auto with the permission of the named insured, providing his actual operation is within the <em>scope of such permission. See, e.g., Bond v. Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mutual Casualty Ins. Co., </em>289 Md. 379, 381, 424 A.2d 765 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">As noted, the Continental policy did not contain either of those clauses. It did not specifically require that the \u201cactual use\u201d be within the employer\u2019s permission or that the operation be within the \u201cscope of such permission,\u201d but required only that the car be used \u201cwith [the employer\u2019s] permission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Nationwide interprets the more traditional language to mean that the insurer will provide coverage only if the permissive user was acting within certain defined limits when the accident occurred. Because Continental elected not to use this qualifying language, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cactual use\u201d or \u201cscope of permission,\u201d Nationwide contends that it was the result of Continental\u2019s \u201cconsidered decision to afford broader coverage.\u201d Thus, argues Nationwide, the trial court\u2019s finding that Zinn\u2019s use of the vehicle was outside the scope of Halperin\u2019s permission was irrelevant to the issue of coverage; it would be germane only in the underlying tort action in which Halperin\u2019s vicarious liability is at issue. On this basis, Nationwide concludes that the trial court impermissibly inserted this \u201cscope of permission\u201d language into the Continental policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">In <em>Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority v. Bullock, </em>68 Md.App. 20, 31-32, 509 A.2d 1217 (1986), we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">[T]hree alternative rules of construction [have] developed with respect to [the omnibus clause in] permissive use cases. The most expansive of these, sometimes known as the \u2018liberal,\u2019 or \u2018initial permission,\u2019 or \u2018hell or high water\u2019 rule holds that \u2018if the vehicle was originally entrusted by the named insured, or one having proper authority to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>permission, to the person operating it at the time of the accident, then despite hell or high water, such operation is considered to be within the scope of the permission granted, regardless of how grossly the terms of the original bailment may have been violated.\u2019 A second rule, denoted the \u2018conversion\u2019 rule, recognizes that a particular use can so exceed the scope of initial permission as to become non-permissive but requires that the departure be such as would cause the user to be liable to the owner in an action for conversion. The third rule, considered to be \u2018an intermediate position between the two more extreme rules,\u2019 is known as the \u2018minor deviation\u2019 rule. It regards \u2018minor deviations\u2019 as still being within the scope of permissive use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Maryland specifically has rejected the \u201cliberal\u201d rule, <em>see Nat\u2019l Grange Mutual Ins. Co. v. Pinkney, </em>284 Md. 694, 697, 399 A.2d 877 (1979); <em>Insurance Co. of North America v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>281 Md. 381, 378 A.2d 1344 (1977), with two results. First, absent the liberal rule, \u201cthe law seems to be ... [that] \u2018where the employer has expressly forbidden his employee to use the employer\u2019s automobile for his own personal purposes, such use of the automobile by the employee in violation of orders is not deemed to be one with the permission of the employer within the meaning of the omnibus clause of the liability insurance policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington Transit Authority, </em>68 Md.App. at 35, 509 A.2d 1217 (quoting Annotation, <em>Automobile liability insurance: permission or consent to employee\u2019s use of car within meaning of omnibus coverage clause, </em>5 A.L.R.2d 600, 651 (1949)). Second, in construing omnibus clauses, Maryland has adopted \u201can almost unique approach, rejecting all three rules and opting instead to construe, on a case-by-case basis, the particular wording of the omnibus clause at issue.\u201d <em>Washington Transit Authority, </em>68 Md.App. at 32, 509 A.2d 1217. Because these clauses are part of contracts, we must interpret them according to principles of contract construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201c \u2018It is well settled that in interpreting insurance contracts, words are to be given their customary and normal meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Grange Mutual Ins. Co. v. Pinkney, </em>284 Md. 694, 705, 399 A.2d 877 (1979) (quoting <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co. v. DeJames, </em>256 Md. 717, 720, 261 A.2d 747 (1970)). \u201c \u2018If the language of an insurance contract is ambiguous, ... construction is for the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018Absent ambiguity the construction of the contract remains within the province of the court____\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThat a term cannot be precisely defined so as to make clear its application in all varying factual situations does not mean that it is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Humphrey, </em>246 Md. 492, 496, 229 A.2d 70 (1967). None of the parties contend that the omnibus provision in this case is ambiguous. In fact, Nationwide asserts that the provision is unambiguous. We agree and conclude that construction of the clause was a matter of law for the court rather than a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The clause in the business policy at issue provides coverage for an employee \u201cwhile using with your permission a covered auto____\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cpermission\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">A license to do a thing; an authority to do an act which, without such authority, would have been unlawful. An act of permitting, formal consent, authorization, leave, license or liberty granted, and it has a flexible meaning depending upon the sense in which it is used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1026 (5th ed. 1979) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Clearly, the language \u201cusing with your permission\u201d means that anyone who used the car with Halperin\u2019s permission was an insured for purposes of coverage under the policy. We also think, however, that \u201cusing with your permission\u201d includes the alleged qualifiers \u201cwith actual permission\u201d and \u201cwithin the scope of the permission.\u201d <em>See Fisher v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>86 Md.App. 322, 331, 586 A.2d 783 (1991). That is, we think that these latter two phrases simply are other ways of saying \u201cwith permission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If Continental had used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201cactual permission\u201d or \u201cwithin the scope of the permission,\u201d these t\u00e9rms would be duplicative, rather than restrictive in effect. <em>Id. </em>Continental\u2019s failure to include these qualifiers, in our opinion, does not expand coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Thus, we think that the presence or absence of these so-called qualifiers has no effect on the operation of the clause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whether the phrase used is \u201cwithin the scope of permission\u201d or simply \u201cwith permission,\u201d the effect is the same: to be an insured for purposes of coverage under the policy, the individual\u2019s use of the vehicle must fall within the scope of permission given by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">At this juncture, we find ourselves on the proverbial \u201chorns of a dilemma.\u201d As pointed out by appellant in its brief and at oral argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Appellees clearly indicate in their declaratory judgment action ... that they see the issue to be scope of employment and whether within the scope of employment, defendant Zinn was acting with permission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Those facts that determine \u201cscope of employment\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the underlying tort suit are the same facts which would determine \u201cscope of permission\u201d within the declaratory judgment action. The facts that determine \u201cscope of permission\u201d are so intertwined with those determining \u201cscope of employment\u201d as to be practicably inseparable. If we were to uphold the trial court on its factfinding, there is indeed the possibility of a conflicting decision in the tort case that might well lead to a separate appeal in that case. That, in turn, could lead to a new trial, wherein Halperin, who is no longer a party in the tort suit, <em>might </em>be held responsible under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>thus fostering yet another appeal. The ominous prospect of a multiplicity of appeals ought not to be encouraged by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Atwood, </em>319 Md. 247, 572 A.2d 154 (1990), a decision not available to the circuit court at the time of trial herein, shall guide our way. There, Judge Eldridge reasoned for the Court of Appeals as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASB\">It would promote the efficient administration of justice, and be less burdensome on the parties, if the insurer\u2019s request for declaratory relief were made in the tort case. Nevertheless, for the reasons set forth in Part III of this opinion, the insurer should not be a party to the tort case until after the jury\u2019s verdict or judge\u2019s decision on liability is rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">In the future, therefore, a separate declaratory judgment action, after the tort suit, will not be allowed in the conflict of interest situation like that presented here. The best procedure to resolve coverage disputes like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>one in this case is a declaratory proceeding, as part of the tort case, initiated after the rendition of the jury\u2019s verdict or court\u2019s decision regarding liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">After the jury\u2019s verdict or court\u2019s decision in the tort case, and no later than ten days after the entry of judgment in the tort suit, the insurer should file a motion to intervene, a motion under Maryland Rules 2-532, 2-533, or 2-534, whichever is appropriate, and a complaint for declaratory relief regarding its duty to pay the damages assessed against its insured. The motion under Rules 2-532, 2-533, or 2-534 will render the tort judgment nonfinal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">The trial judge should then proceed under the insurer\u2019s declaratory judgment complaint as set forth in Part IV above. The trial judge, however, will also have under his control the non-final judgment in the tort case, and will be able to grant relief under Rules 2-532, 2-533, or 2-534, regarding that tort judgment. In this manner, consistency can be obtained, and there will ultimately be a single final judgment resolving both the tort action and the insurer\u2019s obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 264-65, 572 A.2d 154 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The court further declared that this procedure was to be followed in \u201cfuture cases like the present one.\u201d We deem this case to fall into that category. Accordingly, the judgment in this case will be vacated and all further proceedings herein shall be stayed until the appropriate time during the course of the related tort action when the parties should then proceed in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions in <em>Allstate, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Nationwide contends that the trial court erred when it failed to find that, regardless of Zinn\u2019s status under the Continental policy, Lizzio was entitled to personal injury protection benefits and, if Zinn was not an insured for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>purposes of liability, that Lizzio also was entitled to benefits under the uninsured motorist provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">In a personal injury protection (PIP) endorsement to its policy, Continental agreed to pay medical expense benefits and income continuation or essential services benefits to \u201ceach injured person\u201d for bodily injuries \u201ccaused by accident and involving a motor vehicle.\u201d The endorsement defines an \u201cinjured person\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[a]ny ... person who sustains bodily injury ... while occupying the insured motor vehicle as a guest or passenger____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">There also is an endorsement that provides uninsured motorist (UM) coverage. Specifically, the UM endorsement provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">B. WE WILL PAY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">1. We will pay all sums the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle. The damages must result from bodily injury sustained by the insured, or property damage, caused by an accident. The owner\u2019s or driver\u2019s liability for these damages must result from the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">D. WHO IS INSURED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">1. You or any family member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">2. Anyone else occupying a covered auto or a temporary substitute for a covered auto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">4. \u2018Uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 means a land motor vehicle or trailer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-13\">a. For which no liability policy or other form of security accepted by the Motor Vehicle Administrator provides at least the amounts specified by the financial responsibility law of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-14\">b. For which the sum of all liability bonds or policies at the time of an accident provides at least the amounts specified by the financial responsibility law of Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>land, but their limits are less than the limit of this insurance, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">c. For which an insuring or bonding company denies coverage or is or becomes insolvent____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Nationwide argues that because the company car was a \u201ccovered auto\u201d under the Continental policy and because Lizzio was a passenger in the car when the accident occurred, she is entitled to PIP benefits. On these facts, it further argues that Lizzio also is entitled to UM benefits if we find that Zinn is a non-permissive user because the vehicle then is an uninsured motor vehicle within the meaning of the policy. The trial court did not address these issues specifically in its order of January 22, 1990. It simply ruled that Continental \u201cwas not legally obligated to pay the Defendants, Zinn, Sprehe, Lizzio and Thiess any monies under the terms and conditions of its policy with Herbert Halperin Distributing Corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 388-89, 488 A.2d 486 (1985), the Court of Appeals set forth the principles of insurance contract construction in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">An insurance contract, like any other contract, is measured by its terms unless a statute, a regulation, or public policy is violated thereby. To determine the intention of the parties to the insurance contract, which is the point of the whole analysis, we construe the instrument as a whole. Maryland courts should examine the character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Both Continental and Halperin intended to exclude coverage in situations in which an individual operated a company vehicle without Halperin\u2019s permission. If we adopt Nationwide\u2019s interpretation of the UM and PIP provisions, then we circumvent the insurer and the insured\u2019s intent to avoid coverage of claims that arise from the negligence of a non-permissive user. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Of course, if it is determined that the subject vehicle was covered, then obviously the subject coverage must be afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN NATIONWIDE MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY AND CONTINENTAL CASUALTY COMPANY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">. Nationwide apparently sought intervention after Lizzio contended that the uninsured motorist provision in her policy with Nationwide would be triggered if the court denied Zinn coverage under the Continental policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\">.

Because Nationwide specifically complained that the trial court improperly inserted \"scope of permission\" language into the policy, we focused our discussion solely on the interpretation of that phrase. We note, however, that we reached a similar conclusion about the use of the phrase \"actual use\u201d in <em>Fisher v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>86 Md.App. 322, 331-334, 586 A.2d 783 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In <em>Fisher, </em>an insured\u2019s employee had permission to drive a company vehicle home and to use it for company business. <em>Id. </em>at 324, 586 A.2d 783. While at home, the employee responded to a personal emergency unrelated to the employer\u2019s business and was involved in an accident enroute. <em>Id. </em>The insurer contend\u00e9d that the policy provided coverage only if the employee used the vehicle within the scope of the permission which the employer granted to the employee. <em>Id. </em>at 325, 586 A.2d 783. The employee, on the other hand, argued that the language of the policy was insufficient to restrict the employee\u2019s use to the conditions which the employer imposed because the insurer failed to include qualifying language such as \"within the scope of the permission,\u201d \"actual permission,\" \"actual use,\u201d and so forth. <em>Id. </em>at 325, 331, 586 A.2d 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In response, we said that \" \u2018the Court of Appeals [has] observed that many cases from other jurisdictions indicate that the actual use of a vehicle is \u2018the particular use contemplated when permission is granted and relied upon.\u2019 ... [I]t is clear that this definition is controlling in Maryland.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Nationwide Gen. Ins. Co. v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>81 Md.App. 104, 120-21, 566 A.2d 1117 (1989) (citations omitted)). We then said that \"we fail[ed] to see where the absence of a similar phrase in the case at bar modifie[d] or change[d] the clear meaning of the omnibus language of the policy in the instant case.\" <em>Id. </em>86 Md.App. at 332-333, 586 A.2d 783.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">.
