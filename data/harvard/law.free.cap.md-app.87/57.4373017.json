On appeal, he raises five issues for our consideration. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">I. Whether the statements made by the prosecutor in closing argument unfairly prejudiced the defendant such that he was denied the right to a fair trial and such that these statements violated his right to confront witnesses against him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">II. Whether the trial <em>in absentia </em>violated defendant\u2019s right to be present and his right to confront witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">III. Whether the evidence was not legally sufficient to sustain the defendant\u2019s convictions for first degree murder and use of a handgun in a crime of violence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">IV. Whether the trial court erred in not allowing defense counsel to waive trial by jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">V. Whether the delay of sixteen months and fourteen days between the initiation of the prosecution and the start of trial was a denial of defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">We shall address the issues in the order we feel most appropriate, and provide the relevant facts as we discuss them. We first address appellant\u2019s second issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">Whether the trial <em>in absentia </em>violated defendant\u2019s right to be present and his right to confront witnesses?</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">While it is clear that Howell was fully aware of his trial date and time, he was not present when his trial was initially called. The court was advised that he was on his way to the courthouse. At approximately 10:35 a.m., he appeared outside the courtroom door and was told to remain there. Thereafter, jurors were called for his case, and his attorney told him to take a seat in a specified location which was no more than 200 feet from the courtroom. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>counsel went to get him, he was gone. The trial court then gave Howell\u2019s trial counsel until 1:15 to ascertain Howell\u2019s whereabouts. The court reconvened at 2:00 p.m. and continued the matter until the following morning, telling the jurors to return at that time. The court made other inquiries as to Howell\u2019s whereabouts, forfeited his bond, and issued a bench warrant for his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The next morning, Howell\u2019s attorney advised the court that he was still unaware of appellant\u2019s location. The court then held a hearing on the feasibility of trying Howell <em>in absentia, </em>and the trial resumed without Howell. Howell was convicted. He appeared at his sentencing hearing and was heard on his. reason for leaving on his original trial date. He referred to his fear of retribution by Jamaicans who were looking for him. He admitted that, a week after his trial, he had called his attorney and was advised to turn himself in, but declined to do so and remained at liberty until four or five months later when he was arrested on unrelated charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The factual situation in <em>Barnett v. State, </em>307 Md. 194, 512 A.2d 1071 (1986), is remarkably similar to the facts of the case <em>sub judice. </em>The defendant in <em>Barnett </em>was present when the case was called for trial. He was told that jury selection would begin the next morning. He failed to appear at that time. The trial court afforded defense counsel an opportunity to investigate Barnett\u2019s absence, and the court itself made efforts to determine his whereabouts before proceeding with a trial <em>in absentia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The Court of Appeals, after discussing a Pennsylvania case that focused on an extreme situation where a fugitive might be completely unaware of his trial date, adopted a liberal posture on <em>in absentia </em>trials: \u201cThe rule taken from <em>LaBelle, supra, which we </em>adopt____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210, 512 A.2d 1071 (emphasis added). Quoting from the case of <em>State v. LaBelle, </em>18 Wash.App. 380, 397-98, 568 P.2d 808, 818 (1977), the <em>Barnett </em>Court then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">[W]hen a criminal defendant is present at arraignment, enters a plea, receives actual notice of the time, date and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>place of the trial, deliberately absconds without a compelling reason, is represented by counsel at trial, and never offers a satisfactory explanation for his absence, a trial court may find such actions on the part of a defendant to amount to a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to be present and may conduct the trial in his absence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH\"><em>Id. </em>at 208, 512 A.2d 1071 (brackets in original). In <em>Barnett, </em>the Court referred to numerous jurisdictions that had found a waiver of a defendant\u2019s right to be present where he had voluntarily absented himself from the trial before it commenced, and noted, in particular, that \u201cThe Supreme Court of Arizona has regularly affirmed convictions in cases where the defendant voluntarily failed to appear for any portion of the criminal trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 512 A.2d 1071 (citations omitted). Elsewhere in <em>Barnett, </em>the Court commented favorably on cases sustaining <em>in absentia </em>convictions: \u201cIt should be clear, however, that no \u2018talismanic properties\u2019 attach to the point at which trial begins____ Nothing in <em>Diaz[</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>should be interpreted as precluding a court from continuing with a trial if the defendant voluntarily waives his presence before the trial commences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 512 A.2d 1071 (quoting <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>524 F.2d 167, 183-84 (4th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1088, 96 S.Ct. 881, 47 L.Ed.2d 99 (1976)) (citations omitted). The Court stated that the commencement of jury selection had nothing to do per se with the presence or absence of a valid waiver: \u201cBarnett, by absconding on the morning of trial, had to know that he was waiving all of his rights involving his presence at that trial. That is the relevant consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>307 Md. at 212, 512 A.2d 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The Court then quoted favorably from <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>414 U.S. 17, 94 S.Ct. 194, 38 L.Ed.2d 174 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah-\">It is true that a waiver is a voluntary relinquishment of a known right and, without knowledge of a right, there can be no waiver. But the right to try a defendant in absentia rests upon his waiver <em>of his known right to be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>present, not upon the (possibly unknown) court\u2019s right to try him while absent. </em>Here, defendant knew that he had a right to be present and has failed to show that he did not voluntarily elect to waive that right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><em>Barnett, </em>307 Md. at 212, 512 A.2d 1071 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We have previously set out the factual situation that resulted in Howell\u2019s being tried <em>in absentia. </em>The trial judge in the case at bar continued the trial to the following day based on his belief that Howell would contact his counsel with reasons for his absence. He also had hospitals checked to make sure that Howell\u2019s absence was not caused by illness. The trial court adequately informed the jury of the <em>in absentia </em>proceeding and gave the appropriate cautionary instructions throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Howell later filed a motion for new trial and testified about his absence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL] Did you come to this courthouse in Prince George\u2019s County on that date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">Q What was your reason for coming to the courthouse that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\">A I came to court because I knew it was the day for my trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-13\">A Not clearly, sir, but the last thing I remember you said you were going to pick the jury, and you take me around the back to sit on the bench and wait there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT7\">He then testified as to what his wife told him about three men:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-14\">A ... When she went around there she saw three males and one of the guys said where is the boy? If he is here yet? ... she said she don\u2019t trust the way they look____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-15\">Q Are you saying they followed her back to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-16\">A Yeah....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-17\">Q How many of these guys followed her back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>A I saw two____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">Q ... What happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">A ... I just left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">Q Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">A I just feel scared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">Q Scared of who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">A Them guys. They were Jamaicans and I was scared. I figure they are connected to Ms. Brandford and they are from Miami. I was really scared. I know \u2014 I don\u2019t know them, but I know what they are capable of doing. The reason why I left they was asking if I was there---- So I just left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">Q What did you think they were going to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">A Sir, I know they would shoot me, somebody seeking revenge. I know that for a fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">On cross-examination, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-14\">Q Did you try and contact the Court, the Judge\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-15\">A No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-16\">Q \u2014the day of the trial, or the day after the trial was scheduled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-17\">A No, ma\u2019am. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-18\">Q Did you try and contact the police to let them know that you were afraid for your life?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-19\">A I didn\u2019t contact the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-20\">The court then asked several questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-21\">THE COURT: Did you think that your attorney might be a wee bit surprised that you weren\u2019t there for trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-22\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-23\">THE COURT: But you didn\u2019t call him that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-24\">THE WITNESS: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-25\">THE COURT: Why not? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-26\">THE WITNESS: I was like paranoid, sir. I was paranoid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>THE COURT: Did you bother going to a sheriff and saying, Mr. Sheriff, those two fellows are bothering me, I am afraid of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">THE WITNESS: No, I didn\u2019t do that, sir, because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">THE COURT: Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">THE WITNESS: Because they really didn\u2019t appear physically for me to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">THE WITNESS: They didn\u2019t come to no physical contact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">THE COURT: Then why were you afraid of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">THE WITNESS: Because my wife told me that there were these guys around there asking about me____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\">THE COURT: You didn\u2019t turn yourself in, you were arrested on another charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-15\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-16\">THE COURT: You didn\u2019t surrender to anybody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-17\">THE WITNESS: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-18\">THE COURT: They arrested you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-19\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-20\">The trial court denied the motion for new trial finding, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-21\">His wife is the one that did all the hearing. He didn\u2019t hear anything. His wife should have been here to testify to that to make it carry any weight in my mind. But even if all of that is true when he leaves he doesn\u2019t even bother to call his attorney who has been representing [him] all these months and tell his attorney I\u2019m over at whatever place, I need your advice. He doesn\u2019t do anything for I don\u2019t know how many months it was until he is picked up on another charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-22\"><em>So I simply don\u2019t believe the Defendant when he said that he left because he was afraid. </em>Even if I did believe it that is no good reason for his absence. There were a lot of other options that he had. I don\u2019t find that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Defendant is in any way stupid. He is a reasonably intelligent young man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">* &gt;|t * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\"><em>So the reason he walked away wasn\u2019t because he was fearful. The reason he walked away was that on seven prior court appearances the witness was not there, </em>he knew they were having trouble getting the witness there. <em>On the day of trial when the witness did show up he chooses to walk away. </em>That is why he walked away, the writing was on the wall, the witness was there. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">We hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in conducting the trial <em>in absentia. </em>The Court of Appeals, in <em>Barnett, </em>distinguished between the holding in <em>LaBelle </em>and the holdings in Pennsylvania and New York. The <em>LaBelle </em>case granted broad powers to the Louisiana trial courts to proceed <em>in absentia; </em>the Pennsylvania and New York courts severely limited the trial court\u2019s discretion to conduct trials <em>in absentia. </em>The Court in <em>Barnett </em>unequivocally rejected the stricter rationale and clearly adopted the liberal <em>LaBelle </em>rule. <em>See Barnett, </em>307 Md. at 208, 512 A.2d 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The <em>Barnett </em>holding permits trials <em>in absentia </em>when the defendant voluntarily absents himself from trial. We hold that it is not necessary that the proceeding shall have progressed through jury selection, or even that the case has been called before the defendant absents himself, as long as he was aware of the trial date, his counsel is present, and the other provisions of the <em>LaBelle </em>rule are met. Under the <em>LaBelle/Barnett </em>holdings, a defendant who fails to appear for a known trial date may be tried <em>in </em>absentia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial judge, Judge McCullough, exhibited a complete understanding of the rule stated in <em>Barnett </em>and, in his conduct of the instant proceedings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>followed its suggested procedures almost to the letter. We doubt that <em>any </em>trial <em>in absentia </em>could be conducted more in accordance with <em>Barnett </em>than the trial in the case at bar. We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Whether the statements made by the prosecutor in closing argument were improper and unlawfully prejudiced the defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">During the trial, the evidence indicated that a longtime acquaintance of the victim was in the victim\u2019s bedroom at the time he was shot and, in fact, had been staying in the victim\u2019s house. The witness, an individual named Carnell, did not testify. The appellant\u2019s counsel argued to the jury in closing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">[B]ut it doesn\u2019t tell you the most important thing about a reasonable doubt, and that is where the hell does it come from. Where in this case does it come up? Where is it created? How will I know it when I see it? This is how you do it. Reasonable doubt comes from any one of the following four things. The biggest source of reasonable doubt [is] absence of evidence____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">We have no burden of proof, no responsibility with respect to the evidence, <em>so if there\u2019s an absence of evidence, </em>that is reasonable doubt. That is attributable to the State. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">Referring to a chart, appellant\u2019s counsel then argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfC\">Carnell is the little blue circle. They say that\u2019s the position of the people and that <em>Mike just cold-bloodedly came in and shot this man and while he was doing it my client was right there next to Carnell and did something to keep Carnell from preventing that shooting from happening. </em>That\u2019s basically their theory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">* * * * <em>* </em>#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-13\">By the way, whoever said that my client kept Carnell at bay? Did Pat ever testify that Carnell \u2014 that my client said you stay out of this? Did Pat ever testify that my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>client said anything nasty, you know, kill him, Mike, get him, Mike, I\u2019ll keep this guy out of the way? Hey, you back up, don\u2019t get into this. <em>Did you hear any testimony like that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-4\">* * * * # lie</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\"><em>Where is Carnell? </em>Pat tells you they\u2019ve been friends for 12 years. He\u2019s been staying there for two weeks. He\u2019s not a drifter in their lives. He\u2019s not an acquaintance. That\u2019s about as strong of a friend as anybody can have, let you stay in their house for two weeks, known you for 12 years. He\u2019s there during this incident. <em>Where is he? Why didn\u2019t he come into this courtroom </em>and say, listen, this client of Mr. Houlon\u2019s held a weapon up to my head? He didn\u2019t say anything to me, but he held a knife or a gun or a spoon or a banana. He held something up to my head and it was tacitly understood if I tried to intervene in this thing, and, by the way, how do I intervene with a guy with a gun. Consider who\u2019s going to help out this guy in the Government\u2019s version. Under the Government\u2019s version Carnell has no weapon. The poor dead man has no weapon. The only one with a weapon is the shooter and maybe my client under the Government\u2019s version. What\u2019s Carnell going to do, put his hand out and stop the bullet? But, in any event, and getting away from that foolishness, <em>is Carnell in here to say </em>\u2014 isn\u2019t he the guy who should tell us whether he was held at bay? <em>People who are held at bay are the best people to tell you they\u2019re held at bay. I was intimidated or I was threatened because this guy held a gun or knife. You know, he was whispered to or he said to me you make a move, you\u2019re a dead man. Where is he? </em>I don\u2019t have a burden of proof. Am I supposed to dump him in this courtroom? I have no burden of proof. They have the only burden. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The State responded, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">MS. KOENIG: May it please the Court, defense counsel, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, as defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>told you, I get to address what he said.

KOENIG: He\u2019s not going to do it and he didn\u2019t do it and he will never do that____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">In addition to objecting at the time the remarks were made, the appellant made a motion for mistrial later in the proceeding. He also based his Motion for New Trial, in part, on the alleged improper remarks of the prosecutor. The trial court, in denying the motion for mistrial, stated that it did not believe the remarks, if improper, were sufficiently prejudicial so as to require a mistrial. In a later ruling on appellant\u2019s Motion for New Trial, the trial judge opined, \u201cI think counsel opened the door. I think you asked for it. She had a right to say it.\u201d Appellant, on appeal, only challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for mistrial. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying <em>either </em>of the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">In <em>Douglas v. State, </em>32 Md.App. 311, 315, 360 A.2d 474 (1976), we restated the guide for determining abuse of discretion in mistrial cases, quoting <em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. 312, 322 A.2d 880 (1974): \u201cThe most significant guideline for the exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion is that a mistrial is to be declared only where it is \u2018manifestly neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>sary,\u2019 or \u2018under urgent circumstances,\u2019 or \u2018only in very extraordinary and striking circumstances,\u2019 and declaring a mistrial is not \u2018to be lightly undertaken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 322 A.2d 880. <em>See also State v. Crutchfield, </em>318 Md. 200, 567 A.2d 449 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 110 S.Ct. 1926, 109 L.Ed.2d 289 (1990); <em>Jones v.

State, </em>82 Md.App. 617, 573 A.2d 56, <em>cert. denied, </em>320 Md. 801, 580 A.2d 219 (1990), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">Maryland courts have held that, subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion, \u201cboth the State\u2019s Attorney and defense counsel are given wide latitude in the conduct of closing argument____\u201d And, there are \u201cno well-defined bounds beyond which the eloquence of an advocate shall not soar.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">Appellant further asserts that the circuit court erred in failing to take appropriate action to mitigate the effects of the State\u2019s remarks to the jury. Although Judge Rollins did not give any curative instruction to the jury in this regard, the failure to instruct the jury to disregard certain comments is not ordinarily, by itself, considered to be judicial error.

The prosecutor in <em>Hunt, </em>in his rebuttal argument at the sentencing hearing, had referred to the defendant\u2019s allocution statement, by stating \u201cit is worthless, it is trash, it is an attempt to manipulate you ..., it is insulting, it is demeaning, ... written by God knows who ...\u201d The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">A prosecutor has wide latitude in presenting a closing argument.

State, </em>65 Md.App. 69, 499 A.2d 484 (1985) (prosecutor\u2019s comparison of defendant to A1 Capone was highly improper, but not so inflammatory under the circumstances as to create a real likelihood of prejudice); <em>Holbrook v.

State, </em>288 Md. 548, 419 A.2d 384 (1980), where the defense counsel stated to the jury, \u201c[w]e talked about all this testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>was in. Let\u2019s talk about the evidence that didn\u2019t exist, that didn\u2019t happen. We talk about \u2014 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550, 419 A.2d 384. The trial court ruled that the defendant could not comment on the lack of fingerprint evidence. The Court of Appeals reversed, stating, in part, that the purpose of the rule forbidding comment in respect to matters not in evidence was \u201cto prevent counsel ... from attempting to introduce ... matters which ought not be considered in ... a determination of guilt or innocence ... [and] to prevent counsel from suggesting evidence ... not presented at trial thereby providing additional grounds for finding a defendant innocent or guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 419 A.2d 384. It then held that the defendant could comment on the failure of the State to produce evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We had occasion to address <em>Eley </em>in a converse situation in <em>Henderson v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 152, 441 A.2d 1114 (1982), where Chief Judge Gilbert commented: \u201cThe message sounded by <em>Eley </em>is clear: Possible relevant evidence not introduced, or its absence explained, may be used against the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153, 441 A.2d 1114. In <em>Henderson </em>the defendant was asked, over the State\u2019s objection, whether items of evidence had been obtained from the appellant when he was arrested. He responded that they had not been so obtained. The State had been previously alerted to the defendant\u2019s intention to argue negative evidence in closing argument by the defense\u2019s pretrial motion <em>in limine, </em>which requested that the State be forbidden to elicit testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s residence at a pre-release center. The State received permission from the trial judge to establish that a search of the place where the defendant was arrested was not made because it was a pre-release center, and it was improbable that a weapon would be carried into the center. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">We think Judge Levin properly allowed the State to adduce testimony as to why the murder weapon was not located and presented at trial. Although appellant disavows any intent \u201cto show that Detective O\u2019Brien had not aggressively investigated the case,\u201d <em>Eley </em>would have allowed such an argument had appellant advanced it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the jury. Even considering appellant\u2019s assurance that there was no intention \u201cin closing argument to say whether or not the police did anything wrong in their investigation in the matter,\u201d the inference to be drawn from Detective O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony was clear____ Based on what was then before him, and cognizant of <em>Eley, </em>he [the trial judge] took the appropriate measure to assure that the State was not treated unfairly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 157, 441 A.2d 1114. <em>See also Ford, </em>73 Md.App. at 396, 534 A.2d 992 (\u201cIf the State believes that the defense will present a negative evidence argument, the prosecutor may introduce evidence to explain why certain evidence was not secured.\u201d) (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The appellant in the case <em>sub judice </em>asserts that the court took no action to cure any possible prejudice, such as informing the jury of the impropriety of the remarks. We note that the court did announce before the jury that, \u201cIt\u2019s [there\u2019s] no evidence as to why or why he is not here.\u201d The prosecutor informed the jury, \u201cThen don\u2019t you speculate as to why he was not here.\u201d Though we agree that a direct instruction was not given, it was pointed out to the jury that there was no evidence of the reasons for the witness\u2019s absence. The court, in its general instruction, also told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">Keep in mind that you are bound by my instructions as to the law---- In other words, you will determine from the evidence what actually happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">The evidence in this case consists of the testimony of the witnesses from the witness stand and the physical evidence or exhibits admitted into evidence and any stipulations made by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">* * * * * sjs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">Counsel for the State and counsel for the defendants are now going to argue the case to you.

If they say anything ... about the evidence or the facts as they see them that does not coincide with your memory of what you heard during this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>trial, you may disregard what they say and rely on your memory of what occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Appellant also contends that, in addition to saying why the witness had not been present, the prosecution argued what his testimony would have been had he appeared, and thus appellant\u2019s right to confront the missing witness was violated. We see it differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We hold that the appellant\u2019s counsel completely opened the door by his extensive comments regarding Carnell\u2019s absence. In addition to asking \u201cwhere is Carnell,\u201d he commented disparagingly about the possibility of Carnell\u2019s being intimidated, saying in argument, \u201cPeople who are held at bay are the best people to tell you____ I was intimidated or was threatened ... he was whispered to as he said to me you make a move, you\u2019re a dead man.\u201d The clear intended inference of defense counsel\u2019s remarks was that Carnell was not intimidated and, thus, his absence was indicative that his testimony would have been adverse to the State\u2019s theory of the case. By these (and other) specific and extensive comments, based on speculation, not evidence, appellant raised the issue of Carnell\u2019s absence to such a level that the State\u2019s subsequent comments were clearly warranted to insure that it, as well as the defendant, received a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">In her opening argument, the prosecutor did not anticipate Howell\u2019s closing argument as to this issue. Nevertheless, in her final closing argument, she responded, as she was permitted to do as indicated by the authorities we have cited, not the least of which is <em>Henderson. </em>That response, considering the wealth of evidence in the case, did not unfairly prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">We next discuss appellant\u2019s fourth issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">3.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">Whether the trial court erred in not allowing defense counsel to waive trial by jury?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">After the appellant\u2019s disappearance and before the recommencement of the trial, appellant\u2019s counsel attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>to waive the right to a jury trial. The judge refused to allow counsel to waive a right personal to the appellant. On this appeal, Howell argues that, because the trial court found a waiver of his right to be present at trial, he must also have waived his right to make any decision concerning trial conduct and thus had deferred those decisions to his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Maryland Rule 4-246(a) specifically states that \u201cIn the circuit court a defendant having a right to trial by jury <em>shall </em>be tried by a jury unless the right is waived pursuant to section (b)____\u201d Section (b), in pertinent part, explicitly states: \u201cThe court may not accept the waiver until it determines, <em>after an examination of the defendant in open court ... </em>that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">We said in <em>Epps v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 308, 450 A.2d 913, <em>cert. denied, </em>294 Md. 622 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">A criminal defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial is as fundamental as the maxim \u2014 innocent until proven guilty. It is guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, U.S. Const. Amend. VI, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, and by the Maryland Declaration of Rights, Arts. 5, 21 and 24. However, this right may be waived, as when the defendant pleads guilty, <em>State v. Priet, </em>289 Md. 267, 424 A.2d 349 (1981), or elects to be tried by a judge. Md.Rule 735 (1981 Cum.Supp.); <em>Rose v. State, </em>177 Md. 577, 10 A.2d 617 (1940). \u201cTo satisfy constitutional due process standards, the waiver of the right to a jury trial must constitute an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <em>Dortch v. State, </em>290 Md. 229, 234, 428 A.2d 1220 (1981), citing <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238 [89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274] (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-10\"><em>Id. 52 </em>Md.App. at 311-12, 450 A.2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The mandatory rule requires a defendant to be tried by jury unless he is <em>personally </em>examined in open court as to his desire to waive his jury trial rights. When a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>voluntarily absents himself from the proceedings, without having waived his right to a jury trial after examination in open court, he has not waived that right. It is a right personal to a defendant; it is not a right possessed by his counsel. The defendant only waived his right to be present at the proceeding; he did not and could not, authorize his attorney to make any further waiver of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">We note that the appellant has offered no authority, other than \u201clogic and fundamental fairness,\u201d to support his position. The State has offered no authority other than the rule and citation to cases concerned with waiver generally, such as <em>Treece v. State, </em>313 Md. 665, 547 A.2d 1054 (1988). We see nothing illogical or unfair about the rule nor its application in this case, and thus we perceive no error or abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s ruling on this matter. We shall next address the sufficiency of the evidence, appellant\u2019s third issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Whether the evidence was sufficient to support Howell\u2019s conviction of first degree murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The only argument made by the appellant in support of its position on this issue is that there was insufficient corroboration of his extrajudicial statement. He contends that the only \u201cpotentially\u201d corroborative evidence was the testimony of the victim\u2019s wife which showed that the appellant was present when the victim was shot, that he was, at that time, holding his hand near the head of a friend of the victim, and that though there was something in appellant\u2019s hand, she did not know what it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The victim\u2019s wife testified that she saw her husband shot. The evidence indicated that the shooter was the appellant\u2019s brother. She noticed that Howell was in the room holding a white object up to <em>Carnell\u2019s </em>head. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>A He was holding a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">* * * Jje sjc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">Q When you say he had a gun, who are you talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">A The second person [Howell],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">A Not the person who shot my husband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">Q And where did he have this gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">A Close up to his [Carnell\u2019s] face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">Q Was it pointed at Carnell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">On cross-examination by the appellant\u2019s counsel, she was asked, \u201cWhat was the length of time that Carnell and this other man were standing there, the man with the gun to Carnell\u2019s face?\u201d She answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know how long they were standing there. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d There was additional evidence that the victim had been shot. The defendant\u2019s own statements, admitted into evidence, provided, in part, that he had in fact accompanied the shooter to the scene, that they had gone to the victim\u2019s apartment to purchase drugs, that he was present during the shooting, and that he accompanied the shooter during the flight from the scene of the murder. It is clear that any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 573 A.2d 831 (1990). The defendant\u2019s statement was more than adequately and independently corroborated. <em>Woods v. State, </em>315 Md. 591, 556 A.2d 236 (1958). <em>See also McMillian v.

Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction. We next address the appellant\u2019s speedy trial argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>5.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Whether the delay of 16 months and 14 days was a denial of defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy ... trial.... \u201d U.S. Const, amend.

Justice Powell, writing for the Court, adopted a balancing test which took into account the conduct of both the prosecution and defense in determining the constitutional effect of a delay. <em>Id. </em>92 S.Ct. at 2191-92. He observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">A balancing test necessarily compels courts to approach speedy trial cases on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis. We can do little more than identify some of the factors which courts should assess in determining whether a particular defendant has been deprived of his right. Though some might express them in different ways, we identify four such factors: Length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The length of the delay is to some extent a triggering mechanism.

Once this presumption asserts itself, a balancing test must be employed which involves a weighing of four factors, one of which is actual prejudice.

Thus, the period from February 13, 1988, to June 21, 1988, is weighed against neither party, and as the appellant acknowledges, is excluded from our calculations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The delay from June 21 to July 26 occurred at the State\u2019s request. The prosecutor was experiencing difficulty in securing the presence of Patricia Brandford, the victim\u2019s wife, due to her emotional problems arising from the murder. The trial judge granted a continuance based on the State\u2019s representation of her illness. The appellant argues that this delay should be weighed against the State because, regardless of her medical inability to testify, no Certificate for Material Witness had been issued to compel her presence at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We note that a reasonable delay caused by difficulty in obtaining a witness\u2019 presence is justified and will not be weighed against the State. <em>See Barker, </em>92 S.Ct. at 2192; <em>Erbe v. State, </em>276 Md. 541, 549, 350 A.2d 640 (1976); <em>Marks, </em>84 Md.App. at 282, 578 A.2d 828; <em>Lewis v. State, </em>71 Md.App. 402, 418, 526 A.2d 66 (1987); <em>Nocera, </em>36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Md.App. at 323, 374 A.2d 608. The record contains a letter from a clinical psychologist which states that <em>\u201ca </em>court room ordeal will cause my client to experience a full blown psychotic break.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The State\u2019s failure to compel her presence was therefore excusable, and we shall consider this period of delay as neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">On July 14, 1988, the appellant filed a Motion to Compel Discovery concerning Mrs. Brandford\u2019s medical records. At a hearing on July 18, 1988, the State requested a continuance in order to comply with what it considered to be a valid request. The judge, noting that the trial was scheduled for July 26, stated that there was insufficient time to complete discovery, and granted a continuance over the appellant\u2019s objection. We attribute this delay to the necessity to comply with the appellant\u2019s discovery demand. We shall deem it to be neutral.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The trial was then rescheduled for September 6, 1988. On August 25, 1988, the appellant filed a Motion for Continuance on the ground that new counsel had been retained, that additional time was needed to prepare, and that counsel had prior judicial commitments. The appellant argues that this delay should be counted against the State because the State would not have been ready for trial had it proceeded as planned. We disagree. The trial judge grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ed the appellant\u2019s Motion for Continuance. The next day, the appellant filed a waiver of the 180-day period specified in Maryland Rule 4-271. The trial was subsequently scheduled for December 13, 1988. We assign this delay to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">On November 23, 1988, the State requested a postponement of the trial date so that it could make arrangements to bring Mrs. Brandford involuntarily to Maryland. The continuance was granted over the appellant\u2019s objection, and trial was ultimately scheduled for March 21, 1989. We count the time from December 13, 1988, to March 21, 1989, against the State, as by that time it had had ample notice of Mrs. Brandford\u2019s reluctance to testify.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The final postponement, also at the State\u2019s request, moved the trial date to June 27, 1989. Again, this was the result of problems with Mrs. Brandford\u2019s availability. As with the previous delay, the State knew of the problem and could have remedied it by March 21. It did not. Therefore, the time from March 21, 1989, to June 27, 1989, counts against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">In sum, the 6-month plus span from February 13, 1988, to July 26, 1988, and the 42-day period from July 26, 1988, to September 6, 1988, are accorded neutral weight. The appellant\u2019s request for continuance caused the three-month and seven-day period from September 6, 1988, to December 13,1988. This will be weighed against him. The six-month and fourteen-day delay from December 13, 1988, to June 27, 1989, is chargeable against the State due to its negligence in preparation for trial. Delays arising from prosecutorial indifference or negligence will weigh heavily against the State. <em>Brady, </em>261 Md. at 267, 434 A.2d 574; <em>Jackson, </em>69 Md.App. at 653, 374 A.2d 608; <em>Ferrell v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 459, 464, 508 A.2d 490 (1986); <em>Lee v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 169, 178-79, 485 A.2d 1014, <em>cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 115, 492 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>616 (1985); <em>Powell v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 351, 361, 467 A.2d 1052 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 137, 472 A.2d 999, <em>reconsideration denied, </em>299 Md. 656, 474 A.2d 1345 (1984). A delay due to a deliberate attempt by the State to hamper the defense will work to the State\u2019s disadvantage to a greater degree. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. State, </em>281 Md. 640, 654-655, 382 A.2d 1053, <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 839, 99 S.Ct. 126, 58 L.Ed.2d 136 (1978). Thus, a 6-month and 14-day period<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is weighed heavily against the State.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">C. The Defendant\u2019s Assertion of His Right</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqT\">Whether and how a defendant asserts his right is closely related to the other factors we have mentioned. The strength of his efforts will be affected by the length of the delay, to some extent by the reason for the delay, and most particularly by the personal prejudice, which is not always readily identifiable, that he experiences. The more serious the deprivation, the more likely a defendant is to complain. The defendant\u2019s assertion of his speedy trial right, then, is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\"><em>Barker, </em>92 S.Ct. at 2192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The appellant demanded a speedy trial on March 15, 1988, approximately two weeks after he was indicted, and objected to continuances on several occasions. This factor will count for him in the balancing test. <em>See, e.g., Bailey, </em>319 Md. at 409-10, 572 A.2d 544; <em>Epps, </em>276 Md. at 118, 345 A.2d 62; <em>Howard, </em>66 Md.App. at 293, 503 A.2d 739.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">D. Prejudice</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">A fourth factor is prejudice to the defendant. Prejudice, of course, should be assessed in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect. This Court has identified three such interests: (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>(ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\"><em>Barker, </em>92 S.Ct. at 2193 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">(i) Oppressive Pretrial Incarceration</p>\n<p id=\"AGb\">The appellant was released on bond on November 3,1988. The various delays during the entire period of his pretrial incarceration were either neutral or ascribed to him. The court throughout the period was reconsidering bond, and ultimately granted the same. The only delays we charged against the State occurred while appellant was free on bond. Under the facts of this case, we hold that his pretrial incarceration was not unduly oppressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">(ii) Anxiety and Concern</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The appellant makes a bald allegation that \u201c[t]he consequences of the arrest, accusation and impending trial caused the Defendant substantial anxiety and concern.\u201d Without more, this statement \u201chas little significance.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>319 Md. at 417, 572 A.2d 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">(iii) Impairment of the Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">The appellant argues that the preparation of his defense was impaired in two ways. First, he asserts that \u201c[t]he operation of the delay, in and of itself, decreases the chances that pro-defense witnesses can be found, that the defendant can remember the incident in question sufficiently well to assist in his defense, or that exculpatory [physical] evidence [...] will turn up.\u201d (Quoting <em>Brady, </em>291 Md. at 269, 434 A.2d 574.) Second, he contends that the State\u2019s inability to produce Mrs. Brandford and her records for a medical examination hampered his ability to prepare her cross-examination, as well as his overall defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">We believe that the 6-month delay chargeable to the State did not impair the appellant\u2019s defense to a degree violative of his speedy trial right. <em>Carter, </em>77 Md.App. at 468-70, 550 A.2d 972 (6-month trial delay attributable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the State did not violate the right to speedy trial). <em>See Barker, </em>92 S.Ct. at 2193-94 (minimal prejudice resulted from delay, attributable to the prosecution, of more than four years); <em>Jackson, </em>69 Md.App. at 657, 519 A.2d 751 (14V2 months weighed heavily against the State did not overcome the appellant\u2019s tactical decision to remain silent); <em>Howard, </em>66 Md.App. at 212, 503 A.2d 739 (8 months delay, attributable to the State, of which appellant waived 2 months by failure to object, upheld); <em>Lewis v. State, </em>71 Md.App. 402, 526 A.2d 66 (1982) (no prejudice where <em>iVz </em>months out of a total of 19V2 months were charged to the appellant). The case at bar is distinguishable from <em>Brady </em>due to the length of time attributable to the State. In <em>Brady, </em>14 months were weighed against the State; here, the delay was 6 months. It is difficult to imagine how the delay would have seriously harmed the appellant\u2019s case, as he had been released on bail during most of this period and had at least equal opportunity to search for witnesses and evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">As to his argument that he was prejudiced by the State\u2019s inability to produce Mrs. Brandford, he is in essence complaining that he needed more time to prepare a defense. It is incongruous for the appellant to argue that his trial did not occur soon enough, yet contend that it occurred too soon for him to be able to prepare his defense. This argument has no place in a speedy trial discussion, and we shall not discuss it further. Our review of the <em>Barker </em>factors satisfies us that the appellant\u2019s speedy trial right was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Having resolved the issues raised by the appellant against him, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-8\">. <em>Diaz v.

The discovery request was filed on July 14, 1988, which our perpetual calendar indicates was a Thursday. It thus would have been received on a Friday; July 18th was the following Monday. The State therefore promptly informed the court of the difficulty. There were only six business days to obtain hospital and other medical records. We cannot say, given the usual experience, that six days are normally sufficient to subpoena and compile hospital and other medical records of a confidential nature, which ordinarily are privileged. If it had been necessary to obtain the records from a hospital or doctor, the medical professional may well have refused to provide them without a court order.
