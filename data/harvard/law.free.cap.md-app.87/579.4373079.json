Johnson\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence was heard and denied in the first stage of the trial. The trial then proceeded on a not guilty plea upon an agreed statement of facts. We are asked to decide whether the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, based upon the police officer\u2019s lack of reasonable articulable suspicion to effect the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Detective Wayne Vernon, one of the arresting officers, was working as part of an arrest team in a buy-bust operation in Freetown Village, an \u201copen air drug market.\u201d Another detective, who was working undercover purchasing drugs in the area, radioed that he had just purchased crack cocaine from two black males. He described the two men and gave their location. Vernon and his partner drove to the given address and saw the two described individuals. A third man, the appellant, was standing on the stairs with the two suspects. Vernon and his partner, who was wearing a gunbelt and badge, got out of their car. One of the suspects began to run. Vernon approached the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>suspect and appellant, who began to run up the stairs. Vernon yelled, \u201cHalt, police,\u201d and chased appellant. Appellant threw a baggie over the third floor landing and two smaller baggies fell to his feet. Appellant was then arrested. All of the baggies were recovered and found to contain crack cocaine with a street value of at least $2,400.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">This case is controlled by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent landmark decision in <em>California v. Hodari, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991). In its brief filed on April 18, 1991, prior to the <em>Hodari </em>decision, the State virtually conceded that a seizure of appellant occurred when Detective Vernon shouted, \u201cHalt, police.\u201d Appellant contends that the seizure was unreasonable because the officer had no reasonable articulable suspicion to effect the seizure. Thus, according to appellant, the evidence was obtained as a result of the illegal seizure and, therefore, the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\"><em>Hodari </em>is dispositive. In that case, a group of youngsters, including the defendant, Hodari, fled upon noticing an unmarked police car approaching. One of the policemen, Officer Pertoso, left the police car, taking a circuitous route that brought him face-to-face with Hodari, who did not see Pertoso until the officer was almost upon him. At that point, Hodari tossed away a \u201csmall rock,\u201d which was later found to be crack cocaine. Justice Scalia, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">In sum, assuming that Pertoso\u2019s pursuit in the present case constituted a \u2018show of authority\u2019 enjoining Hodari to halt, since Hodari did not comply with that injunction he was not seized until he was tackled. The cocaine abandoned while he was running was in this case not the fruit of a seizure, and his motion to exclude evidence of it was properly denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-9\"><em>Hodari. </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 111 S.Ct. at 1552.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Similarly, because Detective Vernon\u2019s admonition to appellant was ignored, appellant was not seized until he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>arrested, and the cocaine, as in <em>Hodari, </em>had been abandoned prior to any \u201cseizure.\u201d Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
