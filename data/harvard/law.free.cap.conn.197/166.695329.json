On appeal he claims that (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c, (2) the trial court erred in allowing evidence of insurance payments to establish the value of the stolen property, (3) he was denied effective assistance of counsel, (4) the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay testimony of two police officers and the written statement of an accomplice, and (5) there was insufficient evidence to sustain the verdict. We disagree and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Between June 5, 1980, and June 19, 1980, eight homes in affluent sections of the town of Ridgefield were burglarized. Taken from those homes was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>assortment of silverware, jewelry, cash, and other items. In August, 1980, a police investigation led to the arrest of David Basque. Basque admitted to having driven the defendant to several homes in Ridgefield during the span of a few days in order to burglarize them with the intent to sell the items stolen to purchase drugs. On the basis of Basque\u2019s confession, the defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Prior to the commencement of trial, the defendant moved to dismiss all of the charges against him, claiming that he had been denied his right to a speedy trial pursuant to \u00a7 54-82c of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a hearing, the trial court denied the motion. On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion when the defendant did all that was required of him under \u00a7 54-82c.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The stipulated facts relating to this claim are as follows. On June 5,1981, the defendant sent to the warden of the institution where he was incarcerated an undated \u201cwritten notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for final disposition ... of the . . . information.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c (a). On June 5, 1981, the warden forwarded the defendant\u2019s request together with the required certificate to the appropriate court, which acknowledged receipt of the request on June 11,1981. General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c (b). The office of the state\u2019s attorney, however, did not receive the defendant\u2019s request for disposition until September 3, 1982. The trial began on December 1, 1982, eighty-nine days after the receipt of the defendant\u2019s request by the state\u2019s attorney but almost eighteen months after the defendant first submitted his request to the warden.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 54-82d, if a criminal case is not assigned for trial within the statutory period of 120 days fixed under \u00a7 54-82c, the case must be dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant does not dispute that our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Springer, </em>149 Conn. 244, 178 A.2d 525 (1962), is controlling. There, we held that \u201c[ujnder [\u00a7 54-82c], the act required to be done in order to start the running of the period of 120 days is the delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of the prisoner\u2019s request, accompanied by his custodian\u2019s certificate, to the prosecuting official of the county and the appropriate court. Obviously, a prisoner confined in a penal or correctional institution could not be required to make personal delivery. The General Assembly has therefore provided that the prisoner initiate the request for a trial, has required further that his custodian supply information concerning the prisoner\u2019s confinement to the prosecuting official and the court, and has then prescribed the procedure to effect the actual delivery of both. It is the completed delivery of both the request and the supplemental information which starts the running of the period of 120 days within which the prisoner must be brought to trial. Subsection (b) makes this clear in that the prisoner\u2019s written notice and request is required only to be \u2018given or sent' to the custodial official, but the latter\u2019s transmittal must be \u2018by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.\u2019 The return receipt furnishes ample means of fixing the date from which the 120 days is to be computed. No provision is made, however, for fixing the date on which the notice and request is \u2018given or sent\u2019 by the prisoner to his custodian.\u201d Id., 249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Admittedly, the defendant was brought to trial within 120 days of the receipt of his request by the state\u2019s attorney. The defendant urges us, however, to create an implied exception to our interpretation of when the 120 day period begins to run where a defendant has done \u201call things required of him to secure his right to a speedy trial under \u00a7 54-82c\u201d and where the only failure to comply with the statute has been on the part of the warden who, due to inadvertence or malfeasance, has failed to notify the appropriate officials of the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">On the basis of this record, the defendant has failed to provide us with any evidence to indicate that the delay between June 5, 1981, and September 3, 1982, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>was caused by the \u201cinadvertence or malfeasance\u201d of the warden in violation of the warden\u2019s statutory duty \u201cpromptly [to] forward\u201d the defendant\u2019s request. General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c (b). At the hearing on his speedy trial motion, the defendant not only failed to call the warden to testify but he offered no evidence concerning the cause of the delay. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is presumed that the warden properly performed his duty. <em>Parham </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>172 Conn. 126, 134, 374 A.2d 137 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lenihan, </em>151 Conn. 552, 555, 200 A.2d 476 (1964). We cannot conclude, as the defendant argues, that the only reasonable inference for the cause of the delay in this case was that the warden simply failed to forward the defendant\u2019s request to the state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in overruling his hearsay objections to the state\u2019s use of evidence of insurance payments to establish the value of the property taken from two of the burglarized residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">To prove the value of the items stolen, the state offered the testimony of the victim-owners. The first victim testified that her losses included several antique sterling silver serving pieces and some gold and silver jewelry. She stated that she initially estimated the value of these items at approximately $2000. The state then asked her whether she had been reimbursed by her insurance carrier for the loss. She replied in the affirmative. When asked how much she had received, the defendant objected on the ground of hearsay. The trial court overruled the objection and the defendant duly excepted. The victim then testified that she had received $4000 from her insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The next victim-owner called by the state testified that several pieces of jewelry, some camera equipment, and a silver candy dish were taken from her home. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Stated that, in her opinion, the value of the stolen items was approximately $2000. She further testified, over the defendant\u2019s renewed hearsay objection, that she had received a $1200 reimbursement from her insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The jury returned verdicts of guilty of larceny in the second degree with respect to the burglaries of these two residences. General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 53a-123 provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of larceny in the second degree when ... (2) the value of the property or service exceeds five hundred dollars . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 53a-121 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[T]he value of property . . . shall be ascertained as follows: (1) . . . value means the market value of the property ... at the time and place of the crime or, if such cannot be satisfactorily ascertained, the cost of replacement of the property . . . within a reasonable time after the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The law in this state is well settled as to the competency of the owner of property to testify as to its value. \u201cOur cases have ruled that the competence of the witness to testify to the value of property may be established by demonstrating that the witness owns the property in question. . . . The rule establishing an owner\u2019s competence to testify reflects both the difficulty of producing other witnesses having any knowledge upon which to base an opinion especially where the stolen items are never recovered . . . and the common experience that an owner is familiar with her property and knows what it is worth. . . . This rule is applicable in criminal as well as civil cases.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>182 Conn. 52, 60-61, 437 A.2d 843 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 424, 473 A.2d 300 (1984). We do not understand by what reason the defendant can claim prejudicial error with respect to the admission of the evidence of insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>payments where each owner first testified as to her opinion of the value of the stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">This court recently approved without discussion the admission of evidence of insurance proceeds to establish the value of stolen property. <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>196 Conn. 225, 229, 492 A.2d 155 (1985). While payment by an insurer might be considered an implied hearsay assertion of its belief as to market value, both the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Uniform Rules of Evidence do not regard nonverbal conduct as falling within the definition of hearsay unless it is intended as an assertion. Fed. R. Evid., rule 801 (a); Unif. R. Evid. (1974 Rev.), rule 62 (1). Evidence of nonassertive conduct by persons not in privity with the parties is not violative of modern conceptions of the hearsay rule and, in the context of this case, had significant probative value and inherent guarantees of trustworthiness without attendant prejudice to the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 664-66, 491 A.2d 345 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The defendant further claims that his right to effective assistance of counsel was violated because the performance of his trial counsel was neither \u201c \u2018 \u201creasonably competent [n]or within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in criminal law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Siemon </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>184 Conn. 547, 554, 440 A.2d 210 (1981). This claim is specifically based on his trial counsel\u2019s conduct with respect to the evidentiary issues raised by the defendant in his fourth claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The state\u2019s principal witness against the defendant was David Basque. On direct examination, Basque testified that on August 2,1980, he had identified for the Ridgefield police several houses which he and the defendant had burglarized in June of that year. Two police officers had taken him for a ride through certain sections of Ridgefield. When he recognized a house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>that he and the defendant had burglarized, Basque pointed out that house to the police. At trial, he could not remember details about the houses nor could he recall from memory the names of the owners which the police disclosed to him after he had pointed out a house that had been burglarized. To refresh his recollection, Basque had to refer frequently during his direct examination to the written statement he had given to the police on August 2, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">On cross-examination, Basque completely repudiated his direct testimony. He testified that on August 2, 1980, he was experiencing drug withdrawal and that, in desperation, he was willing to \u201cdo anything\u201d to get drugs. He stated that \u201cin exchange for\u201d his confession, the police promised him that he would not go to jail and that he would receive some methadone. With respect to his written statement, he claimed that it had not been written by him, that he had never read it, that he had not known what he was signing, and that he would have signed anything given his desperate state of mind. He further testified that he could not be certain that he had really recognized the houses which he had pointed out to the police and that he might even be confusing the burglaries in this case with other burglaries that he had committed alone. He had identified those homes, he continued, \u201c[bjecause I had to cooperate with the police at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">On redirect examination, the state attempted to rehabilitate its witness, but Basque\u2019s testimony was equivocal and he continued to maintain that he was uncertain about the houses he had identified on August 2,1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The state then introduced the testimony of the two police officers to whom Basque had pointed out the houses and given his written statement. Their testimony essentially described Basque\u2019s conduct, his physical and mental state on the day in question, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>circumstances surrounding the confession and the procedure used for determining the identification of the burglarized residences. It was also brought out that the police had provided Basque with his daily dose of methadone before he identified the houses and signed his statement. The defendant\u2019s objections to portions of this testimony as hearsay were overruled. No exceptions were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The defendant, during the presentation of his case, called Basque as a witness. When asked why Basque\u2019s testimony was \u201cdifferent today from what you told the police on August 2nd,\u201d Basque replied, \u201cI\u2019m under oath. I have to tell the truth, sir.\u201d During cross-examination by the state, the witness maintained that he signed the statement only because he was promised by the police that he would not go to jail and that he would get his methadone, if he cooperated. He also denied receiving the methadone until he had agreed to sign a statement. At this time, the state, without objection, introduced into evidence the signed statement of Basque.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The defendant contends that the introduction into evidence of the testimony of the two police officers and the written statement of Basque constituted hearsay. Although these claims were not properly preserved at trial, because they implicate the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel we review them under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">To succeed in his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s performance was not \u201creasonably competent or within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>170 Conn. 273, 283, 365 A.2d 1167, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 962, 96 S. Ct. 1748, 48 L. Ed. 2d 208 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>(1976), quoting <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 639, 646, 356 A.2d 902 (1975); and further, that this \u201c \u2018lack of competency contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>191 Conn. 142, 143-44, 463 A.2d 609 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Scielzo, </em>190 Conn. 191, 206, 460 A.2d 951 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Chairamonte, </em>189 Conn. 61, 63, 454 A.2d 272 (1983). \u201cIf the evidence upon which the [defendant] bases his claim of ineffective assistance was properly admissible, he cannot sustain even the first part of this dual burden since the failure to object to admissible evidence cannot be considered conduct falling below the level of reasonably competent representation.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>195 Conn. 561, 564, 489 A.2d 377 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The testimony of one witness of a party may be contradicted by the testimony of any other witness offered by that party. <em>Delfino </em>v. <em>Warners Motor Express, </em>142 Conn. 301, 307, 114 A.2d 205 (1955). Such contradiction, however, must take the form of factual evidence and no witness can be impeached by contradicting his testimony as to a collateral matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>158 Conn. 321, 324, 260 A.2d 571 (1969). A contradiction is not collateral if it is relevant to a material issue in the case apart from its tendency to contradict the witness. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Obviously, the accuracy and voluntariness of the confession made by Basque were material issues in this case. The testimony of the police officers was introduced to contradict the implications raised by Basque\u2019s testimony during his cross-examination by the defendant. The officers\u2019 testimony was offered to show that the identification procedure used was neutral and unintimidating, that they made no threats or promises with regard to incarceration or sentencing, and that Basque was supplied with his daily dosage of methadone prior to the time he identified the houses and signed the written statement. These factual assertions were elicited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>to contradict the defendant\u2019s version of the circumstances surrounding his confession. Any reference by the police officers to the incriminating statements made by Basque were merely reiterative of the testimony given by Basque during his direct examination by the state. The testimony of the officers, therefore, was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">As a general rule, a party cannot impeach the testimony of its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement. <em>Delfino </em>v. <em>Warners Motor Express, </em>supra, 307. \u201cAn inconsistent statement, although offered by the party calling the witness who is claimed to have made it, may be admitted where hostility, surprise or deceit is disclosed.\u201d <em>Liebman </em>v. <em>Society of Our Lady of Mount St. Carmel, Inc., </em>151 Conn. 582, 588, 200 A.2d 721 (1964). \u201c \u2018[I]f the witness fails to testify in substantial accord with his prior statement, the court has discretion to permit the admission of the inconsistent statement, even though surprise, in the full sense of the word, is lacking.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>173 Conn. 97, 100, 376 A.2d 1089 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In this case, it is fair to assume that, had the defendant objected to the admission of the statement, the trial court would have admitted it as a prior inconsistent statement. At an earlier stage of the trial, the trial court remarked, during an evidentiary ruling, that \u201cI think the question is appropriate until there\u2019s a determination made as to whether or not it\u2019s [Basque\u2019s] recollection or whether or not he\u2019s hostile.\u201d Similarly, in its charge to the jury, the trial court properly instructed the jury that Basque\u2019s statement was to be considered \u201cnot to prove the truth of the facts contained\u201d therein but for the purpose of impeachment only. A ruling admitting the statement, therefore, would have been discretionary and could properly have been made under the circumstances. Because we find that the evidence upon which the defendant bases his claim of ineffec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>tive assistance was properly admitted, we cannot hold, on the basis of this record, that his trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below the level of \u201creasonably competent representation.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Finally, the defendant contends that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to sustain the verdict. When the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a verdict is challenged, we must determine whether the trier of fact \u201c \u2018could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Scielzo, </em>190 Conn. 191, 196, 460 A.2d 951 (1983). In so doing, we construe the evidence in a manner most favorable to sustaining the verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cimino, </em>194 Conn. 210, 211, 478 A.2d 1005 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">From the evidence presented, the jury could reasonably have found the following facts. In June of 1980, Basque drove the defendant to Ridgefield on several occasions for the purpose of committing burglaries in order to obtain money for drugs. After his arrest on August 1, 1980, in Bridgeport on unrelated charges, Basque admitted to having committed several burglaries in Ridgefield. He offered the police information definitively linking himself and the defendant to at least one known burglary in Ridgefield. Because he had informed the police that he was being treated in a methadone maintenance program and required a daily dose of methadone, the police, on the morning of August 2, 1980, obtained the drug for Basque. After taking the methadone, Basque was driven by the police around Ridgefield past \u201chundreds\u201d of homes, out of which he identified eight as those which he and the defendant had burglarized. Although he did not know the names of the owners of the eight homes, Basque was able to give details such as points of entry and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>items stolen from each house to corroborate his identifications. The police told Basque the owners\u2019 names to correlate with his identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">During the drive, passing by hundreds of houses, Basque at times spontaneously and immediately recognized a house; at other times he asked the police to drive past a certain house again. Throughout the identification procedure, Basque was somewhat anxious but not overwrought, and he spoke with the police in normal, conversational tones. When the identification procedure was completed, the police wrote down in narrative form the information gleaned from Basque. After he read the statement, including the provision regarding the penalty for perjury, Basque signed the written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In reviewing the allegation of insufficient evidence, this court will not reweigh the evidence nor resolve questions of the credibility of witnesses, but will look to that evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom which support the findings of the jury. <em>State </em>v. Haddad, 189 Conn. 383, 389, 456 A.2d 316 (1983). The record is replete with evidence from which the jury could have reasonably concluded that the crimes of burglary and larceny as charged in the information were committed. The defendant pleaded not guilty. He denied any connection with the crimes charged. The evidence linking him with the crimes was the testimony of his alleged accomplice, David Basque. The credibility of Basque was a matter exclusively for the jury. If the jury believed Basque\u2019s initial testimony and disbelieved his later attempt to repudiate his confession, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Such questions are left to the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 461, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980). That being so, our review is at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 54-82c.
