In accordance with the provisions of that statute, the court sentenced the defendant to the custody of the commissioner of correction for a term of five years. The defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in impermissibly restricting defense counsel\u2019s voir dire examination of prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The following facts are uncontroverted. Anthony Paladino, a route salesman for Frito Lay, Inc., had made deliveries on July 7,1982, to the D &amp; S Variety Store located in the Dixwell Plaza in New Haven. While returning to his delivery truck he was approached by two black males who attempted to sell him a knife. As he took out his wallet to pay for the knife, he was grabbed around the neck from behind by a third person, a large black male. A struggle ensued and Paladino was thrown to the ground. During the struggle, he was robbed of his wallet, which contained cash, his driver\u2019s license and personal charge cards. Later that day, the defendant was apprehended, identified as the assailant and arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The case was assigned for trial by jury. Twenty-four potential veniremen were examined from which a jury of six plus two alternate jurors was selected. Thereafter, testimony commenced and the state called six witnesses, three of whom were police officers. Identification of the defendant as the robber was crucial to the state\u2019s case, since the defendant had offered an alibi defense. In support thereof, he introduced testimony from his mother that he was home at the time of the robbery. The defendant corroborated this testimony. A third defense witness, Peter Cox, who testified that he witnessed the robbery, and saw the perpetrator, stated that the defendant was not the robber. On cross-examination, the defendant denied that he ever told a police officer that he \u201cgot jacked up on a robbery charge\u201d and that he had witnessed a struggle but had not participated in any robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that he was denied a fair trial because the trial court impermissibly restricted defense counsel\u2019s voir dire examination of prospective jurors. During the course of the voir dire examination, defense counsel asked certain questions designed to ascertain whether or not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>prospective jurors would be able to perform their duties without bias, prejudice or partiality. During examination of one juror, defense counsel asked: \u201cThe State has indicated that possibly there could be police officers who would testify in this matter. Would you give a police officer\u2019s testimony any extra believability or credibility merely because it\u2019s a police officer testifying?\u201d The trial court refused to allow the question. On another occasion, the state\u2019s attorney queried: \u201cWould you be able to exclude feelings of sympathy and compassion \u2014 ?\u201d At that point the court interrupted and refused to allow this question, noting that the issue would be covered in his charge. On cross-examination of the same prospective juror, defense counsel inquired: \u201cIt was the same question Mr. Fasano asked about sympathy. Would you be able to exclude sympathy for anybody?\u201d Again the court disallowed the question. A third juror was asked: \u201cAnd if the judge were to tell you that you are to base your decision on only what you see and what you hear in the courtroom and not what might have gone on when you weren\u2019t in here, would you do your best to follow those instructions?\u201d The court held this to be an improper question. Defense counsel then attempted to rephrase the question: \u201cIf the Judge were to tell you that you are to base your decision on the evidence that you see and hear .... [The Court:] I\u2019m not going to allow that question anyway. It would be part of the Court\u2019s charge.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The trial court restricted defense counsel\u2019s questioning on voir dire, apparently because it believed that the subject matter of the questions would be adequately covered in the court\u2019s charge, or had already been explained in instructions given prior to voir dire. Although the court\u2019s preliminary instructions to the panel were expansive, thorough and well done, the fact that a court instructs the jury panel prior to voir dire and or charges the jury at the conclusion of the trial does not satisfy the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to examine, personally or by counsel, each juror. The court\u2019s charge does not necessarily delve into the mental processes of the jurors. It does not reveal the innermost thoughts, prejudices or feelings of the individual jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u201cThe right to a voir dire examination of each prospective juror in a criminal action is provided by \u00a7 54-82f of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [The court has the duty to analyze individual questioning under this section and limit examination to questions relating to (1) juror\u2019s qualifications, (2) interest, if any, in the subject matter of the action, and (3) relations with the parties thereto.] This right was established as a constitutional one in 1972 by inclusion in article IV of the amendments to the state constitution of the provision that \u2018[t]he right to question each juror individually by counsel shall be inviolate.\u2019 See <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 446, 450 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>A.2d 828 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>172 Conn. 172, 174, 374 A.2d 156 (1976).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>196 Conn. 667, 671, 495 A.2d 699 (1985). This right cannot be replaced by a court\u2019s charge, which is addressed to a group and does not elicit answers. Examination of jurors on voir dire has a two-fold purpose; it permits the trial court to determine whether the prospective juror is qualified to serve and it aids the parties in exercising their rights to peremptory challenges. <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 446. It is true that the extent of the voir dire examination rests largely within the discretion of the trial court, and the exercise of that discretion will not constitute reversible error unless it has clearly been abused or harmful prejudice appears to have resulted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>supra. \u201cNevertheless, in exercising its discretion, the court should grant such latitude as is reasonably necessary to fairly accomplish the purposes of the voir dire. Clearly, therefore, if there is any likelihood that some prejudice is in the juror\u2019s mind which will even subconsciously affect his decision of the case, the party who may be adversely affected should be permitted questions designed to uncover that prejudice. This is particularly true with reference to the defendant in a criminal case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgs, </em>143 Conn. 138, 142, 120 A.2d 152 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In this case, police testimony was crucial to the state\u2019s attempt to disprove the defendant\u2019s alibi defense. The defendant had allegedly made incriminating statements to a police officer to the effect that he \u201cgot jacked up on a robbery charge\u201d and had witnessed a struggle but had not participated in any robbery. Were this contradiction considered as true, then the defendant\u2019s proffered \u201calibi\u201d defense would have to be disbelieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u201cWhen important testimony is anticipated from certain witnesses whose official or semi-official status is such that a juror might reasonably be more, or less, inclined to credit their testimony, a query as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>a juror would have such an inclination should be permitted. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 F.2d 543 (D.C. Cir. 1964); <em>Sellers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>271 F.2d 475 (D.C. Cir. 1959); <em>Harvin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>297 A.2d 774 (D.C. 1972). It was of vital importance to the defendant that if any such inclination existed it be brought to light. He was entitled to explore this area of possible disqualification prior to the impaneling of the jury. Only then could he intelligently challenge for cause or exercise his right of peremptory challenge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgs, </em>supra, 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\"Nothing could be plainer than that a predisposition to attach greater or less credence to a witness\u2019 testimony simply because of that witness\u2019 position as an officer is inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory right to an impartial jury. The denial of such a fundamental right cannot be countenanced. The trial court\u2019s refusal to allow defense counsel to ask prospective jurors whether they would be inclined to give more weight to the testimony of a police officer merely because of that person\u2019s official status constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 672-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In this opinion Shea and Dannehy, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-136. robbery in the third degree: CLASS D felony, (a) A person is guilty of robbery in the third degree when he commits robbery. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-5\"> The questions which the trial judge prohibited defense counsel from asking the three prospective jurors were not put to each and every venireman. Defense counsel indicated that he did not wish to prolong the voir dire process by asking each prospective juror the questions that the court had found objectionable. The court stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to lay that foundation in each and every \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t consider it a waiver by the fact that you didn\u2019t go ahead and reask all of those questions, and I indicated that to you before.\u201d The court then stated: \u201cI\u2019m not requiring you to repeat all the inadmissible questions to each prospective juror.\u201d Thus, the record was adequately preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 54-82f.
