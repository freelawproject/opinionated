Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1O\">This appeal involves various aspects of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to self-representation at trial, including whether he has a right to hybrid representation. On August 22, 1980, the defendant was charged by an information with tampering with a witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151. After entering a plea of not guilty to the charge, he was tried by a jury and found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On appeal, he raises claims that the trial court erred in that it: (1) caused him to conduct a portion of his trial alone without first obtaining a valid waiver of his state and federal constitutional right to the assistance of counsel; (2) violated his state constitutional right to hybrid representation when his request to proceed as co-counsel was denied; (3) expressly restricted the role of his standby counsel in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 964; and (4) violated Practice Book \u00a7 632 in originally granting his defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Some elaboration of the pertinent pretrial proceedings is necessary for disposition of the defendant\u2019s appeal. Subsequent to being charged with the present offense, the defendant applied for and was found eligible to receive the services of a public defender. Attorney Judith Hoberman was appointed to represent him. Upon his plea of not guilty and election of trial by jury, the defendant\u2019s case was assigned for trial on December 11, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Prior to the voir dire of the prospective jurors, the trial court was informed by Hoberman that the defendant had \u201cexpressed\u201d to her \u201can interest to conduct a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>portion of his own defense.\u201d Hoberman informed the trial court that she could not appear as co-counsel with the defendant, that she had suggested to him that he file a pro se appearance, and that she would move to withdraw her appearance for the defendant. Hoberman further informed the court that she would be willing to appear as the defendant\u2019s standby counsel in the event he elected to proceed pro se.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The trial court then cautioned the defendant of the dangers of self-representation. Specifically, the trial court advised the defendant of the gravity of the offense with which he was charged, that if convicted he faced a possible sentence of up to five years of imprisonment, and that <em>\u201ca </em>trial, particularly a trial to the jury, is going to require a very real degree of expertise to be properly conducted.\u201d In explaining the latter point, the court cited the expertise needed to argue intelligently about the admissibility of evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court then in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>no uncertain terms warned the defendant of the dangers of self-representation: \u201cYou\u2019re putting yourself in a terrible position in attempting to represent yourself. You are not really cognizant of how a trial is conducted, what the appropriate law is, what the appropriate rules of evidence are and that sort of thing. You realize to be a lawyer requires three years of graduate school just to start. Now you can\u2019t possible [sic] have that background expertise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The defendant\u2019s response to the court\u2019s statements was: \u201cWhat you said is quite true \u2014 As a matter of fact absolutely true, but what you don\u2019t understand is that my counsel \u2014 I discussed with my counsel the case and she is just not going to submit things that I want submitted, that I feel need to be submitted, to the jury to understand what\u2019s fully going on here.\u201d Upon the court\u2019s suggestion that, because of his counsel\u2019s \u201cexpertise,\u201d a decision not to develop \u201ccertain things\u201d may have been necessary \u201cunder the rules of evidence,\u201d the defendant declared: \u201cOh, yes they can be brought out and they will be brought out if I have anything to say about this. I am the one being accused. They drag me in here, accuse me and there\u2019s no way I can see myself sitting here not saying anything in my defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Hoberman then renewed her motion to withdraw. The trial court expressly asked the defendant whgther he realized that he was \u201centitled to be represented,\u201d to which the defendant answered, \u201c[r]ight.\u201d The trial court asked the defendant whether he \u201crealizefd] that this can run into a lot of technicalities, in the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>of a trial, of which you are unaware.\u201d The defendant responded that he did not \u201cwant to conduct a full trial,\u201d but rather \u201c[a]ll I want is a small portion \u2014 a little say. [Attorney Hoberman] will be conducting the trial.\u201d The court then said: \u201cWell, I can\u2019t force a lawyer on you,\u201d and the defendant stated: \u201cSo, please don\u2019t let her go.\u201d The court further inquired of the defendant whether \u201c[kjnowing your rights and knowing the difficulties with which you are facing, nevertheless, you want to conduct your own defense?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t want to conduct the whole trial, I just want to be able to have, you know, a say, a few things here and there. She would counsel me, of course, before I say it.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The trial court then proposed that if the defendant filed \u201ca pro se appearance\u201d the court would grant Hoberman\u2019s motion to withdraw but would also order her \u201cto remain in attendance as standby counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court then instructed the clerk to ensure that the defendant was provided a pro se appearance form. Hoberman requested that the defendant be given \u201cjust a few moments to consider your Honor\u2019s latest proposal,\u201d but the defendant retorted: \u201cI understand it perfectly well.\u201d The court warned the defendant that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>further delay of the trial would not be permitted and directly asked the defendant: \u201cAre you entering a pro se appearance or are you not?\u201d The defendant responded affirmatively: \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d The defendant filed his pro se appearance with the trial court which then granted Hoberman\u2019s motion to withdraw her appearance as the defendant\u2019s counsel. The court, however, appointed Hoberman as standby counsel for the defendant and directed her \u201cto remain in attendance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The defendant thereafter presented his opening statement to the jury panel, in which he represented that he was a student \u201cat Yale College with the Special Division Program,\u201d and he personally conducted the voir dire during jury selection. Just prior to the presentation of evidence, the defendant orally moved to dismiss the charges against him on the ground that there was \u201cno probable cause in the first place to arrest me.\u201d During the hearing on this motion, the defendant, as he asserts in his brief, \u201crequested that his counsel be re-appointed and withdrew his appearance.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Noting that the defendant had already \u201cmade a knowing waiver of the right to be represented by counsel,\u201d the court granted the defendant\u2019s request, and the pro se appearance was withdrawn. Later during the actual trial, the defendant changed his position and requested and was granted the court\u2019s permission to conduct his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>representation on a pro se basis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hoberman\u2019s appearance was again withdrawn, and the court appointed her as the defendant\u2019s standby counsel. The defendant then conducted the balance of his trial, including the presentation of final argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We address first the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court \u201ccaused him to conduct a portion of his trial alone without first obtaining a valid waiver\u201d of his state and federal constitutional right to assistance of counsel. Specifically, the defendant argues that, because the \u201cwaiver\u201d of his right to counsel should be held invalid on the ground that the record does not clearly demonstrate that he made \u201can unequivocal request to represent himself,\u201d he is entitled to an automatic reversal of his conviction in that he had represented himself during a portion of the proceedings when the right to counsel had attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The state does not dispute that the defendant had a state and federal constitutional right to assistance of counsel during both the voir dire of the prospective jurors and the pretrial hearing on the defendant\u2019s pro se motion to dismiss. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 480 A.2d 435 (1984), it is implicit that the court viewed the right to counsel as having attached during the stage of the proceeding involved in the voir dire of prospective jurors. Id., 532-33. This court also regards the voir dire under Connecticut law as \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>integral part\u201d of the criminal trial and a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceeding. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 7, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 26 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 357, 446 A.2d 382 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Canady, </em>187 Conn. 281, 289, 445 A.2d 895 (1982); 3 Wharton, Criminal Procedure (12th Ed. Torcia 1975) \u00a7 411. We turn next to the primary component of the defendant\u2019s claim, i.e., the record does not clearly demonstrate that he made an unequivocal request to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">A criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to assistance of counsel under both the federal; see <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963); and the state constitutions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>supra, 533. A criminal defendant also has the right to appear pro se in a state criminal trial \u201cwhen he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.\u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 807, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>supra, citing <em>Lyles </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>658 F.2d 1015, 1020 (5th Cir. 1981); see generally annot., 98 A.L.R.3d 13 (1980). The court in <em>Faretta </em>stated the rule as follows: \u201cWhen an accused manages his own defense, he relinquishes, as a purely factual matter, many of the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel. For this reason, in order to represent himself, the accused must \u2018knowingly and intelligently\u2019 forego those relinquished benefits. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. [458, 464-65, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938)]. Cf. <em>Von Moltke </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>332 U.S. 708, 723-24, 68 S. Ct. 316, 92 L. Ed. 309 [1948] (plurality opinion of Black, J.). Although a defendant need not himself have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose self-representation, he should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that \u2018he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>eyes open.\u2019 <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. [269, 279, 63 S. Ct. 236, 87 L. Ed. 268 (1942)].\u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 835.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In accordance with <em>Faretta, </em>we have recognized that \u201c[n]othing more intricate than a voluntary and intelligent waiver of counsel is required of an accused to exercise his right to defend himself in person.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>supra, 533, citing <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In reciting the circumstances of that case, the <em>Faretta </em>court noted that: \u201cHere, weeks before trial, Faretta clearly and unequivocally declared to the trial judge that he wanted to represent himself and did not want counsel.\u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 835. Some courts have extrapolated from this language a further requirement that the defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se must be clear and unequivocal;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Raulerson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>Wainwright, </em>732 F.2d 803, 808 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 966, 105 S. Ct. 366, 83 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>623 F.2d 824, 827-28 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>539 F.2d 45, 50 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 925, 97 S. Ct. 327, 50 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>425 A.2d 194, 196 (Me. 1981); and the defendant contends that the record establishes that this he did not do. Our review of the record in this case, as we demonstrate below, reveals that the defendant did make a valid waiver of his constitutional right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The defendant argues, and we agree, that the gist of his initial dialogue with the trial court, \u201caccurately construed,\u201d was a request to act as co-counsel along with his court-appointed attorney. The defendant\u2019s request for hybrid representation was denied by the trial court, and we agree that this type of request should not be considered as a request to proceed pro se. See <em>Raulerson </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>supra, 808; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>supra, 49. We note that the defendant\u2019s court-appointed counsel expressed clearly her lack of willingness to serve as co-counsel with the defendant,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the record discloses that the defendant\u2019s wish to be permitted hybrid representation status was the catalyst for Hoberman\u2019s first motion to withdraw her appearance as his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The trial court, faced on the first scheduled day of trial with a defendant requesting a status to which he had no legal right; see Part II, infra; and a motion to withdraw from an attorney whom the defendant considered to be a \u201cvery good lawyer,\u201d scrupulously attempted to accommodate the defendant\u2019s desire to participate actively in conducting his defense within constitutional parameters.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Moreno </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>717 F.2d 171 (5th Cir. 1983). The court, after ensuring that the requirements for a valid waiver had been satisfied; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>supra, 532-40; see generally Practice Book \u00a7 961;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> proposed that if the defendant wanted to proceed pro se, Hoberman would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>appointed as his standby counsel to be available \u201cfor consultation\u201d and ready \u201cto step in\u201d when the defendant during the trial realized he was \u201cout of [his] depth.\u201d The record establishes without question that the defendant affirmatively responded to this proposal, stated on the record that he understood it \u201cperfectly well,\u201d and accepted it both orally and by filing a written pro se appearance form.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">If the trial court has first made appropriate inquiries regarding the defendant\u2019s choice of representation, \u201cthe court can then properly insist that the defendant choose between representation by his existing counsel and proceeding pro se.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Welty, </em>674 F.2d 185, 188 (3d Cir. 1982). \u201cA criminal defendant may be asked, in the interest of orderly procedures, to choose between waiver and another course of action as long as the choice presented to him is not constitutionally offensive.\u201d <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>545 F.2d 273, 278 (1st Cir. 1976). In the present case, the trial court heard statements from both the defendant and his counsel regarding their difference of opinion. The trial court then inquired of the defendant regarding the criteria for an effective waiver. See footnote 2, supra. \u201cWhen a defendant is faced with the choice of proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ing with counsel he is not entirely happy with or defending pro se, the trial judge must satisfy himself that if the defendant chooses to proceed pro se, he does so knowingly, with a full understanding of the risks involved.\u201d <em>Cordoba </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>473 F. Sup. 632, 637 (S.D.N.Y. 1979). This the trial court did do, and the defendant makes no claim that the trial court failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">First, the trial court expressly advised the defendant of his right to be represented by counsel. Second, the trial court warned the defendant at length about the dangers of self-representation. Third, the defendant was apprised of the nature of the proceedings against him, and of the potential exposure to punishment. See footnote 2, supra; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>supra, 537 (the trial court \u201cmay appropriately presume that defense counsel has explained the nature of the offense in sufficient detail\u201d); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>35 Wash. App. 388, 393-94, 667 P.2d 108 (1983). Fourth, the defendant actively participated in the colloquies involved, which were both informative and lively. Fifth, the trial court had extensive opportunities to see, hear and evaluate the defendant\u2019s intelligence and perceptions. On this record<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we conclude that the defendant did voluntarily and intelligently waive his constitutional right to counsel in choosing the option of proceeding pro se with standby counsel available to him; see <em>Flowers </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>680 F.2d 261 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 946, 103 S. Ct. 262, 74 L. Ed. 2d 204 (1982); and the record establishes that \u201c 'he [knew] what he [was] doing and his choice [was] made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 835, citing <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S. Ct. 236, 87 L. Ed. 268 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court erred by denying him the right to hybrid representation that he contends is guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of the state of Connecticut. The key portion of that provision declares that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right to be heard by himself and by counsel . . . .\u201d Conn. Const., art. I \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In his brief the defendant argues that the plain language of the provision \u201csuggests that the right the framers [of the Connecticut constitution] sought to protect was the right of a criminal accused to present his case as co-counsel <em>with </em>his retained or appointed attorney, should he so desire.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The defendant also argues that \u201cthe standard tools of constitutional construction\u201d demonstrate that \u201cthe provision must be interpreted so as to guarantee a right to hybrid representation.\u201d We disagree and hold today that article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution does not guarantee the right to hybrid representation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>As a preliminary matter, it is necessary to define the term \u201chybrid representation,\u201d also known as \u201cco-counsel\u201d status. The defendant explains that \u201c[u]nder such a 'hybrid representation\u2019 arrangement, both he and his attorney would conduct portions of his trial, while he retained ultimate control over defense strategy.\u201d Accord 2 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure (1984) \u00a7 11.5 (f); comment, \u201cThe Right to Appear Pro Se: Developments in the Law,\u201d 59 Neb. L. Rev. 135,156-57 (1980); note, \u201cThe Accused as Co-Counsel: The Case for the Hybrid Defense,\u201d 12 Val. U.L. Rev. 329, 339 (1978); see 21A Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law \u00a7 767 (1981). The state does not dispute that a hybrid representation arrangement involves \u201cthe joint presentation of his defense by him and by his counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Theoretically, hybrid representation can be considered as the ultimate product of a criminal defendant\u2019s \u201cpartial waiver\u201d of both his <em>Faretta </em>right to self-representation and his right to assistance of counsel. 2 LaFave &amp; Israel, supra. The record indicates that, in the pertinent proceedings, the defendant\u2019s initial colloquy with the trial court could be fairly construed as a request for hybrid representation, although he never explicitly requested \u201cco-counsel\u201d or \u201chybrid\u201d status.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The defendant premises his hybrid representation claim on the state rather than the federal constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>It has been uniformly established that the right to counsel under the sixth amendment to the federal constitution does not guarantee a criminal defendant the right to hybrid representation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Supreme Court recently indicated that <em>\u201cFaretta </em>does not require a trial judge to permit \u2018hybrid\u2019 representation of the type Wiggins was actually allowed.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>McKaskle </em>v. <em>Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 183, 104 S. Ct. 944, 79 L. Ed. 2d 122, reh. denied, 465 U.S. 1112, 104 S. Ct. 1620, 80 L. Ed. 2d 148, on remand, 729 F.2d 1026 (5th Cir. 1984). Quite clearly, there is no federal constitutional right to hybrid representation. And it must be remembered that, \u201calthough we fully recognize the primary independent vitality of the provisions of our own constitution\u201d; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 641, 376 A.2d 359 (1977); \u201cthe decisions of the United States Supreme Court defining federal constitutional rights are, at the least, persuasive authority\u201d; id.; and thus maybe \u201cafforded respectful consideration.\u201d Id., 642; see also <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 66, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The defendant essentially argues that the plain meaning of the pertinent clause of article first, \u00a7 8, compels the conclusion that the right to hybrid representation is one guaranteed by our state constitution. Again, the constitutional language, which is the focus of this claim on appeal, provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right to be <em>heard </em>by himself <em>and </em>by counsel . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Const., art. I \u00a7 8. The defendant argues that the framers\u2019 use of the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d rather than the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d and the application of the phrase \u201cto be heard\u201d supports his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u201cIn dealing with constitutional provisions we must assume that infinite care was employed to couch in scrupulously fitting language a proposal aimed at establishing or changing the organic law of the state. <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Leopold, </em>141 Conn. 1, 19, 103 A.2d 818 [1954]; 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) p. 125. Unless there is some clear reason for not doing so, effect must be given to every part of and each word in the constitution.\u201d <em>Stolberg </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>175 Conn. 586, 597-98, 402 A.2d 763 (1978), appeal dismissed sub. nom. <em>Stolberg </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>454 U.S. 958, 102 S. Ct. 496, 70 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1981). Although the simplicity of the defendant\u2019s argument may have some superficial appeal, important questions involving constitutional principles, as a general rule, \u201ccannot be so easily solved.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 155, 251 A.2d 49 (1968). We find the defendant\u2019s \u201cplain meaning\u201d argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In his brief, the defendant maintains the plain language of article first, \u00a7 8, \u201cclearly suggests that the right the framers sought to protect was the right of a criminal accused to present his case as co-counsel <em>with </em>his retained or appointed attorney, should he so desire.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We have previously noted, however, that \u201c[similar provisions in other states have not been construed to entitle an accused as a matter of right to be heard by both himself and by counsel.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>172 Conn. 458, 475, 374 A.2d 1107 (1977). Constitutional framers\u2019 selection of the word \u201cand\u201d in comparable \u201cright to be heard\u201d provisions in other jurisdictions has been held <em>not </em>to encompass a state constitutional guarantee: to \u201ca right to representation and self-representation simultaneously\u201d; <em>Hooks </em>v. <em>State, </em>416 A.2d 189, 199 (Del. 1980); to \u201csimultaneous enjoyment\u201d of \u201cthese two basic rights\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burkhart, </em>541 S.W.2d 365, 369 (Tenn. 1976); \u201cto have his case presented in court by both himself and counsel acting at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the same time\u201d; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>7 Cal. 3d 448, 459, 499 P.2d 489, 103 Cal.

App. 1974). Thus, the weight of authority overwhelmingly demonstrates that the defendant\u2019s suggested construction of \u201cand\u201d in article first, \u00a7 8, is far from plain. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In sum, we are not persuaded that the framers\u2019 use of the conjunctive in article first, \u00a7 8, manifests an intent to guarantee hybrid representation. \u201c \u2018If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>words have a doubtful meaning, or are susceptible of two meanings, they should receive that which will effectuate the intent of the framers of the Constitution and the general intent of the instrument.\u2019 <em>Borino </em>v. <em>Lounsbury, </em>86 Conn. 622, 625, 86 A. 597 (1913).\u201d <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>supra, 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The <em>Borino </em>rule also assists in our analysis of the phrase, \u201cright to be heard,\u201d in \u00a7 8 of article first. Historical background, where there is ambiguity, may be utilized as a proper tool to discern the framers\u2019 intent in drafting the language of constitutional provisions; see <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>supra; or of legislative enactments. See <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-ManhattanEurope, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 494 A.2d 555 (1985). Constitutional interpretation can be \u201cnecessarily influenced\u201d by recognition of a provision\u2019s historical roots, including its English common law antecedents. <em>Borino </em>v. <em>Lounsbury, </em>supra, 629; see <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 821-22. Our examination of the historical background of article first, \u00a7 8, discloses that there are two related yet separate legal developments that may have culminated in the original adoption of this provision of the first Connecticut constitution in 1818.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">First, the independent right of an individual accused of the commission of a crime to self-representation had evolved. See generally <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra. \u201c[U]nder the ancient English common law a person on trial for a felony was not allowed counsel and was not a competent witness in his own behalf.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>supra, 473. In cases involving other crimes that were prosecuted in the Star Chamber, a defendant was compelled \u201cto accept representation by counsel whose object was to avoid the disapprobation which would follow if anything in the defendant\u2019s answer to the indictment offended the Crown.\u201d <em>Hooks </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 199; see also <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 821-23. During interrogation conducted in the Star Chamber, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>accused was not permitted assistance of counsel. Note, \u201cAssistance of Counsel: A Right to Hybrid Representation,\u201d 57 B.U.L. Rev. 570, 577 (1977). After the elimination of the Star Chamber, \u201cevery litigant was required to \u2018appear before the court in his own person and conduct his own cause in his own words.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 823. The legal fiction had emerged that the presiding judge could serve in these undoubtedly inquisitorial proceedings as counsel for the accused. Id., 824 n.21; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>supra, 473; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>47 Conn. 518, 543-44 (1880); note, 57 B.U.L. Rev., supra, 577. Incremental statutory reform commencing in late seventeenth century England provided criminal defendants with the option of presenting a defense \u201c \u2018by Counsel learned in the Law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 824; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Burkhart, </em>supra, 367; note, 57 B.U.L. Rev., supra. The right to counsel thus emerged \u201cas guaranteeing a choice between representation by counsel and the traditional practice of self-representation.\u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 825; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Burkhart, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Historically, \u201c[i]n the American Colonies the insistence upon a right of self-representation was, if anything, more fervent than in England.\u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 826. As a general proposition, the scope of the right to counsel in early colonial times was probably limited, just as it had been in England. See note, 57 B.U.L. Rev., supra, 578. Because lawyers in colonial America were identified with the Crown, distrust of lawyers was institutionalized as several colonies, including Connecticut, initially \u201cprohibited pleading for hire in the 17th century.\u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 827 and n.32.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> By the end of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>century, however, the right to counsel had been established in Connecticut. Id., n.35; 2 Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1796) pp. 398-99.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Appointment of counsel was \u201cthe practice in Connecticut in the latter part of the 18th century; appointment apparently was sometimes made even when the accused failed to request counsel, if he appeared in need of a lawyer, but there is no indication appointment was ever made over the objection of the accused.\u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 830 n.40, citing 2 Swift, supra, 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Thus, by the time of the adoption of our first state constitution in 1818, a defendant in a criminal case had the right to present a defense, including one by counsel, if he so chose. Under the rationale as espoused by the recent illustrative decision in <em>Hooks </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, our constitutional provision guaranteeing \u201ca right to be heard by himself and by counsel\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> simply \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>addressed to securing both of these equally important fundamental rights. But we are not persuaded that a hybrid representation arrangement would be in any way consistent with or of assistance to the framers\u2019 original intent. The discussion in <em>Faretta </em>clearly shows that the states envisioned the right to counsel as an adjunct to the ever-present right to self-representation, available if the defendant wishes to make use of it.\u201d Id., 199; see <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>316 U.S. 455, 466, 62 S. Ct. 1252, 86 L. Ed. 1595 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The second development in the law involved the competency of a criminal defendant to testify on his own behalf at trial. The ancient common law rule was \u201cthat a person charged with a criminal offense is incompetent to testify under oath in his own behalf at his trial.\u201d <em>Ferguson v. Georgia, </em>365 U.S. 570, 81 S. Ct. 756, 5 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1961). In our examination of the English common law system, we have already indicated that after the English revolution the defendant was permitted to <em>argue </em>on his own behalf at trial. <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 823-24. \u201cIn the process the defendant could offer by way of explanation material that would later be characterized as testimony. . . . In the seventeenth century, however, he was allowed to call witnesses in his behalf; the right to have them sworn was accorded by statute for treason in 1695 and for all felony in 1701. 7 Will. Ill, c. 3; 1 Anne, St. 2, c. 9. ... A distinction was drawn between the accused and his witnesses \u2014 they gave evidence but he did not. . . . The general acceptance of the interest rationale as a basis for disqualification reinforced this distinction, since the criminal defendant was, of course, <em>par excellence </em>an interested witness.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>supra, 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">This rule was the law in Connecticut when the state constitution was adopted: \u201cIt is a general rule in criminal cases, that a person who is either to be a gainer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>or loser in the event of the cause, in which he is called to give evidence, is incompetent, and cannot be examined.\u201d Swift, A Digest of the Law of Evidence in Civil and Criminal Cases (1810) p. 69; see generally <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>State, </em>23 Conn. 18 (1854). However, the defendant, as explained above, had the right to make his oral statement, unsworn, in his case. In 1867, the common law disability prohibiting a defendant from testifying under oath was abrogated by statute in Connecticut.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 54-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">By 1818, then, one accused of a crime in our state had no right to <em>testify </em>in his own behalf. He could, however, be \u201cheard\u201d in his role as defendant by making an unsworn statement himself. The provision in article first, \u00a7 8, that guarantees the accused \u201ca right to be heard by himself and by counsel\u201d may have been intended by the framers \u201cto insure that every accused citizen enjoyed the benefit of counsel <em>and </em>a correlative right to be heard in person.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burkhart, </em>supra, 371.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Under the rationale espoused by such cases as <em>Burkhart </em>and <em>Landers </em>v. <em>State, </em>550 S.W.2d 272 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977), article first, \u00a7 8, was \u201cintended to afford an accused the right to participate and be heard in his trial while at the same time removing the restrictions to full representation and participation of counsel.\u201d <em>Landers </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 277; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Burkhart, </em>supra. The short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>answer to the critics of this line of reasoning that it causes the phrase, \u201cto be heard,\u201d \u201cto have different meanings as to the terms himself, or counsel or both\u201d; <em>Landers </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 281 (Phillips, J., dissenting); is that this theory assumes the framers\u2019 intent that each would be \u201cheard\u201d in accordance with his respective accepted role as defined at that time in history. The defendant could at that time appear as an unsworn witness represented by counsel. If the accused, however, chose to represent himself, then he would be \u201cheard\u201d in the capacity of counsel as well as in that of defendant. After the disqualification of a defendant as a witness was removed by statute his right to make an unsworn statement was replaced by the right to testify. See <em>Landers </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In any event, we need not base our resolution of this issue on an express selection between these two historical developments. In light of all this background, we instead are persuaded that to accept the defendant\u2019s argument that article first, \u00a7 8, guarantees a right to hybrid representation would be tantamount to viewing that provision\u2019s language \u201cas newly descended from the firmament like fresh fallen snow\u201d; <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>supra, 62; as there is scant evidence that the framers ever intended, much less imagined, any such result.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> That provision has not previously been so construed by this court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>supra, 475. In conclusion, we decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to so construe this provision of our state constitution.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court committed reversible error by granting defense counsel Hoberman\u2019s motion to withdraw in that the court did not first establish \u201cgood cause\u201d; see Practice Book \u00a7 632; and by restricting the role of his standby counsel so as to violate Practice Book \u00a7 964. The state counters that these claims, raised for the first time on appeal, have not been properly preserved for appellate review. In neither his brief nor his reply brief does the defendant address the state\u2019s argument that these claims have not been preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Our rules of practice, of course, require that a party, in order to preserve a claim for appeal, \u201cdistinctly [raise]\u201d it at trial. Practice Book \u00a7 3063; see also Practice Book \u00a7 315; <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 65-66, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). As we stated in <em>Evans, </em>supra, 70, and have reiterated since, it is only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u201cthat newly raised claims can and will be considered by this court.\u201d The first such circumstance involving a recently discovered constitutional right is inapposite to these claims. Nor is the second exceptional circumstance, the deprivation \u201cof a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial,\u201d implicated here. Id. We do note, however, that the record, fairly read, supports the state\u2019s position that the defendant received a fundamentally fair trial,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and the defendant asserts no claim to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-6\"> Attorney Judith Hoberman\u2019s opening statement to the trial court was in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u201cMs. Hoberman: If I may proceed preliminarily. My client, although some of the papers refer to him as David Gethers, has formally changed his name to Donald Galland and during the course of these proceedings he wishes to be referred to as Donald Galland. I had anticipated filing a motion right now.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u201cBefore we do that, however, Mr. Galland has expressed to me an interest to conduct a portion of his own defense. I have discussed that it is impossible for me to co-counsel his case with him. If he wishes to conduct his defense, I suggested that he file a pro se appearance and that I move to withdraw as counsel in the matter. I would be happy to advise him and sit at the counsel table with him as adviser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 527 n.1, 480 A.2d 435 (1984), regarding the defendant\u2019s legal change of name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-10\"> The following is the trial court\u2019s advisement through this point in time:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Mr. Galland, you are charged with a very serious offense. Tampering with a witness is classified \u2014 it\u2019s what we call a class D felony. Now, that title doesn\u2019t mean much to you, but it is sufficiently serious so that what you face is possible punishment of up to five years. You have got to realize that a trial, particularly a trial to the jury, is going to require a very real degree of expertise to be properly conducted. For instance, there may well be questions as to admissibility of evidence. I doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>very much that you would have the training and the background to be able to argue intelligently as to whether or not a particular piece of evidence was admissible or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\u201cNow, this can come up in several different ways. It may be that the state is offering evidence to which a proper objection can be made and you won\u2019t know it. It may be that you are attempting to offer evidence on your own behalf which is not admissible and you have framed your defense around this thing that isn\u2019t admissible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\"> The trial court then attempted to clarify the nature of the defendant\u2019s position:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u201cThe Court: Well, let me get it straight.

I think sometime during the trial you are going to finally realize you are out of your depth and if she stays in the room as stand-by counsel and is available to you for consultation, she will be available to step in when we reach that stage, which I am sure we will, when you realize this is something above and beyond you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\"> The following is pertinent to the defendant\u2019s request:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor, the explanation having been made on the record, after the defendant\u2019s request, I would now ask the court to again question the defendant as to whether or not he wishes to continue to now having been informed under the conditions stated on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right. I asked you before if you wanted to withdraw your pro se appearance and have Ms. Hoberman appear on your behalf and your answer was yes.

See footnote 9, infra. The defendant explicitly agreed to proceed pro se and to have Hoberman available only in the role of standby counsel. The trial court then inquired of the defendant as to whether he understood that he had a right to counsel, that he was facing a felony charge with \u201cthe possibility of a substantial amount of prison time,\u201d and that in light of \u201call that, nevertheless, you want her to get out and you will conduct the trial.\u201d The defendant responded affirmatively to all these questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\"> The watershed case on waiver of the right to counsel, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.

Prior to the <em>Faretta </em>decision in 1975, the federal courts uniformly rejected the constitutional basis for hybrid representation status. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Conder, </em>423 F.2d 904 (6th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Pegram </em>v. <em>United States, </em>400 U.S. 958, 91 S. Ct. 357, 27 L.

The federal courts, it must be remembered, have been able to rely, at least in part, on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654, which provides that \u201c[i]n all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel. ...\u201d That federal statute, however, withstood constitutional attack on the hybrid representation issue in at least one case. <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>205 F.2d 806 (5th Cir.), cert. dismissed on petitioner\u2019s motion, 346 U.S. 892, 74 S.

See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattson, </em>51 Cal. 2d 777, 787-88 n.3, 336 P.2d 937 (1959). The one state court exception revealed by our research is <em>Wake </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>514 S.W.2d 692, 696 (Ky. App. 1974) (hybrid status \u201cis embraced within the right-to-counsel and equal-protection provisions of the federal and state constitutions\u201d). See note, \u201cThe Accused as Co-Counsel: The Case for the Hybrid Defense,\u201d 12 Val. U.L.

See <em>Gray </em>v. <em>State, </em>351 So. 2d 1342 (Miss. 1977). The language contained in article first, \u00a7 10, of the original Mississippi constitution of 1817, guaranteeing the right of an accused to \u201cbe heard by himself and counsel\u201d was revised during the Mississippi constitutional convention of 1832 to provide that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have a right to be heard by himself or counsel, <em>or both. . </em>. .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.)

Nevertheless, sound policy reasons have been offered for not establishing an absolute right to hybrid representation. As one post<em>Faretta </em>court succinctly stated: \u201cThis rule recognizes that the conflicting interests of the accused and society involved in a criminal trial can be served only in an orderly proceeding. The trial judge must therefore have discretion to control the conduct of a trial to maintain dignity, decorum and orderly procedures; to avoid unnecessary delays; and to prevent the disruption of the judicial process by the accused\u2019s inept or disorderly self-representation.
