On May 24,1984, however, more than two weeks after he had been sentenced, the defendant filed a motion to withdraw his earlier plea of nolo contendere. The motion was denied by the court on May 30,1984. The defendant has appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere because the state\u2019s failure to provide exculpatory evidence nullified the voluntary and intelligent character of his plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">On June 20, 1983, at approximately 3:40 a.m., an employee at the Stratford transfer station arrived at work and discovered that two Mack trucks, each valued at $27,500, had been stolen. The Stratford police were immediately notified and given a description of each vehicle. Later, at approximately 6:30 a.m., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Stratford police were informed by the state police that Trooper Joseph Froehlich and another trooper had stopped these vehicles at approximately 12:35 a.m. and had issued summonses for equipment violations to the operators. The operator of one of the trucks identified himself with a New Jersey operator\u2019s license as the defendant, Reginald Martin, residing at 782 Ocean Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">On June 21, 1983, the Stratford police obtained a \u201cmugshot\u201d of the defendant from the Jersey City police department. On June 27, 1983, Froehlich was shown a photographic array containing nine color photographs of black males. He \u201cimmediately and without hesitation\u201d selected the defendant\u2019s photograph as depicting the truck operator who had earlier identified himself as Reginald Martin, and to whom he had issued a summons. The defendant was arrested in New Jersey on a fugitive from justice warrant and subsequently waived extradition to Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">On September 22,1983, the defendant, through counsel, filed a discovery motion which, inter alia, contained a general request for disclosure of exculpatory information or materials, citing General Statutes \u00a7 54-86c, Practice Book \u00a7 741 (1), and <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). This motion was granted by the court. After an arrest warrant for an alleged coparticipant in the truck thefts had been vacated because of a claimed incorrect police identification, the defendant filed a motion for supplemental disclosure to discover whether Froehlich had also identified the suspect who had been erroneously charged. This motion was denied without prejudice to its renewal at time of trial. The same ruling was made concerning the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress Froehlich\u2019s photographic identification of him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>ing </em>denial of the defendant\u2019s pro se motion to dismiss this case based on the state\u2019s failure to disclose the previously requested information concerning Froehlich, the defendant entered his plea of nolo contendere. This plea was accepted after the court properly canvassed the defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 711.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We begin our analysis with Practice Book \u00a7 720,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which specifically prohibits the withdrawal of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cafter the conclusion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>proceeding at which the sentence was imposed.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 720; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kiss, </em>3 Conn. App. 400, 488 A.2d 845 (1985). This section, restricting the authority of a court to permit withdrawal of a plea, is applicable to the defendant\u2019s May 24, 1984 motion to withdraw, which was filed fifteen days after the proceeding at which he was sentenced.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In spite of Practice Book \u00a7 720, the defendant asserts that our case law establishes an exception that permits a postsentencing attack on the \u201cvoluntary and intelligent character of his plea\u201d and allows withdrawal thereof if constitutional standards were not met when the court accepted the plea. We do not agree that the cases cited support the defendant\u2019s attempt to withdraw his plea in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">This court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983), allowed a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea after sentence had been imposed. In <em>Childree, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to, inter alia, larceny in the first degree. Id., 115. Because the court failed to apprise the defendant of an element critical to the larceny offense and the record did not indicate that the defendant\u2019s counsel had adequately explained the larceny charge to him, however, we held that his plea was not \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d made, in the sense that it did not constitute an intelligent admission that he had received \u201c \u2018real notice of the true nature of the charge against him, the first and most univer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>sally recognized requirement of due process.\u2019 \u201d Id., 121, quoting <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 645, 96 S. Ct. 2253, 49 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1976); <em>Smith v. O\u2019Grady, </em>312 U.S. 329, 334, 61 S. Ct. 572, 85 L. Ed. 859 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The defendant also relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-9), </em>36 Conn. Sup. 578, 421 A.2d 557 (1980), in which the Appellate Session of the Superior Court allowed the postsentencing withdrawal of a guilty plea that the trial court had accepted without explaining to the defendant that his plea operated as a waiver of his right to trial by jury and his right to confront witnesses. Again, as in <em>Childree, </em>it was clear from the record that the trial court had failed to advise the defendant that his plea constituted a waiver of some of his constitutionally protected rights. It was also significant in <em>Anonymous </em>that the state neither contested the fact that the taking of the plea was defective, nor objected to the defendant\u2019s postsentencing withdrawal. Id., 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In both <em>Childree </em>and <em>Anonymous </em>a defendant was allowed to withdraw his plea after sentence had been imposed. Superficially these cases appear to conflict with Practice Book \u00a7 720. In each case, however, it was clear on the record that the defendant's constitutional rights were violated by an improper canvass and a failure to advise the defendant of the consequences of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is governed by federal constitutional standards as well as state rules of practice. \u201cSeveral federal constitutional rights are involved in a waiver that takes place when a plea of guilty is entered in a state criminal trial. First, is the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination .... [s]econd, is the right to trial by jury . . . [t]hird, is the right to confront one\u2019s accusers.\u201d <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969). Further, under the Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>cut rules of practice, a trial judge must not accept a plea of nolo contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is voluntarily made under Practice Book \u00a7 712<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that the defendant fully understands the items enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 711. <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 357, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>170 Conn. 469, 473, 365 A.2d 1100 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bugbee, </em>161 Conn. 531, 533, 290 A.2d 332 (1971). The record clearly indicates that the defendant, Reginald Martin, was properly canvassed<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and completely understood his waiver of constitutional rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The defendant does not claim that the trial court failed to comply substantially with the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 711 or that the record fails to satisfy constitutional requirements for the acceptance of his plea. See <em>Boykin </em>v. Alabama, supra, 243. Indeed, he concedes that the canvass was proper. The defendant indicated that he had discussed his plea with his attorney and understood its ramifications. He was aware that a plea of nolo contendere was tantamount to a plea of guilty, and was cognizant of the agreed upon sentencing recommendation, which the court ultimately followed. Upon inquiry, the defendant\u2019s counsel said he knew of no reason why the court should not accept the plea. The trial court properly ruled, at the close of the canvass, that the defendant\u2019s plea was voluntary, made with full knowledge of the consequences and made with effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">It is in this fashion that <em>Childree </em>and <em>Anonymous </em>differ from the instant case. The records in those cases evidenced a clear constitutional deficiency in the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the plea. The defendant in this case merely raises an unsubstantiated claim that another suspect in the crime was misidentified by the same police officer who identified the defendant. He contends that the disclosure of such misidentification by the police officer who had identified him not only would be exculpatory, but would negate the voluntary nature of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">It is important to note that the defendant could have acquired this claimed exculpatory evidence had he pursued his earlier motions for disclosure of this information and to suppress Froehlich\u2019s identification of him. He chose, however, not to pursue these avenues and instead entered a plea of nolo contendere. The defendant clearly understood his right to renew his motions for further disclosure and for a suppression hearing. His \u201cintentional relinquishment\u201d of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>rights functioned as a waiver. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shockley, </em>188 Conn. 697, 706, 453 A.2d 441 (1982); <em>Talton </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>171 Conn. 378, 385-86, 370 A.2d 965 (1976). A plea of nolo contendere is a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects, including federal constitutional claims, which might otherwise be raised by way of defense, appeal or collateral attack. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Warden of Attica State Prison, </em>381 F.2d 209, 212 (2d Cir. 1967); <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>161 Conn. 337, 343, 288 A.2d 58 (1971), aff'd, 406 U.S. 250, 92 S. Ct. 1551, 32 L. Ed. 2d 45, reh. denied, 407 U.S. 934, 92 S. Ct. 2464, 32 L. Ed. 2d 817 (1972); <em>Consiglio </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>160 Conn. 151, 166, 276 A.2d 773 (1970).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">We affirm the lower court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea because of its lack of timeliness, as provided by Practice Book \u00a7 720, and because his plea, on the record, was knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We do not reach the question whether evidence of the information concerning the claimed misidentification of an accomplice by Froehlich would vitiate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>defendant\u2019s plea on the ground that his plea was not sufficiently knowledgeable in the absence of such disclosure. In order to determine whether or not the information sought was truly exculpatory, evidence would be required as to the claimed erroneous identification. Additional evidence would be required concerning the defendant\u2019s decision to forego renewal of his motions and to enter a nolo contendere plea. Such inquiries are better pursued, as we have recently held in cases concerning inadequacy of counsel, by habeas corpus proceedings. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>196 Conn. 567, 494 A.2d 570 (1985); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>192 Conn. 383, 393, 472 A.2d 759 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasher, </em>190 Conn. 259, 460 A.2d 970 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>186 Conn. 574, 442 A.2d 1335 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-U9. larceny defined.

General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a provides that a defendant may enter a plea of nolo contendere, conditional on the right to take an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress or motion to dismiss when based on an unreasonable search and seizure. A plea of nolo contendere under this section does not constitute a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 50 n.4, 454 A.2d 266 (1983). This statute, of course, is not applicable to the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\"> We note that in federal practice a defendant who desires to withdraw his plea after sentence has been imposed must seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, while withdrawal prior to sentencing is permitted for \u201cany fair and just reason.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 32 (d). Under the statute referred to by the rule, the defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s acceptance of his plea constituted \u201ca fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice,\u201d or \u201can omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 426, 82 S.
