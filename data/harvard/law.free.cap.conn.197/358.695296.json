Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGr\">This appeal arises from the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty in this matter. We address the critical issue of whether, under our rules of practice, the failure of the trial court, prior to accepting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>defendant\u2019s plea, to advise him of the maximum possible sentence to which he would be exposed, constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The salient facts are as follows. On February 11, 1981, the defendant was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Wesley Jackson. At approximately 2 p.m., police officers stopped the vehicle to check Jackson\u2019s motor vehicle license. During the stop and ensuing investigation, the police found an unregistered .38 caliber revolver in the car. The defendant later admitted that the gun was in his possession and that the driver, Jackson, had had no knowledge of it. On July 14,1981, the defendant pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to a charge of carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">At the hearing during which the defendant entered his guilty plea, the trial court, <em>Norcott, J., </em>canvassed the defendant, who was represented by counsel, as to the nature of his plea. See Practice Book \u00a7 711.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response to the court\u2019s inquiries, the defendant stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>that his plea was voluntary and that he understood he was waiving his rights to a jury trial, to remain silent, and not to incriminate himself. Further, the defendant acknowledged that he was satisfied with the advice of his attorney, that he was pleading guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine, and that he understood that the state was not recommending a sentence. The defendant also stated that he understood and agreed with the state\u2019s version of the facts in this case. Before accepting the plea, however, the trial court did not inform the defendant of the maximum possible penalty for the offense to which he pleaded guilty, and it also failed to elicit expressly a waiver of his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine his accusers.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Thereafter, on September 22, 1982, the defendant, who had not yet been sentenced, appeared in court on a written motion to withdraw his guilty plea. As a ground for withdrawing the plea, the defense counsel cited the failure to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 711 and argued that the court had failed to inform the defendant of the maximum possible sentence for the offense. After a hearing, the trial court, <em>Ckemauskas, J., </em>denied the motion to withdraw the plea, stating that the defendant had been \u201cmade fully aware of everything involved here.\u201d The defendant then took an exception. The trial court, <em>Gray, J., </em>sentenced the defendant on October 8, 1982, to imprisonment for a term of five years, suspended after three years, with five years of probation and a one thousand dollar fine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying the motion to withdraw his plea in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the court failed in its canvass (1) to advise him of the maximum possible penalty for the offense to which he pleaded guilty, and (2) to elicit an express waiver from him of his federal constitutional right to confront and cross-examine his accusers. We agree with the defendant that it was reversible error to deny his motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u201cAfter a guilty plea is accepted but before the imposition of sentence the court is obligated [under Practice Book \u00a7 720<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] to permit withdrawal upon proof of one of the grounds in \u00a7 721.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>182 Conn. 176, 185, 438 A.2d 46 (1980); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasher, </em>190 Conn. 259, 265, 460 A.2d 970 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Deboben, </em>187 Conn. 469, 474, 446 A.2d 828 (1982). One of these grounds is that \u201c[t]he plea was accepted without substantial compliance with Sec. 711.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 721 (1); see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 357, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The question here is whether the trial court\u2019s failure to inform the defendant of the maximum possible sentence to which his plea exposed him fell below the standard that constitutes \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with \u00a7711.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Under our rules of practice, a trial judge must not accept a plea of guilty \u201cwithout first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is voluntarily made under Practice Book \u00a7 712 and that the defendant fully understands the items enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 711.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>197 Conn. 17, 23, 495 A.2d 1028 (1985). \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 711 was promulgated to ensure that such guilty pleas are made voluntarily and with full knowledge of the waiver of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Suggs, </em>194 Conn. 223, 226, 478 A.2d 1008 (1984). In pertinent part Practice Book \u00a7 711 requires that \u201c[t]he judicial authority shall not accept the plea without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that he fully understands . . . (4) The maximum possible sentence on the charge, including, if there are several charges, the maximum sentence possible from consecutive sentences and including, when applicable, the fact that a different or additional punishment may be authorized by reason of a previous conviction . . . .\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The state does not dispute the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court failed to comply with subsection 4 of Practice Book \u00a7 711 in that the defendant was not informed of the maximum possible penalty for the crime charged. Rather, the state argues that, because the right to be informed of the maximum possible penalty for the crime charged is of nonconstitutional dimension, to constitute reversible error the defendant must demonstrate that he would have pleaded differently had the court fully complied with Practice Book \u00a7 711. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>We have stated that Practice Book \u00a7 711 (4) is an express recognition \u201c[t]hat the defendant\u2019s awareness of the maximum sentence possible is an <em>essential </em>factor in determining whether to plead guilty . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 126, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983). \u201cThe length of time a defendant may have to spend in prison is <em>clearly crucial </em>to a decision of whether or not to plead guilty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>176 Conn. 7, 9-10, 404 A.2d 871 (1978). Accordingly, Practice Book \u00a7 711 (4) <em>\u201crequire[s] </em>that the court determine that the defendant \u2018fully understands\u2019 those consequences.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>193 Conn. 144, 155 n.9, 476 A.2d 543 (1984); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-9), </em>36 Conn. Sup. 578, 580, 421 A.2d 557 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u201cThe rules of statutory construction apply with equal force to Practice Book rules. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>183 Conn. 520, 521, 441 A.2d 41 (1981). \u2018Where the meaning of a statute [or rule] is plain and unambiguous, the enactment speaks for itself and there is no occasion to construe it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Trantolo, </em>192 Conn. 15, 22, 470 A.2d 228 (1984), quoting <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>177 Conn. 68, 73, 411 A.2d 28 (1979). The requirements of the rule are clear. We do not mandate that a trial court, in making the determinations required by \u00a7 711, speak in the very words of that rule because \u201c[m]atters of reality, and not mere ritual, should be controlling.\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 467-68 n.20, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969), quoting <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 F.2d 16, 17 (6th Cir. 1968). In discharging its obligations under \u00a7 711, the court\u2019s inquiries need not be so restricted that \u201cthe [j]udge [must] mount the bench with a script in his hand\u201d; <em>Sappington </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 F.2d 1378, 1380 (8th Cir. 1972); and although \u201cnot a script, perhaps, but [with] some sort of checklist, as a prompter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>so that whatever form the dialogue takes, all of the necessary lines will be delivered.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fels, </em>599 F.2d 142, 149 n.6 (7th Cir. 1979). Unfortunately, all the \u201cnecessary lines\u201d required by \u00a7 711 were not delivered so as to make for conformity with the rule. It matters not that \u00a7 711 incorporates nonconstitutional as well as constitutional rights; the rule requires both be addressed. There was not on this record, as the state suggests, substantial compliance with \u00a7 711 because of the trial court\u2019s failure to address \u00a7 711 (4) at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In the present case, the record clearly discloses that the trial court accepted the defendant\u2019s plea without first determining that the defendant was aware of and understood the maximum possible sentence to which he was exposed. The plea was therefore accepted in contravention of Practice Book \u00a7 711 (4); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>192 Conn. 37, 45, 470 A.2d 688 (1984); the requirements of which we have previously recognized as both \u201cclearly crucial\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra; and \u201can essential factor\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>supra; to an accused\u2019s grave decision whether to plead guilty to any charged offense. In addition, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant had actual knowledge of the maximum possible consequences of his plea. <em>See D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>568 F.2d 1302, 1306 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 944, 98 S. Ct. 2846, 56 L. Ed. 2d 785 (1978); Bond, Plea Bargaining and Guilty Pleas (2d Ed. 1982) \u00a7 3.5 (b). The record, thus, in addition to disclosing the lack of any inquiry concerning the maximum possible sentence, is barren of any indication that this defendant was aware of, much less fully understood; see <em>D'Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-9), </em>supra; the maximum potential punishment to which his plea exposed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">To satisfy the requisites of Practice Book \u00a7 711 it is necessary to demonstrate on the record that a plea is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>entered with the defendant\u2019s full understanding. If he did not fully understand the consequences of his plea, then grave questions arise pertaining to the voluntary nature of the plea and consequently its constitutional validity. Courts have so held where a defendant\u2019s awareness of the punishment or consequences is not evident from the record when the plea is taken. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>121 Ariz. 328, 590 P.2d 444 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kulp, </em>476 Pa. 358, 382 A.2d 1209 (1978); <em>In re Vensel, </em>88 Wash. 2d 552, 564 P.2d 326 (1977). A guilty plea must be voluntary in every respect. It differs in purpose and effect from an extrajudicial confession or admission because the plea by itself is a conviction and is the equivalent of a jury verdict of guilty. <em>Machibroda </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U.S. 487, 82 S. Ct. 510, 7 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1962); <em>State </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>170 Conn. 469, 365 A.2d 1100 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Linsner, </em>105 Ariz. 488, 467 P.2d 238 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In this case, then, the lack of substantial compliance with \u00a7 711 inheres in the trial court\u2019s failure to fulfill its duty as that rule requires.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> One court has said that \u201c[t]he maximum possible sentence provided by law for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>conviction of the offense charged is the most \u2018important consequence of the plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wells </em>v. <em>State, </em>396 A.2d 161, 162 (Del. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">On these facts, therefore, we hold that the trial court\u2019s failure to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea for lack of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with \u00a7 711 was reversible error. It is therefore unnecessary for us to address the defendant\u2019s other claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to permit the defendant to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The more recent better reasoned opinions recognize, however, that a trial court\u2019s failure to inform the defendant prior to plea of the maximum possible sentence constitutes valid grounds for withdrawal of that plea. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Palter, </em>575 F.2d 1050 (2d Cir. 1978); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>State, </em>291 Ala. 83, 277 So. 2d 896 (1973); <em>Pratte </em>v. <em>State, </em>448 So. 2d 502 (Ala. Crim. App. 1984); <em>Wells </em>v. <em>State, </em>396 A.2d 161 (Del. 1978); <em>Avery </em>v. <em>State, </em>463 N.E.2d 1088 (Ind. 1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kulp, </em>476 Pa. 358, 382 A.2d 1209 (1978); see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>390 Mass. 714, 459 N.E.2d 787 (1984); <em>People </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>414 Mich. 896, 323 N.W.2d 4 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>213 Neb. 897, 331 N.W.2d 818 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>94 Wash. 2d 1, 614 P.2d 164 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>93 Wash. 2d 301, 609 P.2d 1353 (1980). Some cases have been remanded for a hearing on whether the defendant actually knew of the maximum sentence possibilities. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>121 Ariz. 328, 590 P.2d 444 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>326 N.W.2d 316 (Iowa 1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fischer, </em>218 Neb. 678, 357 N.W.2d 477 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Curnyn, </em>202 Neb. 135, 274 N.W.2d 157 (1979); <em>In re Vensel, </em>88 Wash. 2d 552, 564 P.2d 326 (1977). Of course, an on-the-record showing that the defendant has been informed of the potential maximum sentence vitiates a challenge on these grounds. See <em>Durbin </em>v. <em>State, </em>56 Md. App. 442, 446, 468 A.2d 145 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>217 Neb. 417, 422, 350 N.W.2d 521 (1984); <em>In re Hall, </em>143 Vt. 590, 595, 469 A.2d 756 (1983). On the other hand, the court in one jurisdiction that seemed to denigrate claims of this nature, nevertheless, recognized that informing the defendant of the maximum potential sentence represents the better practice. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Trott, </em>338 N.W.2d 248, 253 (Minn. 1983); see generally Bond, Plea Bargaining and Guilty Pleas (2d Ed. 1982) \u00a7 3.5 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The following transpired when the court conducted the original plea canvass in this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. James, you have plead [sic] guilty to a felony and I am going to ask you a few questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u201cHave you discussed this plea with your attorney, Mr. Kaplan?</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u201cMr. James: Yes, I have.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">\u201cThe Court: Are you satisfied with the advice he has given you?</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">\u201cMr. James: Yes, I am.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">\u201cThe Court: Are you pleading guilty voluntarily and for no other reason?</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">\u201cMr. James: Yes, I am.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">\u201cThe Court: Do you understand by entering this plea of guilty, you are waiving your right to a jury trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">\u201cMr. James: Yes, I am.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">\u201cThe Court: Do you realize you are giving up your right of silence and privilege against self-incrimination?</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">\u201cMr. James: Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-17\">\u201cThe Court: Do you understand the recommendation in this case is that, in fact, there will not be a recommendation and that sentencing will be left up to be based on the pre-sentence investigation report?

App. 260, 263, 470 A.2d 1234 (1984); see Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 711 through 713. Similarly, the rules of practice permit a withdrawal of a plea of guilty upon certain specified grounds. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 720 through 722. One of these grounds is the lack of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with \u00a7 711. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasher, </em>190 Conn. 259, 460 A.2d 970 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S.

In the state court systems, there appears to be a division of authority as to whether the failure to inform of the maximum potential penalty constitutes automatic reversible error. 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law \u00a7 476. Because in this matter our rules express a \u201csubstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>tial compliance\u201d standard; Practice Book \u00a7 721 (1); we must, of course, decide the defendant\u2019s practice book claim on that ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
