He filed a motion to suppress<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a motion to dismiss,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming in each that his rights were violated under both the United States and the Connecticut constitutions. In his motion to suppress, he sought the suppression of items seized from his person as having been taken without a warrant or without probable cause or pursuant to an unlawful arrest. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted both motions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state, with the permission of the trial court, has appealed. On appeal, the state claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the trial court erred (1) in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on its determination that the police lacked probable cause to arrest when they arrested the defendant, and (2) in granting the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">At the outset, we turn to the state\u2019s threshold claim that the issue of \u201cprobable cause\u201d in this appeal is to be determined solely by the \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d analysis set out in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, reh. denied, 463 U.S. 1237, 104 S. Ct. 33, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1453 (1983), rather than by the stricter two-prong analysis of the Aguilar-Spinelli<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> cases which predated Gates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The defendant specifically premised his trial court motions upon the Connecticut as well as the United States constitutions. The trial court, without stating the precise bases of its decision in granting suppression and dismissal, granted the defendant\u2019s motions. We are therefore entitled to infer that the trial court acted in favor of all the defendant\u2019s claims as they were asserted in his motions, especially when the trial court\u2019s decision, which was explicated in terms of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>analysis, had been based on the settled substantive law of this state before the <em>Gates </em>decision. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Grayton, </em>163 Conn. 104, 106, 302 A.2d 246, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1045, 93 S. Ct. 542, 34 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1972). On appeal, the state seeks to overturn the trial court\u2019s decision and, in doing so, argues in its brief that <em>\u201cGates </em>in no way [has] altered an individual\u2019s <em>ultimate </em>right not to be searched or seized in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the absence of probable cause. United States Constitution, Fourth Amendment; Connecticut Constitution, article I \u00a7 7.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In his brief, the defendant asserts the Connecticut constitution\u2019s preference for searches pursuant to a warrant and also argues that his motions below were predicated on both the United States and Connecticut constitutions. We conclude that the probable cause issue is properly before us under both the United States and Connecticut constitutions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 566-73, 482 A.2d 300 (1984) <em>(Healey, J., </em>dissenting), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We note that in none of our three earlier decisions in which we referred to <em>Gates </em>did any of the defendants claim that the respective circumstances failed to constitute probable cause under the Connecticut constitution. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>195 Conn. 505, 488 A.2d 1256 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gasparro, </em>194 Conn. 96, 480 A.2d 509 (1984). It is our view in this warrantless arrest and search case that the trial court\u2019s decision was correct under either the <em>Gates </em>\u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d analysis or the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\"><em>Gates, </em>of course, involved an application for a warrant, and it is crucial to underscore the fact that the <em>Gates </em>court reiterated that \u201cafter-the-fact scrutiny by courts of the sufficiency of an affidavit should not take the form of <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 236. Rather, a reviewing court should pay \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause. Id., citing <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 419, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969). In the same fashion, we do not attempt such de novo review where there has been a trial court determination that probable cause does <em>not </em>exist. In deciding whether probable cause does or does not exist, \u201c[t]he trier of the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>determines with finality the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony. \u2018We cannot retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Penland, </em>174 Conn. 153, 157-58, 384 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 436 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 2237, 56 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1978). This axiom is significant because the trier of fact, which in such a suppression hearing is the trial court, first determines the facts; then the trial court ultimately determines whether those facts it found constitute probable cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The former is obviously a fact-bound determination, while the latter is at the very least a mixed question of fact and law. See <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 96, 85 S. Ct. 223, 13 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">It is clear that the constitutional validity of the search in this case is predicated upon the constitutional validity of the arrest, which was constitutionally valid only if at the time the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant. See <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 91; <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-76, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879, reh. denied, 338 U.S. 839, 70 S. Ct. 31, 94 L. Ed. 513 (1949). \u201cThe rule of probable cause is a practical, nontechnical conception affording the best compromise that has been found for accommodating . . . often opposing interests. Requiring more would unduly hamper law enforcement. To allow less would be to leave law-abiding citizens at the mercy of the officers\u2019 whim or caprice.\u201d <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Certain observations concerning <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, should properly be made here. The <em>Gates </em>deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sion dismantled and abandoned the stricter \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>in that it held that the sufficiency of an affidavit that relies on a confidential informant depends on \u201cthe totality-of-the-circumstances\u201d test. While the <em>Gates </em>court reiterated the preference for search warrants, it seems fairly probable that the <em>Gates </em>test may be applied in fourth amendment cases to warrantless searches and seizures. See 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment (1985 Sup.) \u00a7 3.1, p. 172. Despite the abandonment of the two-pronged test of <em>AguilarSpinelli </em>in fourth amendment cases, the <em>Gates </em>court said that it \u201cintended neither a rigid compartmentalization of the inquiries into an informant\u2019s \u2018veracity,\u2019 \u2018reliability,\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge,\u2019 nor that these inquiries be elaborate exegeses of an informant\u2019s tip\u201d; it did emphasize that \u201c[rjather, we required only that <em>some </em>facts bearing on two particular issues be provided to the magistrate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 231 n.6. Thus, the \u201cveracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d issues are still viable though in the context of the less strict \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d analysis for the existence of probable cause. The <em>Gates </em>court agreed with the Illinois Supreme Court \u201cthat an informant\u2019s \u2018veracity,\u2019 \u2018reliability,\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 are <em>all highly relevant </em>in determining the value of his report\u201d (emphasis added) but it did not agree \u201cthat these elements should be understood as entirely separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 230. Rather, as the <em>Gates </em>court set out, \u201cthey should be understood simply as closely intertwined issues that may usefully illuminate the commonsense, practical question whether there is \u2018probable cause\u2019 to believe that contraband or evidence is located in a particular place.\u201d Id. Under Gates, \u201cthe duty of the reviewing court is simply to ensure that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>magistrate had a \u2018substantial basis for . . . conclud[ing]\u2019 that probable cause existed.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 238-39; <em>see Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>466 U.S. 727, 733, 104 S. Ct. 2085, 80 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1984). However, in rejecting the stricter test, the <em>Gates </em>court attempted to characterize its new approach as an \u201canalysis that traditionally has informed probable-cause determinations.\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 238. In rejecting the \u201cindependent status\u201d of the two-pronged <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, the informant\u2019s \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201creliability\u201d and his \u201cbasis of knowledge,\u201d the <em>Gates </em>court said that they were \u201cbetter understood as relevant considerations in the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis that traditionally has guided probable-cause determinations: a deficiency in one may be compensated for, in determining the overall reliability of a tip, by a strong showing as to the other, or by some other indicia of reliability.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 233. According to the <em>Gates </em>court, the totality of the circumstances analysis was \u201cfar more consistent with our prior treatment of probable cause than is any rigid demand that specific \u2018tests\u2019 be satisfied by every informant\u2019s tip.\u201d Id., 230-31. The probable cause standard is a \u201cpractical, nontechnical conception,\u201d it deals with \u201cprobabilities,\u201d and \u201c \u2018[t]hese are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u2019 \u201d Id., 231, quoting <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 175-76. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>thermore, \u201c \u2018the [probable cause] process does not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities\u2019 \u201d and \u201cprobable cause is a fluid concept \u2014 turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts \u2014 not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.\u201d Id., 231-32. The court stressed that \u201c[o]ur decisions applying the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis outlined above have consistently recognized the value of corroboration of details of an informant\u2019s tip by independent police work.\u201d Id., 241. The <em>Gates </em>court referred with approval to <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 257, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1960), where \u201c[w]e [said] that even in making a warrantless arrest an officer \u2018may rely upon information received through an informant, rather than upon his direct observations,' so long as the informant\u2019s statement is reasonably corroborated by other matters within the officer\u2019s knowledge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 242, quoting <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">While the <em>Gates </em>court laid down the totality of circumstances analysis, it did express both the preference for warrants and the deference to be given by appellate courts to determinations of probable cause. De novo appellate probable cause determination was specifically eschewed, and these admonitions were repeated in <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>supra. With this background, we consider whether the trial court correctly determined that the state had <em>not </em>demonstrated the existence of probable cause in this warrantless arrest case.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">It would appear that on November 8, 1982, Officer Joseph Howard had been a New Haven police officer for nearly nine years. At that time, he had been working for about a year and one-half with a city street crime unit whose primary function was narcotics enforcement. He had known the defendant Kimbro for more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>than five years, had arrested him in the past,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and knew him to be a convicted felon recently released from prison. Over \u201capproximately\u201d two weeks before November 8, 1982, Howard had observed the defendant on Dixwell Avenue near Lake Place in New Haven \u201cat least half a dozen times,\u201d and felt that it was unusual during periods of \u201cinclement weather, cold weather\u201d that he saw the defendant \u201cloitering for extended periods of time\u201d at that location. Howard said that \u201cDixwell [Avenue] and Lake Place is an area that we patrol . . . quite frequently . . . [and] we would drive through the area in search of wanted persons or illegal activity and during such travels I did note his presence there on those aforementioned occasions.\u201d He said that he knew \u201cone of the [defendant\u2019s] home addresses,\u201d which was about two to three miles away, and he also said that he was not aware that the defendant worked at a garage across the street from the corner on which the November 8,1982 arrest took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Howard testified that as the result of a telephone call<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> from \u201ca known reliable informant,\u201d approximately five to ten minutes before the defendant\u2019s actual arrest, he and two other officers<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> proceeded to Dixwell Avenue and Lake Place. He believed that the informant, who had been a paid police informant, was reliable because information given in the past by him \u201chad resulted in the apprehension of wanted felons . . . and one narcotics arrest,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> although he was not aware of any con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>victions resulting from any of those instances. Howard had known this informant for several months.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">With reference to what Howard testified the informant told him, the trial court in its oral decision said that \u201cwhat impressed me also was the fact that Officer Howard couldn\u2019t really tell exactly what the informant had told him and there were no details involved.\u201d The court felt that it was important as to \u201cwhat weight should [be given] to Officer Howard\u2019s testimony as to the credibility or reliability of the informant. I have to find that the informant was credible or reliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Such matters are for the trier of fact and not for appellate review. In cases involving constitutional safeguards, as this did, in passing upon the trial court\u2019s determination on the issue of probable cause, it is best we remember that we do not sit \u201c \u2018as in <em>nisi prius,\u2019 </em>\u201d and, therefore, deference is due the trial court\u2019s decision of that issue. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ricci, </em>472 A.2d 291, 298 (R.I. 1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>434 A.2d 257, 264 (R.I. 1981); see <em>Culombe </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>367 U.S. 568, 81 S. Ct. 1860, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1037 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The trial court also stated that \u201cthere are no circumstances in this case corroborating the informant, except the fact that he [the defendant] was at this particular comer when the police arrived there.\u201d This last circumstance the trial court did not consider \u201cparamount,\u201d because Howard had seen the defendant there a half dozen times recently; moreover, the defendant worked in that area. Noting the lack of evidence of any prior arrests or convictions involving narcotics of Kimbro, the court attached \u201cno indication of anything\u201d to the circumstance that the defendant merely \u201cbacked away\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>when Howard approached him. It concluded that there were \u201cinsufficient circumstances for the determination that the informant was credible or that his information was reliable.\u201d The \u201creliability\u201d necessary for the existence of probable cause to arrest applies as much to the information provided as to the informant who provides it. <em>Cioci </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>99 R.I. 308, 313, 207 A.2d 300 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The transcript also discloses that Howard testified on direct that the informant told him that the defendant was on Dixwell Avenue near Lake Place and \u201cwas in possession of and offering for sale what the defendant purported to be cocaine.\u201d While he did not recall the \u201cexact verbiage [of the informant,] the conversation was that Mr. Kimbro was in possession of it, that he was offering it for sale on the street and that the informant had seen the package that was offered, that was purported to be cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">On cross-examination Howard admitted that the informant did not tell him that he (the informant) \u201chad seen narcotics on the defendant\u201d but \u201cmerely packages of what the defendant was purporting to be cocaine.\u201d He also said at first that the informant did not tell him he had seen an actual sale. Asked how the informant \u201cknew\u201d that the defendant \u201cwas in fact purporting to have cocaine,\u201d Howard replied that the informant overheard \u201cthe defendant purport that the package of substance was cocaine.\u201d He was asked again if the informant told him whether he had seen an actual sale. After a colloquy the court said that \u201cone of the problems with this hearing is that . . . if the officer would just <em>say </em>what he said instead of trying to <em>paraphrase </em>what he said.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court thereupon instructed the officer to do so. Howard then said the informant did not know it was cocaine except that he \u201coverheard\u201d and \u201cobserved the packages being displayed and the offer of the purported cocaine for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>sale.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He thereafter repeated that the informant had not told him that he had seen a drug sale. During this portion of the cross-examination the court itself asked the officer questions and indicated that the testimony was \u201cconfusing.\u201d Howard was also asked, based on his \u201cobservation\u201d of the defendant over the period of two weeks in the same area, whether he had ever observed the defendant in a drug transaction. He said that \u201cI could have and never even known it\u201d because \u201csmall objects\u201d are involved in such a transaction. Upon arriving at the location where the defendant was standing, Howard, who had not observed any drug <em>activity, first </em>placed the defendant under arrest and <em>then </em>searched him pursuant to the arrest. That search disclosed several packages, a sample of which was later found to include cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We have already noted that this case, unlike <em>Gates, </em>involves a warrantless arrest and search.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While we endorse the <em>Gates </em>majority\u2019s preference for warrants, we must recognize that, while the state makes no such claim in this case, it is not always reasonably practicable to get a warrant. The state instead suggests that this is a conventional type of case with probable cause evident under <em>Gates, </em>thus justifying the warrantless arrest and the resulting search and seizure. Where, in warrantless arrests or searches, the police involved, in effect, act as their own magistrate in the determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>tion of the existence of probable cause, obviously fourth amendment protections still apply. See 1 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure (1984) \u00a7 3.3, p. 185. That amendment \u201c \u2018protects all, those suspected or known to be offenders as well as the innocent . . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 33, 83 S. Ct. 1623, 10 L. Ed. 2d 726 (1963). It is well to remember that, unlike some other constitutional rights, there is no realistic way that an innocent person can invoke advance protection from unconstitutional searches and seizures, but rather the choice is either to submit to whatever the governmental authority undertakes or to resist at a possibly greater risk. See <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 182, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879, reh. denied, 338 U.S. 839, 70 S. Ct. 31, 94 L. Ed. 513 (1949) (Jackson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In this case, the informant himself was the source of the information upon which the police acted. The \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201creliability\u201d of this informant was of great concern to the trial court. The paid informant\u2019s track record has been set out; there were prior arrests of \u201cwanted felons,\u201d but the one and only prior narcotics arrest was a \u201cdropsy\u201d case. No convictions had resulted from any information he had conveyed. He gave no information of any prior conduct of the defendant involving narcotics, nor did the police, singly or collectively, know of or suspect any prior conduct of the defendant with narcotics.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This is true although he had been the subject of police observation for at least two weeks at that area where he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">There is little doubt that the veracity of an informant is enhanced where he makes a statement under oath or where his information is corroborated by police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>observation, especially where the informant\u2019s information is in some detail. This police corroboration, of course, is, as in the cases where there is a warrant, that which results from prior independent police investigation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Canestri, </em>518 F.2d 269, 272 (2d Cir. 1975); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>162 Conn. 440, 448, 294 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 870, 93 S. Ct. 198, 34 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1972) (\u201c[w]here information from different sources dovetails, corroboration exists\u201d). In determining the reliability of information provided by an informant, we have relied upon the reputation or past criminal behavior of the suspect as a practical consideration. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>185 Conn. 104, 115, 440 A.2d 841 (1981). There is no evidence in this record that this informant knew anything of the defendant\u2019s reputation or past criminal behavior. Howard, of course, knew of the defendant\u2019s release from prison, but an officer\u2019s knowledge of the reputation of a suspect is not alone enough to constitute probable cause. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Canestri, </em>supra, 272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In this case, the informant indicated what he saw of this defendant\u2019s conduct prior to informing the police. We, as an appellate court, should not evince a grudging attitude toward the trial court\u2019s ultimate assessment of the evidence before it, when that assessment is reasonably supportable on the credible evidence. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D; see <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>196 Conn. 359, 377-78, 493 A.2d 193 (1985). In the present case the trial court was not indulging in the hyper-technicality which <em>Gates </em>disapproves, but, rather, as was evident from the transcript, it was sifting and evaluating the oral evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">What may be called the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d circumstance in the totality of circumstances discloses that there was no evidence that this informant bought or even saw the alleged narcotics. We say this aware that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>whatever a person knowingly exposes is not constitutionally protected from observation. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>624 F.2d 95, 100 (10th Cir. 1980); see <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 363, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967) (White, J., concurring). In this case, given the complete lack of any independent police investigation or information tending to corroborate the informant\u2019s information, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that probable cause was not demonstrated is supported in this record. Furthermore, although the trial court properly employed the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, what we have pointed out clearly demonstrated that probable cause could not exist even under the <em>Gates </em>totality of the circumstances test.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In light of our conclusion that even under the <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates </em>approach the motion to suppress was properly granted, we ordinarily need say no more. In this case, however, the defendant also asserted the protection of the Connecticut constitution in his motion to suppress. We thus address this claim separately in accordance with the decision of <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S. Ct. 3469, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1201 (1983). In turning to article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we must decide whether that provision affords more substantive protection to citizens than does the fourth amendment to the federal constitution in the determination of probable cause. We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Although we have not previously determined this particular question, we have invoked our constitution in the protection of individual rights. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985); <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>194 Conn. 510, 481 A.2d 1084 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>191 Conn. 37, 463 A.2d 573 (1983); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 376 A.2d 359 (1977). We clearly have the power to construe the Connecticut constitution in accordance with our particular analysis of the specific right in issue.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Only recently we have said that \u201c[f]ederal law, whether based upon statute or constitution, establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 57, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984). In taking this position we recognize, as we must, the authority of the United States Supreme Court to act as the final arbiter of controversies arising under the United States constitution. This was established early in the history of our republic. See <em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 5 L. Ed. 257 (1821) (authority to review state criminal cases); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hunter\u2019s Lessee, </em>14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 4 L. Ed. 97 (1816) (authority to review state civil cases). We also recognize, and the United States Supreme Court has acknowledged, that such authority is limited when the federal courts undertake to review state court decisions construing state law. In <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra, 1041, Justice O\u2019Connor, writing for the majority, said: \u201cIf the state court decision indicates clearly and expressly that it is alternatively based on bona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds, we, of course, will not undertake to review the decision.\u201d In construing article first, \u00a7 7, of our constitution in this case, we recognize that protections under our constitution may be afforded in accordance with <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long, </em>supra. It appears settled that federal court decisions do not limit the rights of state courts to afford greater rights than under the federal constitution. See, e.g., <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>447 U.S. 74, 81, 100 S. Ct. 2035, 64 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1980); <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Hass, </em>420 U.S. 714, 719, 95 S. Ct. 1215, 43 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1975); see also Brennan, \u201cState Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights,\u201d 90 Harv. L. Rev. 489 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The determination of \u201cprobable cause\u201d under article first, \u00a7 7, is not to be made under the \u201cfluid\u201d concept of that term as set out in <em>Gates, </em>but rather, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the established principles developed in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 476 N.E.2d 548 (1985) (after remand); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>102 Wash. 2d 432, 688 P.2d 136 (1984). Citation is not necessary to demonstrate this court\u2019s invocation over the years of the <em>AguilarSpinelli </em>test, which we submit has not been applied hypertechnically.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We eschew the amorphous standard of Gates<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in passing upon article first, \u00a7 7, interpretation and apply the more specific standards of <em>the Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, as did the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on remand from the United States Supreme Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>supra.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, with its two prongs of \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201creliability\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge,\u201d offers a practical and independent test under our con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>stitution that predictably guides the conduct of all concerned, including magistrates and law enforcement officials, in the determination of probable cause. This test protects individual rights without disadvantaging law enforcement. It is salutary to recall, as Justice Brennan has said, that \u201cone of the strengths of our federal system is that it provides a double source of protection for the rights of our citizens.\u201d Brennan, supra, 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The circumstances relevant to the issue of probable cause in this case have been set forth earlier in this opinion. As we have demonstrated above, the trial court made no piecemeal analysis of the testimony in applying the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test in this case. It concluded that there were \u201cinsufficient circumstances for the determination that the informant was credible or that his information was reliable.\u201d The trial judge said that he did not have \u201cany real evidence here about the reliability of this informant and the fact they made one narcotics arrest [the dropsy case] does not give me that evidence of reliability.\u201d Additionally, the trial court pointed out that \u201cthere are no circumstances in this case corroborating the informant, except the fact that he [the defendant] was at this particular corner when the police arrived there.\u201d Actually, the corroboration to which the court referred should have been corroboration existing prior to that time when the police decided to make the arrest and after an evaluation of the informant\u2019s information with whatever independent police information known to them at that time. As pointed out, the police had absolutely no self-verifying detail in their collective knowledge to add to the informant\u2019s information. Even though they had been observing him for about two weeks and knew he was recently released from prison, they had, on this record, no knowledge of any prior narcotics history of any sort of this defendant. The deference to be given a finding of probable cause should, even-handedly, not be diluted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>in evaluating a trial court\u2019s finding of no probable cause. This includes the trial court\u2019s careful evaluation of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">While it is not crucial in this warrantless arrest and seizure case, we note the rationale of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 109, 85 S. Ct. 741, 13 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1965), that \u201cdoubtful or marginal cases . . . should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\u201d The real question is not \u201cwhether there was a warrant or whether there was time to get one, but whether there was probable cause for the arrest.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 417, 96 S. Ct. 820, 46 L. Ed. 2d 598, reh. denied, 424 U.S. 979, 96 S. Ct. 1488, 47 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1976). \u201cThere is no more basic constitutional rule in the Fourth Amendment area than that which makes a warrantless search unreasonable except in a few \u2018jealously and carefully drawn\u2019 exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 427 (Powell, J., concurring). This clearly applies under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. The common sense application of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test in this case by the trial court in its determination that there was not probable cause was not clearly erroneous, and the result reached under that test was constitutionally mandated under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In this opinion Dannehy and Santaniello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-5\"> \u201cMOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u201cPursuant to Practice Book Section 821 the Defendant in the above-entitled matter respectfully requests the Court to Suppress all items seized from the person of the Defendant as such search was conducted: (a) without a warrant, or (b) without probable cause to search, or (c) pursuant to an unlawful arrest, in violation of Article 1, Section 8 of the Connecticut Constitution and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress actually cites \u201cArticle 1, Section 8 of the Connecticut Constitution\u201d but there has never been any claim that anyone was misled by this obvious typographical error.

This court has recognized this as its duty and, in this specific context, we said quite clearly in <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 376 A.2d 359 (1977), that \u201c[i]n the area of fundamental civil liberties \u2014 which includes all protections of the declaration of rights contained in article first of the Connecticut constitution\u2014 we sit as a court of last resort, subject only to the qualification that our interpretations may not restrict the guarantees accorded the national citizenry under the federal charter. In such constitutional adjudication, our first referent is Connecticut law and the full panoply of rights Connecticut residents have come to expect as their due. Accordingly, decisions of the United States Supreme Court defining fundamental rights are persuasive authority to be afforded respectful consideration, but they are to be followed by Connecticut courts only when they provide no less individual protection than is guaranteed by Connecticut law.\u201d Id., 641-42. Further, we have frequently invoked the principle of <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S. Ct. 3469, 77 L.

In the case before us, the testimony was clear that the informant had personally observed the defendant offering packages he represented to contain cocaine for sale on the streets.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, which might not have been satisfied in <em>Gates, </em>was easily surpassed here. The so-called \u201cveracity prong\u201d of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli, </em>whether the police have reasonable grounds for crediting the information concerning criminal activity furnished by the informant, remains essentially untouched by the <em>Gates </em>\u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d formulation. It is therefore wholly unnecessary for our disposition of this case to decide what we may do if we should some day be confronted with a situation like <em>Gates </em>where the \u201cbasis of the informant\u2019s knowledge\u201d is left to be inferred entirely from the details contained in the information furnished, some of which may have been verified by other sources. There is nothing in the language or history of article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution, paralleling the fourth amendment of our federal constitution, that mandates any particular test for determining the ultimate constitutional requirement of the existence of probable cause prior to a search. No one questions the authority of this court to construe our state constitution to afford greater protection to individual rights than that afforded by our federal constitution; see <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 57, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984); but it is wholly inappropriate to declare our position in a particular instance before we have a case presenting the issue. Accordingly, I would follow our customary practice of not crossing constitutional bridges until we come to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>them. <em>Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>196 Conn. 623, 647, 495 A.2d 1011 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s resolution of this appeal under the standard two-pronged <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. As previously noted, the basis for the informant\u2019s report of criminal activity in progress, the first prong of the test, was his personal observation of the defendant\u2019s activities at the location specified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such a situation \u201cpresents few problems: since the report, although hearsay, purports to be first-hand observation, remaining doubt centers on the honesty of the informant . . . . \u201d <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 425 (White, J., concurring). It is this remaining veracity prong that the trial court as well as the majority maintain is not satisfied by the evidence presented at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The majority opinion sets forth a plethora of arguments to support the conclusion of the trial court that the police could not reasonably have relied on the information supplied by the informant in arresting and searching the defendant. Among them are: (1) the deference due the trial court\u2019s determination; (2) the lack of a warrant for the arrest or search; (3) an insufficient \u201ctrack record\u201d of the reliability of previous tips given by the informant, none of which had thus far resulted in a conviction; (4) the fact that, because the defendant may have worked near the location where he was reported to be selling cocaine, Officer Howard\u2019s several observations of him loitering there for extended periods of time and for no apparent reason were not actually corroborative of the reliability of the informant; and (5) the absence of any knowledge by the police or indication in the informant\u2019s report concerning prior drug related activities of the defendant. None of these can withstand analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>First. With respect to our function in reviewing trial court decisions on probable cause, it is clear that upon <em>disputed factual </em>issues we are ordinarily bound by the finding of the judge who heard the evidence. We ought not, however, to defer to the legal conclusions drawn from those facts if in our judgment they are clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D. We have heretofore treated probable cause as a question of law to be reviewed in the light of the subordinate facts found by the trial court or presented to us as undisputed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>189 Conn. 717, 458 A.2d 1147 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>162 Conn. 440, 294 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 870, 93 S. Ct. 198, 34 L. Ed 2d 121 (1972). In the present case the trial court made no finding that the information given to the police by the informant was not as indicated by Howard\u2019s testimony. The court concluded simply that the information received was insufficient as a matter of law to justify a reasonable belief that the defendant had engaged in criminal activity. No more deference is due that determination than any other trial court decision on a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Second. It is utterly ridiculous to suggest that when the police receive a report of criminal activity presently occurring in a public street they must await issuance of a warrant before taking action. By the time the application for the warrant can be prepared and a judge found available the felon would be long gone. Effective law enforcement under such a requirement would be impossible. The report received by Howard five or ten minutes before the arrest was that the defendant was then engaged in selling narcotics. If Howard had reasonable grounds to credit that report, delaying action until a warrant could be obtained would have been a dereliction of his duty to prevent crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Third. The prior experience of Howard with this informant demonstrates an ample basis for his reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>anee upon the truth of the report received. Three previous arrests had been made on the basis of information furnished by the same informant, \u201c[o]ne narcotics arrest and . . . two wanted felons.\u201d Howard had participated in the narcotics arrest and when the suspect was approached he discarded some items containing heroin. Because Howard had been acquainted with the informant only for several months, he was aware of no convictions that had resulted from this informant\u2019s tips, because the cases were still pending in court. Convictions are not essential for an informant to have an acceptable reputation for reliability. 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment, \u00a7 3.3, p. 510. \u201cCourts have consistently held that an informant\u2019s track record is sufficiently established by a showing (i) that on one or more previous occasions the informant indicated that a certain object, usually narcotics . . . are concealed at a certain place, and (ii) that this information was verified as true by a search which uncovered the specified items at the place indicated.\u201d Id., p. 511. The circumstances of the prior narcotics arrest, resulting from this informant\u2019s tip, in which Howard had participated make this principle applicable to establish adequately the reliability of the informant even without the successful experience of the police with the information concerning the two wanted felons.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Fourth. The fact that Howard had seen the defendant loitering for extended periods of time at Dixwell Avenue and Lake Place even during cold and inclement weather did tend to confirm in his view the accuracy of the information received from the informant. Although the defendant may have worked in the vicinity, the location of his employment was not known to Howard at the time of the arrest and has no bearing upon the reasonableness of his judgment at that time. The weight given by the trial court as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>majority to this innocent though unsupported<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> explanation of the defendant\u2019s frequent presence at the location where he was arrested is misplaced for the same reason that the fruits of a search, such as the cocaine found upon the defendant, cannot be used to justify the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Fifth. It is highly novel to suggest, as the majority opinion does, that Howard\u2019s acquaintance with the defendant, whom he had once arrested, as a convicted felon recently released from prison was wholly insignificant in the probable cause determination because he was unaware of any prior involvement of the defendant with drugs. Courts frequently rely upon felony convictions as evidence of character just as lay persons do without consideration of the nature of the particular felony involved. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-145 (b); State v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 513, 523-25, 447 A.2d 396 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The case before us provides a stronger basis for relying upon the information supplied by the informant than that approved by the United States Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Court in <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 79 S. Ct. 329, 3 L. Ed. 2d 327 (1959), where a paid informant, who had given other information of narcotics violations found to be reliable during the preceding period of about six months, notified the arresting officer that the defendant would be returning to Denver from Chicago by train on one of two successive days with three ounces of heroin in his possession. He also gave a detailed description of the defendant and the clothing he would be wearing. When the defendant alighted from the train garbed as predicted he was arrested. The court upheld the finding of probable cause despite the absence of: (1) any disclosure of the basis for the informant\u2019s knowledge of the defendant\u2019s activities other than inferences that could be drawn from the details of his description and the accuracy of his prediction; (2) any \u201ctrack record\u201d of prior convictions based on previous tips of the informant; and (3) any confirmation by police observation of anything but noncriminal conduct of the defendant. \u201cThe detail provided by the informant in <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[supra,] provides a suitable benchmark.\u201d <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 416, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In the present case, the informant had obtained the information he gave the police by personal observation and was willing to risk his reputation for reliability as well as his source of income by reporting a crime in progress. He must have realized his report would be subjected to immediate verification by police action, as it was. Under these circumstances I cannot affirm the conclusion of the majority as well as the trial court that it was unreasonable for Howard to rely upon the truth of the information he had received and to arrest the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-5\"> Officer Howard, who had received the tip from the informant, testified in this respect as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u201cI don\u2019t recall the exact verbiage but the conversation was that Mr. Kimbro was in possession of it, that he was offering it for sale on the street and that the informant had seen the package that was offered, that was purported to be cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">On cross-examination, after responding that the informer had not told him he had seen an actual sale, the testimony of Howard continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u201cQ. He did not tell you he had seen an actual sale. Did he tell you he had seen narcotics on the defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u201cA. No, merely packages of what the defendant was purporting to be cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">\u201cQ. What the defendant was purporting to be cocaine?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">\u201cQ. How did the informant know that the defendant was in fact purporting to have cocaine? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cA. The informant had overheard the defendant purport that the package of substance was cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Upon inquiry by the court as to how the informant knew the defendant was offering cocaine for sale, Howard testified further:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u201cMr. Howard: Overheard-well, you can call it a transaction. A transaction is something that takes place between people.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\u201cThe Court: He said he had overheard what?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\u201cMr. Howard: And observed the packages being displayed and the offer of the purported cocaine for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u201cQ. How did he know it was cocaine?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">\u201cA. The only way he knew was by Mr. Kimbro purporting it to be that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"> See footnote 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\"> The only testimony at the suppression hearing concerning the defendant\u2019s place of employment occurred during the cross-examination of Officer Howard as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u201cQ. Officer, you stated that you had observed him for two weeks and that you knew where he lived, you had his home address. Did you know where he worked?</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\u201cA. No, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">\u201cQ. Were you aware that he worked across the street, at the Triangle Garage, from the corner where he was found?</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t have any knowledge of that nor do I now.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">\u201cQ. Now you do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">The last remark by the defendant\u2019s attorney, designated as a question in the transcript, does not qualify as testimony. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 575, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1001, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983). Nevertheless, the trial court in rendering its decision declared: \u201cThe fact that the officer testified that he had seen [the defendant] loitering at that comer about half a dozen times in the past did not impress me either, particularly in view of the indication that he worked in that area.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Callahan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUg\">dissenting.

Ed. 2d 1453 (1983), that \u201cthe \u2018two-pronged test\u2019 has encouraged an excessively technical dissection of informants\u2019 tips, with undue attention being focused on isolated issues that cannot sensibly be divorced from the other facts presented to the magistrate.\u201d Id., 234-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u201cThe strictures that inevitably accompany the \u2018two-pronged test\u2019 cannot avoid seriously impeding the task of law enforcement . . . .\u201d Id., 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u201cWe are convinced that this flexible, easily applied standard [totality-of-the-circumstances] will better achieve the accommodation of public and private interests that the Fourth Amendment requires than does the approach that has developed from <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli.\u201d </em>Id., 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">I feel that making <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>the test for determining probable cause under the state constitution is a step backward into that labyrinthine body of hypertechnical rules concerning the criminal law from which I thought we were gradually beginning to emerge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
