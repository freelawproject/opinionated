The defendant received an effective sentence of one year, execution suspended after six months, and two years probation, and was fined five hundred dollars. In his appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant raised four claims of error, none of which the Appellate Court found persuasive. The present appeal concerns only one of these claims, namely, that the trial court\u2019s refusal to conduct an in camera inspection of the psychiatric records of a state\u2019s witness, or to make the records available to defense counsel, violated the defendant\u2019s right to conduct an effective cross-examination of the witness, as guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. We granted certification to review the decision of the Appellate Court finding no error. We affirm the decision of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The decision of the Appellate Court describes the underlying facts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>1 Conn. App. 384, 473 A.2d. 311 (1984). The defendant was accused of several instances of wiretapping and of engaging in acts of vandalism. The police investigation of the defendant was initiated by his former girlfriend, who reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>in January, 1979, to the police \u201cher suspicions that the defendant had stolen some personalty of hers, and that she believed that the defendant was wiretapping.\u201d Id., 386. In anticipation of the complainant\u2019s testimony at trial, \u201cthe defense subpoenaed her medical records for the years 1978 and 1979 from the Charlotte Hunger-ford Hospital, which included the records of her treatment in the psychiatric inpatient unit of the hospital.\u201d Id., 388. The hospital moved to quash the subpoena, in which motion the complainant joined, and the defendant filed an application for permission to review the hospital records. The court granted the motion to quash the subpoena and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to review the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The trial court based its rulings on General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e, which at the time of trial provided, in relevant part, that \u201c \u2018no person shall disclose or transmit any . . . [oral or written] communications or records [relating to diagnosis or treatment of a mental condition made between the patient and a psychiatrist] where the patient is identifiable, or the substance or any part or parts of any resume thereof, to any person, any corporation or any governmental agency, municipal, state or federal, without the consent of the patient or his authorized representative.\u2019 \u201d Id., 389. At the hearing on the motion to quash the subpoena, the trial court found that the records sought by the defendant fell within the statutory privilege, and that the blanket prohibition of the statute precluded both the defendant\u2019s review of the records and an in camera inspection by the court. The defendant took an exception to the trial court\u2019s rulings on the motion to quash the subpoena and the motion for permission to examine the records. Id., 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In his appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court\u2019s rulings with regard to the witness\u2019 psychiatric records precluded him from con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ducting an effective cross-examination of the witness, in violation of his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. Id. After his appeal had been argued in the Appellate Court, but before that court rendered its decision, this court decided the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 471 A.2d 949 (1984). In <em>Esposito, </em>we considered the question of when, if ever, a trial court or a criminal defendant should be permitted to inspect the psychiatric records of a state\u2019s witness to discover whether they contain relevant impeaching evidence. Id., 176-80. There we decided that \u201c[t]he broad sweep of [General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e] covers not only disclosure [of a witness\u2019 psychiatric records] to a defendant or his counsel, but also disclosure to a court even for the limited purpose of an in camera examination.\u201d Id., 178. We then went on to articulate a procedure which would protect the witness\u2019 statutory right to confidentiality while simultaneously safeguarding the defendant\u2019s constitutional right effectively to cross-examine the witness. First, the defendant is required to make \u201ca showing that there is reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the information is likely to impair the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation such that the witness\u2019 direct testimony should be stricken. Upon such a showing the court may then afford the state an opportunity to secure the consent of the witness for the court to conduct an in camera inspection of the claimed information and, if necessary, to turn over to the defendant any relevant material for the purposes of cross-examination. If the defendant does make such showing and such consent is not forthcoming then the court may be obliged to strike the testimony of the witness. If the consent is limited to an in camera inspection and such inspection, in the opinion of the trial judge, does not disclose relevant material then the resealed record is to be made available for inspection on appellate review. If the in camera inspection does reveal relevant material then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the witness should be given an opportunity to decide whether to consent to release of such material to the defendant or to face having her testimony stricken in the event of refusal.\u201d Id., 179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The Appellate Court found that the preliminary showing, required under <em>Esposito, </em>\u201cthat the failure to produce the records was likely to impair the defendant\u2019s right to confront the witness against him\u201d had been made. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>supra, 395. Citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, the court acknowledged that \u201c[s]ince the witness did not consent to a release of the records to anyone, including the [trial] court for an in camera review, the [trial] court \u2018may\u2019 have become obliged to strike the testimony of the witness.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>supra. Upon review of the record and transcripts in the case, however, the Appellate Court found a clear showing \u201cthat the evidence offered by the state, even without the testimony of the witness, was sufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. The court therefore concluded that there was no error because \u201c[e]ven if we assume, that the trial court would have, under the holding of <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, stricken the testimony of the witness, the defendant still would have been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In his request to this court for certification, the defendant raised two related issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first concerns whether the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ant access to the witness\u2019 psychiatric records, or to inspect the records in camera, deprived the defendant of his sixth amendment right effectively to cross-examine the witness. The second issue is whether the Appellate Court erroneously applied a \u201charmless error test\u201d in reviewing the rulings of the trial court with regard to the witness\u2019 psychiatric records.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">In an appeal from the Appellate Court, \u201cthe focus of our review is not the actions of the trial court, but the actions of the Appellate Court. We do not hear the appeal de novo. The only questions that we need consider are those squarely raised by the petition for certification, and we will ordinarily consider these issues in the form in which they have been framed in the Appellate Court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 433, 493 A.2d 865 (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The first question raised by the defendant, as to whether his sixth amendment rights were violated by the denial of access to the witness\u2019 psychiatric records and the absence of an in camera inspection, is unanswerable. Because \u201cthe witness did not consent to a release of the records to anyone, including the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>for an in camera review\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>supra; the records are not \u201cavailable for inspection on appellate review\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 180; by either the Appellate Court or this court. Although the witness in fact testified extensively upon cross-examination by the defendant regarding her psychiatric treatment and hospitalizations, her alcoholism and drug use, her suicide attempts, and her feelings of fear and anger toward the defendant; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>supra, 392; absent any knowledge of the contents of her psychiatric records, it is impossible to determine whether they included relevant impeaching evidence that was not cumulative or was contrary to her testimony. To rely on the testimony actually elicited on cross-examination in assessing whether the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights were violated would involve pure speculation as to the contents of the witness\u2019 records. The Appellate Court properly did not engage in such a futile exercise, nor do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">As the Appellate Court correctly noted, \u201c[t]he claim here ... is not th\u00e1t the defendant was restricted in any way in cross-examination, but that without examination of the psychiatric records of the witness the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation was impaired to such an extent that he was denied a fair trial.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim on the ground that, even absent the witness\u2019 testimony, there was clearly sufficient evidence to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 395. This brings us to the second question raised by the defendant in his appeal to this court, that is, whether \u201c[t]he Appellate Court applied a \u2018harmless error test\u2019 in the violation of his basic constitutional right to confront witnesses, which right goes to the integrity of the fact finding process of determining guilt or innocence in violation of the guidelines set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Truppi, </em>182 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Conn. 449 [438 A.2d 712 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 941, 101 S. Ct. 2024, 68 L. Ed. 2d 329 (1981)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Truppi, </em>supra, 466, this court reversed a defendant\u2019s convictions for robbery and kidnapping because the trial court\u2019s instructions had shifted to the defendant the burden of proof as to the intent element of those crimes in violation of his due process rights. Although the state urged that the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt; id., 465; we refused \u201cto weigh the evidence of guilt against the uncured damage done by the harmful portion of the instructions\u201d; id., 466; because such an analysis \u201cwould transfer to this \u2018court the jury\u2019s function of measuring the evidence by appropriate legal yardsticks.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Bollenbach </em>v. <em>United States, </em>326 U.S. 607, 614, 66 S. Ct. 402, 90 L. Ed. 350 (1946); compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 563, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985) (improper remarks by prosecutor during opening summation to jury required reversal of convictions despite \u201crecord that [did] not permit serious doubt of [the defendant\u2019s] guilt\u201d), with <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohane, </em>193 Conn. 474, 485, 479 A.2d 763, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 990, 105 S. Ct. 397, 83 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1984) (trial court\u2019s erroneous refusal to instruct jury that no adverse inference could be drawn from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify \u201cmay be held harmless only if the evidence against the accused is so overwhelming that we can conclude as a matter of law that the jury\u2019s verdict was not influenced by the absence of [the] instruction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The defendant argues that the analysis applied by the Appellate Court conflicts with the established principle that \u201ccertain constitutional protections are so central to the requirement of a fair trial that their violation absolutely requires that the conviction from which they arose be set aside.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohane, </em>supra, 484, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705, reh. denied, 386 U.S. 987, 87 S. Ct. 1283, 18 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1967). The defendant cites two cases in which the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201c \u2018a denial of cross-examination without waiver . . . would be constitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of showing of want of prejudice would cure it.\u2019 <em>Brookhart </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>384 U.S. 1, 3 [86 S. Ct. 1245, 16 L. Ed. 2d <em>314(1966)].\u201dSmith v. Illinois, </em>390 U.S. 129, 131, 88 S. Ct. 748, 19 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1968). A close examination of these cases reveals, however, that the defendant\u2019s reliance upon them is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In <em>Brookhart </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>supra, 7, the defendant\u2019s attorney informed the trial court \u201cthat the State need make only a prima facie showing of guilt and that he would neither offer evidence on [the defendant\u2019s] behalf nor cross-examine any of the State\u2019s witnesses.\u201d The United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction because the record failed to demonstrate that the defendant himself knowingly and intelligently agreed \u201cto be tried in a proceeding which was the equivalent of a guilty plea and in which he would not have the right to be confronted with and cross-examine the witnesses against him.\u201d Id. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, where the \u201conly real question at the trial . . . was the relative credibility of the petitioner and [the principal] prosecution witness\u201d; id., 130; the defendant was not permitted to ask the witness either his name or address. The Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]o forbid this most rudimentary inquiry at the threshold is effectively to emasculate the right of cross-examination itself.\u201d Id., 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In <em>Brookhart </em>and <em>Smith, </em>each defendant demonstrated a clear violation of his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. As previously discussed, however, it is impossible to determine whether the defendant\u2019s right to cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>examine the witness was impaired in this case absent an opportunity to review the witness\u2019 psychiatric records. It is to protect a defendant from the <em>possibility </em>of a violation of his confrontation rights that <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, contemplates striking the testimony of a witness who asserts the privilege of confidentiality in the face of a showing of likely impairment of those rights absent disclosure. Id., 179-80. In light of Esposito, because this defendant made the requisite preliminary showing, he would have been entitled to have the witness\u2019 testimony stricken upon her refusal to permit an in camera inspection. Thus, although the defendant cannot prove that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to confront the witness, he can claim that her testimony should have been excluded from the evidence upon which his guilt was determined and that the procedure followed below was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">This court has previously applied the harmless error doctrine to uphold convictions, despite the erroneous admission of testimony at trial, where there was overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>187 Conn. 602, 612, 447 A.2d 734 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>179 Conn. 328, 336-37, 426 A.2d 298 (1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 912, 100 S. Ct. 3000, 64 L. Ed. 2d 862 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeko, </em>177 Conn. 545, 557, 418 A.2d 917 (1979); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>162 Conn. 316, 328, 294 A.2d 297 (1972); see also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>411 U.S. 223, 93 S. Ct. 1565, 36 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1973). In light of the Appellate Court\u2019s unchallenged finding that, even absent the witness\u2019 testimony, \u201cthe defendant still would have been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>supra, 395; we agree that the convictions should be sustained. We interpret the Appellate Court\u2019s finding to mean that, as a matter of law, the remaining evidence against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>defendant was so overwhelming as to render any error in not striking the complainant\u2019s testimony harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The decision of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Healey and Santaniello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> The defendant\u2019s request to this court for certification was in the form of two statements and reads as follows: \u201cThe petitioner was denied his sixth amendment right to confront and to conduct an effective cross-examination of the state\u2019s primary witness against him as guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution in that the witness\u2019 psychiatric records were not made available to his counsel and the trial court refused to make an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the subpoenaed records. The Appellate Court applied a \u2018harmless error test\u2019 in the violation of his basic constitutional right to confront witnesses, which right goes to the integrity of the fact finding process of determining guilt or innocence in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>guidelines set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Truppi, </em>182 Conn. 449 [438 A.2d 712 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 941, 101 S. Ct. 2024, 68 L. Ed. 2d 329 (1981)].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\"> Because we agree with the analysis and the decision of the Appellate Court, we decline to consider the alternate grounds for affirmance contained in the preliminary statement of issues filed by the state pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3012 (a). Thus, for the purposes of this appeal, we accept the Appellate Court\u2019s finding that the defendant made a sufficient showing under <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 179, 471 A.2d 949 (1984), \u201cthat the failure to produce the [witness\u2019 psychiatric] records was likely to impair the defendant\u2019s right to confront the witness against him.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>1 Conn. App. 384, 395, 473 A.2d 311 (1984). We likewise need not review the Appellate Court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe evidence offered by the state, even without the testimony of the witness, was sufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d; id.; because the defendant has not challenged this finding in the present appeal to this court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 434, 493 A.2d 865 (1985). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>are several charges, the maximum sentence possible from consecutive sentences and including, when applicable, the fact that a different or additional punishment may be authorized by reason of a previous conviction; and</p>\n<p id=\"Ak5\">\u201c(5) The fact that he has the right to plead not guilty or to persist in that plea if it has already been made, and the fact that he has the right to be tried by a jury or a judge and that at that trial he has the right to the assistance of counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him, and the right not to be compelled to incriminate himself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b350-7\">Shea, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABD\">concurring. I agree with the majority\u2019s application in this case of the harmless error doctrine in the form appropriate for errors of constitutional import, i.e., harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. The opinion of the Appellate Court, however, appears to have employed a different standard: <em>\u201cA </em>review of the record and transcripts in the present case, however, clearly demonstrates that the evidence offered by the state, even without the testimony of the witness, was sufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>1 Conn. App. 384, 395, 473 A.2d 311 (1984). This sentence, declaring that, even with the omission of the testimony that should have been stricken, the state\u2019s evidence was sufficient to prove guilt implies that the criterion used was whether the remaining evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to support the finding. Legal sufficiency of the evidence is not the test for harmless error even if only a nonconstitutional error is involved. The harmlessness of an error depends upon its impact on the trier and the result, not upon whether the particular evidence involved was legally essential to support the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Applying the constitutional standard, I would find the evidence, absent the testimony of the witness who asserted her psychiatric privilege, to be so overwhelming as to render the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The physical evidence, the tapes and the recording equipment clearly established the substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>of the crimes, and other witnesses provided more than ample evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement in those crimes, including his own admissions. The testimony that should have been stricken was of some significance in explaining the defendant\u2019s motivation, but was otherwise merely repetitious of facts amply proved by physical exhibits or by other witnesses. The defendant was acquitted of the one charge upon which the testimony of this witness was of great significance, the theft of her jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Accordingly, I agree with the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
