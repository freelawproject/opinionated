Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As1\">This appeal arises from the judgment of sentence imposed in connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>defendant\u2019s rape of a fourteen year old girl in Walling-ford on May 21,1979. On October 4,1982, the defendant Ronald Sutton was found guilty by a jury on each count of a three count information. The first count charged the crime of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the second count charged the crime of kidnapping in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94 (a);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the third count charged the crime of threatening in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 5,1982, the defendant was sentenced on the first count to a term of not less than seven and one-half years nor more than fifteen years, on the second count to a term of not less than seven and one-half years nor more than fifteen years with the sentence on the second count to run consecutive to that on the first count and to a sentence of one year on the third count to run consecutive to the sentence on the first and second counts. The judgment stated that an effective sentence of not less than sixteen years and not more than thirty-one years was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>On October 5, 1982, the defendant appealed to this court. He frames the issue on appeal in this fashion: \u201cDid the imposition of a more severe sentence on the Defendant following his reconviction after he successfully challenged his first conviction fail to comport with the requirements of <em>North Carolina </em>v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711 [89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656] (1969), and deprive the Defendant of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States?\u201d The defendant is challenging not his underlying conviction of October 5,1982, but rather the sentence imposed on account of that conviction. He argues that this sentence should be vacated and that the case should be remanded for a resentencing proceeding comporting with <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The factual background pertinent to our disposition is the following. On July 7,1981, the defendant pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine to the same three charges of which he was later found guilty by a jury on October 4,1982. At the time of the July 7,1981 plea, the trial court, <em>Reynolds, J., </em>after an extensive canvass, indicated that it intended to impose an effective sentence of not less than seven and not more than twelve years in prison, and, ordering a presentence investigation, it continued the matter for sentencing to August 14,1981.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the latter date, the trial court did sentence the defendant on the first count charging sexual assault in the first degree to a term of not less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>seven years nor more than twelve years, on the second count charging kidnapping in the second degree to a term of not less than seven years nor more than twelve years, and on the third count charging threatening to one year. It ordered that all the sentences were to run concurrently for an effective sentence of not less than seven years and not more than twelve years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Thereafter, on November 30, 1981, the defendant filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Sutton </em>v. Warden, Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 266428. The sole ground alleged in the application for the issuance of the writ was that \u201c[the defendant\u2019s] imprisonment is illegal in that the minimum terms of his sentence [of August 14,1981,] for sexual assault in the first degree and kidnapping in the second degree are more than one-half of the maximum terms imposed for those crimes, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 53a-35 (c) (2).\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The prayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>for relief requested that the habeas court \u201cissue an order declaring his sentences for sexual assault in the first degree and kidnapping in the second degree <em>null and void . . . </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">On March 15,1982, a hearing was held on the defendant\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus at which the defendant, his defense counsel and assistant state\u2019s attorney Michael Dearington, were present. At the outset, the defendant argued that the sentence should have been not less than six years and not more than twelve years rather than the sentence imposed of not less than seven nor more than twelve years because the sentencing statutes provided that the minimum sentence imposed could not exceed one half the maximum. Admitted as an exhibit, the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney at his August 14, 1981 sentencing recited in part that the defendant \u201cplead [sic] guilty upon the understanding, <em>inter alia, </em>he would receive an effective sentence of seven to twelve years to serve.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The state argued that it felt that the habeas court, <em>N. O\u2019Neill, J., </em>did not have \u201cthe authority to change sentences\u201d and that the matter \u201cshould be either referred to Sentence Review or he should be allowed to withdraw his plea, and we start from round one again.\u201d The defendant himself responded that \u201c[t]hat would be fine with me.\u201d The state said that it had no objection to going to the sentence review division but also said \u201cI\u2019m not sure what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the petitioner is asking for.\u201d A colloquy ensued,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> with the court, the defendant and both counsel participating, during which the withdrawal of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and a new trial became focal. The court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>defense counsel and the state then all expressly warned the defendant that if he chose to withdraw his guilty plea and have a new trial, the risk of incurring an increased sentence existed if a guilty verdict were returned. Although the defendant stated that he understood \u201cthat,\u201d the court said it would delay its decision until it was informed that the defendant\u2019s attorney had conferred with him and had, in writing, notified the court that the defendant wished to withdraw his guilty plea. Upon receiving a \u201cpositive statement\u201d to that effect, the court said that then \u201cI\u2019ll grant the motion to withdraw the guilty pleas and erase all the prior elections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">On March 22, 1982, the defendant\u2019s counsel wrote to the habeas court stating that he had spoken to the defendant, and \u201cwarned him that he would open himself to the maximum sentences for the crimes charged, and that there is a possibility of receiving a term of imprisonment substantially longer than the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>sentence,\u201d but that the defendant \u201cindicated to me his desire to go ahead with a new trial.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s counsel also enclosed with that letter the defendant\u2019s affidavit \u201cto that effect,\u201d which, inter alia, acknowledged his attorney\u2019s warning. The defendant thus swore: \u201cI fully understand the risk involved, but have nevertheless decided to withdraw my guilty plea and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>proceed with a new trial.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, on April 28, 1982, the habeas court issued its memorandum of decision,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> finding that the defendant\u2019s \u201csen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>fences of August 14, 1981 are <em>void </em>. . . (Emphasis added.) There was no appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The defendant thereafter pleaded not guilty and elected a trial by jury. The six day jury trial took place in September and October, 1982, on the same three charges to which he had earlier pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine. At trial a number of witnesses testified, including the victim, her mother, her father, her sister and the defendant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The jury returned and the court, <em>Mulvey, J., </em>on October 4, 1982, accepted their verdict of guilty on each of the three counts on October 4, 1982. The court imposed an effective sentence of not less than sixteen years and not more than thirty-one years.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>On appeal, the defendant argues that the imposition of a more severe sentence on October 5,1982, following his reconviction after his successful attack on his first conviction does not comport with the requirements of <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, and has deprived him of his liberty without due process of law. In support of this contention the defendant argues that this case \u201cis, for all practical purposes, indistinguishable from <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Rice,\u201d </em>the companion case of <em>Pearce, </em>decided sub nom. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>and that the facts of <em>Simpson </em>\u201care particularly important in the context of the instant case.\u201d In arguing that <em>Pearce </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>controls, the defendant maintains that the <em>Pearce </em>rule applies to defendants who have successfully attacked convictions based on guilty pleas as well as to defendants who have successfully attacked illegal sentences. He also maintains that he has not waived his due process rights. On the other hand, the state\u2019s contention, broadly stated, is that: \u201cOnce A Defendant Knowingly and Voluntarily Withdraws<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> His Plea Of Guilty And Thus Subjects Himself, His Victims, And Witnesses To Exhaustive Examination During The Subsequent Criminal Trial . . . That Defendant [cannot] Then Resurrect The Voided Plea In His Effort To Avoid The Consequences Of The Lawful Sentence Which The Trial Court Based Upon Evidence Adduced At The Criminal Trial.\u201d We find error and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Some discussion of <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Rice, </em>which were habeas corpus proceedings brought by state prisoners, is required for our analysis. The United States Supreme Court articulated the question presented by both of these cases as follows: \u201cWhen at the behest of the defendant a criminal conviction has been set aside and a new trial ordered, to what extent does the Constitution limit the imposition of a harsher sentence after conviction upon retrial?\u201d <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In <em>Pearce, </em>the prisoner had been convicted in a North Carolina court of assault with intent to commit rape and sentenced to prison for a term of twelve to fifteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>years. Several years later, he instituted a state post-conviction proceeding which culminated in the reversal of his conviction by the North Carolina Supreme Court on the ground that an involuntary confession had been admitted unconstitutionally as evidence against him. He was thereafter retried, convicted and sentenced by the trial judge to an eight year prison term, which, \u201cwhen added to the time Pearce had already spent in prison, the parties agreed amounted to a longer total sentence than that originally imposed.\u201d Id. That conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court. He then began habeas corpus proceedings in a federal district court, which held that \u201cthe longer sentence imposed upon retrial was \u2018unconstitutional and void.\u2019 \u201d Id., 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In the companion case, Rice had pleaded guilty in an Alabama court to four separate charges of second degree burglary and was sentenced to prison terms aggregating ten years. Two and one-half years later, the judgments were set aside in a state coram nobis proceeding on the ground that Rice had not been accorded his constitutional right to counsel. Thereafter, he was retried on three of the charges, convicted and sentenced to prison terms aggregating twenty-five years. On his resentencing he was not given any credit for the time that he had spent in prison on the original judgments. Rice then initiated habeas corpus proceedings in a federal district court \u201calleging that the state trial court had acted unconstitutionally in failing to give him credit for the time he had already served in prison, and in imposing grossly harsher sentences upon retrial.\u201d Id., 714-15. The federal court agreed with both of Rice\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The United States Supreme Court was thus faced with \u201ctwo related but analytically separate issues\u201d in <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Rice. </em>Id., 715. The broader one, presented by <em>Pearce, </em>concerned \u201cthe constitutional [limitation] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>upon the imposition of a more severe punishment after conviction for the same offense upon retrial\u201d; id., 715-16; the more limited issue presented by <em>Rice </em>was \u201cwhether, in computing the new sentence, the Constitution requires that credit must be given for that part of the original sentence already served.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 716. On the issue in <em>Rice, </em>the court held that \u201cthe constitutional guarantee against multiple punishments for the same offense absolutely requires that punishment already exacted must be fully \u2018credited\u2019 in imposing sentence upon a new conviction for the same offense.\u201d Id., 718-19. The court then addressed \u201cthe broader problem of what constitutional limitations there may be upon the general power of a judge to impose upon reconviction a longer prison sentence than the defendant originally received.\u201d Id., 719. On that issue, the court held, \u201cthat neither the double jeopardy provision nor the Equal Protection Clause imposes an absolute bar to a more severe sentence upon reconviction. A trial judge is not constitutionally precluded, in other words, from imposing a new sentence, whether greater or less than the original sentence, in the light of events subsequent to the first trial that may have thrown new light upon the defendant\u2019s \u2018life, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities.\u2019 <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 245 [69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (1949)]. Such information may come to the judge\u2019s attention from evidence adduced at the second trial itself, from a new presentence investigation, from the defendant\u2019s prison record, or possibly from other sources.\u201d Id., 723. However, after approving of \u201c[t]he freedom of a sentencing judge to consider the defendant\u2019s conduct subsequent to the first conviction in imposing a new sentence,\u201d the <em>Pearce </em>court hastened to point out that \u201c[t]o say that there exists no abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>lute constitutional bar to the imposition of a more severe sentence upon retrial is not, however, to end the inquiry. There remains for consideration the impact of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The <em>Pearce </em>court declared that it would be \u201ca flagrant violation\u201d of the fourteenth amendment for a state trial judge to follow an \u201cannounced practice of imposing a heavier sentence upon every reconvicted defendant for the explicit purpose of punishing the defendant for his having succeeded in getting his original conviction set aside.\u201d Id., 723-24. The \u201cvery threat inherent in the existence of such a punitive policy would,\u201d <em>Pearce </em>said, \u201cwith respect to those still in prison, serve to \u2018chill the exercise of basic constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d Id., 724. A defendant\u2019s due process rights would therefore be violated where such punishment is imposed whether the earlier conviction has been set aside because of constitutional error or where a defendant has \u201csuccessfully pursued a statutory right of appeal or collateral remedy.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The <em>Pearce </em>court then announced its rule on the due process claims: \u201cDue process of law, then, <em>requires </em>that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 725. Both Pearce and Rice had claimed that the trial courts had imposed the heavier sentences to punish them for their challenges of their original convictions. The majority in <em>Pearce, </em>however, said that it was not necessary to decide whether the trial judges had in fact acted vindictively. Because \u201cthe fear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction, due process <em>also requires </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>that a defendant be freed of the apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Therefore, the <em>Pearce </em>court determined that \u201cto assure the absence of such a motivation\u201d it \u201cwas necessary to impose upon the resentencing judge what was later described as \u2018a prophylactic limitation.\u2019 \u201d 3 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure (1984) \u00a7 26.1 (c), p. 176; see <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>412 U.S. 47, 51, 93 S. Ct. 1966, 36 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1973).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cIn order to assure the absence of such a motivation, we have concluded that whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding. And the factual data upon which the increased sentence is based must be made part of the record, so that the constitutional legitimacy of the increased sentence may be fully reviewed on appeal.\u201d <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, 726. This limitation recognizes that \u201c[t]o punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation \u2018of the most basic sort.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 372, 102 S. Ct. 2485, 73 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1982), quoting <em>Bordenkircher </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 363, 98 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 2d 604, reh. denied, 435 U.S. 918, 98 S. Ct. 1477, 55 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1978); see <em>Chaffin </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>Stynchcombe, </em>412 U.S. 17, 32-33 n.20, 93 S. Ct. 1977, 36 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1973). The federal due process clause, however, \u201cis not offended by all possibilities of increased punishment upon retrial after appeal, but only by those that pose a realistic likelihood of \u2018vindictiveness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blackledge </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 27, 94 S. Ct. 2098, 40 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>supra, 375. An appellant who has been successful on appeal in obtaining a reversal of his conviction cannot complain that he be subjected to a proper reappraisal of sentencing standards on remand. <em>People </em>v. <em>Serrato, </em>9 Cal. 3d 753, 764, 512 P.2d 289, 109 Cal. Rptr. 65 (1973); <em>People </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>109 Cal. App. 3d 426, 436, 167 Cal. Rptr. 256 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The defendant argues that the <em>Pearce </em>rule applies to defendants who have successfully attacked convictions based on guilty pleas as well as to those based on illegal sentences. We have no quarrel with that contention as a general proposition but are mindful that post <em>-Pearce </em>pronouncements by the United States Supreme Court, as we have pointed out, state that due process is not an absolute bar to a higher sentence. We conclude that the teachings of <em>Pearce </em>and its progeny, which were clearly implicated in the sentencing of October 5, 1982, merited attention. In this context, we cannot accept the state\u2019s assertion in its brief that, because the August 14, 1981 sentence \u201cWas Void At The Defendant\u2019s Request, The Trial Court Had <em>Unrestricted </em>Ability To Sentence The Defendant To Any Lawful Sentence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Our disposition of this case must also consider another facet of the resentencing proceeding that we hereinafter direct. That involves the fact that the sentence imposed on October 5,1982, after the defendant\u2019s jury trial, was itself illegal, in the sense that, as the defendant in his brief indicates, it did not comport with statutory authority. The sentences on the first and sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ond counts of the information were indeterminate sentences while the sentence imposed on the third count was a definite sentence. The minimum term of sixteen years is more than one half the maximum term of thirty-one years in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35 (c) (2).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This is so because the one year sentence for threatening was added to both the maximum and minimum terms and not just to the minimum.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The defendant further argues that he \u201chas already served his new minimum term of imprisonment, and, under these circumstances, only the <em>19 </em>year increase in his maximum term presents a case and controversy for this Court to decide.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The sentence imposed on October 5, 1982, was itself illegal because it was not imposed in accordance with statutory authority. The defendant himself has brought this to our attention in his brief. Despite his assertion that we are limited to reviewing \u201conly the 19 year increase in his maximum term,\u201d we do not agree that the matter of the minimum term is academic, and on remand the illegality of the sentence for its statutory nonconformity should be addressed. See General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 53a-35 (c) (2), 53a-37. An appellant, who has been successful on appeal or has an illegal sentence vacated, should not be heard to assert that \u201che should not be subjected to a proper reappraisal of statutory sentencing standards upon remand.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>supra, 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">A remand for resentencing is also necessary because of <em>Pearce. </em>At that resentencing hearing, the teaching of <em>Pearce </em>requires that the defendant\u2019s due process rights must be strictly observed. \u201cThe goal of the <em>Pearce </em>rule, that apprehension of vindictiveness be allayed, does not permit a defendant to be left to speculate as to the true reason for an increased sentence.\u201d <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Redman, </em>616 F.2d 1251, 1259 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 944, 100 S. Ct. 2170, 64 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1980). This is a matter of federal constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The record of the remarks<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> of the trial judge in sentencing this defendant after the jury verdict of guilty does not affirmatively disclose any \u201cfactual data,\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>are legitimate <em>Pearce </em>reasons for the increased sentence. Such reasons must be \u201cbased upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding [on August 14,1981].\u201d <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, 726; <em>Blackledge </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>supra; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>690 F.2d 21, 24 (2d Cir. 1982). \u201cIf any doubt remained that the sentencing judge must himself articulate the basis for the harsher sentence, such doubt was dispelled by the Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Pearce </em>in <em>Blackledge </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 25-26, 94 S. Ct. 2098, 2101, 40 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1974).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>581 F.2d 602, 606 (7th Cir. 1978). The affirmative disclosure required by <em>Pearce </em>and its progeny to ensure the \u201cconstitutional legitimacy\u201d of the increased sentence is not present in the record. Despite a careful examination of the trial court\u2019s remarks at the resentencing of October 5,1982, we cannot find that the record demonstrates that the increased sentences were based on objective information concerning identifiable conduct occurring subsequent to the original sentencing in accordance with <em>Pearce. </em>The record does not affirmatively disclose that this was done. The resentencing judge noted that he had \u201csat through this trial, and listened to what took place here, and it was atrocious.\u201d This, together with his observation that the victim, her mother, her father and her sister \u201chad to come in here and testify,\u201d does not comport with <em>Pearce </em>and its progeny, which require that the factual basis for the higher sentence, if not the literal reasons, \u201caffirmatively appear\u201d in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">It is fair to say that a full trial after an earlier proceeding setting aside the original sentence can be a subsequent event under <em>Pearce </em>that may, in a given case, supply data that may lend support to an increased sentence. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>676 F.2d 1359, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>1365 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1040, 103 S.

Evidence introduced for the first time at a later trial has been suggested to constitute a basis for data regarding a defendant\u2019s conduct occurring after the first sentencing and consonant with <em>Pearce </em>where the record so discloses that under <em>Pearce </em>standards. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>supra, 889. Of course, \u201camplified knowledge\u201d about the defendant\u2019s criminal activity which may have occurred before the sentencing of August 14,1981, but known to the earlier sentencing judge cannot serve as a basis for an increased sentence under <em>Pearce. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gilliss, </em>645 F.2d 1269, 1284 (8th Cir. 1981); <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>419 F.2d 753 (D.C.

Ed. 2d 582 (1978) (perjury by defendant will support an increased sentence); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>supra. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grayson, </em>supra, 51, the United States Supreme Court said: \u201cA defendant\u2019s truthfulness or mendacity while testifying on his own behalf, almost without exception, has been deemed probative of his attitudes toward society and prospects for rehabilitation and hence relevant to sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In light of the foregoing, we decide today to remand this case for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.

[that] [h]e wanted his day in court. He had his day in court, and now it\u2019s time for his past record to catch up with him . . . it\u2019s the State\u2019s request, if the Court please, that sentences be imposed not concurrently but consecutively, and that the maximum be imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Counsel for the defendant said, inter alia, that he did not feel it was \u201cappropriate for the court to impose maximum penalties, and certainly not consecutive ones on this count [sic] . . .\u201d arguing that the kidnapping charge was \u201cincidental to the assault. ...\u201d Directing the court\u2019s attention to the \u201cprior plea arrangement ... for a term of seven to twelve years ...\u201d that the defendant having \u201copted to vacate that sentence, even though he was scheduled for a parole hearing fairly soon; and I don\u2019t think that having exercised those rights, that that would warrant the imposition of a maximum sentence. So, I would ask the Court to consider sentencing in the area of eight to sixteen years, with the sentences running concurrently . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The defendant also addressed the court and after commenting on the jury trial said: \u201cAlso, since I was sentenced illegally at the first trial, and the Prosecutor or my attorney made no attempt to correct it, and the Judge surely knew it was an illegal sentence, I believe if I am sentenced to a longer term, it is only to punish me for asking for what is guaranteed me by both the State and Federal Constitution, and by this State Statutes. Not once was I offered the chance to have my illegal sentence corrected without risk<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ing a longer sentence. I still maintain I am innocent, but I am at the mercy of the Court. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The state then said: \u201cYour Honor, there was a waiver signed by him, which is of record, and it\u2019s in the file, in which he was advised, by his counsel who represented him on a Writ of Habeas Corpus, that we were not going to oppose the vacation of the sentence \u2014 the vacating of the sentence if it were understood, clearly and concisely, that we were to go to trial with a fresh slate, and there is a record in there, a letter from the Legal Assistant to Prisoners, in which it states T spoke with Mr. Sutton \u2014 \u2019 I am quoting from the two opening paragraphs; counsel has a copy of this; T spoke with Mr. Sutton on March 19th, 1982.1 warned that he would open himself up to maximum sentences for the crimes charged, and that there is a possibility of receiving a term of imprisonment substantially longer than the original sentence. Mr. Sutton indicated a desire, to me, to go forward with a new trial. Please enclose his affidavit to that effect.\u2019 So, again, we have this man standing up here with the unmitigated gall of saying that that sentence has a motion, or something \u2014 in any event, the affidavit that he signed, if your Honor please, and a Commissioner of the Superior Court took his oath \u2014 \u2018My attorney for the Writ of Habeas Corpus, Brian W. Smith, Legal Assistant for the Prisoners, has explained to me if I proceed with a new trial, there is a distinct possibility that I may receive a new term of imprisonment substantially longer than the sentence originally imposed; but I fully understand the risk, but decided to go forward with the plea.\u2019 I also stated, on March 15th, \u2018The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, acting under my authority,\u2019 if your Honor please, \u2018offered to accept a withdrawal of his guilty plea, and proceed with a new trial.\u2019 I have always felt that that plea was inadequate. The fact was that the plea \u2014 the other sentence was inadequate. The only reason it was even allowed to go through was to save that family from the <em>very </em>torture that they had here. Now, he has had his day in court. He has made that family testify. There is nothing that recommends a lighter sentence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\"> The defendant, in his reply brief, argues it is erroneous for the state to say that the defendant withdrew his plea. \u201cRather, [he argues] he pleaded guilty, received a sentence of unquestioned illegality, and subsequently filed a habeas corpus action claiming that he was illegally confined. . . . The writ was granted . . . because his sentence, and consequently the plea that had been negotiated on the basis of that sentence, [was] illegal. It is this successful pursuit of a collateral remedy that brings this case squarely within the ambit of <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711 [89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L.

Ct. 1966, 36 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1973). The judge who presided at the defendant Sutton\u2019s jury trial was, however, not the same judge who had accepted the defendant\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea. See <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 116-17, 92 S. Ct. 1953, 32 L.

It is arguably difficult to understand how the defendant can contend that if successful on this appeal, he should be entitled, on resentencing, to receive a sentence of not less than six years and not more than twelve years when such a sentence was neither \u201cbargained for\u201d nor imposed, and when his habeas corpus proceeding not only voided a sentence of not less than seven years and not more than twelve years which was statutorily illegal but also voided \u201chis continued imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">On the resentencing we order below, we emphasize that both the teachings of <em>Pearce </em>and our sentencing statutes must be strictly observed. It goes without saying that the resentencing we order today must, of course, give the defendant credit for all time served since his original sentencing of August 14, 1981. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 716 n.6, 89 S.

The thing that happened to this little girl is a horrible thing, and she had to come in here and testify, as did her entire family: mother, father, and sister, and they did; and I suppose it will be a long time before this little girl is able to put it out of her mind as to what happened to her on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">\u201cI understand that the accused could do as he did, in asking that the prior matter be vacated, and that he be allowed to proceed to trial, and that, of course, was accorded him, and he has had his trial; and I have no question in my mind as to the verdict being a proper one that the jury handed down late yesterday afternoon. I am aware of the accused\u2019s record. It\u2019s a record that involves violence; it involves knives; it involves sex. It hasn\u2019t improved with age, as sometimes occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">\u201cAnd so, under those circumstances, I will impose a sentence that I think is a proper one, taking all those things into consideration. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b524-6\">Peters, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7k\">concurring. I agree with that part of the majority opinion which orders the trial court to hold a new hearing for the resentencing of the defendant. I write separately to emphasize that <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969), imposes important constitutional constraints upon the scope of such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Unless and until the United States Supreme Court decides to retreat from its holding in <em>Pearce, </em>we are bound to follow its mandate. To guard against the risk of retaliatory vindictiveness to punish a defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to a retrial, and to avoid the problems of proof that inhere in a factual demonstration of improper motivation, <em>Pearce </em>adopts a prophylactic rule. That rule purposely limits the circumstances under which a defendant, on a new trial, can receive a sentence more severe than that which was imposed upon him during an earlier prosecution for the same crime. The majority opinion recognizes that <em>Pearce </em>requires the sentencing judge to place on the record his reasons for imposing the more severe sentence. The majority opinion acknowledges that <em>Pearce </em>confines constitutionally permissible reasons for a more severe sentence to \u201cidentifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">I am troubled, however, by the intimations in the majority opinion that <em>Pearce </em>might allow the sentencing judge in making an affirmative record to rely, in any way, on the fact that the defendant had committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>an atrocious crime or that his retrial had compelled the victim and members of her family to testify. None of that constitutes \"conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.\u201d Nor do I believe that \"a full trial after an earlier proceeding setting aside the original sentence can itself be a subsequent event under <em>Pearce\u201d </em>unless, during the retrial, the defendant has demonstrably committed perjury. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 51, 98 S. Ct. 2610, 57 L. Ed. 2d 582 (1978), on which the majority relies, does not signal a retreat from <em>Pearce, </em>because <em>Grayson </em>did not involve a reprosecution but concerned only the propriety of an enhanced sentence in a single trial. Indeed, <em>Grayson </em>does not cite <em>Pearce. </em>I urge the trial judge, on resentencing, to bear in mind that <em>Pearce </em>limits his inquiry to a search for objective facts about identifiable conduct of the defendant subsequent to his original sentencing. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gilliss, </em>645 F.2d 1269, 1283-84 (8th Cir. 1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>581 F.2d 602, 604-607 (7th Cir. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>519 F.2d 1031, 1033-35 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Accordingly, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
