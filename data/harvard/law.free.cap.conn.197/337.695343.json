Subsequent to the plea, but prior to sentencing, the defendant retained other counsel and filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The motion was based on a claim that \u201c[t]he plea was involuntary, or was entered without knowledge of the nature of the charge,\u201d and that it \u201cresulted from the denial of effective assistance of counsel.\u201d The trial court denied the motion to withdraw the plea after an extensive hearing and imposed a sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment. The defendant appeals, claiming that the trial court erred in: (1) finding that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary and made with the effective assistance of counsel; (2) considering the strength of the state\u2019s case and the probable outcome of a trial in its decision as to whether the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel; (3) failing adequately to inform the defendant of the nature of the charge against him and of his right against self-incrimination prior to accepting his guilty plea; (4) becoming an active participant in the plea bargaining process by allegedly holding a \u201csecret pretrial conference\u201d from which the defendant and the public were unconstitutionally excluded; (5) refusing to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>charges for lack of a probable cause hearing; (6) denying the defendant\u2019s motion to disqualify the court on sentencing; (7) ruling that it lacked the authority to suspend a portion of the sentence; and (8) denying his motion for a waiver of fees, costs and expenses. The defendant also challenges the plea bargaining procedure on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The underlying facts of the crime leading to the defendant\u2019s guilty plea are as follows: On August 28, 1982, the defendant attended a birthday party for his daughter, held at the home of the child\u2019s mother in Waterbury. During the party, an argument occurred in which both the defendant and Juan Ortiz, the new boyfriend of the mother of the defendant\u2019s child, became involved. The defendant left the party and drove to his apartment, where he retrieved a shotgun and a box of shotgun shells. He returned to the party and confronted Juan Ortiz. The two men fought, and the defendant fired his gun, intending to hit Ortiz, but instead fatally shooting Sergio Torrez, who was standing nearby. The defendant fled from the house, and was apprehended by the police en route to Hartford later that night. The following morning, August 29, 1982, the defendant, having been fully advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, gave a signed statement to the Waterbury police recounting the events of the previous night.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">On October 5, 1982, the defendant was indicted for the crime of murder, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. The defendant retained counsel and initially entered a plea of not guilty. On April 18, 1983, after assurances from the state that the minimum sentence would be recommended, the defendant withdrew his original plea and entered a plea of guilty to the charged offense. The trial court conducted \u201ca typical searching canvass which included a detailed description of the nature of the charge\u201d and, after finding \u201cthat there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>was a factual basis for the charge and that the plea was voluntary,\u201d accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">On May 20,1983, the date on which sentencing was scheduled to take place, the defendant appeared with new counsel and filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming that \u201c[t]he plea was involuntary, or was entered without knowledge of the nature of the charge,\u201d and that it \u201cresulted from the denial of effective assistance of counsel.\u201d After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and sentenced him to twenty-five years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The defendant\u2019s primary claim on appeal is that the trial court erred in accepting his guilty plea and in denying his motion to withdraw that plea. He claims that the plea was involuntary, entered without knowledge of the nature of the charge against him and resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">A guilty plea that is not both voluntary and knowing is in violation of due process and thus void. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>174 Conn. 338, 340, 387 A.2d 550 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>170 Conn. 469, 473, 365 A.2d 1100 (1976). For a guilty plea to be truly voluntary, the defendant must understand the law in relation to the facts. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 466. Because a defendant waives several constitutional rights when he elects to plead guilty to a criminal offense, the choice of a guilty plea is of profound significance. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 120, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983). In pleading guilty, a defendant waives his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, his right to trial by jury and his right to confront his accusers. Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Book \u00a7 711 (5); <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>supra. A guilty plea is therefore constitutionally valid only if the record affirmatively discloses that the plea was entered voluntarily and intelligently. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 242; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>supra; <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>173 Conn. 360, 373, 377 A.2d 1108 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The defendant first claims that his guilty plea resulted from the denial of the effective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he asserts that his counsel should have questioned him about his intent at the time of the crime and should have informed him of the possibility of conviction of the lesser included offense of manslaughter if he lacked the requisite intent for murder. The defendant maintains that his counsel\u2019s failure so to question and inform him resulted in a plea which was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">A defendant must satisfy two requirements in order to prevail on a claim that his guilty plea resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>192 Conn. 383, 393, 472 A.2d 759 (1984). First, he must prove that the assistance was not \u201c \u2018within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law\u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>170 Conn. 273, 283, 365 A.2d 1167, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 962, 96 S. Ct. 1748, 48 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1976), quoting <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 639, 646, 356 A.2d 902 (1975) . . . .\u201d <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 393. Second, there must exist \u201c \u2018such an interrelationship between the ineffective assistance of counsel and the guilty plea that it can be said that the plea was not voluntary and intelligent because of the ineffective assistance. <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>161 Conn. 337, 344, 288 A.2d 58 (1971), aff\u2019d, 406 U.S. 250, 92 S. Ct. 1551, 32 L. Ed. 2d 45, reh. denied, 407 U.S. 934, 92 S. Ct. 2464, 32 L. Ed. 2d 817 (1972).\u2019 \u201d <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 393-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>In the present case, the defendant is unable to meet even the first of these two requirements. The record indicates that the defendant\u2019s original attorney adequately investigated the case and informed the defendant of the charge against him and the likelihood of a murder conviction. At the hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the defendant admitted that his counsel had told him of the possibility of conviction of manslaughter in some degree, but that \u201cthe probability of such a disposition was highly unlikely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">It is within the range of reasonably competent counsel for an attorney to advise his client to plead guilty even though defenses may conceivably exist. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>397 U.S. 790, 797-98, 90 S. Ct. 1458, 25 L. Ed. 2d 785 (1970); <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 770, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>584 F.2d 687 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Herring </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>491 F.2d 125, 128 (5th Cir. 1974). Here, the defendant had signed a voluntary statement that he had left the party in anger, driven to his home, retrieved a gun and ammunition, and returned to the party where he fired the shot that killed the victim. It was thus highly unlikely in this case that the defendant could successfully claim a lack of intent to reduce his conviction from murder to manslaughter. Based on this record, the advice which the defendant received was well within the range of competence required of attorneys representing clients in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court, in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, should not have considered the strength of the state\u2019s case and the probable outcome were the case to go to trial. In his brief, he characterizes the court\u2019s ruling as improperly resting on \u201c[t]he court\u2019s opinion [as to] the guilt or innocence of [the] accused.\u201d This characterization, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>however, is inaccurate. The defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea was largely premised on his assertion that the plea resulted from the ineffective assistance of counsel. As on appeal, the defendant\u2019s claim on the motion to withdraw was essentially that he had not been adequately informed of the possibility of a manslaughter conviction. In evaluating this claim, the trial court properly examined the strength of the state\u2019s case against the defendant in order to determine whether the defendant\u2019s counsel had acted competently in advising him to plead guilty. <em>McMann </em>v. Richardson, supra, 770-71; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 394. The court reviewed the defendant\u2019s voluntary statement to the police, as well as the probable testimony of a number of eyewitnesses, and found that \u201cthere was overwhelming evidence as to every element of murder and nothing whatsoever to support any claim of extreme emotional disturbance.\u201d This finding was not, as the defendant contends, an expression of the court\u2019s opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Rather, it reflected the court\u2019s assessment of the likely outcome of trial, which was necessary to evaluate the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court\u2019s analysis and ruling were entirely proper in the context of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court, in accepting his guilty plea, failed adequately to inform him of the nature of the charge against him, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 711 (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of this claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>he alleges that the court did not instruct him on the mens rea element of murder, and challenges the court\u2019s explanations regarding the state\u2019s burden of proof and the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 711 was designed to ensure that guilty pleas are made voluntarily and with full knowledge of the waiver of specific constitutional rights. <em>State </em>v. Suggs, 194 Conn. 223, 226, 478 A.2d 1008 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 357, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981). The record in this case establishes that the canvass by the trial court, prior to the acceptance of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, met the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 711. The defendant was correctly informed that \u201cthe State is held to a very, very high standard of proof. Any reasonable doubt must be resolved in your favor.\u201d Thereafter, the court quoted the statutory definition of murder contained in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, and explained its meaning to the defendant. Included in the court\u2019s explanation was the intent element of the offense, followed by a discussion of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. The court then proceeded to inform the defendant of the possible sentences for the offense charged, and the effect of a guilty plea, as opposed to a conviction after trial, with regard to his sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>At that point, the court asked the defendant, \u201cDo you understand?\u201d and the defendant responded in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u201c \u2018[W]here there has been a substantial compliance with [\u00a7 711], such that none of the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected rights has been infringed upon, the failure to comply with each and every requirement of [\u00a7 711] does not automatically require the vacating of the defendant\u2019s plea.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>supra, 360.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Suggs, </em>supra, 227. Under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s explanations to the defendant regarding the charged offense of murder, the affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>tive defense of extreme emotional disturbance and the state\u2019s burden of proof were entirely adequate to ensure that the defendant fully understood the nature of the charge to which the plea was offered, in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 711 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court, prior to accepting his guilty plea, failed to inform him of his right not to be compelled to incriminate himself, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 711 (5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record does not support this claim. After informing the defendant of his right to be tried by a jury or a three-judge panel, the presumption of innocence and the state\u2019s burden of proof, and his right to confront the witnesses against him, the trial court stated: \u201cBecause you are entitled to the presumption of innocence, it would not be necessary for you to put [on] a defense. If your decision was not to put [on] a defense, that could not be held against you. . . . If you did decide to put [on] a defense . . . you would have the right to make a further decision as to whether or not you yourself would take the stand, and if your decision was not to take the stand, again that cannot be held against you.\u201d The court then asked, \u201cDo you realize you\u2019re waiving all those rights by offering me this plea of guilty?\u201d to which the defendant replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Although the court did not specifically tell the defendant that he had \u201cthe right not to be compelled to incriminate himself,\u201d the substance of that right was adequately conveyed. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Suggs, </em>supra, 226-28, we considered a defendant\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of his guilty plea on similar grounds. There, the defendant complained that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s questions of the defendant whether he was waiving his \u2018right to face your accuser here in the courtroom\u2019 were insufficient to advise [him] of his right to confront and cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>examine witnesses.\u201d Id., 227. We rejected his claim, noting that \u201ca defendant unsophisticated in the law might be better informed of the right to confront witnesses by the use of the more commonly understood term, \u2018face.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote omitted.) Id., 228. Similarly, in this case, the trial court, in explaining to the defendant that he would not have to present a defense or take the stand at trial, and that any decision in that regard would not be held against him, may better have conveyed to the defendant the meaning of the right not to incriminate himself than had it used the exact terminology contained in Practice Book \u00a7 711 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In his brief, the defendant asserts that the trial court improperly became an active participant in the plea bargaining process. In support of this claim he alleges that the court \u201cunilaterally and in secret made an offer\u201d in a \u201csecret pretrial conference between the court, the State\u2019s Attorney and [defense counsel],\u201d which the defendant was not permitted to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">It is fundamental that the party who claims such an error has the burden of establishing its occurrence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>194 Conn. 573, 581, 484 A.2d 435 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>149 Conn. 655, 658-59, 183 A.2d 275, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 868, 83 S. Ct. 130, 9 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1962). In the present case, the defendant has not substantiated his claim of improper participation by the trial court in the plea negotiations. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant was in any way coerced or that his decision to plead guilty was not made of his own free will. Rather, the record demonstrates that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was made knowingly and that he was fully aware of all the consequences of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Prior to accepting the plea, the court asked the defendant, \u201cWas there any threat made to you to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>you to decide to plead guilty?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d The court further inquired, \u201cI don\u2019t mean by this, do you like it. We all know you don\u2019t. But was your decision to plead guilty made of your own free will?\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Thus, the record does not support a claim that the defendant did not approve of the negotiated plea, or that the court in any way pressured the defendant into pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The defendant also contends that under our state and federal constitutions, both he and the public had a right to be present at the \u201csecret pretrial conference.\u201d The single authority cited by the defendant in support of his claim, however, establishes only that the public has the right to be present at a trial. <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>448 U.S. 555, 100 S. Ct. 2814, 65 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1980). In this case, however, there was no trial because the defendant elected to plead guilty. Although there may have been a disposition conference from which the defendant was excluded, under our established rules of practice neither the defendant nor the public is entitled to attend such a proceeding. In fact, under Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 687 and 688, the prosecutor is not permitted to engage in plea negotiations directly with a defendant who is represented by counsel, except with defense counsel\u2019s permission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also Practice Book \u00a7 704. Furthermore, Practice Book \u00a7 967 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>does not include the disposition conference or plea negotiations among the specifically enumerated situations where a criminal defendant has the right to be present.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since the defendant does not challenge the constitutionality of these rules of practice, we need not further consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In a related claim, the defendant appears to argue that the plea bargaining was improper because it discouraged the exercise of his constitutional right to plead not guilty and to demand a trial by jury. The defendant\u2019s claim is without merit. Both federal and state cases have clearly established that plea bargaining is both desirable and constitutional. <em>Corbitt </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>439 U.S. 212, 219, 99 S. Ct. 492, 58 L. Ed. 2d 466 (1978); <em>Bordenkircher </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 361-62, 98 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 2d 604, reh. denied, 435 U.S. 918, 98 S. Ct. 1477, 55 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1978); <em>Staton </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>175 Conn. 328, 331-33, 398 A.2d 1176 (1978). A guilty plea should not be considered involuntary solely because it is the result of plea bargaining. \u201cIt is . . . well settled that plea agreements are consistent with the requirements of voluntariness and intelligence \u2014 because each side may obtain advantages when a guilty plea is exchanged for sentencing concessions, the agreement is no less voluntary than any other bargained-for exchange.\u201d <em>Mabry </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>467 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>504, 508, 104 S. Ct. 2543, 81 L. Ed. 2d 437 (1984). Since, as previously discussed, the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was entirely voluntary, his right to plead not guilty was not abridged simply by virtue of the fact that his guilty plea grew out of a plea bargaining arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The defendant\u2019s assertion that the plea bargaining impermissibly infringed on his constitutional right to demand a trial by jury is likewise untenable. \u201cWhile confronting a defendant with the risk of more severe punishment clearly may have a \u2018discouraging effect on the defendant\u2019s assertion of his trial rights, the imposition of these difficult choices [is] an inevitable\u2019 \u2014 and permissible \u2014 \u2018attribute of any legitimate system which tolerates and encourages the negotiation of pleas.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bordenkircher </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, 364, quoting <em>Chaffin </em>v. <em>Stynchcombe, </em>412 U.S. 17, 31, 93 S. Ct. 1977, 36 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1973). Prior to accepting the defendant\u2019s plea, the court specifically informed him that in pleading guilty he was waiving his right to a jury trial, and elaborated on the repercussions of his decision to forego this right. The defendant indicated that he realized he was waiving his right to be tried by offering to plead guilty, and nevertheless proceeded to enter a guilty plea. The defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to a jury trial precludes his present claim that the plea negotiations deprived him of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The defendant next claims that because this case was pending when article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution was amended to require a probable cause hearing for those charged with a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment, the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss the indictment filed against him and held a probable cause hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>defendant argues that while a dismissal of the indictment would not have prevented the state from refiling the charges, it would have vacated his guilty plea. This court has previously considered and decided this issue adverse to the defendant\u2019s position. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanabria, </em>192 Conn. 671, 474 A.2d 760 (1984), we held that although the amendment to article first, \u00a7 8, was adopted on November 24, 1982, no defendant who was indicted by a grand jury before the passage of legislation implementing the amendment on May 20, 1983, was entitled to a further pretrial finding of probable cause. Id., 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>In the present case, the defendant was indicted by a grand jury for the crime of murder on October 5, 1982. Thus, although his case was pending at the time the amendment was adopted on November 24, 1982, the defendant was indicted prior to that date and therefore was not entitled to a probable cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Prior to sentencing, the defendant filed a motion asking that the trial court determine its authority to \u201csuspend a portion of the minimum sentence as defined under [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-35a.\u201d In response, the court ruled that it did not have the authority to suspend a portion of the minimum twenty-five year sentence for murder. On appeal, the defendant claims error in this ruling, maintaining that the trial court had \u201cthe inherent equitable powers to suspend a portion of said minimum sentence.\u201d The defendant further argues that a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty-five years which could not be suspended or reduced would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The legislature has the authority to impose a mandatory minimum sentence for a specific crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>171 Conn. 677, 680, 372 A.2d 99 (1976). A trial court\u2019s power to impose a particular sentence is defined by statute, and the constitution does not require that the judiciary be given discretion in sentencing. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The defendant appears to argue that it is unclear whether the legislature intended murder to have a minimum sentence of twenty-five years without suspension. A brief review of our statutory sentencing provisions demonstrates that his argument is without merit. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-28 requires that a period of probation or conditional discharge be imposed upon the entire or partial suspension of a sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u00a7 53a-29 prohibits the imposition of a period of probation or conditional discharge for a class A felony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a, murder is defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>as a class A felony requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus the trial court was correct in its determination that it lacked the authority to suspend a portion of the minimum twenty-five year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">With regard to the defendant\u2019s assertion that a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment, without suspension, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>to the federal constitution, we need only refer to our recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>196 Conn. 655, 665-66, 495 A.2d 691 (1985), where we rejected a similar challenge to the penalty provision of our arson murder statute. As we held in <em>Dupree, </em>we cannot conclude that this defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cwas grossly disproportionate to the nature of the offense involved in this case.\u201d Id., 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to disqualify the court on sentencing. At the hearing on the motion to disqualify, the defendant argued that because his motion to withdraw his guilty plea was partially based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, his attorney-client privilege had been waived and the court consequently heard \u201ctestimony which was basically privileged in nature\u201d and that it was thus \u201cinappropriate ... for the court to . . . act as a sentencing judge.\u201d The defendant wished to be sentenced by a judge who had not heard the privileged testimony. The defendant expressed his intention to request that the sentencing judge suspend the twenty-five year sentence negotiated in the plea bargaining process after the defendant had served ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to disqualify, stating: \u201cI don\u2019t see how there can possibly be any prejudice to [the defendant] if I impose the minimum [sentence] . . . that is the least that any other judge could do. If I were to decide that something more than the minimum [sentence] was appropriate, I have already made it clear [that] I would give him the opportunity to withdraw his plea of guilty and stand trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">As previously discussed, neither the court that sentenced the defendant, nor any other court, would have been authorized to suspend any portion of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ant\u2019s mandatory minimum twenty-five year sentence for murder. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-28, 53a-29 and 53a-35a. The trial court was therefore entirely correct in concluding that, since the defendant could not receive any sentence lesser than that which the court intended to impose, he could in no way be prejudiced by any privileged statements heard by the court incident to his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The motion to disqualify the trial court on sentencing was thus properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">yin</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Finally, the defendant claims error in the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a waiver of fees, costs, surety and expenses \u201cso that he may file an appeal to the Supreme Court.\u201d The trial court based its denial of the defendant\u2019s motion on the fact that the defendant had retained a private attorney. We decline to decide whether or not the trial court\u2019s ruling on this motion was correct. On August 22, 1983, the defendant filed in this court a motion to compel the state to pay his fees and expenses, which we remanded for an indigency hearing in the trial court. The trial court never ruled on the motion, and the defendant withdrew it on December 27,1984. By withdrawing his motion without ever having made a sufficient showing of indigency in the trial court, the defendant abandoned his claim for a waiver of fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-13\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54a. murder defined, affirmative DEFENSES.

I\u2019ll read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the statute. A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or a third person. In other words, the State would have to prove that you caused the death of this victim and that you intended to kill someone, not necessarily the person who was actually killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u201cI want to point out to you what is called an affirmative defense. That you acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from your viewpoint in the situation which existed or as you reasonably believe them [sic] to be. If you were able to prove such extreme emotional disturbance, that would not mean that you would get off scot-free; it would mean that the charge would be reduced to what\u2019s called manslaughter in the first degree, the punishment of which is somewhat less than murder. I want to point out to you that on the charge of murder the minimum sentence under the statute is twenty-five years, the maximum is life, which is defined by the statute as being sixty years. In other words, if you were to go on trial and you were to be convicted, you could get anywhere from twenty-five years as a minimum to life which means sixty years as a maximum. I want you to understand this. I have already made a representation to your attorney, and I believe he has informed you of it, that my present intention is, at the time of sentencing, that I would impose the minimum sentence of twenty-five years in return for you having offered a plea of guilty. I did point out to your attorney that in the event the presentence investigation is very derogatory, I might feel that twenty-five years is insufficient, but in the event that that is my conclusion, at the time of sentencing I will offer you the opportunity to withdraw your plea of guilty and stand trial. On the other hand, if I do accept your plea of guilty today, and after review of the presentence investigation report, I feel at the time of sentencing that twenty-five years is appropriate, the minimum sentence, then, sir, you could not later change your mind and withdraw your plea of guilty without my permission which I do not have to give you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\"> See footnote 2, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b363-6\"> \u201c[Practice Book] Sec. 687. \u2014in general</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u201cThe prosecuting authority and counsel for the defendant, or the defendant when he is not represented by counsel, may engage in discussions at any time with a view towards disposition.
