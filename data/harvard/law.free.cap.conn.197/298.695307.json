Miner, was convicted by a jury of first degree sexual assault, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and of unlawful restraint in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was sentenced to an effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>term of eighteen years, suspended after fifteen years, and five years probation. The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction claiming that (1) the state\u2019s failure to make a timely disclosure of allegedly exculpatory identification information deprived him of his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial, and (2) his trial counsel\u2019s failure to seek sanctions or pursue further investigation upon the untimely disclosure of this information denied him the effective assistance of counsel. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">From the evidence adduced at trial, the jury could reasonably have found the following facts: On the evening of April 17, 1982, the complainant and her husband went to Danny\u2019s Cafe in Niantic, where they played pool with some friends and other customers, including the defendant. The complainant and her husband left the cafe at about 1:30 a.m. and went to the Lyme Tavern. About an hour later, after an argument with her husband, the complainant left the tavern to walk home alone. The tavern was approximately one mile from where she lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">While walking along route 156, the complainant saw the defendant standing in a lighted parking lot. Minutes later, she saw him hitch a ride from a passing car. As the complainant approached the intersection of route 156 and Fairhaven Road, she again observed the defendant. He approached her on foot and, after a brief conversation in which the defendant expressed his desire for her and the complainant warned him to leave her alone, he pulled her into the bushes alongside the road. There was a struggle, during which the defendant overpowered the complainant, throwing her to the ground and sexually assaulting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The complainant eventually broke free and ran away, naked from the waist down. She ran up Fairhaven Road to a lighted house nearby. She told the occupants of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the house that she had been raped and they took her in, gave her aid and called the police. Meanwhile, two of the men who were at the house, Robert Llewellen and James Suprenant, proceeded to the area where the complainant said the rape had occurred. In the illumination of a street light, Llewellen observed a man, clad only in his shirt and underwear, running from the spot the complainant had identified as the scene of the assault. Although Llewellen was able to see the man\u2019s face clearly, Suprenant was looking in a different direction and caught only a quick glimpse of the running man. Suprenant and Llewellen chased the man but were unable to catch him.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Both Llewellen and Suprenant testified at trial. Llewellen made a positive in-court identification of the defendant as a man he had seen earlier that evening at Danny\u2019s Cafe, and as the individual he had observed running from the scene of the crime. Suprenant, who had also been at Danny\u2019s Cafe earlier that night, could not identify the defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The complainant made an unequivocal in-court identification of the defendant at trial. Later during the course of the state\u2019s direct examination of the complainant, the state\u2019s attorney began to question her regarding a photographic identification session conducted by the police several days after the assault. Defense counsel objected and asked that the jury be excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In the jury\u2019s absence, the defendant\u2019s attorney conducted a voir dire examination of the complainant. The witness testified that she had been shown the photographs two days after the assault, which occurred on April 18,1982, whereupon defense counsel stated: \u201cI\u2019m going to object to any inquiry as to any photographic display made after the 19th\u201d on the ground \u201cthat counsel was appointed for the Defendant ... on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>April 19th . . . and any photographic confrontation without the assistance of counsel would be in violation of his sixth amendment and fourth amendment rights.\u201d Before the court had an opportunity to rule on the defendant\u2019s objection, the state\u2019s attorney interjected that he had \u201can ethical and professional duty to vouch for his witnesses . . . [and] on that basis . . . I have an obligation to inquire regarding the prior photo lineup which is, in fact, flawed. . . . She made a misidentification, Your Honor.\u201d At that point, defense counsel withdrew his objection and the court declared a short recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">After the recess, the jury returned to the courtroom and the state\u2019s attorney resumed his direct examination of the complainant regarding the photographic lineup. She testified that the police had visited her home and showed her a display of about ten photographs. After viewing the display, she informed the police that she \u201creally could not identify the person in the pictures.\u201d Although she picked out \u201ctwo that looked similar,\u201d she told the police that \u201cI could not pick out one certain one because I was not sure if that was the man, and I didn\u2019t want to point somebody out that was not the man who did this.\u201d The complainant further testified that she did not narrow her identification down to one picture, and that neither of the two photographs she selected was of the defendant, whose picture was in fact among those displayed. She explained her inability to recognize the defendant\u2019s photograph by saying \u201cit wasn\u2019t a very clear picture, and I would rather have seen him in person, and I just didn\u2019t want to pick somebody out if I wasn\u2019t really sure . . . but I know for a fact that [the defendant] is the man now because I see him in person, and I can just remember his face that night very clearly.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the state concluded its direct examination of the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>On cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel questioned the complainant regarding the photographic identification session. He offered the photographic display as a full evidentiary exhibit, and it was admitted without objection and passed among the jurors at counsel\u2019s request. During this portion of his cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s attorney attempted to impeach the complainant\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant by questioning her on her inability to recognize his photograph. He challenged her characterization of the defendant\u2019s picture as \u201cfoggy or unclear,\u201d and tried to cast doubt on her descriptive abilities and powers of perception by comparing her prior description of the defendant with the two photographs she had selected as looking most like her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">On May 10, 1982, the defendant had filed a pretrial motion for discovery and inspection in which he requested exculpatory information or materials including \u201c[njegative, inconsistent, ambiguous, or exhonorating [sic] results obtained in a showup, lineup, or photographic identification procedure.\u201d In its answer to the defendant\u2019s motion for discovery, the state indicated that it had no knowledge of any such exculpatory information or materials. While the defendant does not allege prosecutorial misconduct and conceded in oral argument that there is no reason to believe that the state intentionally withheld information regarding the complainant\u2019s faulty photographic identification, he argues that \u201cthe manner and timing of the prosecution\u2019s disclosure was clearly negligent and severely prejudiced [him] in the preparation and presentation of his defense.\u201d He claims on appeal that the prosecutor\u2019s disclosure during trial of the complainant\u2019s flawed photographic identification, after eliciting her unequivocal in-court identification of the defendant, denied him his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The defendant argues that the state\u2019s tardy disclosure of the allegedly exculpatory identification information was in violation of his constitutional rights as established in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976), and codified in General Statutes \u00a7 54-86c.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To obtain a new trial on the basis of a claim of tardy disclosure, \u201cthe defendant bears the burden of proving that he was prejudiced by the state\u2019s failure to make the information available to him at an earlier time.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115, 122, 496 A.2d 466 (1985). The defendant asserts that the timing of the disclosure was harmful in two respects. First, he maintains that the late discovery \u201cforeclosed [him] from pretrial investigation and/or exploration of the evidence underlying [the complainant\u2019s] in-court identification and out-of-court misidentification.\u201d Such investigation, the defendant suggests, might have furnished a basis for the suppression of the complainant\u2019s in-court identification. The second source of prejudice claimed by the defendant is that \u201cthe timing of the disclosure denied [him] an opportunity to develop, through additional discovery or otherwise, a defense based upon mistaken identity.\u201d Prior knowledge of the complainant\u2019s misidentification, he argues, would have enabled trial counsel to investigate the two men whose photographs were selected during the identification session, and would possibly have led to information implicating someone other than the defendant as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>We are unable to address on its merits the defendant\u2019s claim of prejudicial tardy disclosure of exculpatory material because it has not been properly preserved for appellate review both because of the defendant\u2019s withdrawal of his objection at trial and because of the inadequacy of the record. When the state first began to question the complainant regarding the photographic identification session, defense counsel initially objected to the inquiry, but, upon learning that the identification was \u201cflawed,\u201d immediately withdrew the objection. The defendant raised no claim of \u201csuppression\u201d of exculpatory information at trial, nor did he move the court for a continuance or for other relief. There was no request for a suppression hearing to determine whether or not the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>185 Conn. 402, 413, 441 A.2d 119 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 1612, 71 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1982); or to test the reliability of the complainant\u2019s in-court identification. Id., 418. Although on appeal the defendant asserts that investigation of the two men whose photographs were selected by the complainant might have yielded a successful defense based upon mistaken identity, he has presented nothing to indicate that either these two individuals or any other person besides the defendant was in any way connected with the charged offense. Compare <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Alldredge, </em>498 F.2d 376 (2d Cir. 1974). On this record, the defendant\u2019s claims of prejudice are purely speculative and cannot furnish a basis for the reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>188 Conn. 161, 448 A.2d 837 (1982), we declined to consider a similar claim of untimely disclosure due to the defendants\u2019 failure to raise the issue at trial. \u201cWhether acting wittingly or unwittingly defendants cannot decline to avail themselves of appropriate procedural motions at the trial at a time when curative action may be taken and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>expect this court to afford them relief on appeal without making a clear showing of a denial of a fundamental constitutional right, in this case that the delay in disclosure deprived them of a fair trial.\u201d Id., 178. In this case, the defendant not only withdrew an objection to the complainant\u2019s direct testimony regarding the photographic identification session, but he used this information to his own advantage in cross-examining the complainant. By choosing to proceed in this fashion at trial, the defendant effectively waived, for the purposes of appeal, any claim of error based on the state\u2019s late disclosure of exculpatory evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>197 Conn. 17, 24-25, 495 A.2d 1028 (1985). Although the defendant has <em>cited State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), in urging this court to review this claim, he has not presented a record that \u201cadequately supports a claim that [he] has clearly been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial.\u201d Id., 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The defendant also claims that his trial attorney\u2019s failure to request a suppression hearing, or to move for \u201cany of the applicable sanctions provided by [Practice Book \u00a7 747 for the state\u2019s failure to disclose information discoverable as of right under Practice Book \u00a7 740], including a . . . mistrial,\u201d constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe test that measures ineffective assistance of counsel requires a defendant to make two showings, that trial counsel\u2019s performance was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>reasonably competent or within the range of ordinary training and skill in the criminal law, and that trial counsel\u2019s lack of competence contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. [Citations omitted.] As we have repeatedly held, this test is difficult to meet on the face of an appellate record because such a record rarely reveals the strategic reasons behind the actions taken or not taken by trial counsel. For that reason, we have with increasing frequency declined to consider such claims on direct appeal, suggesting instead that their merits be addressed by recourse to habeas corpus. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>195 Conn. 475, 485, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobowitz, </em>194 Conn. 408, 413, 480 A.2d 557 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tirado, </em>[194 Conn. 89, 92-93, 478 A.2d 606 (1984)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>196 Conn. 567, 570, 494 A.2d 570 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">While the defendant recognizes this court\u2019s reluctance \u201cto resolve this kind of claim upon a direct appeal rather than after a habeas corpus proceeding where facts and circumstances often not disclosed by a trial transcript can be fully developed and the lawyer who represented the defendant at trial can be heard from\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Orsini, </em>187 Conn. 264, 280, 445 A.2d 887, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 861, 103 S. Ct. 136, 74 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1982); he submits that in this case \u201cthe \u2018facts and circumstances\u2019 are sufficiently clear from the record and trial transcript to warrant direct review.\u201d At oral argument, the defendant focused on his trial counsel\u2019s failure adequately to investigate the circumstances of the photographic identification procedure to determine the reliability of the complainant\u2019s in-court identification. He maintained that his attorney\u2019s failure to request a suppression hearing was inexcusable and he appeared to argue that this omission was prima facie evidence of ineffective assistance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Although on the record before us we can only speculate as to why trial counsel chose to cross-examine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>complainant with regard to her flawed photographic identification rather than to pursue other available options, we are able to conceive of several tactical reasons for proceeding as he did. For example, the defendant\u2019s attorney might have decided that a motion to suppress the complainant\u2019s in-court identification would be futile in light of her testimony that she had had several opportunities to view the defendant, both before the crime, at Danny\u2019s Cafe and in a lighted parking lot on route 156 as she was walking home, and during the attack. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 415-16 (among the factors which determine the reliability of an identification is the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">We are likewise unpersuaded that trial counsel\u2019s failure to seek a continuance to conduct further discovery compels a finding of inadequate representation. The complainant testified that she did not positively identify any of the photographs displayed as that of her assailant, but merely selected two pictures that she thought most closely resembled him. From this testimony trial counsel might well have concluded that an investigation aimed at inculpating another individual as the perpetrator would be fruitless. Such a conclusion would certainly have been reasonable given the positive identification of the defendant supplied by Robert Llewellen. On the appellate record presently before us, we cannot conclude that the defendant was denied adequate assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-11\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-70. sexual assault in the first degree: class b felony: one year not suspendable.
