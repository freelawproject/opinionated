Paragraph 11 contained a denial that the contingency upon which the obligation of the bond depended had occurred, but such fact was not pleaded in form nor numbered as a separate defense.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b580-11\">The court at General Term, held :</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">\u201c It is quite clear that the 4th subdivision of the answer was redundant, being a mere reiteration of a similar allegation in the complaint. The allegations in the subsequent subdivisions (5-10) are unnecessarily prolix; but taken as a whole I am not prepared to say that they do not constitute a plea of such former adjudication against the plaintiff\u2019s claim as would, if true, defeat his right of action. When there is a semblance of a cause of action or defense set up in the pleading, its sufficiency cannot be determined on motion to strike out as redundant or irrelevant. It seems that the proper way to test the validity of the pleading is by demurrer or by motion on trial (Walter <em>v. </em>Fowler, 85 <em>N. Y. </em>621; Fettretch <em>v. </em>McKay, 47 <em>Id. </em>426 ; Collins <em>v. </em>Suau, 7 <em>Robt. </em>94; Trinity Church <em>v. </em>Higgins, 48 <em>N. Y. </em>532). It seems to me the plaintiff\u2019s proper remedy was, first to move that the defendant state the defenses separately, and then to test the sufficiency of these allegations by a demurrer.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>Winsor &amp; Marsh, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b581-5\"><em>Abel E.
