The defendant never noticed the case for trial. ' The complaint was dismissed January' 3, 1882, for want of prosecution, and defendant noticed his costs for taxation. The plaintiff \u201e objected, before the clerk, to all except the first and fourth items of the bill, on the ground that the action having been dismissed for failure to prosecute, the defendant was entitled to disbursements, costs before notice of trial, and costs of motion only, and the clerk sustained the objections. The costs were taxed at $20, and the disbursements at $2.27, total' $22.27. Defendant moved at .special term for a new taxation, which the court denied.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-12\"><em>Johnson &amp; Cantine, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-13\"><em>George W.

Neither from the language of the Code nor from any reported case, can I find that a party\u2019s right to the costs in question der pends strictly upon the fact that he noticed the cause for trial. Tillspaugh <em>v. </em>Dick (8 <em>How. Pr. </em>33), is plainly distinguishable. In that case there were two defendants. One of them had noticed the cause for trial, and as to him the complaint had been dismissed. As to the defendant who asserted the claim for costs after notice of trial, and for term fees, the cause had been noticed by neither side, and it was in view of this fact, and in reference to this defendant, that the court observed: \u201c As to this defendant the cause has never been noticed for trial; .... it was never on the calendar as between these parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The costs' under consideration, it seems to me, are given to either party for preparation rendered necessary in consequence of the service of a notice of trial. The preparation to be made is the same whether only one or both parties give such notice. If I am correct in this, it follows that in the case at bar it was an immaterial fact that the defendant had failed to notice the cause for trial, because it appeared that the plaintiff had dope so, and that the cause, had been necessarily on the calendar for more than five terms under said notice, during which time the defendant was compelled to attend, though he was not in a position to take the plaintiff s default.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The order should be reversed with $10 costs, and a new taxation ordered, with instructions to the clerk to allow $15 after notice of trial, and $50 for term fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Russell, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
