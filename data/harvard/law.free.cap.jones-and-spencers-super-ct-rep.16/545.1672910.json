The former general term ascertained what facts alleged in the complaint constituted a cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>or causes of action, and what was the proper relief. Of course this general term cannot review the decision. The peculiarities of the situation are practically shown by the fact that defendants now present two forms of judgment, which seem to be based upon distinctly different views of plaintiff\u2019s rights. There is no sufficient ground, therefore, for directing judgment as asked by the defendants. It is not intended to deny that this court would have the power to vacate the judgment entered by the clerk, if it appeared that it was not in conformity with the order which the former general term made. In this case, however, in view of its history disclosed by the record, it does not appear that the defendants have an absolute right to have this question determined. The correspondence between the attorneys shows that the case was shaped for the purpose of getting the judgment of the court of appeals upon the rights of the parties. If the present judgment were set aside, it might result in another hearing at a general term of the appeal from the special term. An appeal from the present judgment, will result in an adjustment of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b578-4\"><em>David Dudley Field </em>and <em>Dorsheimer, Bacon </em>&amp; <em>Deyo, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b578-5\"><em>Julian T.
