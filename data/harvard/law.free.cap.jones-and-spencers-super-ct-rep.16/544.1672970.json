The order was settled on notice, and was absolute. The original plaintiff having died, the action was revived, and thereafter, and on or about May 10, 1882, judgment herein was entered without notice of any kind. Thereupon defendant\u2019s counsel moved the special term to vacate or re-settle the order upon an affidavit of one of the attorneys for defendant, in which he states that the judgment was entered without notice, and that he believes that it does not express the intent of the court. This motion was denied.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b576-13\">The court at G-eneral Term held:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>Dorsheimer, Bacon &amp; </em>Deyo, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b577-5\"><em>Julian T. Davies </em>and <em>Roger </em>Foster, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">\u201cAfter settlement of a general term order and the taxation of costs, the entry of judgment follows as matter of course. It is the clerk\u2019s duty to see that the judgment conforms to the order. Neither the law nor the practice of the court requires notice of entry of judgment to be given. The question was made, not that the judgment did not follow the order, but that the judgment did not express the intent of the court. This was not a question for the special term to pass upon.</p>\n<author id=\"b577-6\">Opinion Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
