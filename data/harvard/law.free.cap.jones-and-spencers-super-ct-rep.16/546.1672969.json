The deceased was sitting on the left side of an open car, and as the car was turning a curve to the left, he fell out to the left and almost immediately expired. The curve was not a sharp one, and the witnesses all agreed that the rate of speed at which the car approached and passed the curve did not exceed four miles per hour, and that they noticed or felt nothing\" beyond the\" ordinary jar which is usually experienced on such an occasion. According to the testimony, the deceased fell out contrary to the known laws of force, and the occurrence was not accounted for. There was no evidence showing improper management of the horses or the car, or a defect in the car or the track. The cause of the fall was left to conjecture.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-6\">A. <em>G. </em>Vanderpoel, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-7\"><em>Hutchins </em>&amp; <em>Platt </em>and <em>Austin G.

She was bound to adduce competent proof of facts showing negligence in the defendant or its servants (Baulec <em>v. </em>N. Y. <em>&amp; </em>H. R. R. Co., 59 <em>N.
