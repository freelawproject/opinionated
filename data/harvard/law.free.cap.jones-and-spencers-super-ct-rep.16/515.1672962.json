It claims, that these services were, together with disbursements expended on that behalf, reasonably worth the sum of $5,000, and admits payment on account thereof of $975. A bill of particulars furnished the defendant consists simply of a copy of the entries in the plaintiff\u2019s register, showing the different steps taken in rendering these services, but no specific charges for what was done, but only a gross charge of $5,000. These entries in the register consist of fifty-one items. The answer admits the employment and rendition of the services, and making the disbursements, but denies the value thereof as stated, and any value whatever, beyond the sum al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ready paid therefor, and for which credit is given to the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit read on the motion admits that none of the fifty items in his bill of particulars have separate charges made in detail, but that he has charged the sum of $5,000 in gross for the services, and credited the defendant with the sum of $975.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-6\"><em>R.

It is not the immediate object of the suit to take any account or the ground of defense. There is no account to be examined, for it is not disputed. The single issue to be tried, are the services of the value o\u00a3 $5,000, or of any value beyond the sum admitted to have been paid. The case is controlled by the following cases, among others: Bathgate <em>v. </em>Haskins, 59 <em>N. Y. </em>533; Kain <em>v. </em>Delano, 11 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>29 ; Felt v. Tiffany, 11 Hun, 62.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Opinion by Speir, J.; Sedgwick, Ch.
