By the common law, the death of either party before judgment abates an action. So that it is only by reason of and under the statutory provisions that an action can be revived. Section 757 of Code of Civil Procedure provided only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>for the revival of an action in the event of the death of <em>\u201c </em>a sole plaintiff or defendant.\u201d There is no section of the Code, nor is there any statute providing for the revival of an action in the event of the death of <em>botJi </em>a sole plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-5\">In Coit <em>v. </em>Campbell (50 <em>Hun, </em>50), the court held that section 757 was inapplicable, except in cases coming entirely within its language.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b339-6\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asg\">This action came on for trial in March, 1861, and the trial ended with the withdrawal of a juror at plaintiff\u2019s request. Since that time both parties to the action died\u2014the plaintiff on December <em>22, </em>1864, and the defendant on July <em>22, </em>1879. Up to the time of defendant\u2019s death no further step had been taken in the action by the plaintiff or his representatives. On October 31, 1881, an order was obtained from one of the judges of this court requiring the executors of the deceased defendant to show cause why the action should not be continued in the name of the administrator of the deceased plaintiff. Upon the hearing the motion was denied. Indeed I do not see how it could have been granted. Aside from the objection founded upon the lapse of nearly seventeen years since the plaintiff\u2019s death, the death of both parties to the action was a bar to the motion. The court had no longer any jurisdiction in the premises. The provisions of the Code directing a continuance of the action by or against the representative of a party to the action who died since the commencement of the action (\u00a7\u00a7 755-760), do not include a case in which all the parties to the action are dead at the time of the motion ; and by the common law the action abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., and Arnoux, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
