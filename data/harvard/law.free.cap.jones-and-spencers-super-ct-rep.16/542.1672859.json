The plaintiff testified that in the accident proved, she fell and broke her knee-pan. She was taken to a hospital and there remained for three months and ten days ; in the hospital she underwent great pain ; she made a livelihood by coloring photographs and doing crayon work; in coloring photographs, she was employed five days in the week, her salary for that being $9 ; for three days\u2019 crayon work she would receive $30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>or $40, but coloring photographs brought in work more regularly ; after the accident she did not apply for work in coloring photographs, because it was painful to sit any length of time. The surgeon who attended her at the hospital testified, that when she left the hospital, she had a good result; that there was, at the time he testified,'some stiffness of the knee and some swelling; that it was somewhat stiff, but not what is ordinarily called a stiff joint; that in such cases it was probably from six months to two years before there was a thoroughly good use of the joint; that there was no indication that it would be a permanent injury ; that it would take some time, but eventually she would have a good joint; that there was slight danger, very slight indeed, that there would be permanent disability ; that it was impossible to say how long she would be lame ; it depended upon herself ; if used, it would be a good joint; if not used, the stiffness would remain <em>-f </em>that at present she could not go up or down stairs without assistance ; that except so far as being required to walk or go a great distance to work, she could do the business of coloring photographs very well; that the injury would not interfere with her sitting at work. The accident happened October 20, 1881, and the trial' began February 8, 1882. 0</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-5\"><em>D.

The learned judge below seemed to incline to that opinion, but thought it best-that the general term should pass upon the question on appeal. The plaintiff\u2019s case showed, that the consequences of the injury would not be permanent. The damages that may be recovered, are such as the proof shows to be reasonably certain of occurrence (Curtis <em>v. </em>Rochester and S. R. R. Co., 18 <em>N. Y. </em>534). No estimation of past loss of occupation and pain, and the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>future consequences according to the evidence, would justify the jury in fixing the amount of compensation at $6,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The practice is to deem the successful party, in such a case, not responsible for the action of the jury: The</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">new' trial, therefore, should be upon the terms that the defendant pay the trial fee and the. disbursements of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">New trial ordered, upon payment of costs above indicated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
