Defendant contended that plaintiff\u2019s compensation was contingent upon certain conditions which had not been fulfilled. During the progress of the trial the plaintiff read in evidence three letters written by defendant to him, one of which contained, this paragraph: \u201cI have had a talk with Mr. Palmer since I saw you this morning, and have induced him to give your claims a better consideration.\u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The court at General Term held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u201c Neither the words \u2018your claims\u2019 nor the context, demonstrated of themselves the subject matter of the conversation referred to in the letter. It required extrinsic evidence to elucidate and explain what ' those claims \u2019 were. In such cases parol evidence is always, admissible for the purpose of applying the instrument to the facts <em>(2 Phill. Ev. </em>ch. VIII. \u00a7 3). In accordance with this doctrine the defendant\u2019s counsel subsequently read said sentence to the defendant, and asked him \u2018 to state to what that referred,\u2019 whereupon the counsel for plaintiff objected on the ground that \u2018 the letter speaks for itself,\u2019 and the objection was sustained. This ruling was erroneous on the ground assigned for its exclusion. The letter should have been excluded or explained. The counsel for the plaintiff now contends that if upon any ground the question might have been ruled out, the ruling should be sustained, and that the ruling was proper, because it called, for the opinion of the witness, and was leading. Neither proposition as contended for is correct. Where a. specific ground of objection is urged and ruled upon, the party is bound thereby. The reason is apparent. An objection, if validly urged, to the form of a question, can readily be obviated, or if to the competeney of. the evidence, other and competent proof may by sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>plied. And the question did not call for the opinion or conclusion of the witness. It called for a fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b560-5\"><em>Theodore H.
