S. </em>(5 ed.) 978: \u201c No person shall hereafter transact business in the name of a partner not interested in his firm, and where the designation \u2018and company \u2019 or \u2018&amp; Co.\u2019 is used, it shall represent an actual partner or partners.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-14\">The testimony showed the following facts. In 1874, the plaintiff and Thomas F. Pettus, composed a firm, which was styled Pollard, Pettus &amp; Co. In that year, the defendant agreed in writing to sell to Pollard, Pettus &amp; Co., certain piece of real estate in Texas, which the contract stated was now deeded to Messrs. Wood<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ward, Stillman &amp; Co. as collateral security, and certain other pieces of real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\">Thomas F. Pettus died July 6, 1875. The surviving members of the firm, on August 4, 1875, had a transaction, the nature of which is indicated by the following receipt signed by the defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-6\">\u201c New York, August 4, 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-7\">\u2018 \u2018 Received of Messrs. Pollard, Pettus &amp; Co., 400 shares of Houston City R. R. stock, out of the proceeds of a loan on which I promise to liquidate a debt due Woodward <em>&amp; </em>Stillman and make a clear title to the said Pollard, Pettus &amp; Co., to a certain 80 blocks of land, &amp;c., as per my title bond, executed to them in 1874.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-8\">January 3, 1877, the defendant gave the note in question, and the plaintiffs signed, by the name Pollard, Pettus &amp; Co., an agreement to the following effect, that whereas Pollard, Pettus &amp; Co. now hold two contracts,, being those above referred to, and whereas said Brady has not yet completed said contracts and has executed, the said promissory note, it is agreed that said Pollard, Pettus &amp; Co., at any time before final settlement, shall have the right to elect to receive either payment of the note or a conveyance of the lands, it being understood that according to the election of the plaintiffs, the defendant should be released from the alternative obligation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\">One of the plaintiffs testified, that at the time of receiving the note, the plaintiffs were doing a commission business in the city of New York under the firm name of Pollard, Pettus &amp; Co., and continued the business under that name to the time of testifying.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-10\">He also testified that part of the business of the present firm consisted in liquidating the affairs of the former firm of Pollard, Pettus &amp; Co. of which Mr. Thomas-F. Pettus was a member, and that the present firm took. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the note in the course of the liquidation of the affairs, of the former firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">On motion, the complaint was dismissed on the ground that the note was taken by the plaintiffs in the name of Pollard, Pettus &amp; Co. in violation of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">Exceptions were ordered to be heard in first instance, at general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-7\"><em>Richard H. </em>Barker, attorney, and <em>Frederick H. </em>Man, of counsel, for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-8\"><em>Harry </em>Wilbur, attorney, and of counsel, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b511-9\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3A\">I am of opinion, that so far as the transaction went in fact, in the mere taking of the note, the case of Wood <em>v. </em>Erie Railway Company (72 N. <em>Y. </em>196), requires us to hold, that it was not in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">In the case cited, the plaintiffs were doing business-under a firm name, that was in violation of the^tatute. In that firm name he bought a carriage. It was delivered by him to the defendant at Buffalo to be transported to New York and to be delivered thereto plaintiff. It was marked by the firm name. The action was-for injuries to the carriage, done in the course of transportation. The court of appeals held that \u201c the shipping and receiving of carriages was not the business of the plaintiff, but merely incidental to the business of manufacturing and dealing in this species of property.\u201d In this case it was a separate and distinct matter^ outside of the plaintiffs\u2019 ordinary business, and in no wise a violation of the statute. The court also considered that to invalidate a particular transaction, it must be within the mischief which it was the object of the statute to remedy ; and that that mischief was the effect of representing, by a fifm name, that the firm had, as. partners, some one, whose name was not disclosed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the firm name, and the tendency therefrom to induce credit upon the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In the present case, the note was isolated and separated from the business of buying and selling goods on commission, which was the general business of the plaintiffs. It had no connection with that business, directly or indirectly. It was \"taken in the process of adjusting the rights of the parties, in a contract for the convey and of real estate. The scope of the transaction was of a nature that would not bring the defendant within any of the consequences that the statute was pointed against.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">If the transaction was not illegal, the remaining question, whether the plaintiffs could show that they were the persons designated by the name of the payee in the note, to wit, Pollard, Pettus &amp; Co., should be answered in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Exceptions sustained, order reversed and new, trial ordered, with costs of the motion to the plaintiff to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Truax, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
