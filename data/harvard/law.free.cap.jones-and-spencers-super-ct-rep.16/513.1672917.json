There was very little evidence that the stockbrokers had advanced money for the defendant in purchasing the stock in question, or of the terms of the contract, if there were one, between the parties. The judge, in charging the jury, said, \u201c The question is, whether the plaintiff has proved enough to make the defendant pay for the difference between the price paid for the stock and the price for which it was sold. The plaintiff undertook to discharge his duty, and there is nothing that appears here to the contrary.\u201d The counsel for defendant, beside excepting to the remark last cited, requested the court to charge \u201c that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove, the purchase, sale and amount of loss on this Rock Island stock transaction.\u201d This request was refused.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The court at General Term, held: \u201c That this charge would have been a practical aid to the jury in determining what the fact was upon the testimony that was not explicit or full. It would have prevented the jury from thinking that it was enough if it did not appear that the brokers had failed in their duty. The plaintiff was bound affirmatively to prove what the contract was, and that the brokers had fulfilled their part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201cAs the answer stood, it did not permit proof of the counter-claim as presented by defendant\u2019s evidence. The breach alleged by the answer was, that the brokers did not account for the money of defendant, alleged to have been received by them. The proof was, that they expended the money on certain North Carolina bonds. The defendant had ordered the money to be expended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>on North Carolina bonds. He was informed that the brokers had bought the bonds, and they were delivered to him. His allegation was that the bonds were nob valid. The answer was not sustained.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b547-5\"><em>George Putnam Smith, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b547-6\"><em>Jacob S.
