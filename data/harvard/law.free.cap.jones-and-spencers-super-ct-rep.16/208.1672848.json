Whitehouse and Henry Elliott, and John O. Whitehouse and Henry Elliott, as executors of the last will testament of Joseph O. Whitehouse, deceased, and Henrietta Hollingshead and Charles Aikman, as executors of the last will and testament of William M. Hollingshead, deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-12\">It alleges that in September, 1867, Joseph T. White-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>house and William M. Hollingshead, as partners, recovered a judgment for $1,074, against one Abraham Solomon, from which judgment, which carried a right of arrest, Solomon sought to be discharged' by various proceedings in bankruptcy and in the court of common pleas ; that Whitehouse and Hollingshead employed the plaintiff to resist Solomon\u2019s applications to be relieved from the judgment, agreeing that for such services the plaintiff should have one-half of the judgment and should have and receive one-half of the money that should thereafter be collected and received thereon. The plaintiff claims that he performed his contract and prevented Solomon\u2019s discharge, and that, thereafter, Whitehouse and Hollingshead having died\u2014-the former in 1869 and the latter in 1871\u2014the persons named in the title of this action were appointed their executors, and that afterwards, on June 28, 1871, the defendants received from Solomon, without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff, the amount of the judgment, and satisfied the judgment of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\">The plaintiff now claims that being entitled to one-half of the amount recovered by the defendants, he is entitled to an accounting on the equity side of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">The defendants deny the agreement, deny that they received the full amount of the judgment from Solomon, but allege that it was compromised at $215 ; allege a release by the plaintiff to Solomon of his interest; allege that they were appointed executors in 1870, published the usual notices, and were discharged from their trust in 1879, the plaintiff having made no claim against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">John O. Whitehouse died in August, 1881, whereupon this motion to revive the action against his executors was made.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-8\"><em>Mansfield </em>Compton, appellant in person.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>Alonzo C. Farnham, </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b242-5\">By the Court.\u2014Horace Russell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFW\">This motion was made below, and the appeal from the order denying it was argued before us, oh the assumption that the plaintiff had stated in his complaint a cause of action against the defendants personally, as well as against them as executors of their respective testators. The argument was that the alleged injurious acts of the executors of Whitehouse and Hollingshead, as stated in the complaint, were in exercising control and dominion over the plaintiff\u2019s part of the judgment and in receiving his part of the produce thereof, behind his back and without his knowledge or assent, and did not consist merely in breaches of the decedent\u2019s promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The contract, as alleged between the plaintiff and the decedent, stated in the view most favorable to the plaintiff, did not contemplate that they should be prevented from collecting the judgment and satisfying it. If the deceased had a right to collect it, their executors had. The plaintiff claims that he was to have one-half the judgment or one-half of whatever amount should be collected thereon. It cannot be said that this <em>per se </em>made him the legal owner of one-half the judgment as it stood upon the record. It amounts to no more than fixing his compensation at one-half of whatever should be collected upon the judgment; that is to say, it was a contract between the deceased that in the event of their ever collecting anything on the judgment, they would pay to the plaintiff one-half of the sum so collected. It cannot, then, be said that it would have been a wrongful act in them, as against the plaintiff, to collect and to satisfy the judgment, with or without the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, nor was it wrongful in their executors to do, with reference to a judgment standing in their name, what they would have had the right to do if living. It was an act done in their representative capacity\u2014simply the collection of the assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>of the deceased, and the plaintiff had his right of action to recover upon his contract the amount agreed to be paid him by the deceased. And that was' all.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The complaint does not state a cause of action against the defendants individually, and the motion to revive the action against the personal representatives was, therefore, properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
