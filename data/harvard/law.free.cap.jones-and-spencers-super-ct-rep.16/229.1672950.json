The case was tried before a judge with a jury, and the complaint was dismissed as to the Sixth avenue Railroad Company, and the trial proceeded as to the other defendant, and resulted in a verdict against it for $10,500. Judgment was entered by the plaintiff against the Twenty-third street Railroad Company for that amount and costs, and dismissing his complaint as to the Sixth avenue Railroad Company, and for its costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-10\">Thereupon the Twenty-third street Railroad Company appealed, both as against the plaintiff and its co-defendant, the Sixth, avenue Railroad Company, and the Six th avenue Railroad Company moved to dismiss the appeal as to it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-11\"><em>C.

Company.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZB\">No appeal can be taken by a party against whom no judgement has been entered by the respondent against whom he appeals. Liability for a negligence or tort is several, and an action may be brought and maintained against either (Kain <em>v. </em>Smith, 80 <em>N. Y. </em>458). Under this authority, the plaintiff could discontinue his action as to the defendant, the Sixth avenue Railroad Company, and continue it as to the defendant, the Twenty-third street Railway Company, and the latter defendant cannot object, and would have no right to appeal from an order to that effect; and for a stronger reason it has no right to appeal from a judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint as to the defendant, the Sixth avenue Railroad Company. There can be no claim for contribution between wrong-doers (Peck <em>v. </em>Ellis, <em>2 Johns. </em>130; Wehle <em>v. </em>Haviland, 42 <em>How. Pr. </em>399 ; Miller <em>v. </em>Fenton, 11 Paige, 18 ; Anderson <em>v. </em>Murray, 33 <em>Barb. </em>354; 1 Hill on Torts, 185, note a; Lingard <em>v. </em>Bramley, 1 <em>Vesey &amp; B. </em>117; Merriweather v. Nixon, 8 <em>Term R. </em>186). This being so, the defendant, the Twenty-third street Railway Company, has no right to appeal as to its co-defendant, the Sixth avenue Railroad Company.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b262-5\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, Ch.
