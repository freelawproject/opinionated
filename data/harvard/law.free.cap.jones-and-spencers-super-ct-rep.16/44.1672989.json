It was commenced on January 15, 1880. The defendants pleaded the one year\u2019s statute of limitation, and the reply was that she had three years under the Code of Civil Procedure, and that the period had not elapsed when the suit was brought. The only exception raised is to the ruling of the court denying a motion to dismiss the complaint after the proofs were in.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-4\"><em>A.

On June 5, 1877, the repealing act was passed by section 383, subdivision 5, and went into effect September 1, 1877, repealing absolutely section 94, subdivision <em>2 </em>of the Code of Procedure, containing the one year clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel claims that the case is within the exceptions of section 414 of the Code as .amended. When subdivision 4 of that section went into effect, the time to commence the action had not expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">When the injury occurred, April 18, 1877, the plaintiff had one year in which to bring the action. The repealing act was j&gt;assed and took effect within the year, viz., on September 1, 1877, and the time of limitation was changed from one to three years, and there is no saving clause in the repealing act by which the act repealed can have any application in this case \u2022under the provisions of the Code. It certainly could not be in the mind of the legislature, while extending the statute from one to three years, that they should cut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>off the short time of one year secured to a party, as a matter of law, to a period of about four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Where an act of parliament is repealed, it must be considered, except as to transactions passed and closed, as if it never existed <em>(Dwarris on Statutes, </em>676).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
