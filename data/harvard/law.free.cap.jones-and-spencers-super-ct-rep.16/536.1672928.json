O\u00ed. </em>94), it was held that \u2018 the legislature intended to confine the action of this court under the statute to such disposition of the money as in its discretion may be proper, only so long as the same remains in the hands of the chamberlain,\u2019 and that the statute did not authorize its withdrawal from his hands.\u2019 The case of Hatch <em>v. </em>Mayor (82 W. <em>Y. </em>436) does not overrule this construction of the statute. The prayer of the petition must, therefore, be denied.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-13\"><em>Evarts and Secor, </em>for petitioner, appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-14\"><em>W.

The case at bar falls within the principle of the Hatch case (43 <em>Super: Ct. </em>94), and should be controlled by the decision of that case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">Opinion by Freedman, J.; Russell, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"Arq\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
