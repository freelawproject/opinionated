We conclude that such a cause of action does not accrue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>until the seller fails to perform the required repair within a reasonable period of time. We reach the same conclusion with respect to a warranty claim under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">On March 23,1993, plaintiff purchased a new 1992 Dodge Spirit manufactured by defendant DaimlerChrysler Corporation. When he made this purchase, plaintiff elected to obtain a seven-year, seventy-thousand-mile \u201cpowertrain\u201d warranty from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Plaintiffs claims arise out of a series of repairs and replacements of the \u201cengine timing belt,\u201d which was one of the parts covered by the powertrain warranty. On December 16, 1993, after the car had been driven 16,408 miles, plaintiff had the timing belt replaced. More than three years later, on March 21, 1997, after the car had been driven 36,149 miles, plaintiff had the belt repaired. Plaintiff then had to have the belt replaced on May 16, 1997, January 5, 1998 and July 6, 1998. According to plaintiff, the timing belt again failed on July 31,1998, causing the destruction of the \u201cshort block\u201d of the engine, which the dealer took six months to repair. All of these timing belt repairs and replacements were purportedly performed by defendant in accordance with the seven-year, seventy-thousand-mile powertrain warranty obtained by plaintiff when he purchased the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">On December 15, 1998, plaintiff brought this action against defendant for breach of the seven-year, seventy-thousand-mile powertrain warranty. Plaintiff also asserted claims under the Lemon Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-29 to -49, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2301-2312, and the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -106.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that . plaintiffs complaint and supporting exhibits did not state a claim under the Lemon Law and that plaintiffs other claims were barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his response, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>indicated that he was not pursuing his claim under the Consumer Fraud Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion as to plaintiffs other claims and dismissed the complaint. The court held that plaintiffs claim under the Lemon Law was barred because he had not given defendant notice and an opportunity to correct the alleged defect within the first 18,000 miles of operation. The court dismissed plaintiffs warranty and Magnuson-Moss Act claims as untimely because they were not brought within four years after delivery of the car. The court rejected plaintiffs argument that his warranty and Magnuson-Moss claims were timely because the seven-year, seventy-thousand-mile powertrain warranty was \u201ca guarantee of performance\u201d which defendant breached by failing to properly repair the timing belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Plaintiff appeals. We affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs Lemon Law claim, but reverse the dismissal of his warranty and Magnu-son-Moss Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">To assert a claim under the Lemon Law, a complaint must allege that (1) \u201c[the plaintiff] report[ed] a nonconformity in [the] motor vehicle to the manufacturer or its dealer dining the first 18,000 miles of operation or during the period of two years following the date of original delivery ..., whichever is earlier,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-31, and that (2) \u201cthe manufacturer or its dealer [was] unable to repair or correct [the] nonconformity within a reasonable time,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-32(a). If a plaintiff can establish both of these preconditions for relief under the Lemon Law, he is entitled to return the vehicle to the manufacturer and to receive \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>full refund of the purchase price ..., less a reasonable allowance for vehicle use.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-32(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Although plaintiff alleges that he brought his car to the dealer for repair of the engine timing belt when it had been driven less than 18,000 miles and within two years of delivery, he does not allege that the dealer failed to correct this condition within a reasonable time. To the contrary, he states that the dealer replaced the timing belt, and that he continued driving the car for three more years before he experienced any problems with the replacement belt. When that occurred, the car had been driven more than 36,000 miles and four years had elapsed since defendant delivered the car to plaintiff. Thus, the period of protection the Lemon Law provides a purchaser of a new automobile had expired at least two years earlier. Moreover, plaintiff did not offer any evidence that the replacement engine timing belt installed in his car in 1993 was defective or that the dealer improperly installed this part. Consequently, there is no basis for a claim under the Lemon Law, which only applies to an uncorreeted nonconformity that is reported within the first 18,000 miles of operation or within two years after delivery of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We also note that the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs, which is responsible for administration of the Lemon Law, see <em>DiVigenze v. Chrysler Corp., 345 N.J.Super. </em>314, 329-31, 785 A.2d 37 (App.Div.2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>442, 794 A.2d 181 (2002), rejected a Lemon Law claim under facts similar to this case, pointing out that the law does not provide \u201ccontinuous protection to car buyers\u201d but instead applies only to defects identified and reported within the statutorily specified period. <em>Fowler-Femandez v. Volkswagon United States, Inc., </em>96 <em>N.J.A.R.2d </em>(CMA) 190 (1996). This interpretation of the statute by the agency charged with responsibility for its administration is entitled to substantial deference, <em>Earl v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>158 <em>N.J. 155, </em>167, 728 A.2d 820 (1999), which provides additional support for our conclusion that plaintiffs complaint fails to state a cause of action under the Lemon Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We turn next to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs claim for breach of defendant\u2019s seven-year, seventy-thousand-mile powertrain warranty was not filed within the four-year limitation period established by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for breach of warranty claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The powertrain warranty applies to all \u201cparts, assemblies and components that together provide the power to [the] car.\u201d During the term of this warranty, which is \u201c7 years or 70,000 miles, whichever occurs first, counted from the vehicle\u2019s Warranty Start Date,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant is obligated to \u201ccovert ] the cost of all parts and labor needed to repair or adjust any Chrysler supplied item ... that proves defective in material, workmanship or factory preparation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant acknowledges that the engine timing belt is covered by this warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The limitations period under the UCC for an action for breach of a sales contract is \u201cfour years after the cause of action has accrued.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-725(1). The UCC further provides that \u201c[a] cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party\u2019s lack of knowledge of the breach[,]\u201d and that \u201c[a] breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-725(2). However, the UCC provides an exception to this general rule if \u201ca warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the time of such performance[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If a seller has provided this form of warranty, \u201cthe cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Defendant contends that the powertrain warranty given to plaintiff was an ordinary sales warranty, and that plaintiff therefore had only four years after the delivery of the car on March 23, 1993, to bring an action for any breach of the warranty. If this view of the powertrain warranty were correct, plaintiffs claim for breach of the warranty would be time barred because he did not file this action until December 15,1998, which was more than four years after delivery of the car. On the other hand, plaintiff contends that the powertrain warranty was a warranty of future performance, which defendant did not breach until 1998, when it failed to properly repair the timing belt, thus causing plaintiff recurrent problems with the operation of the car. Under this view of the warranty, plaintiffs action was filed well within the four-year period allowed under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:2-725(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In <em>Docteroff v. Barra Corp. of Am., Inc., </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>230, 241-43, 659 A.2d 948 (App.Div.1995), we held that a \u201cguarantee\u201d by a seller of roofing materials that it would \u201cmaintain the roof ... [i]n a watertight condition ... for (5) five years[,]\u201d and would repair or replace any defects that arose during that period, constituted a promise of future performance, and that the four-year UCC statute of limitations did not begin to run until the seller\u2019s breach was or should have been discovered. In reaching this conclusion, we noted that a seller\u2019s agreement to repair or replace defects in parts that become evident during a specified period \u201cfit[s] within the modern concept of warranty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 659 A.2d 948 (quoting <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. General Motors Corp., </em>533 <em>Pa. </em>423, 625 <em>A.2d </em>1172, 1177 (1993)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We also noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>that \u201c[s]ueh a warranty ... \u2018cannot be characterized as a mere representation of the product\u2019s condition at the time of delivery rather than its performance at a future time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Commissioners of Fire Dist. No. 9 v. American La France, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>566, 573, 424 A.2d 441 (App.Div.1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The seven-year, seventy-thousand-mile warranty that defendant gave plaintiff was similar to the warranty involved in <em>Docteroff. </em>Although defendant did not describe the warranty as a \u201cguarantee\u201d of future performance, it was not \u201ca mere representation of the [car\u2019s] condition at the time of delivery\u201d but rather a promise relating to \u201cits performance at a future timet,]\u201d 282 <em>N.J.Super. at </em>242, 659 A.2d 948, that is, as in <em>Docteroff, </em>an enforceable agreement that if a covered defect arose at any time during the period of the warranty, defendant would repair that condition. Therefore, we conclude that a claim for breach of this warranty did not accrue at the time of delivery of the car but rather when defendant allegedly breached its duty to repair the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The correctness of this conclusion is clearest in a case such as this, where the term of the warranty is longer than the four-year limitations period provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-725(1). If we adopted defendant\u2019s view that its powertrain warranty is an ordinary sales warranty, and consequently that a buyer must bring an action for breach of that warranty within four years of delivery, this would mean that the buyer would be unable to enforce defendant\u2019s warranty obligations for any breach that occurred beyond or even near the end of that four-year period, even though by its terms the warranty extends for as long as seven years. We are unwilling to construe <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-725(2) in a way that could lead to such an unreasonable result. See <em>State v. Gill, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>441, 444, 221 A.2d 521 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">This conclusion is also supported by decisions in other jurisdictions. In <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. General Motors Corp., supra, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that a \u201c12 month/12,000 mile \u2018New Car Limited Warranty\u2019 promising \u2018repairs and needed adjustments\u2019 to correct manufacturing defects is a warranty that \u2018explicitly extends to future performance of the goods\u2019 for purposes of determining when a cause of action for breach of that warranty accrues\u201d under section 2-725(2) of the UCC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">[W]e do not read the words \u201cexplicitly extends to future performance of the vehicle\u201d to require that the warranty make an explicit promise regarding how the goods will perform in the future. We believe that the focus of \u00a7 2725 is not on <em>what </em>is promised, but on the duration of the <em>promise </em>\u2014 ie., the period to which the promise extends____Therefore, we agree with Appellant that the phrase \u201cexplicitly <em>extends to </em>future performance\u201d can be interpreted to include a promise that, by its terms, comes into play upon, or is contingent upon, the future performance of the goods\u2014 Logically, a promise to repair or adjust defective parts within the first 12 months or 12,000 miles after delivery cannot be breached until the vehicle <em>requires </em>repair or adjustment, and \u201cdiscovery of the breach must await the time of [future] performance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">Furthermore, we will not permit [General Motors] and other sellers who draft similar documents to escape the consequences of presenting them to the consumer as \u201cextended warranties.\u201d There can be little question that the consumer will consider the length of any warranty offered in determining whether to purchase a particular vehicle: The consumer naturally would believe that the longer the warranty, the greater the protection, and hence, the better the value, he or she is receiving. If [General Motors] position were to prevail, the protection afforded the buyer during the latter part of a warranty approaching four years would be largely illusory, as the buyer would have a veiy short period of time in which to bring a cause of action for breach. Moreover, the longer-term protection afforded by a warranty extending beyond four years would be completely illusory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">[625 A.2d at 1173, q1176-78 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\"><em>See also Wienberg v. Independence Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., </em>948 S.W.2d 685, 690 (Mo.Ct.App.1997) (\u201c[Wjhere a warranty expressly extends to future performance of the goods, repair or replacement language does not necessarily nullify the future performance warranty.\u201d); <em>Krieger v. Nick Alexander Imports, Inc., </em>234 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>205, 285 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>717, 724 (1991) (\u201cA promise to repair defects that occur during a future period is the very definition of express warranty of future performance!)]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">There are other jurisdictions which hold that the kind of repair warranty involved in this case is not \u201ca warranty [that] explicitly extends to future performance of the goods,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>725(2), but that a cause of action for breach of such a warranty does not accrue upon delivery because \u201cthe promise to repair is an independent obligation that is not breached until the seller fails to repair.\u201d <em>Cosman v. Ford Motor Co., </em>285 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>250, 220 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>790, 674 N.E.2d 61, 68 (1996), <em>appeal denied, </em>172 <em>Ill.2d </em>549, 223 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>194, 679 <em>N.E.2d </em>379 (1997); <em>see also Versico, Inc. v.

General Motors Corp., supra, </em>625 A.2d at 1179-81 (Zappala, J., dissenting). The rationale for this view is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">[such a] warranty does not promise a level of performance. It warrants only that the dealer will repair, replace, or adjust defects if parts of the powertrain in fact do malfunction. It does not warrant the quality of the powertrain or its performance.... A promise to repair parts of the powertrain for six years is a promise that the manufacturer will behave in a certain way, not a warranty that the vehicle will behave in a certain way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">It does not fit within the definition of warranty under the Commercial Code. Although it is a warranty made as part of the sale of the goods in the sense that it promises something associated with the sale, it does not \u201cwarrant\u201d the quality of the vehicle or its performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">[Cosman, <em>supra, 674 N.E.2d </em>at 66-67.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">This is also the view taken of some scholarly commentaries. For example, <em>Anderson on the Uniform Commercial Code </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">A warranty of future performance differs from a covenant to repair or replace. The future performance warranty expressly provides some form of guaranty that the product will perform as required during the specified time. The obligation to repair or replace merely imposes a duty to repair or replace when a defect exists within the required period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">Although ... courts [that treat a covenant to repair or replace as a warranty of future performance] are sound in their conclusion that the statute of limitations should not commence until the seller has breached its promise to repair or replace the goods or any defective parts, it makes more sense to view the seller\u2019s failure to do so as a breach of contract, rather than as a breach of warranty. By so doing, <em>the </em>buyer\u2019s cause of action does not arise until the seller has refused <em>to repair or </em>replace the goods rather than upon the tender of delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">[Lary Lawrence, <em>Lawrence\u2019s Anderson on the Uniform Commercial Code </em>\u00a7 2-725:129 at 332-33 (3d ed.2001)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">Moreover, this is the view the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has taken in a draft revision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>UCC, which treats a \u201cpromise by the seller to repair or replace the goods or to refund all or part of the purchase price upon the happening of a specified event\u201d as a \u201cremedial promise.\u201d <em>Amendments to Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2 </em>\u2014 Sales (Annual Meeting 2001 Draft) \u00a7 2-103(1)(m). Under this proposed revision, a promise by a seller to repair or replace a defective part during a specified warranty period \u201cis not a warranty at all and therefore is not subject to either the time of tender [rule of 725(1)] or [the] discovery rule [of 725(2)].\u201d <em>Amendments to Uniform Commercial Code, supra, </em>preliminary comment to \u00a7 2-103(1)(m). Instead, a cause of action for breach of a remedial promise would accrue \u201cwhen the remedial promise is not performed when due.\u201d <em>Amendments to Uniform Commercial Code, supra, </em>\u00a7 2-725(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We have no need to decide whether defendant\u2019s seven-year/seventy-thousand-mile powertrain warranty constituted a warranty of future performance within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-725(2) or an independent promise to repair defects in the powertrain that appear during the term of the warranty because, under either view, plaintiff\u2019s cause of action would not have accrued when the car was delivered in 1993 but rather when persistent problems in the engine timing belt appeared in 1997 or when defendant was allegedly unable to repair this defect in a timely manner in July 1998, and thus plaintiffs complaint was timely filed in December 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (the Act) does not require any consumer product to be warranted. 15 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2302(b)(1)(B)(2). However, if a manufacturer or other supplier warrants a product, the Act imposes specific obligations on the warrantor, which include compliance with minimum federal standards for warranties. 15 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 2304(a). If a warrantor violates any of those obligations, a buyer may bring an action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>federal or state court for damages and equitable relief. 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\"> The Act does not contain any express limitations period for actions brought under its provisions. Where a federal statute creates a cause of action, but does not establish a limitations period for that action, the courts will apply the state statute of limitations governing the state cause of action most closely analogous to the federal action. <em>DelCostello v. International Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>151, 158-60, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2281, 2287-89, 76 L.Ed.2d 476, 485-86 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The statutory cause of action that is most analogous to a claim under the Act is a breach of warranty claim under the UCC, which is governed by the limitations provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-725. Furthermore, even though, as previously discussed, there is some debate as to whether the kind of repair warranty involved in this case is \u201ca warranty [that] explicitly extends to future performance of the goods\u201d within the intent of section 2-725(2), see <em>swpra </em>pp. 178-180, it is clear that such a warranty is a warranty of future performance under the more expansive definition of warranty contained in the Act. The term \u201cwritten warranty\u201d is defined under the Act to mean not only \u201c(A) any written affirmation of fact or written promise made in connection with the sale of a consumer product ... which relates to the nature of the material or workmanship and affirms or promises that such material or workmanship is defect free or will meet a specified level of performance over a specified period of time,\u201d but also \u201c(B) any undertaking in writing ... by a supplier of a consumer product to refund, repair, replace, or take other remedial action ... in the event that such product fails to meet the specifications set forth in the undertaking.\u201d 15 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2301(6). Even if the powertrain warranty that defendant gave to plaintiff did not constitute an \u201caffirmation of fact or written promise\u201d that the \u201cmaterial [and] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>workmanship\u201d of the covered parts were \u201cdefect free,\u201d it nonetheless constituted an \u201cundertaking in writing ... by a supplier of a consumer product to refund, repair, replace, or take other remedial action ... in the event that such product fails to meet the specifications set forth in the undertaking.\u201d Therefore, plaintiffs claim under the Act did not accrue until defendant allegedly breached its obligation to repair the defect in plaintiffs engine timing belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">This conclusion is supported by <em>Cosman, </em>discussed earlier in this opinion, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">[T]he federal definition of \u201cwritten warranty\u201d under the Magnuson-Moss Act includes promises to repair within the concept of warranty____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">A breach of the promise to repair cannot occur until Ford refuses or fails to repair the powertrain if and when it breaks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">Under this analysis plaintiffs should have the right to sue for a failure to repair at any time within the life of the warranty and within four years after the breach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">The result we reach here does the least violence to two legislative acts \u2014 the Uniform Commercial Code and the Magnuson-Moss Act \u2014 drafted without an eye on the other. It preserves a four year statute of limitations for promises that are part of a contract for the sale of goods, while recognizing that the Magnuson-Moss remedy for breach of a promise to repair cannot ripen until the promise is broken and has nothing to do with the inherent quality of the goods or them future performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">[674 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 67-68.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-10\"><em>See also Keller v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., </em>733 A.2d 642, 644 (Pa.Super.Ct.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs Lemon Law claim, but reverse the dismissal of his breach of warranty and Magnuson-Moss Act claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\"> Even though some discovery had been conducted, neither party submitted any discovery materials to the trial court in connection with this motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Instead, both parties relied upon their respective \"statements of undisputed facts\" and supporting exhibits, which consisted of the contract of sale and other purchase documents and bills for the repairs performed on plaintiff\u2019s car. As a result, the record before us contains only a skeletal presentation of the facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-9\"> Although the parties seem to assume that this date was the date of delivery of the car, we note that the warranty states that \"[t]he 'Powertrain Warranty\u2019 begins at the end of the 'Basic Warranty' period.\" However, even if the term of the powertrain warranty began on the date of delivery, it is undisputed that all of the repairs and replacements of plaintiff's engine timing belt occurred while the warranty was in effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\"> Although the warranty states that defendant is obligated \"to cover[] the cost of all parts and labor needed to repair\" the vehicle, it also states \"[e]xcept in emergencies, you MUST bring your vehicle to an authorized Chrysler Dealer for warranty services and repairs.\u201d Therefore, as a practical matter, defendant's obligation to cover the costs of repair is generally an obligation to perform the repairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\"> <em>Compare Spring Motors Distribs., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. 22, </em>47, 465 A.2d 530 (App.Div.1983) (holding that \u201cthe words your vehicle has been designed to give long reliable service with the simplest and least costly maintenance requirements possible' do not make any explicit guarantee as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>vehicle\u2019s performance over or after a stated period of time\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on unrelated </em>grounds, 98 N.J. 555, 489 A.2d 660 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\"> For a general discussion of the Act, see 1 James J. White and Robert S. Summers, <em>Uniform Commercial Code </em>(4th ed.1995) \u00a7 9-15.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b212-12\">WELLS, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"AJy\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">I concur with both the result and reasoning of Parts I and III of the majority opinion. I also concur with the result in Part II. The majority reaches its result in that Part on either one of two alternate theories: one by a construction of the powertrain warranty as one for the future performance of the powertrain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>thus not subject to the four year limitations period under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-725(2); and, one by a construction of the warranty simply as an independent \u201cpromise to repair defects in the powertrain\u201d, <em>supra, </em>180. Under the latter view the power-train warranty is not one presently defined by the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">I write separately simply to express my view that it is on the second, and only the second, theory that the result should rest. I am convinced that the cases supporting that theory are better reasoned and better comport with the intent of the manufacturer of the car in question and, as well, the reasonable expectations of the consumer. In my view, the decision of another panel of this court, <em>Docteroff v. Barra Corp. of Am., Inc., </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>230, 659 A.2d 948 (App.Div.1995), cited by the majority is distinguishable. The warranty there was far broader than the one here and did arguably guarantee the future performance of the roof involved there, thus bringing it within <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12:2-725(2). That, in my opinion, is simply not true in the case of this much more narrowly worded warranty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
