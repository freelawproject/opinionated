The State contends that the Law Division judge erred in concluding that defendant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to interview a witness, prior to her testimony, who was scheduled to testify that \u201caround the time of the alleged incident,\u201d defendant was with her. We agree with the State and now reverse. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1; fourth-degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(4); third-degree unlawful possession of a handgun, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b; and second-degree possession of a handgun for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4a. At sentencing, the judge granted the State\u2019s motion for the imposition of an extended term pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a. After merging the aggravated assault and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose conviction, defendant was sentenced to a custodial term of twenty-five years with a twelve and one-half year period of parole ineligibility on the robbery conviction and to a concurrent five-year term on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>possession of a handgun conviction. We affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence. <em>See State v. Banks, </em>A5089-95 (App.Div.August 27, 1997), <em>certif. denied, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>364, 704 A.2d 1299 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The underlying facts supporting defendant\u2019s convictions are set forth in our prior opinion. We repeat them here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">On August 14, 1995, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Suzette Carter and her two young children were waiting at a bus stop in Newark. Defendant approached Carter and demanded her jewelry. Defendant showed Carter a gun that he had tucked in his shorts and ordered Carter and her children into a nearby driveway where he could complete the robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">Once in the driveway, Carter\u2019s son became frightened and ran out of the driveway. Defendant ordered Carter to call her son back, which she did. When the boy returned, defendant put the gun to the child\u2019s head, took Carter\u2019s jewelry and demanded money. When Carter told defendant that she had no money, defendant stated that he would shoot her son if she was lying. After going through Carter\u2019s pocketbook and finding no money, defendant fled the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">Carter then called her God-sister to report what had occurred. Carter\u2019s God-sister and cousin got into the cousin\u2019s car and proceeded to Carter\u2019s apartment. Carter then called the police. Thereafter, while looking out of her apartment window, Carter saw defendant. Before the police arrived, Carter and her cousin got into the cousin\u2019s car and followed defendant so that Carter could be sure that defendant was the person who had committed the robbery. Carter told her cousin that defendant was the perpetrator. Carter\u2019s cousin and sister followed defendant to his destination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">Subsequently, the police arrived and were told of defendant\u2019s whereabouts. Defendant was arrested, and Carter identified him as the person who committed the robbery approximately ninety minutes after the incident. Carter stated that defendant\u2019s appearance had changed between the robbery and his arrest. He had on different clothes, and his hair was combed differently. Carter, however, was positive that defendant was the person who committed the robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">On June 16, 1998, defendant filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for post conviction relief contending that: his trial counsel was ineffective because of \u201ctainted out of court identification [and] improper jury instructions.\u201d Thereafter, counsel was assigned to represent defendant for his post conviction relief petition. Counsel amended defendant\u2019s petition to allege ineffective assistance of counsel on the following grounds: (1) failure to request mistrial or curative instruction when jury heard petitioner was on probation; (2) failure to present alibi witness (after opening to the jury with an alibi defense); (3) failure to object to jury charge not conforming to facts of case; (4) failure to consult with and discuss trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>strategy with petitioner; (5) failure to motion for a new trial or judgment of acquittal; (6) failure to object or request mistrial or curative instruction regarding prosecutors remarks in summation; (7) failure to object to prosecutors improper opening remarks and instructing the jury on the law of misidentification; and (8) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The State opposed defendant\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The Law Division judge rejected all of defendant\u2019s claims except the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon counsel deficiencies involving the defense of alibi. The judge scheduled an evidentiary hearing, at which time defendant\u2019s trial counsel testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">It is clear from the record that defense counsel filed a notice of alibi pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:12-2, signed by counsel and defendant. In the notice, counsel stated that defendant \u201cmay\u201d rely on the defense of alibi and that the witness, defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Rhonda Caldwell (\u201cCaldwell\u201d), \u201cwill establish that defendant was with her on public transportation between Newark and Elizabeth around the time of the alleged incident.\u201d The alibi information was provided to counsel by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Defense counsel attempted to interview Caldwell before trial for two purposes. First, the interview was to cover defendant\u2019s claim that the charges against him were retaliation by the victim because defendant had \u201cbeaten up\u201d the victim\u2019s boyfriend. Counsel sought information about the fight between defendant and the victim\u2019s boyfriend from Caldwell. Second, counsel sought to interview Caldwell about defendant\u2019s whereabouts on the date and time of the robbery. However, Caldwell could not be located for an interview at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Prior to trial, counsel subpoenaed Caldwell to appear for trial on January 31, 1996. She did not appear. Following jury selection, defense counsel made his opening statement where he said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">But there is a different scenario, and I think when I explain certain things to you you will understand why there is an issue of fact. The defendant says I didn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s the first thing. Not me, you got the wrong person. So we have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>question of identification. We have an issue as to where the defendant was at the time. You will hear testimony that it was approximately 8:30 in the morning, that Suzette Carter and her children were at a bus stop. Mr. Banks says I spent \u2014 this was a Monday morning. I spent the weekend at my girlfriend's house in Elizabeth. At that time the girlfriend\u2019s name was Rhonda Caldwell. She was living at 112 West Jersey Street in Elizabeth. On Monday morning they left his girlfriend\u2019s house and they went, eventually, to South 19th Street which is where the defendant lived. They took buses, two buses. They took the 24 bus from Elizabeth to downtown Newark and the 31 bus up South Orange Avenue. They got off at South 19th Street, walked a couple of blocks to the defendant\u2019s house which was I believe located between 14th and 15th Avenues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">At no time in the route that they took did they pass Littleton and 16th Avenue which is the address where Ms. Carter was waiting for the bus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Counsel then pointed out that the State\u2019s theory of the case required the jury to believe that about one and one-half hours after the crime at approximately 8:30 a.m., defendant was spotted in the neighborhood of the crime on 16th Avenue and was chased back to his own house. Counsel further pointed out that the police found neither the gun nor any of the jewelry when they arrested defendant. Counsel then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">These are some of the things I want you to be thinking about because the State has got to convince you beyond a reasonable doubt. They have to convince you that they\u2019ve got the right guy, that he was present at the location of the robbery and that he\u2019s the person who committed these offenses, and when you hear the testimony, you know, you\u2019re going to learn that there was no jewelry, that there was no gun found, and too, you know, ask yourselves well, is this the kind of thing that can be the basis for a doubt or can be the basis for a reasonable doubt. Absence of testimony is something that you are entitled to use and say well, they haven\u2019t proved it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">What they\u2019re going to be able to show is some people chased the defendant in his home. Does that mean that an hour and a half before that he was at the same location committing a robbery. I think the issues are fairly clear. He\u2019s saying I have an alibi defense, I was some place else at the time, that is 8:30. I wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019m walking down the street and all of a sudden some guys come chasing me and they go chase me to my house, but I have nothing to do with any robbery. I have no knowledge of any robbery. I didn\u2019t do it, and they never found anything on me that ties me to the robbery. No gun, no jewelry, no nothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Thus, defense counsel\u2019s opening statement was a full explanation of defendant\u2019s defense which was a direct denial of the charges. Part and parcel of that defense, was the defense of alibi. <em>State v. Garvin, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>268, 272, 208 A.2d 402 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Subsequent to the opening statements, the State put forth a case that established the facts set forth above. On February 1, 1996, Caldwell appeared at trial. She did not testily that day but returned on February 6, 1996, at which time she testified. Defense counsel did not interview Caldwell concerning her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">On direct examination, Caldwell testified that defendant had spent the weekend with her in Elizabeth and that on the following Monday morning, August 14, 1995, the date of the robbery, she and defendant left her residence to go to defendant\u2019s residence in Newark. The following questions and answers were provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkG\">Q And do you have a specific address in Newark that you were going to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">A We were going to Kenneth\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">Q And do you know what Kenneth\u2019s address was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">A No, I don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s 18th Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">Q Now, how were you planning to get from your house in Elizabeth to Kenneth\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">A The <em>bus.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">Q Okay. Do you remember the number of the bus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-13\">A The 24 and the 31.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-14\">Q You had to take more than one bus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-15\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-16\">Q And do you know the routes that these buses took?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-17\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-18\">Q Want to tell us what they were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-19\">A It takes you from Broad Street in Elizabeth to Broad Street, downtown Newark. It\u2019s the 24. We took the 31 from Market Street to South Orange Avenue in Newark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-20\">Q And did there come a time when you got off the bus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-21\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-22\">Q And where did you <em>get </em>off the bus at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-23\">A At the comer of 18th Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-24\">Q And what other street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-25\">A South Orange Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-26\">Q Okay. Okay. Now, do you have any idea at all as to what time it was that you were on the buses from Elizabeth to Newark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-27\">A Between <em>7 </em>and 7:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Q And how about when you got into Newark and taking in the 31 up to Kenneth\u2019s house. You have any idea what time it was at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">A It had to be between 7:30 and 8 o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">Q Now, do you have any idea as to where Kenneth might have been around 8:30 in the morning on that August 14th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">A In his house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">Q Were you with him at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">A No, I wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">Q Now, where were you going when you left?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">AI had an appointment at 9:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\">Q And how were you going to get to your appointment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-13\">A The bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-14\">Q Now, did you have a watch on with you that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-15\">A No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-16\">Q So, when you\u2019re giving us approximations of time, is this just guesses on your part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-17\">A No, I had the time on my beeper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-18\">Q You have a beeper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-19\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-20\">Q Now, did you walk to Kenneth\u2019s house or did you go to Kenneth\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-21\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-22\">Q And you have any idea as to what time it was at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-23\">A No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-24\">During cross-examination, a rather contentious exchange occurred between the prosecutor and Caldwell.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-25\">Q What time did you leave Elizabeth that morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-26\">A Between 7 and 7:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-27\">Q And how do you know it was at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-28\">A The time on my beeper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-29\">Q What time did your beeper say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-30\">AI don\u2019t know, between 7 and 7:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-31\">Q Well, you just said you knew it was that time because of the time on your beeper, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-32\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-33\">Q And you just said that you don\u2019t know what time your beeper said, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac_\">AI said between 7 and 7:30.1 don\u2019t know the exact time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Q Does your beeper only keep time by half hours or does it keep times by \u2014 strike that.

You said that. You said, did you have a watch on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-15\">Q Did you just testify that you had problems with your beeper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-16\">A Yes, just to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-17\">Q And your beeper didn\u2019t keep good time.

Following an evidentiary hearing, the Law Division judge granted defendant\u2019s petition. In granting the petition, the judge said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-18\">Although the jury was clearly [told] at the outset during opening statements that the defense of misidentification would be, to a large extent, premised on an alibi to be provided during the course of the trial, the alibi witness could not corroborate the alibi of Mr. Banks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-19\">Clearly, this was not a choice among strategic alternatives on the part of defense counsel which clearly this Court should give great deference too. But in this instance the Court finds that there was a conscious decision and a choice of a defense, that the defense had been identified and had been discussed with the client, but unfortunately without ascertainment of its underlying factual support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-20\">The conviction \u2014 the counsel clearly did not interview the alibi witness at any time before she took the stand. Again, although it\u2019s quite clear as to the materiality of that particular defense, as heretofore indicated in the notice of alibi, counsel did not seek a continuance from the Court in order to have a full opportunity to interview the purported alibi witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-21\">This instance is simply, in this Court\u2019s judgment, a significant instance of inexcusable lack of preparation and failure on the part of counsel to inquire into the facts that would support his case. And any objective assessment of performance, which this Court is obligated to undertake and which the Court does not undertake lightly, demonstrates to this Court a serious deficiency in the representation of Mr. Banks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The error, the deficiency in this instance, is not the product of poor strategy to which the Court must give great deference, or unpredictable, or unexpected, or unforeseeable testimony, to which the Court must give great deference, but it\u2019s a direct result of a lack of mandated preparation. This error was so serious as to fall in this instance below what is expected, in this Court\u2019s opinion, under the sixth amendment and the New Jersey Constitution Guarantee of Effective Assistance of Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">The assistance of counsel and the presentation of a defense was plainly ineffective. The seriousness of the error, moreover, is compounded in this particular instance by a realistic appreciation by defense counsel, not only as to the materiality and significance of the alibi defense to a successful defense for his client, but also on an understanding of the inability of his client to take the stand because of prior criminal convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">Good lawyering mandates an investigation and exploration of a defense prior to its announced submission to a jury. The failure to interview the alibi witness deprived counsel and more importantly, deprived the defendant of the basis to make an informed tactical decision as to the defense of Mr. Banks. The defendant\u2019s defense was thereby undermined. He was left with none for which reasonable doubt could be provided and he was convicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">Moreover, the second prong of <em>[Strickland, Fritz </em>and <em>Cronic see </em>infraj, in this Court\u2019s opinion, is such that there is indeed a reasonable probability or a substantial likelihood exists, in this Court\u2019s mind, that the deficiency in this instance on the part of counsel may have contributed to the adverse outcome for the defendant. That the deficiency leading to the defense, a defense without merit, would contribute to the jury\u2019s perception of the defendant perpetrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">On appeal, the State argues that the judge erred in granting defendant\u2019s petition. It asserts that the judge\u2019s decision was premised on the theory that defense counsel promised to deliver a classic alibi defense and further, even if counsel did not make such a promise, counsel was entitled to rely on the information provided by defendant with respect to the alibi. Finally, the State contends that defense counsel did not promise anything he did not deliver and that defendant suffered no prejudice as a result of defense counsel\u2019s failure to interview Caldwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">For defendant to prevail on his ineffective assistance claim, he must satisfy the test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 694, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 2068, 80 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>674, 80 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 674, 698 (1984), and <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>648, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2039, 80 <em>L. </em>Ed 2d 657 (1984), which our Supreme Court adopted in <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 58, 519 A.2d 336 (1987). <em>See also State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 463-64, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>(acknowledge the adoption of the test). Under the <em>StHckland-Cronic-Fritz </em>test, defendant must demonstrate that: (a) \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient;\u201d and (b) \u201cthere exists \u2018a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Preciose, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 463-64, 609 A.2d 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Here, we agree that defendant\u2019s counsel should have interviewed Caldwell prior to having her testify, but cannot conclude that the result of defendant\u2019s trial would have been different had counsel conducted such an interview. We are satisfied that an interview of Caldwell by defense counsel would have revealed no different version of events than Caldwell testified to during the trial. An examination of Caldwell\u2019s testimony reveals that an interview would have told counsel that at approximately the time of the robbery, defendant was with Caldwell or at his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Caldwell testified that she and defendant left her home in Elizabeth \u201cbetween 7:00 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.\u201d She stated that they had to take two buses, one from Elizabeth to Newark and the other from a location in Newark to the area of defendant\u2019s home. She testified that she and defendant were on the second bus between 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">She testified that defendant was in his home at 8:30, but admitted that she was not with him at the time. Although, during the contentious cross-examination by the prosecutor, Caldwell admitted that she did not know where defendant was at 8:30 a.m., she testified on re-direct that because she was not \u201cpay[ing] particular attention to the time,\u201d defendant could have arrived at his house after 8:30 a.m., after the robbery had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The Law Division judge must have concluded that if defense counsel had interviewed Caldwell and learned the content of her proposed testimony, then defense counsel would not have called her as a witness. Our dissenting colleague contends that had defense counsel interviewed Caldwell before trial, she would not have been called as a defense witness, or counsel\u2019s opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>statement \u201cwould not have so depended on alibi.\u201d We can reach no such conclusion from this record. It is highly likely in our view that counsel would have still called Caldwell as a witness. Her testimony was such that if believed, along with the other proofs, a reasonable jury could have concluded that defendant was not the perpetrator of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Further, defense counsel attempted to interview Caldwell before trial, but was unable to do so because she could not be located. In this regard, counsel relied on defendant\u2019s representations to make his opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Moreover, the Law Division judge and our dissenting colleague, in their opinions, treat the alibi defense as if it were a \u201cseparate defense.\u201d <em>State v. Garvin, supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 272, 208 A.2d 402. It is not. \u201cIt is part and parcel of a direct denial of the State\u2019s charge whenever the defendant\u2019s physical presence at a given time and place is a critical part of the prosecutor\u2019s ease.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also State v. Mucci, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>423, 431, 136 A.2d 761 (1957); <em>State v. Nunn, </em>113 <em>N.J.Super. </em>161, 167, 273 A.2d 366 (App.Div.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Here, defendant\u2019s defense was simply that he was not the perpetrator of the robbery, and, as part of his direct denial, he produced the testimony of Caldwell, his girlfriend, who was with him around the time the robbery took place. Caldwell\u2019s testimony was consistent with the notice of alibi that set forth that she would testify that defendant was with her \u201caround the time of the alleged incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">We are satisfied that, had counsel interviewed Caldwell prior to trial, he would have learned then what she ultimately testified to during her direct and re-direct testimony. An interview that revealed what Caldwell testified to on those two occasions would not have caused counsel to forego using her as a witness. Moreover, we doubt that counsel\u2019s opening statement would have been different based on the interview in that Caldwell, at least inferentially, placed defendant at a different location at around the time of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The dissent\u2019s view, essentially, allows defendant to have it both ways. We have no doubt that had defense counsel not called Caldwell as a witness, defendant would have filed a petition for post-conviction relief, contending that the failure to call Caldwell as a witness constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Considering the circumstances here, not calling Caldwell as a witness might reasonably be considered ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Further, with the information counsel learned from defendant, he was prudent in providing the notice of alibi pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:12-2.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">Whether the testimony of the proposed witness shows directly that a defendant was not physically present at the precise time and place of the alleged offense, or does so only inferentially, its purposes and objectives are the same. The difference is the weight and degree of persuasiveness attributed to that testimony by the jury. There is no less reliance by defendant on such testimony nor less need for notice by the State that it will be offered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">[State <em>v. Nunn, supra, </em>113 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 168, 273 A.2d 366.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Here, Caldwell, during her cross-examination, was not particularly helpful to defendant\u2019s case, but that is not a basis to conclude that counsel was ineffective because he failed to interview her. The same cross-examination would have occurred whether she was interviewed or not. Caldwell\u2019s testimony during direct and redirect examination was not damaging to defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Finally, counsel relied on defendant\u2019s representations in deciding what defense to present. In fact, defendant signed the notice of alibi along with his counsel. Given the circumstances from a defense perspective, particularly that only defendant and Caldwell knew about defendant\u2019s whereabouts around the time of the robbery, we cannot conclude that counsel\u2019s reliance on defendant\u2019s representations about an alibi constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Cf. State v. Sloan, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 615, 545 A.2d 230 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>647, 552 A.2d 171 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>WELLS, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">I would affirm for substantially the reasons given by the trial judge in his oral opinion. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674 (1984) requires that two prongs be met to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">As to the first prong, the majority concedes only that counsel \u201cshould have interviewed Caldwell prior to having her testify.\u201d But the trial judge found that \u201c[t]his error was so serious as to fall in this instance below what is expected ... under the Sixth Amendment and the New Jersey Constitutional guarantee of effective assistance of counsel.\u201d I agree with that assessment and would, therefore, expressly conclude that the first prong of <em>Strickland </em>was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">It is a clear error of professional judgment in a criminal case not to interview an important alibi witness before that witness takes the stand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counsel had two chances to interview Caldwell. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The first opportunity came on Thursday, February 1, 1996, when she appeared at the courthouse but was not reached by the time of evening recess. The second chance occurred when she belatedly appeared after lunch on Tuesday, February 6, just before she was called to the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">It is true, as the State argues, that counsel is entitled to rely on the representations of his client in developing defenses and in deciding what witnesses to interview or not to interview. <em>State v. Sloan, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 615, 545 A.2d 230, <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>647, 552 A.2d 171 (1988). But such reliance does not extend to calling an alibi witness without interviewing her. So potent is alibi testimony that not to be certain as to precisely what such a witness will say is to invite the serious prejudice that occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Even assuming that the benefits of an alibi defense were worth the risk of mentioning it to the jury even though counsel was unable to discuss it with Caldwell prior to the start of trial, I also conclude that the judge was correct in finding it deficient performance not to have confirmed the details of the alibi with the witness when defense counsel had the opportunity to do so. Counsel could have conducted a brief interview when Caldwell appeared on Thursday, or he could have asked the trial judge for an opportunity to do so just before she took the stand the following Tuesday. I am not unmindful that the patience of the court and jury had been sorely strained at that point in the trial by Caldwell\u2019s tardy appearance. But I nevertheless deem it a significant omission that counsel did not at least try to seek a brief recess to interview her.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Second, the failure of Caldwell to place the defendant with her at the time of the crime prejudicially damaged the claim of misidentification by Carter. Had the jurors harbored doubts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>about Carter\u2019s testimony or questions concerning her identification of Banks, those doubts and questions surely paled in the face of the failed alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The defense rested on the doubt raised by a very stressed victim\u2019s identification, the failure to locate the gun and the jewelry and, most importantly, the alibi. When the alibi failed the whole defense case lost credibility. I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s speculation that had counsel interviewed Caldwell, she probably would have been called as a witness anyway. Its view is that Caldwell\u2019s testimony, notwithstanding her concession that she was not with Banks at 8:30 a.m., could still raise a doubt as to Banks\u2019 participation in the crime, because Caldwell was not paying particular attention to the time, they had just arrived in Newark perhaps as late as 8:00 a.m., and then went to Banks\u2019 house. But they then separated and Caldwell left for an appointment. She only surmised that Banks remained at his house and she specifically denied they were together at 8:30 a.m. If counsel had been able to interview her before the start of trial, his opening would not have so depended on alibi. If he had interviewed her before she testified, had she been called at all, her interrogation on the stand would have been quite different.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In contrast to the majority, however, I see little chance that had she been interviewed she would have been called. Without Caldwell\u2019s testimony that she and Banks were together at 8:30 a.m., she adds little of probative value to the defense case. In fact, her admission that they had separated by 8:30 a.m. not only seriously detracts from viable defense arguments regarding the victim\u2019s identification, but also places Banks near the scene of the robbery <em>before </em>it occurred, something none of the State\u2019s other witnesses did.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Had the defense of alibi not been mentioned to the jury and Caldwell not been called to the stand, doubt could well have been engendered in the minds of some jurors as to the victim\u2019s identification as the result of (1) the stress that Carter, the victim, was under; (2) the evidence of the suspect\u2019s changes in clothing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>hairstyle between the robbery and the chance sighting of Banks later in the morning; (3) the failure to find the gun and jewelry; and (4) the improbability of a robber returning to the scene so quickly after the crime \u2014 facts urged upon the jury during the opening. But when Caldwell\u2019s testimony unexpectedly did not cover the time of the robbery and it happened that his house was within a few blocks of the crime, reasonable doubts about the State\u2019s case in the minds of jurors could not have but been dispelled to Banks\u2019 great prejudice. Thus, the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>standard is established.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\"> <em>See </em>Leonard N.
