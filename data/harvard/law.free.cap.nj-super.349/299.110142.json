We conclude that the statute requires an intent to permanently abandon the child. Because the trial judge did not define the critical term for the jury, we reverse defendant\u2019s endangering conviction. We do, however, affirm his conviction for third-degree theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Defendant, N.I., appeals from his conviction, after a three-day jury trial, of third degree theft, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3a (count one) and second degree endangering the welfare of a child, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a (count two). After denial of his post-trial motion for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:18-2, or a new trial pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:20-1, defendant was sentenced to a five-year state prison term on count one and ten years with four years of parole ineligibility on count two, the terms to run concurrent. Appropriate penalties were also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On January 31, 1998, defendant was observed in the Stern\u2019s Department Store in the Bergen Mall in Paramus taking items of children\u2019s clothing and putting them into a bag which was then placed under a blanket resting on the hood of a stroller. Defendant had been seen initially by a salesperson who reported the incident to a store security officer, Ron Botelho, who also made observations. As defendant left the store accompanied by a child, Botelho followed him outside into the parking lot. Botelho identified himself and asked defendant to return to the store to discuss the clothing he had taken. Defendant ignored Botelho and kept walking, pushing the stroller and gradually increasing his pace. At some point, defendant began to run across the parking lot, toward Route 4. As he fled, a large bag fell out of the stroller and the child, who was running with defendant, tripped over the bag and fell. Botelho stopped to assist the child and radioed another security officer, Bochner, of defendant\u2019s flight. Bochner gave chase but defendant escaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Police responded and learned from the child that her name was K. and that defendant, her father, was N.I. K. was five years old. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>She was taken to police headquarters but no one came or called to inquire about her.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Botelho subsequently examined the bag which had fallen from the stroller. Inside the bag was a \u201cbooster bag,\u201d a container lined with foil and plastic, commonly used by shoplifters to prevent merchandise security tags from setting off an alarm. Inside the booster bag were twenty-three articles of children\u2019s and infants\u2019 clothing with retail price tags totaling $638.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">On the evening of January 31, Detective Joseph Ackerman took over the investigation. He observed that K. had no injuries and appeared to be healthy and happy. Ackerman learned that the Hackensack Police Department had a photo of defendant and sent Detective Benkey to pick it up. Benkey thereafter returned from Hackensack not only with the picture but with C.I., K.\u2019s uncle, who had been sent to Hackensack to pick up the child on the mistaken assumption that she was there, arriving at about 10:00 p.m. K. was, understandably, happy to see her uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Defendant\u2019s niece, K.W., testified in his defense at trial to the following. On January 31 K.W. accompanied defendant, his girlfriend G.S., and defendant\u2019s two children, B. and K., from their homes in the Bronx to go shopping at Stern\u2019s. K.W. went off on her own after arriving at the store. At 6:30 p.m. she exited Stern\u2019s and heard G.S. screaming. Defendant was sprawled on the pavement and K. was standing a short distance away. An unidentified man came up, obviously angry, and \u201csnatched\u201d K. When the two women followed him to the door of the store, the man pulled out a badge and told them to \u201cpick the baby up at the precinct.\u201d After recovering from their shock, K.W. and G.S. went over to defendant, who was on the ground next to the tipped-over stroller holding B. close to his chest. K.W. telephoned her grandmother in the Bronx to tell her what had happened after which she, G.S., defendant, and the child sat in their van for over an hour until her uncle, C.I., arrived with K., after which they returned to the Bronx, arriving home after midnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The verdict made it clear that the jury rejected K.W.\u2019s version of the events of January 31, 1998 and generally accepted the scenario proffered by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">POINT I. DEFENDANT IS ENTITLED TO JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL FOR ENDANGERING THE WELFARE OF A CHILD BECAUSE THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT DEFENDANT ABANDONED HIS DAUGHTER. ALSO, THE COURT DID NOT CHARGE THE JURY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATUTE AND FAILED TO DEFINE ABANDONMENT, FORSAKING AND WILLFULLY. (Partially Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">POINT II. THE ADMISSION OF TESTIMONY THAT THE HACKENSACK POLICE HAD A PHOTOGRAPH OF DEFENDANT, A RESIDENT OF NEW YORK CITY, DENIED DEFENDANT DUE PROCESS AND A FAIR TRIAL. POINT III. DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE IS NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE SENTENCING GUIDE-LINES; CONSEQUENTLY, IT MUST BE REDUCED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">POINT IV. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR TRANSFER TO A DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAM.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Defendant raises additional issues in a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, entitled \u201cPetition for Certification,\u201d but without clear point headings. We have also considered those issues. Because we find that the endangering charge failed to define an essential term for the jury, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction on count two. We affirm the conviction on count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">Under a single point heading, defendant attacks both the sufficiency of the evidence and the adequacy of the charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We begin with the challenge to the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-14\">Any <em>person </em>having a legal duty for the care of a child ... who causes the child harm that would make the child an abused or neglected child as defined in R.S. 9:6-1, R.S. 9:6-3 and P.L.1974, c. 119, \u00a7 1 (C. 9:6-8.21) is guilty of a crime of the second degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The statute was intended to incorporate into the criminal code the fourth degree crime defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-3 \u201cwithout substantial change except for the penalty provisions.\u201d <em>Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, </em>Vol. II at 259 (1971) (Final Report). Thus, the Commission incorporated \u201cby reference the definitions of \u2018abused\u2019 \u2018abandonment,\u2019 \u2018cruelty\u2019 and \u2018neglect\u2019 contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1, which also are incorporated into <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-3.\u201d <em>State v. Demarest, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>323, 328, 599 A.2d 937 (App.Div.1991). As was further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">After the Criminal Law Revision Commission issued its report but before the Legislature enacted the Code, the scope of civil remedies for child abuse and neglect were expanded by the enactment of chapter 119 of the Laws of 1974, <em>N.J.SA. </em>9:6-8.21 to 8.73, and further extended by amendments to this legislation enacted as Chapter 209 of the Laws of 1977. The final form of the offense of endangering the welfare of a child contained in the Code as enacted in 1979 incorporates by reference the definitions of \u201cabused\u201d and \u201cneglected\u201d child in both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 and <em>N.J.SA. </em>9:6-8.21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">[Id at 328-29, 599 A.2d 937.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-3 is the source statute for <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, it does not contain any definitions of an \u201cabused\u201d or \u201cneglected\u201d child. <em>State v. Demarest, supra, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 329 n. 3, 599 A.2d 937. Those definitions are found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1, as well as in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21. In this case the State contended that K. was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">Abandonment of a child shall consist in any of the following acts by anyone having the custody or control of the child: (a) willfully forsaking a child; ft)) failing to care for and keep the control and custody of a child so that the child shall be exposed to physical or moral risk without proper and sufficient protection; (c) failing to care for and keep the control and custody of a child so that the child shall be liable to be supported and maintained at the expense of the public, or by child caring societies or private persons not legally chargeable with its or their care, custody and control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">The section does not provide any definition of \u201cwillfully forsaking.\u201d In a similar vein, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 defines an \u201cabused or neglected\u201d child to mean, among other things, \u201ca child who has been willfully abandoned by his parent. . . .\u201d That section contains no definition of abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>In accordance with these provisions, the trial court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">Abandonment of a child will consist in any of the following aets by anyone having the custody or control of the child; one, willfully forsaking the child; two, failing to care for and keep the control or custody of the child so that the child will be exposed to physical risk without proper and sufficient protection. Abused or neglected child means a child less than 18 years of age whose parent or guardian has willfully abandoned the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The court did not attempt to define the term \u201cwillfully forsaking.\u201d The court further instructed the jury that the applicable mental state for the offense was \u201cknowingly.\u201d <em>See State v. Demarest, supra. </em>The court\u2019s charge followed the Model Charge which, in a footnote, merely directs trial judges to charge \u201cthe appropriate definition of an abused or neglected child as provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 as indicated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Model Jury Charge </em>(Criminal) <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24Ma (Approved May 21,1993). There were no objections to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">During deliberations the jury requested that the definition of abandonment be provided to them and, with consent of counsel, the court sent a reply to the jury stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">Abused or neglected child means a child less than 18 years of age that has been willfully abandoned by a parent or guardian. Abandonment of a child can consist of any of the following aets: A, willfully forsaking the child, and or B, failing to keep or control so that the child shall be exposed to physical risk without proper and sufficient protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Although defendant filed a post-trial motion seeking a judgment of acquittal or a new trial on the endangering charge, no complaint was raised concerning the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">Defendant now contends that the instructions were deficient in failing to define the terms \u201cabandonment,\u201d \u201cforsaking,\u201d and \u201cwillfully.\u201d As we have noted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 simply speaks of a child who has been \u201cwillfully abandoned,\u201d while <em>N.J.S.A. 9:6-1 </em>provides that one of the means of abandonment is \u201cwillfully forsaking a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the Legislature did provide a definition of abandonment in <em>N.J.S.A. 9:6-1, by </em>stating that it \u201cshall consist in any of\u2019 three specific actions, one of which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>\u201cwillfully forsaking a child.\u201d Thus, there is no problem in the definition of abandonment; rather, the deficiency, if any, is that the charge in this case provided no guidance to the jury on the meaning of the essential terms, \u201cwillfully\u201d or \u201cforsaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">It is, of course, settled that clear and correct jury instructions are essential to a fair trial. <em>State v. Cooper, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>326, 363, 700 A.2d 306 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>1084, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>809, 145 L.Ed.2d 681 (2000). \u201cA charge is a road map to guide the jury and without an appropriate charge a jury can take a wrong turn in its deliberations.\u201d <em>State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. 2, </em>15, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990). In <em>State v. Alexander, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>563, 571, 643 A.2d 996 (1994), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">A court\u2019s obligation properly to instruct and to guide a jury includes the duty to clarify statutory language that prescribes the elements of a crime when clarification is essential to ensure that the jury will fully understand and actually find those elements in determining the defendant\u2019s guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The obligation to define critical terms follows from the fundamental proposition that \u201c\u2018[t]he criminal law cannot be administered justly or efficiently if the jury is allowed to speculate as to what conduct the law intended to proscribe by a specified crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 643 A.2d 996 (quoting <em>State v. Butler, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>560, 595, 143 A.2d 530 (1958)). This requirement applies \u201ceven when statutory terms have common or well-understood meanings based on ordinary experience.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Indeed, \u201cstatutes containing words whose meanings are ordinary and understandable often require a judicial determination with respect to their intended scope of application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 643 A.2d 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">This is not to say that every word used in a charge must be further defined even when it has a readily and commonly understood meaning. <em>See State v. Rovito, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>581, 584-85, 494 A.2d 309 (1985) (terms such as \u201coffer,\u201d \u201ctransfer,\u201d or \u201cotherwise transfer possession,\u201d as used in definition of \u201cto dispose of\u2019 in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1d, need no further definition for the jury). Certain words can be understood by \u201ca person of average intelligence\u201d and \u201cwould not send the average citizen scrambling for a dictionary.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>State v. Afanador, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>162, 171, 631 A.2d 946 (1993) (\u201corganizer, supervisor, financier or manager ... carry their ordinary and well understood meanings\u201d). Words \u201cused by ordinary citizens in everyday conversation\u201d need not be defined. <em>Id. </em>at 175, 631 A.2d 946. In this case, as we have pointed out, the critical words used in the alternative form of abandonment, such as \u201ccare for ... control ... custody ... physical risk ... sufficient protection,\u201d do not appear to be \u2018\u201cbeyond the ken of the average juror,\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hackett, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>66, 83, 764 A.2d 421 (2001), and would not require further clarification. <em>See State v. T.C., </em>347 <em>N. J.Super. </em>219, 242, 789 A.2d 173 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">However, the same cannot be said of \u201cwillfully\u201d and \u201cforsaking,\u201d as the facts of this case make clear. Defendant unquestionably left his child in the mall parking lot and ran away. However, it is arguable that he thereafter provided information concerning her whereabouts to a relative who then went to the police station, albeit the wrong one, to retrieve the child that same day. While defendant\u2019s niece testified that she called her grandmother in New York to relate K.\u2019s whereabouts, her testimony also was that defendant was with her when the call was made. Indeed, she testified that she, defendant, G.S., and defendant\u2019s other child, B., all remained in the van in the mall parking lot until defendant\u2019s brother later arrived with K. Given these facts, whether defendant could be said to have forsaken the child depends on whether the term requires a permanent relinquishment, which a jury might have found absent here, or whether forsaking can be satisfied by the type of temporary leaving, which the jury might also have found on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">One dictionary defines forsake as \u201c1: To renounce (as something once cherished) without intent to recover or resume ... 2: to quit or leave entirely: withdraw from ...\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>486 (1983), while another defines it as \u201c1. to give up, to renounce ... 2. to withdraw one\u2019s help or friendship or companionship from ...\u201d <em>Oxford American Dictionary </em>343 (Paperback ed.1982), and yet another as \u201c1. to quit or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>leave entirely; abandon; desert; 2. to give up or renounce (a habit or way of life, etc.)\u201d. <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Second Edition Unabridged </em>753 (1987). The definitional weight clearly suggests permanent relinquishment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, every dictionary makes clear that forsake is synonymous with abandonment. The definitions of abandonment, in turn, also refer to relinquishment with the intent of never again claiming an interest in the thing abandoned. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1 (7th ed.1999); <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 43; <em>Random House Dictionary, supra, </em>at 2. With respect to abandonment in the family law context, the dictionaries define the act as that of \u201cleaving a spouse or child willfully and without an intent to return.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s, supra, </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">While dictionary definitions may be employed to define imprecise terms,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a simple canvassing of dictionaries does not provide a definitive answer unless we are first able to determine the sense in which the Legislature used the term. <em>State v. Alexander, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 574, 643 A.2d 996. In the case of this statute, not only does the history fail to suggest that answer, but even the Criminal Law Revision Commission thought the terms potentially too imprecise for criminal prosecution. In proposing what is now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, the Commission expressed the following misgiving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">We are not happy with the breadth of, nor the precision of the definitions of, abuse, abandonment, cruelty and neglect in N.J.S. 9:6-1. The conduct which is appropriately prevented by non-criminal sanctions needs not always also be made criminal. Further, provisions of Chapter 6 of Title 9 show the basic thrust of it not to be to provide a criminal sanction but rather a strong remedy to compel support and/or proper conduct toward the child. Pending a reexamination of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>definitions for civil purposes, we do not believe we should tamper with them for criminal purposes which might destroy the most effective sanction to stop the misconduct. We do believe that reconsideration of this entire field of law would be appropriate. With hesitancy, then, we simply recommend continuation of existing law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\"><em>[Final Report, supra, </em>at 260.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The leading commentator on the Code has likewise noted that the \u201cTitle 9 citations in <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a] do not provide a clear definition of the sort of harm forbidden.\u201d Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 3 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Only a few cases have addressed the \u201cwillfully forsaking\u201d concept. In <em>In re A.B.M., </em>132 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>434, 28 A.2d 518 (E. &amp; A.1942), the Court found that a mother, who made arrangements for her unborn child to be immediately placed for adoption and who never contacted or even saw the child after its birth, had abandoned the child. Referring to the statutory definition of abandonment in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1, the Court said that the child had been \u201cwillfully forsaken while yet in the mother\u2019s womb.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441, 28 A.2d 518. The Court went on to quote with approval from <em>Winans v. Luppie, </em>47 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>302, 305, 20 A. 969 (E. &amp; A. 1890), that abandonment \u201cimport[s] any conduct on the part of the parent, which evidences a settled purpose to forego all parental duties, and relinquish all parental claims to the child.\u201d In <em>State v. Sanders, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>233, 553 A.2d 354 (App.Div.1989), we addressed the sufficiency of the factual basis supporting defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. We found that the action of the defendant, who had left her two-day-old baby in a bus station restroom in Philadelphia and boarded a bus from Atlantic City with the express purpose of leaving the child forever was sufficient, as constituting the \u201cultimate act\u201d of neglect under the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 237, 553 A.2d 354. The defect addressed in this case was apparently not raised, and therefore not addressed, in <em>Sanders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The alternative definitions of abandonment in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 also tend to support our view. Both of the other definitions proscribe \u201cfailing to care for and keep the control and custody of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>child\u201d so that the child shall be exposed to harm, subsection (b), or shall become a financial burden upon the public or others not chargeable with the child\u2019s care, subsection (c). Both of those alternatives do not require a permanent relinquishment and do not use the word forsaken which is employed, in stark contrast, only in subsection (a). We believe the Legislature was thereby drawing a line between harms, physical, moral, or financial, that might befall the child or others from even a temporary leaving, and the \u201cultimate act\u201d of neglect described by \u201cwillfully forsaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We conclude that the word \u201cforsaking,\u201d undefined in the statute, requires definition in order to guide a jury. We conclude further that based on the most common understanding, as well as the scant case law, \u201cforsaking\u201d must be understood as a permanent giving up or relinquishment of the child. We believe that such a definition comports most closely with the probable legislative intent. <em>See Burns v. Belafsky, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>466, 473, 766 A.2d 1095 (2001) (court\u2019s role in interpreting a statute is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent as if it had addressed the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">We must also consider the meaning of the word willfully used in conjunction with forsaking. The word appears in two places: under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21, the child must be \u201cwillfully abandoned,\u201d and under <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-1, \u201cwillfully forsaking a child\u201d is one of the definitions of abandonment. In <em>State v. Burden, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>424, 425, 315 A.2d 43 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>282, 321 A.2d 243 (1974), a pre-code case, defendant was convicted of willfully failing to provide her three small children with proper and sufficient food, clothing, maintenance, and medical attention in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 and 9:6-3. On appeal, defendant argued that \u201cwillfully\u201d required \u201cproof of an evil intent and knowledge on the part of defendant that harm would result from her action.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We disagreed, finding that \u201cevil intent or bad motive is not required to prove child neglect [under the statutes]. The word \u2018willfully\u2019 in the context of this statute means intentionally or purposely as <em>distinguished from inadvertently or acciden</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>tally.\u201d Id. </em>at 427, 315 A.2d 43 (emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Hofford, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>377, 384, 404 A.2d 1231 (App.Div.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Applying that definition in this case, the proofs certainly do not suggest that defendant left his child \u201cinadvertently or accidentally.\u201d <em>State v. Burden, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 427, 315 A.2d 43. The difficulty is, however, that if the <em>Burden </em>definition were carried forward into the Code offense, the trial judge would have been obliged to charge \u201cpurposely\u201d as the applicable mental state, which requires a \u201cconscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(l). However, <em>State v. Demarest, supra, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 334, 599 A.2d 937, held that \u201cknowing\u201d is the appropriate mental state for the offense charged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u201cKnowing\u201d is a less onerous burden than \u201cpurposely\u201d because it only requires awareness of what one is doing rather than it being the actor\u2019s \u201cconscious object\u201d to engage in prohibited conduct. Thus, we have the potentially untenable situation of a knowing offense subsuming conduct which is purposeful. Accordingly, defendant argues that <em>State v. Demarest </em>was \u201cwrongly decided to the extent that it authorizes a lesser culpability level than that spelled out in Title 9.\u201d In that regard, defendant points to the anomalous result that a civil action for abandonment under Title 9 would require a higher degree of culpability than a second degree criminal prosecution with exposure, as here, to ten years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">We do not believe that \u201cwillfully,\u201d as used in Title 9, was intended to describe the applicable mental state for criminal conviction. Under pre-Code law, mental elements for crimes were \u201cset forth by the use of terms such as \u2018unlawfully,\u2019 \u2018maliciously,\u2019 \u2018intentionally\u2019 and the meaning appropriate for the particular crime [was] left to the judiciary.\u201d <em>Final Report, supra, </em>Vol. II at 40.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For example, in <em>State v. Burden, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>427, 315 A.2d 43, the court equated -willfully with \u201cintentionally or purposely as distinguished from inadvertently or accidentally.\u201d Obviously the court was not using the word \u201cpurposely\u201d in the sense that it is now defined in the Code. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The fact that willfully is used in some of the subsections defining abuse, abandonment, and cruelty in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1, but not in others, and similarly in only some parts of the definition of \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21, and not at all in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-3, which actually sets forth the criminal offense, leads us to conclude that \u201cwillfully\u201d as used in \u201cwillfully forsaking\u201d does not set forth a culpable mental state and is, therefore, not in conflict with the knowing culpability requirement for <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4 established by <em>State v. Demarest. </em>Thus, the potentially untenable situation alluded to earlier, of having a knowing offense subsume a purposeful offense, would not exist. <em>State v. Demarest, supra, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 333, 599 A.2d 937; <em>cf. State v. Mendez, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>498, 504-11, 785 A.2d 945 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Having said this much, the fact remains that willful, even if used in the lay sense, does describe a type of mind-set and is not so well understood that the jury can be left without a definition. Returning to the dictionaries, the <em>Oxford American Dictionary, supra, </em>at 1068, defines willful as \u201c1. done with deliberate intention and not as an accident, <em>willful murder. 2. </em>self-willed, obstinate, <em>a willful child.\u201d </em>We believe that the emphasis should be on the absence of inadvertent or accidental conduct as the <em>Burden </em>court held. However, that state of mind is already sufficiently described by \u201cknowingly.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(2). As a result, willful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>becomes essentially superfluous. The only way to deal with this dilemma, other than judicially excising willful from the statute, is simply to make clear to the jury that the terms knowingly and willfully are generally synonymous in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We also note that the use of willfully to qualify both forsaking in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 and abandoned in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 emphasizes the permanency associated with forsaking and further supports our definition of that term as requiring a permanent relinquishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Given our conclusion that willfully as used in Title 9 does not refer to a different mental state than knowingly, it is difficult to conceive how the use of the term prejudiced defendant. If there was jury confusion, it could only have been to defendant\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Although defendant argued before the trial court that the evidence was insufficient to support his abandonment conviction based on \u201cwillfully forsaking,\u201d he did not object to the court\u2019s charge. We must, therefore, judge his present contention under the plain error standard, which compels reversal only if the error prejudicially affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights and is \u201csufficiently grievous to justify notice by the reviewing court and to convince the court that of itself the error possessed a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result.\u201d <em>State v. Hock, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>526, 538, 257 A.2d 699 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>930, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>2254, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>797 (1970); <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>see State v. Bey, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>45, 94-95, 548 A.2d 846 (1988). The possibility of an unjust result must be \u201c \u2018sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jordan, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>409, 422, 688 A.2d 97 (1997) (quoting <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">We conclude that if the jury based its guilty verdict on the undefined term \u201cwillfully forsaking,\u201d a reasonable doubt does exist as to whether the jury was led to a result it might not have otherwise reached. A rational jury, given an appropriate defin\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>tion of forsaking, could have concluded, even in the face of defendant\u2019s unconscionable behavior, that he did not intend to permanently abandon his child. We cannot forget that \u201ccharging errors are usually regarded as poor candidates for rehabilitation by harmless error treatment,\u201d <em>State v. Malloy, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>525, 533, 736 A.2d 532 (App.Div.1999) (citing <em>State v. Vick, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>288, 289, 566 A.2d 531 (1989)), and that \u201c[n]o surer showing of a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result can be made than a basic error in instructing the jury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>State v. Jordan, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 422-23, 688 A.2d 97); <em>see also State v. Simon, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>191, 206, 398 A.2d 861 (1979). It is not without significance that during deliberations the jury asked for a redefinition of abandonment, which resulted in a repeat of the inadequate and erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Regrettably, in the two decades since the Code was adopted, the Legislature has never acted on the Criminal Law Revision Commission\u2019s suggestion for a \u201creconsideration of this entire field of law____\u201d The imprecision of the Title 9 definitions incorporated into <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, which caused the Commission to be \u201cnot happy\u201d and to recommend adoption of the statute only \u201c[wjith hesitancy,\u201d has come home to roost in this case. It would, of course, be best if <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a was self-contained with its own appropriate and precise definitions. However, we leave that task to the Legislature, if it deems it appropriate to act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Defendant also argues that the court\u2019s charge was erroneous in that the judge mistakenly instructed the jury that the second aspect of abandonment consisted of \u201cfailing to care for and keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the control or custody of the child so that the child shall be exposed to physical risk without proper and sufficient protection,\u201d rather than, as the statute reads, \u201cfailing to care for and keep the control <em>and </em>custody of the child .... \u201d (emphasis added). Defendant contends further that the court compounded its error when it purported to repeat the initial charge in response to the jury question but omitted the words \u201ccare for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">As noted earlier, because defendant failed to object to the charge, we address his claim under the plain error standard. We conclude that there was no plain error in this aspect of the judge\u2019s instruction. We fail to see how the jury could, in light of the evidence, have been misled as a result of the judge stating \u201ccustody <em>or </em>control\u201d instead of \u201ccustody <em>and </em>control.\u201d In this ease, the State\u2019s evidence, obviously credited by the jury, was that defendant had both custody and control. As a result, the inadvertent substitution of \u201cor\u201d for \u201cand\u201d could not be said to have made it easier for the State to gain a conviction. Similarly, the court\u2019s omission of the words \u201ccare for\u201d did not in our view prejudice defendant. As found in the statute, \u201ccare for\u201d does not seem to convey anything different from \u201ckeep custody and control\u201d; if anything, the expression seems to require less.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">At trial and by way of post-trial motion, defendant did contest the sufficiency of the evidence to support the endangering charge. Given our definition of the term, we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to warrant submission of the case to the jury under a willfully forsaking theory. There is no doubt that arrangements were made within a relatively short period of time for K. to be reunited with her family. Therefore, a rational jury could not have found that the child was willfully forsaken. However, although the evidence of forsaking was insufficient, and indeed not even argued by the State at trial, we conclude that, giving the State the benefit of all favorable inferences, <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 459, 236 A.2d 385 (1967), the jury could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>found that defendant failed to keep custody or control of K. so that she would not be exposed to physical risk. After she tripped over the stroller or bag and fell to the ground, defendant left her in the parking lot of a busy shopping mall. We do not agree with defendant that \u201csomething more than one incident of a failure to watch someone for a short period of time is required.\u201d This was not a case of a briefly inattentive babysitter. Thus, while a jury could have acquitted defendant on this aspect of the abandonment definition,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the charge was adequate and the evidence supporting the conviction in that regard was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Having found that defendant\u2019s conviction could be properly based on the \u201cfailing to keep control and custody\u201d prong of the abandonment definition, but not on the \u201cwillfully forsaking\u201d prong, we must determine whether his endangerment conviction can stand. In <em>Stokes v. United States, </em>264 <em>F. </em>18, 23 (8th Cir.1920), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">A general verdict under an erroneous instruction cannot be upheld, when there were two theories submitted to the jury, on either of which they might have founded it, under one of which the instruction was harmless, while under the other it was error, because the generality of the verdict renders it impossible to determine upon which theory the jury based it. They may have founded it upon the very issue to which the erroneous instruction related, and that instruction may have controlled and produced their finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Our research reveals that <em>Stokes </em>states the majority view. <em>See James v. People, </em>727 P.2d 850, 853-55 (Colo.1986) (collecting cases); <em>Bloomquist v. State, </em>914 P.2d 812, 819 (Wyo.1996). Although our courts have not considered the issue in a criminal context, in <em>Maccia v. Tynes, </em>39 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 10, 120 A.2d 263 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>(App.Div.1956), we held that in a civil case \u201cwhere two issues are left to a jury, either of which may be determinative of the case, and a general verdict is brought in, making it impossible to ascertain upon which of the issues the verdict was founded ... there must be a reversal even if the error infects only one of the issues.\u201d We found this to be the more equitable result. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12, 120 A.2d 263; <em>see Gordon v. Noel, </em>356 <em>N.W.2d </em>559, 565 (Iowa 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Accordingly, we hold that where a criminal charge is submitted to a jury on alternate theories, and a legal or evidentiary deficiency renders one of the theories without support, a general verdict that does not identify which theory the jury relied upon must be reversed. Without the definition we have provided, the jury could have convicted defendant of endangerment on a theory that he abandoned K. by forsaking her, but not in failing to keep custody and control so as to expose her to a risk of physical harm. <em>See supra, </em>footnote 6. We simply do not know. While this might have been an apt case for submission of post-verdict interrogatories, <em>R. </em>3:19 \u2014 1(b); <em>see State v. Diaz, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>628, 642-45, 677 A.2d 1120 (1996); <em>State v. Hardison, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>379, 391, 492 A.2d 1009 (1985); <em>State v. M.L., </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 26-27, 600 A.2d 1211 (App.Div. 1991), certif. den. 127 <em>N.J. </em>560, 606 A.2d 371 (1992), that did not occur and defendant\u2019s conviction on count two must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">We have reviewed defendant\u2019s other claims of error, including those advanced in his supplemental <em>pro se </em>\u201cPetition,\u201d and find them without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). We add only the following comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Defendant contends that the court erred in denying his post-sentencing, <em>pro se </em>motion for transfer to a drug treatment program pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:21-10(b). The State concedes that the trial judge apparently did not realize that even second degree offenders faced with a presumption of incarceration are eligible for a drug treatment program under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-14, if the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>consents; if the prosecutor does not consent, the court may order a defendant admitted to a treatment program if the judge finds the prosecutor\u2019s objection to be \u201ca gross and patent abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14c. Although we agree with the State that defendant does not appear to meet all of the necessary criteria established by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-14c, we believe it would be most appropriate, under these circumstances, for the trial judge to consider the matter in the first instance. Because we reverse defendant\u2019s child endangering conviction, we need not address his arguments concerning the court\u2019s findings as to aggravating and mitigating factors on that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Because the error we have identified has no bearing upon defendant\u2019s conviction for theft and because he does not challenge his sentence on that charge, we affirm that judgment, subject to defendant\u2019s right to seek entry into a drug treatment program as discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial on count two; affirmed as to the judgment on count one.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-15\"> Defendant's brief violates <em>R. </em>2:6-2(a)(5) which requires that each legal issue be addressed separately \"under appropriate point headings.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> The common marriage vows\u2019 use of the term \"forsaking all others,\u201d certainly suggests a permanent, rather than temporary, commitment.
