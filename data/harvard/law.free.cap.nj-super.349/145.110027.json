A stalking charge, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-10b, was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>missed by the court on defendant\u2019s motion after the State\u2019s ease. After denial of his motion for a new trial, defendant was sentenced to concurrent three year probationary terms conditioned on serving four days, cumulatively, in the Passaic County jail, payment of mandatory penalties, and lifetime community supervision pursuant to Megan\u2019s Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4. Defendant appeals. We reverse and vacate defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Defendant\u2019s convictions arose out of two brief encounters that he had with D.D., a girl then thirteen years of age, one in February 1999 and the second on May 28,1999. According to the State\u2019s proofs, defendant, a thirty-four-year-old married man, and D.D. lived in the same neighborhood, a few blocks from each other. D.D. had resided in this neighborhood for about three or four years. They were not previously acquainted, however, although D.D. would pass by defendant\u2019s home on her way to the junior high school, where she was at the time a seventh grader, and occasionally see defendant going in or out of his house. Prior to the February 1999 encounter, they never spoke to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Defendant\u2019s first encounter with D.D. was sometime in February 1999 on a rainy morning at about 7:30 a.m. while D.D. was walking alone to school. D.D. did not have an umbrella, raincoat, or other rain gear, and was carrying a backpack. She was about a block from her school when defendant, on his way to the gym, pulled his car alongside of D.D., who was on his driver\u2019s side, and asked her if she wanted a ride. D.D. said \u201cno\u201d and continued on her way to school while defendant drove off. When she returned home from school, she mentioned the incident to her parents and was told by her father that she did the right thing in reporting the encounter to them. After the incident, D.D. continued walking the same path to school and, although they may have passed each other on the street, defendant never spoke to her again until their second encounter on May 28,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">On that day, at around 9:00 p.m., D.D. was riding her bicycle in the neighborhood with her two younger brothers \u2014 K.D., then age nine, and F.D., then age eleven \u2014 who were rollerblading. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>were on their way to visit a friend who lived nearby when, about one block from their home, defendant, alone in his car, pulled up behind them to their right and called out to D.D. to \u201ccome over here.\u201d D.D. did not respond because she either did not hear or was ignoring defendant, but F.D. asked \u201cwhat,\u201d to which defendant replied \u201cnot you, her.\u201d D.D. still did not respond but continued riding her bicycle, instructing her brothers to turn around with her and go home. Defendant repeated his request a few more times, inquiring of D.D. whether she remembered him and motioning for her to approach his car, which was stopped at the time. D.D. continued ignoring him and headed home with her brothers while defendant drove off. D.D. never spoke to defendant during this brief encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The children returned home and told their father, who in turn reported the incident to the police. Later that evening, defendant was brought to police headquarters and, under questioning, gave an account of the two encounters nearly identical to D.D.\u2019s version. He volunteered further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">I sec this girl all the time, all the time. I\u2019ve only spoken to her twice during the winter and today. Sometimes on the weekends or after school hours she\u2019s with friends, and tonight I saw' her on the bicycle. I know she\u2019s younger than me, but I didn\u2019t know she\u2019s a minor. She\u2019s cute, she\u2019s nice, but her looks are deceiving. I thought she\u2019s a teenager, about 16. Also her height, she\u2019s a pretty tall girl.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Defendant denied ever \u201cpicking up\u201d a girl he knew or believed to be a minor. When specifically asked about his attraction to D.D., defendant responded: \u201cI don\u2019t want to give up anything like my marriage, but what impressed me is her looks, she\u2019s attractive and her height. I don\u2019t know much about her.\u201d Defendant specifically recalled seeing D.D. one day on his way to Pathmark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">She was sitting on her front porch and I saw her talking to two young guys. I just drove by and we made eye contact and I just smiled at her. I was surprised that she lived there, I didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t jealous of them, they were in her age bracket, I guess I\u2019m just trying to take advantage of how I look now while I can. I am obsessed with her, but not like anything out of the ordinary. I find her attractive and there are plenty of young ladies that go by that way and sometimes I get to talk to them. Sometimes girls going to school or joggers. I don\u2019t usually fantasize about her but sometimes if it come to me. Mentally I\u2019ve thought of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>asking her for a date, but actually no, it\u2019s hard to come on to a lady straight. You have to play the game. I wish I could ask her out but physically it is hard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">He explained the May 28,1999 encounter in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">Yes, I said come over here. She didn\u2019t come over, she made a U-turn with the two boys and went up [the] Avenue. I just smiled and continued on my way. I wanted to talk to her because she was across the street, and I wanted to tell her that if she remembers me, and that I was the guy that lives over on the comer of [ ]. I just wanted to see her up close and hear her voice and what she\u2019s like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">At the close of the State\u2019s proofs, defendant moved to dismiss all three counts of the indictment. The trial judge dismissed only the count of stalking and, with respect to the other two counts, reasoned thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">The evidence does not indicate that either in February of 1999 or in May of 1999, that the conversation dealt with sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">In fact D.D. herself testified that there was nothing sexual. The defendant did not do anything that, under the circumstanees-did not follow her, did not offer to take her anywhere, did not show her anything; did not ask her any other questions and did not mention he liked her or thought she was pretty or attractive and this would be [applicable] to both February of 1999 and May of 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">What moves it in the direction of sex is the statement of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">It\u2019s very close in my judgment as to whether or not both Counts 2 and 3 should be dismissed. It\u2019s a close question I believe, but as I indicated the standard is that the State does not have to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt, and I think when you consider the totality of the circumstances in giving the State the benefit of all its favorable testimony as well as all of the favorable inferences which reasonably could be drawn therefrom, I think ... a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, that is to say, I think the jury can conclude that it was the defendant\u2019s conscious object both as to Count 2 and as to Count 3 to engage in a sexual act with this person which would be a prohibited offense or a criminal offense or sexual contact given her age being 13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">Now it might be that he just wanted to ask her for a date, but, on the other hand, it might have been that he wanted to get her into the car to commit some type of sexual act with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-13\">Now, you don\u2019t get it from what he said to her, but arguably you get it from the fascination that he had with her in terms of his statement to the police, and I realize it\u2019s somewhat of a stretch, but I really think it\u2019s a question that the jury should decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-14\">I don\u2019t recall having such a close question since I\u2019ve been here, but I\u2019m going to deny the motion as to Counts 2 and 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>On appeal, defendant raises several issues, all of which contest the sufficiency of the evidence to support his dual convictions. We have concluded, after reviewing the entire record in light of the arguments advanced on appeal, that there was no reasonable basis upon which the jury might have convicted defendant for child luring and attempted child endangerment. Because an acquittal on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence was warranted, we vacate defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The standard to be applied in deciding a motion for judgment of acquittal made under <em>R. </em>3:18-1 at the close of the State\u2019s case is whether or not the evidence, be it direct or circumstantial, viewed in its entirety and giving the State the benefit of all the evidence favorable to it and all favorable inferences which could be reasonably drawn therefrom, is sufficient to enable a jury to find that defendant is guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt. If the evidence is insufficient to warrant a conviction, then the motion must be granted. <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 458-459, 236 A.2d 385 (1967); <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>7, 11, 357 A.2d 59 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>495, 366 A.2d 651 (1976). We apply the same standard as the trial court in reviewing its denial of a motion for acquittal. <em>State v. Moffa, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>258, 263, 200 A.2d 108 (1964). A reversal on the ground of insufficient evidence requires an acquittal. <em>Hudson v. Louisiana, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>40, 43, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>970, 972, 67 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>30, 33 (1981); <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>1, 16, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2141, 2149-50, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1, 12-13 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Both crimes with which defendant was charged are inchoate in nature, involving conduct designed to culminate in the commission of a substantive offense but that has not yet achieved its completion because something remains to be done by the actor. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5:1a. Because situations at this stage are often ambiguous, and equivocal behavior may be misconstrued as preparation to commit a crime, to prevent the danger of abuse, criminal attempt is limited to an offense of criminal purpose implemented by an overt act strongly corroborative of such purpose. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>Farrad, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>247, 257-58, 758 A.2d 648 (2000). Thus, an attempt must be purposive; no lesser mental state will suffice. <em>State v. Robinson, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>476, 485, 643 A.2d 591 (1994); <em>State v. Crescenzi </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>142, 147, 539 A.2d 1250 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>597, 546 A.2d 520 (1988). And the purpose must be to cause a particular result. <em>See State in Interest of J.L.W., </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 341 n. 3, 565 A.2d 1106 (App.Div.1989). This element of purposive conduct requires an exploration of the actor\u2019s intent, not merely the possible consequences of his action. <em>See State v. Battle, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 258-59, 507 A.2d 297 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>560, 523 A.2d 194 (1986). The \u201cpurpose\u201d requirement is interrelated with the general rule that there must be substantial steps strongly corroborative of the firmness of defendant\u2019s purpose to carry out the crime. <em>See State v. Fornino, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>531, 538, 539 A.2d 301 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>570, 546 A.2d 499, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>859, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>152, 102 L.Ed.2d 123 (1988). The requirement that the actor\u2019s conduct shall strongly corroborate his purpose to commit a crime is intended to assure that it demonstrates that he is being guided by a criminal purpose. <em>See </em>Cannel, <em>Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 6 on <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:5-1b (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Thus, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-6 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">A person commits a crime of the third degree if he attempts to lure or entice a child into a motor vehicle ... with a purpose to commit a criminal offense with or against the child. \u201cChild\u201d as used in this act means a person less than 18 years old.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The elements of this offense are (1) that the defendant attempted to lure or entice into a motor vehicle; (2) a child under eighteen years-old; and (3) the defendant had a purpose to commit a criminal offense with or against the child. <em>State v. Olivera, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>583, 589, 782 A.2d 988 (App.Div.2001). The Legislature has chosen to condition a defendant\u2019s culpability for luring on a purpose to commit a \u201ccriminal offense,\u201d a term equated with \u201ccrime,\u201d defined as \u201c[a]n offense ... for which a sentence of imprisonment in excess of 6 months is authorized.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>2C:1-4a. <em>See State v. Olivera, supra, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 589, 782 A.2d 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The other crime that defendant was charged with attempting to commit, child endangerment, is defined thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">Any person having a legal duty for the care of a child or who has assumed responsibility for the care of a child who engages in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of the child, or who causes the child harm that would make the child an abused or neglected child as defined in R.S.9:6-1, R.S.9:6-3 and P.L. 1974, c. 119, s. 1 (C.9:6 \u2014 8.21) is guilty of a crime of the second degree. <em>Any other person </em>who engages in conduct or who causes harm as described in this subsection to a child under the age of 16 is guilty of a crime of the third degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\"><em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">This offense prohibits impairing or debauching the morals of a child by sexual conduct. Although the term \u201csexual conduct\u201d is not defined, clearly included are sexual assault and sexual contact as those terms are used in Chapter 14. <em>See State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 537 A.2d 667 (1988); <em>State v. Miller, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>112, 527 A.2d 1362 (1987); <em>State v. Hess, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 486 A.2d 1301 (App.Div.1984); <em>State v. Davis, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 550 A.2d 1241 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Both crimes, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-6 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, focus on the actor\u2019s intent. Indeed, a critical issue in this case pertains to the purpose with which defendant acted on the two occasions he encountered D.D. Again we stress that a purpose to commit a crime is required under both statutory provisions \u2014 and in the case of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-4a, a crime of a sexual nature\u2014 because \u201cmuch that is inappropriate, unseemly, reprehensible, or even unlawful, falls below that threshold.\u201d <em>State v. Olivera, supra, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 590, 782 A.2d 988. And it is <em>not </em>just any notion of criminal purpose that will suffice, but rather the criminal purpose alleged by the State. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 782 A.2d 988. <em>See also State v. Petties, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>310, 319-21, 654 A.2d 979 (1995); <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>311, 315-16, 560 A.2d 1240 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">In this case, the allegation is that defendant wanted to lure D.D. into his car for some type of sexual contact, which, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>would endanger the morals and welfare of the child. To establish this purpose, the State introduced into evidence a statement defendant gave to police on the evening of the May 28, 1999 incident suggesting, at most, his physical attraction to D.D., but acknowledging a disinclination to act on it. Aside from the two underlying encounters themselves, this singular statement of defendant was the only evidence of intent offered by the State. However, being physically attracted to D.D. does not prove that defendant intended to commit a crime, much less a crime of a sexual nature with or against D.D. <em>See State v. Covell, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>554, 566, 725 A.2d 675 (1999). And given the neutral circumstances attending the two encounters, we conclude that defendant\u2019s statement does not make it more likely that his purpose in approaching D.D. on both occasions was to commit a sexual crime with or against her. .</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">This situation is clearly distinct from that in <em>State v. Covell, </em>where the defendant\u2019s sixteen-month-old highly incriminating statement \u2014 admitting to a problem \u201cwith young girls that I can\u2019t help\u201d \u2014 was used in conjunction with an alleged prior incident of lewdness involving another young girl in a grocery store to prove that his present conduct in motioning at and calling for an eight-year-old girl to enter his car before anyone saw her was designed to cause or culminate in the commission of a crime against her. Considering the fact that, in the prior incident, the defendant was observed lowering two plastic plums to the level of his groin area and having an erection while talking to a young girl, the Court concluded that his statement \u201cdoes make it more likely that defendant\u2019s purpose in beckoning to [the minor] was to commit a sexual crime with or against her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566-67, 725 A.2d 675. Here, in contrast, defendant\u2019s statement is the State\u2019s only evidence to prove his intent or motive and its content, which is at most ambiguous and lacking in specificity, certainty and firmness of resolve, is simply not probative of a criminal purpose in beckoning D.D. on either or both occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Even if defendant\u2019s statement were considered evidential of a criminal purpose, the State\u2019s proofs fail to satisfy the other interrelated requirement of attempt liability, namely that of an overt act strongly corroborative of such purpose. As noted, a criminal attempt requires that the actor take a \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward commission of a crime. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1a(3). For an act to be considered a substantial step, it must be strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor\u2019s purpose to carry out the crime. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5 \u2014 1(b); <em>State v. Fomino, supra, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 538, 539 A.2d 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Neither of defendant\u2019s two encounters with D.D., even when viewed together, qualifies. In the first incident, in February 1999, defendant merely offered D.D. a short ride to school while it was raining and the minor was without any rain gear. Three months later, on May 28, 1999, without any interaction in the meantime, defendant motioned for D.D. to come over to his car to talk while she was riding her bicycle, accompanied by her two brothers, and close to home. Absent from these approaches was any sexual innuendo, overtone, or content. On both occasions, defendant took no further action than the initial request, and left the scene immediately upon D.D.\u2019s rejection. He neither issued a command, opened the car door, nor engaged her in further conversation. In fact, on the second occasion he did not even request that D.D. enter the car. Nor did he employ any enticement in either instance. There was no lying in wait, searching, or following. Indeed, the trial judge properly granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case on the stalking charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">This conduct is even more neutral and innocuous than the accused\u2019s behavior in <em>State v. Olivera, supra, </em>during the first of two alleged child luring incidents that was dismissed on the defense\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s proofs in that case. In <em>Olivera, </em>thirteen-year-old E.T. was walking alone to her seventh grade class when a van driven by the defendant slowed down as it passed her, then pulled up beside her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>again. The defendant, who was in his late thirties, began a conversation with E.T., eventually inviting her to examine some sports equipment in the back of his van. E.T., who was within one block of her school at this point, walked away. The defendant, who had never exited the van, left the scene. 344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 586-87, 782 A.2d 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The second incident in <em>Olivera, </em>involving another thirteen-year-old girl almost one year later, and for which the same defendant was convicted, evidenced conduct far more substantial and incriminating than that involved here. <em>Id. </em>at 587, 782 A.2d 988. E.R. was walking alone to her seventh grade class on a day when the weather was clear and dry. She was about one block from school when a detective, coincidentally in the area, spotted the defendant pull his van over in the roadway and, with his head speaking out the window, engage E.R. in conversation. The defendant asked her if she went to the school, where he said that his son also had gone. He then asked if she spoke Spanish. She said she did, and he began speaking to her in Spanish. The defendant then asked her if she needed a ride to school, opened his passenger door, and motioned for her to enter. E.R. declined the invitation, saying \u201cthe school\u2019s right there,\u201d and the van drove off. The detective then approached E.R., found out what happened, and pursued the van. When questioned about his conversation with E.R., the defendant explained that he knew the girl\u2019s father. The following day, after learning of the earlier reported incident with E.T., the detective arrested the defendant on an outstanding motor vehicle warrant at which time the defendant admitted lying to the officer the day before and also denied any knowledge of the prior incident with E.T. <em>Id. </em>at 588, 782 A.2d 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In contrast, we find that none of defendant\u2019s acts here, viewed alone or in the aggregate, may be considered \u201csubstantial,\u201d and therefore their commission could not be a criminal attempt. Although defendant\u2019s statement to the police may betray an intent to act \u201cinappropriately, unseemly or reprehensibly\u201d towards D.D., to further infer a criminal purpose from what at best may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>characterized as the early stages of this potential conduct would be too remote, tenuous, and speculative a proposition. In other words, whether the attempt statute serves to criminalize defendant\u2019s conduct in this case is not a question simply of degree. Rather, it involves, as a threshold matter, an inquiry into whether these acts demonstrate that defendant is being guided by a criminal purpose so as to satisfy the \u201csubstantial step\u201d requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1a(3). For reasons stated, we conclude they do not and find the trial judge erred when he held that a reasonable jury could find otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction is vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
