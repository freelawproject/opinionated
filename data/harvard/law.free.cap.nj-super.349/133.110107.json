When defendant Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Company, plaintiffs\u2019 insurer, refused to pay plaintiffs\u2019 judgment under the uninsured/underinsured motorist provision of their policy, plaintiffs instituted a declaratory judgment action against defendant. Defendant claimed that it was not liable to plaintiffs because they had failed to give it sufficient notice of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the judge granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, finding that defendant received notice of plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The judgment was stayed for sixty days, however, so that defendant could conduct discovery on the issue of whether the tortfeasor was truly uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Defendant filed a motion for reconsideration. Although the motion judge reaffirmed her earlier determination that defendant had received notice of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, she reversed the summary judgment order with respect to damages because no one had represented defendant\u2019s interests at the proof hearing and, therefore, the damages award would have to be arbitrated pursuant to plaintiffs\u2019 policy with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Plaintiffs appeal the order that requires the issue of damages to be arbitrated. They assert that defendant is bound by the default judgment for damages because it declined to intervene in the underlying tort action after receiving notice. Defendant cross-appeals from the order finding that it had notice of plaintiffs\u2019 claim. It argues that plaintiffs did not provide adequate notice and if they did, the default judgment for damages is not binding and the matter should proceed to arbitration. We reject plaintiffs\u2019 contentions and affirm the order requiring the issue of plaintiffs\u2019 damages to be submitted to arbitration. We also reject defendant\u2019s notice argument and affirm the order finding that defendant received notice of plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">On June 1,1996, plaintiff James Vaccaro was driving a car along Ocean Avenue in Belmar. His wife, plaintiff Karen Vaccaro, was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>passenger. At the same time, Miguel Arenas was driving a car owned by Alica Gaticaseguel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> along River Road in Belmar. At some point, the car driven by Arenas struck the Vaccaro car. Plaintiffs\u2019 car was insured by defendant. Gaticaseguel\u2019s car was insured by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cLiberty Mutual\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">On July 3, 1996, plaintiffs filed a complaint against Arenas and Gaticaseguel in the Law Division, Monmouth County, seeking compensatory damages <em>(Vaccaro v. Arenas </em>action). Gaticaseguel filed an answer to the complaint, denying liability, and asserting a counterclaim for contribution and indemnity against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On June 2, 1997, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel wrote a letter to defendant, which informed it that plaintiffs had been in an accident on June 1, 1996; that they were insured by defendant; that they had filed a lawsuit against the owner and the operator of the other car; and that the owner\u2019s insurance company, Liberty Mutual, had denied coverage. The letter also stated that Gaticaseguel had filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting lack of agency, and that plaintiffs had moved for substituted service on Liberty Mutual because Arenas could not be served. The letter advised that both motions were returnable on June 13, 1997. The letter concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">Because of the denial of coverage by Liberty Mutual, the tortfeasor\u2019s car may be uninsured. I am making a claim for Uninsured Motorist benefits on behalf of both James and Karen Vaccaro for personal injuries sustained in this accident, contingent on whether Liberty Mutual has validly disclaimed coverage. You are invited to participate in the liability action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Defendant received the letter on June 4, 1997. On September 16, 1997, defendant, through its claims representative, Arlene L. Gonzalez, acknowledged notice of plaintiffs\u2019 UM claim, although Gonzalez and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had been in telephone contact at least a month earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">On January 12, 1998, plaintiffs requested the entry of default against Liberty Mutual in the <em>Vaccaro v. Arenas </em>action based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>upon its failure to answer the complaint in that matter. Liberty Mutual was required to file an answer because plaintiffs had obtained a court order permitting substituted service upon Arenas, who could not be located, through Liberty Mutual. Liberty Mutual had been served pursuant to the order for substituted service. A default against Liberty Mutual was entered. On May 14, 1999, the default against Liberty Mutual was vacated and a default against Arenas was entered. The same order provided that a proof hearing would be scheduled subsequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">At some point in 1998, Gaticaseguel filed a declaratory judgment action against Liberty Mutual and plaintiffs <em>(Gaticaseguel v. Liberty Mutual </em>action). Gaticaseguel alleged in her complaint that Arenas was not authorized to drive her car at the time of the accident and that Liberty Mutual had refused to meet her demand to defend and indemnify her in the <em>Vaccaro v. Arenas </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">On August 12, 1999, a proof hearing was held in the <em>Vaccaro v. Arenas </em>action. Prior to the hearing, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel provided notice of the hearing to Liberty Mutual. No notice of the proof hearing was provided to defendant. Following the uncontested proof hearing, judgment was entered in the amount of $305,710.62 in favor of plaintiffs and against Arenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">On September 8, 1999, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel wrote defendant\u2019s representative, Gonzalez, and reminded her that, \u201c[ajbout two years ago,\u201d he had placed defendant on notice about plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpotential uninsured motorist claim.\u201d Counsel said that because the default judgment against \u201cthe tortfeasor\u201d exceeded the coverage under Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy, he was asserting a claim for underinsured motorist benefits on behalf of plaintiffs. Further, counsel stated his intention to proceed with arbitration of the claim immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">On January 24, 2000, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel again wrote to Gonzalez and reminded her of the default judgment entered against \u201cthe tortfeasor.\u201d Counsel informed Gonzalez that Gaticasequel had filed a declaratory judgment action against Liberty Mutual, that trial had been scheduled for March 6, 2000, and that summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>judgment motions filed by plaintiffs, Gaticaseguel and Liberty Mutual were returnable the Friday before trial. Again, counsel invited defendant \u201cto participate.\u201d Counsel\u2019s letter concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">The outcome of the declaratory judgment action will determine whether the Vaccaro\u2019s claim is for UM or UIM benefits. I understand that the tort feasor\u2019s policy limit is only $35,000.00 which is only a fraction of the default judgment entered against the tort feasor. Therefore, a claim against the Penn National policy has been made regardless of the outcome of the declaratory judgment action. I note this for your benefit because I have not received a response to my previous letter requesting your position on Arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In addition, in the <em>Gaticaseguel v. Liberty Mutual </em>action, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a third-party complaint against defendant. Leave was granted, but there is no indication in the record that the complaint was ever filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Subsequently, on March 3, 2000, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment in the <em>Gaticaseguel v. Liberty Mutual </em>action was denied. Gatieaseguel\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted. The judge declared that as of the date of plaintiffs\u2019 accident \u201cLiberty Mutual had not effectively canceled [Gaticaseguel\u2019s] automobile insurance policy\u201d and, therefore, she was entitled to a defense in the Vaccaro <em>v. Arenas </em>action. The judge also granted Liberty Mutual\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment against plaintiffs, declaring that they were not \u201centitled to benefits under the Gaticaseguel automobile insurance policy.\u201d The effect of this latter ruling was that Arenas was uninsured on June 1, 1996, the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Two days later, on March 5, 2000, plaintiffs commenced this action seeking a judgment against defendant in the amount of $305,710.62, pursuant to the uninsured motorist provision of plaintiffs\u2019 policy with defendant. This represented the total amount of the default judgment against Arenas. Defendant filed an answer denying liability and asserting various defenses, including plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Thereafter, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, relying on <em>Zirger v. General Accident Ins. Co., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>327, 676 A.2d 1065 (1996), to support their claim that the default judgment entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>against Arenas was binding <em>on </em>defendant and therefore defendant was obligated to satisfy the judgment. Defendant cross-moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, asserting that plaintiffs had failed to provide notice of the <em>Vaccaro v. Arenas </em>action or the <em>Gaticaseguel v. Liberty Mutual </em>action. It argued that the failure of notice did not give it any opportunity to be heard and defend \u201cthe underlying claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The motion judge granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion, concluding that defendant had. received notice of plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Defendant\u2019s cross-motion was denied. The judge, however, allowed a sixty-day discovery period to determine whether Arenas was truly uninsured. The judgment, in favor of plaintiffs, was stayed for the discovery period.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Defendant moved for reconsideration. The motion judge reaffirmed her earlier decision with respect to notice, but concluded that the issue of \u201cthe appropriate amount of damages ... should be done in an arbitration.\u201d This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">We are satisfied that plaintiffs provided adequate notice to defendant of both the <em>Vaccaro v. Arenas </em>and <em>Gaticaseguel v. Liberty Mutual </em>actions that would have allowed defendant to move to intervene. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s letter of June 2, 1997, advised defendant that: (1) plaintiffs had been injured in an accident on June 1, 1996; (2) they had filed a lawsuit against the tortfeasors; (3) the tortfeasor was insured by Liberty Mutual; (4) plaintiffs may make a claim against defendant for UM benefits; and (5) Defendant was \u201cinvited to participate in the liability action.\u201d Defendant declined to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Furthermore, plaintiffs\u2019, by their attorney\u2019s letter of January 24, 2000, advised defendant of the <em>Gaticaseguel v. Liberty Mutual </em>action, the declaratory judgment suit. Although plaintiffs\u2019 notice to defendant could have been provided much sooner, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel advised defendant of the status of the case, the fact that motions for summary judgment were pending, and again invited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>defendant to participate. Again, defendant declined to intervene or take steps to \u201cparticipate\u201d in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the motion judge must have confused the June 2, 1997, letter with the January 24, 2000, letter is disingenuous, at best. The first letter clearly stated that plaintiffs had been injured in an automobile accident on June 1, 1996; that they had filed the <em>Vaccaro v. Arenas </em>action; that Gaticaseguel\u2019s car \u201cmay be uninsured\u201d as the result of Liberty Mutual\u2019s denial of coverage; and that counsel was <em>\u201cmaking a claim for Uninsured Motorist benefits on behalf of both James and Karen Vaccaro for personal injuries sustained in this accident, </em>contingent on whether Liberty Mutual has validly disclaimed coverage\u201d (emphasis added). The letter concluded by \u201cinvit[ing] [defendant] to participate in the liability action.\u201d Thus, we conclude, as did the motion judge, that counsel\u2019s June 2, 1997, letter was a sufficiently definitive notice that plaintiffs were making a claim against defendant for uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We now address plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the order that requires the parties to arbitrate plaintiffs\u2019 damages. Plaintiffs contend that the motion judge committed reversible error when she reconsidered her initial ruling to enter judgment against defendant on the default judgment granted to plaintiffs as a result of the proof hearing and determined that the issue of plaintiffs\u2019 damages had to be decided in arbitration. According to plaintiffs, <em>Zirger </em>required defendant to intervene in the <em>Vaccaro v. Arenas </em>action, and its failure to do so, after having been placed on notice of the action, rendered it bound by the default judgment entered against Arenas. Plaintiffs argue that the motion judge erred when she ruled that <em>Zirger </em>did not apply to default judgments because no one with interests similar to those of defendant had appeared at the proof hearing. They assert that because the issue of their damage was resolved by the proof hearing, defendant cannot relitigate this issue in arbitration. They contend that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>defendant desired to contest the amount of damages, it should have intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Plaintiffs assert that <em>Zirger </em>expressly holds that an insurer, which has declined the opportunity to intervene in an underlying tort action, is barred from enforcing the standard arbitration clause in the UM/UIM endorsement of its insurance policy. They argue that \u201cto broadly exempt default judgments from the holding of <em>Zirger </em>creates a loophole that our Supreme Court never intended and rewards insurance carriers for doing exactly what the Supreme Court did not want them to do, that is, ignore the liability action in favor of a subsequent arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The arbitration clause here is a \u201cstandard arbitration clause widely used in the industry.\u201d <em>Zirger, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 330, 676 A.2d 1065. In <em>Zirger, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 332, 676 A.2d 1065, our Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a plaintiff, who had tried to conclusion his or her claim against a tortfeasor and received an award of damages in the Law Division, could nevertheless be forced to relitigate the damages issue before an arbitration panel pursuant to the arbitration clause in the UM/UIM endorsement of his or her automobile liability insurance policy. There, the plaintiff sustained personal injuries in an accident involving an automobile driven by Joseph Filsaime. <em>Id. </em>at 330, 676 A.2d 1065. Although Filsaime\u2019s liability policy afforded only $15,000 in coverage, the plaintiffs policy with the defendant General Accident Insurance Company (GA) provided $1 million in underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage. <em>Ibid. </em>The UIM endorsement, however, contained an arbitration clause and did not bind GA to \u201c[a]ny judgment for damages arising out of a \u2018suit\u2019 brought without [GA\u2019s] written consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331, 676 A.2d 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">After the plaintiff had instituted a negligence action against Filsaime, his counsel informed GA about the limit of liability on Filsaime\u2019s policy, and asked GA\u2019s permission to settle for the policy limits so that he could pursue a UIM claim under his policy with GA. <em>Id. </em>at 331, 676 A.2d 1065. In addition, counsel demanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>arbitration pursuant to the UIM endorsement of the GA policy. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Both sides chose arbitrators, and a few months later, GA consented to the plaintiffs settlement of his claim against Filsaime for the policy limits. <em>Ibid. </em>However, the settlement never took place. <em>Ibid. </em>After a jury found Filsaime liable for the plaintiffs injuries, Filsaime\u2019s carrier offered to settle the case for the $15,000 policy limit. <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiffs counsel called GA\u2019s counsel and said that he was inclined to reject the offer and proceed to trial on damages. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Although counsel for GA said that the matter could proceed to trial on damages, he claimed that he never waived GA\u2019s contractual right to arbitration. <em>Ibid. </em>Counsel further asserted that GA was not authorized to preclude the plaintiff from proceeding to trial on damages, and, therefore, counsel\u2019s \u201cinformal authorization\u201d was of \u201cno significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331-32, 676 A.2d 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The plaintiff was awarded $400,000 in damages by the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 676 A.2d 1065. He then demanded payment of that amount, less the $15,000, from GA. <em>Ibid. </em>GA refused, and the plaintiff instituted a declaratory judgment action. <em>Ibid. </em>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the judge concluded that GA had waived its contractual right to arbitration by impliedly consenting to the litigation between the plaintiff and Filsaime and granted summary judgment to the plaintiff. <em>Ibid. </em>On appeal, we reversed. <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded that GA had not waived its right to arbitration because its consent to the litigation \u201cwas not sufficiently unequivocal and decisive.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, we said that GA \u201ccould not be collaterally estopped from relitigating the damages question because its interests and Filsaime\u2019s were not sufficiently similar to conclude that Filsaime\u2019s litigation of the damages claim provided adequate representation of [GA]\u2019s interest in minimizing its ultimate liability under the UIM endorsement.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Our Supreme Court disagreed and reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 344, 676 A.2d 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Applying principles of collateral estoppel, the Court expressly held \u201cthat a UM/UIM carrier that intervened in the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tort litigation, or declined to exercise its opportunity to intervene, is barred from enforcing the standard arbitration clause in the UM/UIM endorsement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342, 676 A.2d 1065. Although the Court recognized that its holding \u201cmay constitute a modification of the usual requirements for privity,\u201d the Court was nevertheless \u201cconvinced that the UM/UIM carrier\u2019s interests can be protected adequately in the underlying action and that the common interests of the UM/UIM carrier and the tortfeasor\u2019s carrier effectively serve the purposes of the privity requirement.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Further, the court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">We invalidate the eontractnal arbitration clause only to the extent that it requires an arbitration proceeding that duplicates the underlying litigation of the tort claim. For example, if the underlying tort claim does not result in an adjudication of damages, as is often the case, the arbitration clause in the UM/UIM policy will be given full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\"><em>{Id. </em>at 343, 676 <em>A.2d </em>lO\u00edi\u00f1.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Essentially, <em>Zirger </em>was concerned with the \u201cavoidance of redundant litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 676 A.2d 1065. In other words, if the UM/UIM carrier is put on notice of the underlying tort claim that is fully litigated with the tortfeasor, the UM/UIM carrier acts at its peril when it declines to intervene. We are satisfied that <em>Zirger </em>contemplates a contested damages trial to bind the UM/UIM carrier. An uncontested proof hearing that fixes damages is not the equivalent of an adjudication of damages so as to invalidate the contractual arbitration clause. To bind the UM/UIM carrier, there must be notice to the carrier and an adversarial proceeding that determines damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">We find support for our conclusion in the language from the opinion of the Nevada Supreme Court in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Pietrosh, </em>85 <em>Nev. </em>310, 454 P.2d 106 (1969), cited with approval in <em>Zirger. </em>The Nevada Supreme Court observed that invalidating the arbitration clause and binding the carrier to the damage judgment after trial was appropriate when the carrier had been notified of the litigation. The Nevada Court went on to observe that enforcement of the arbitration clause \u201c \u2018may be appropriate in a case where the insured secures a default judgment against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>uninsured motorist, since an adversary determination of liability and damages is absent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zirger, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 336, 676 A.2d 1065 (quoting <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Pietrosh, supra, </em>454 P.2d at 110-11). Here, because plaintiffs\u2019 damages were fixed at a proof hearing, resulting from Arenas\u2019 default, the arbitration clause in the policy is valid and plaintiffs must arbitrate the issue of their damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Finally, at oral argument, defendant argued that had it intervened in this default proceeding, it would have invoked its arbitration clause and the issue of plaintiffs\u2019 damages would have been decided in that forum and not at a proof hearing. We cannot disagree with defendant\u2019s position because the policy allows either party to \u201cdemand\u201d arbitration when there is a disagreement as to whether plaintiffs are entitled to damages or the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 damages is in dispute. Moreover, the arbitration clause allows both sides to select an arbitrator, with the two arbitrators selecting the third member of the arbitration panel. Arbitration, therefore, allows the parties to partially select who will decide the issues, something that is unavailable in a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Because of the default, there was no tortfeasor to cause an adjudication of damages that renders any subsequent relitigation of plaintiffs\u2019 damages in an arbitration proceeding unnecessary. In other words, there is not the \u201canomaly of the use of arbitration as a supplement to an adjudication in court.\u201d <em>Zirger, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 342, 676 A.2d 1065. Here, the arbitration is a substitute for the litigation of damages, because no real litigation of that issue occurred in the trial court. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\"> Alica Gaticaseguel\u2019s surname in the record is also spelled Gaticasequel and Gaticasecuel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
