Lewis had left no will. Letters of estate administration were therefore issued to her parents, Meredith M. Stewart and Ronald L. Lewis, pursuant to SCPA 1001 (1) (d); although decedent had been married to James A. Simmons, the marriage ended without issue in 2007 when the couple divorced, leaving decedent\u2019s parents as her sole distributees <em>(see </em>EPTL 4-1.1 [a] [4]). They, however, renounced their interest in decedent\u2019s Clayton, New York residence in favor of decedent\u2019s brothers Ronald L. Lewis, II and Jonathan Lewis. The Clayton property, which had been in decedent\u2019s family for generations, would thus have passed to decedent\u2019s blood relations but for the December 2010 filing in Jefferson County Surrogate\u2019s Court of petitions to revoke the parents\u2019 letters of administration and to admit to probate a will executed by decedent in Texas in 1996. That will bequeathed all of decedent\u2019s property, real and personal, to her then husband James A. Simmons, and named him as the will\u2019s executor. The will had been in the possession of the ex-husband\u2019s mother who retrieved it from her dresser after her son informed her that he had learned during a recent Internet search of his former wife\u2019s death some eight months before. The son brought the will to an attorney, and this proceeding was shortly commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The present petitions, however, were brought not by the son but, nominally, by his father, James Robert Simmons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the son was disqualified by reason of his divorce from decedent from serving as her executor or taking under the proffered pre-divorce will <em>(see </em>EPTL 5-1.4 [a] [1], [3]), decedent\u2019s former father-in-law, who was named in the will as decedent\u2019s alternate executor and beneficiary, was not so disqualified under New York law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which governs the disposition of decedent\u2019s New York real property, the sole asset of significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>value in her estate. Objections to probate were filed by decedent\u2019s parents and brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">During the ensuing probate proceedings, decedent\u2019s ex-husband testified that the will offered for probate was one of a pair of reciprocal or \u201cmirror\u201d wills made by the then married couple. Those wills and several other instruments bearing on end-of-life decisions were, according to the former husband, executed during a single session at an attorney\u2019s office in Texas in 1996. Each instrument, he said, was generated in quadruplicate, and although he described each set of four as composed of one original and three \u201ccopies,\u201d the natural, albeit less than certain, import of his testimony was that each copy was intended to be a functional instrument. He testified,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201cthey were all done [the same day] at [the attorney\u2019s] office, both the originals of course and the copies. And we planned from that day, Robyn and I, to leave one set at my parents\u2019 house, one set at our Texas house, one set at the New York house and one set in a safe deposit box. That was all planned out before we sat down that day and ~ and signed all those signatures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Later in his testimony he explained, \u201cwe had four sets of everything at each house for a reason. We both traveled. We knew that one house could burn down, this, that and the other.\u201d During the probate proceeding, testimony was also elicited from Marilew Barnes. Ms. Barnes had been decedent\u2019s friend, neighbor and confidante. She had been given powers of attorney by decedent \u2014 both legal and medical \u2014 and had assisted decedent with financial and health-related matters during the period following her divorce when her ability to manage her own affairs was compromised by the debilitating and ultimately fatal sequelae of alcohol addiction. Ms. Barnes stated that it had been a priority of decedent\u2019s to make a new will once her divorce became final, and that in the fall of 2007 decedent brought to her for her examination, and then discussed with her, what she understood to be a will that contained a provision revoking all prior wills and codicils. Nonetheless, as noted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>no will was found during a diligent postmortem search of decedent\u2019s home and possessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The Surrogate, while not skeptical of Ms. Barnes\u2019s account as to what she saw and read, and while acknowledging \u201chow the fact that the will [offered for probate] was drafted ten years prior to the decedent\u2019s divorce raises suspicion in [objectants\u2019] eyes as to whether the will truly reflects what the decedent would have wanted when she passed in 2010,\u201d nevertheless understood himself to be bound to dismiss the objections to the 1996 will and to admit it to probate. This was because Ms. Barnes had not witnessed the signing of the evidently lost 2007 will and her testimony, therefore, could not prove that the will had been duly executed. Without proof of due execution, the lost will could not, in the Surrogate\u2019s view, be given effect, even for the limited purpose of revoking the 1996 will. As to the ex-husband\u2019s testimony indicating that the 1996 will had, by design, been executed in four equally functional counterparts to be kept separately at specified locations, among them decedent\u2019s post-divorce Clayton, New York residence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Surrogate noted only that \u201c [i] t is not clear from the testimony of the witnesses if the decedent and Mr. Simmons left the attorney\u2019s office with four original instruments or one original and three copies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">A divided Appellate Division affirmed the Surrogate\u2019s decision and decree (114 AD3d 203 [2014]). This Court granted objectants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal (23 NY3d 906 [2014]), and we now modify.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Preliminarily, we note that the lower courts properly refused to give revocatory effect to the lost will described by Ms. Barnes. Estates, Powers and Trusts Law \u00a7 3-4.1 (a) (1) (B), particularly as we have construed it in <em>Matter of Coffed </em>(46 NY2d 514, 519 [1979]), commands categorically that revocation of a will by a subsequent will or other writing may be accomplished only by executing the revoking instrument \u201cwith the formalities prescribed . . . for the execution and attestation of a will.\u201d As we observed in <em>Coffed, </em>this requirement\u2019s stringency has been deemed necessary to prevent fraud and flippancy in the making and revocation of testamentary instruments generally; its prophylactic utility would be largely undone if it were dispensable in the individual, seemingly sympathetic case (see <em>id. </em>at 519).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Although objectants\u2019 claim of revocation by a subsequent writing was properly rejected, it does not follow that the 1996 will was proved. Indeed, the evidence before the Surrogate raised a most serious, and unresolved, question as to whether the 1996 will had been otherwise revoked, and while that question persisted the will should not have been admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">A will may, of course, be revoked not only by means of a writing executed in the manner of a will, but by the testator\u2019s act of destroying it with revocatory intent (EPTL 3-4.1 [a] [2] [A] [i]), which act achieves the revocatory purpose even if there remain will duplicates outstanding <em>(Crossman v </em>Crossman, 95 NY 145, 152 [1884]). That a testator has in fact revoked a will by destruction is strongly presumed where the will, although once possessed by the testator, cannot be found posthumously despite a thorough search <em>(Matter of Fox, </em>9 NY2d 400, 407-408 [1961]; <em>Matter of Staiger, </em>243 NY 468, 472 [1926]; <em>Matter of Kennedy, </em>167 NY 163, 168-169 [1901]). The presumption, once raised, \u201cstands in the place of positive proof\u201d <em>(Staiger, </em>243 NY at 472) and must be rebutted by the will\u2019s proponent as a condition of probate <em>(Matter of Fox, </em>9 NY2d at 407).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Here, the facts of record, adduced in critical part through the testimony of petitioner\u2019s son, supported inferences that decedent executed her 1996 will in quadruplicate, with each document having been meant to possess the force of an original instrument; that one of the will duplicates was kept at the Clayton, New York home where decedent resided after her divorce; and that, after a thorough search, no will was found there. Plainly, these circumstances sufficed to raise the presumption that decedent revoked her 1996 will by destroying it. It is equally plain that that presumption was not rebutted. None of the other duplicate wills was produced or otherwise accounted for. And, although petitioner now urges that the unproduced duplicates were merely copies, the uncertain status of the will duplicates, although commented upon by the Surrogate, was never resolved. We are left then with a will admitted to probate upon a record sufficient only to disprove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">It is precisely to avoid such an incongruous outcome that the governing rule of proceeding has long been that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201c[a]s soon as it is brought to the attention of the surrogate that there are duplicates of a will presented to him for probate, it is proper that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>should require [the] duplicates to be presented, not for the purpose of admitting [them] as separate instruments to probate, but that he may be assured whether the will has been revoked, and whether each completely contains the will of the testator\u201d <em>(Crossman, </em>95 NY at 152; <em>and see e.g. Matter of Robinson, </em>257 App Div 405, 407 [4th Dept 1939]; <em>Matter of Blackstone, </em>172 Misc 479, 484 [Sur Ct, NY County 1939]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Here, it is manifest that the Surrogate\u2019s attention was drawn to the existence of will duplicates, but the consequently arising issues as to the will\u2019s validity were not resolved as they should have been in accordance with <em>Crossman\u2019s </em>instruction. Petitioner was required not merely to exclude the possibility, but to rebut the legal presumption of revocation, sufficiently raised by the ex-husband\u2019s testimony as to the existence of will duplicates, one of which had been kept, but was not found after decedent\u2019s passing, at her post-divorce residence. The necessity of such a showing was in this matter highlighted by the circumstance that the 1996 will, reciprocally bequeathing all of decedent\u2019s property to her then husband, reflected a testamentary design irretrievably bound up with the testator\u2019s since terminated spousal status.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">While the record in its present state would only support a denial of probate, we recognize that the crucial issues raised by the duplicate will testimony were not framed for resolution as they should have been and that this may have operated to deprive petitioner of a fair opportunity to avoid or rebut the presumption of revocation which otherwise must control the outcome of this proceeding. We therefore remand the matter to the Surrogate so that these pivotal issues can be fully litigated and determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Accordingly, the orders of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by remitting to Surrogate\u2019s Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">. Mr. Simmons senior made no bones about the fact that he was not the real party in interest. He testified that he was \u201cnot the [pjetitioner\u201d and was \u201cjust along for the ride.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">.

After decedent\u2019s divorce, her ex-husband\u2019s father, petitioner, ceased to be her \u201crelative\u201d within the relevant definition of Texas law (see Tex Estates Code Ann \u00a7 123.001 [a]).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\">.

While I agree with my colleagues that remittal to Surrogate\u2019s Court is the appropriate result, I write separately to express my disagreement with the majority\u2019s dicta, in the hope that this added language will not be misinterpreted as a holding by this Court and lead the Surrogate to believe the issue has already been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The issue for the Surrogate to resolve on remittal is whether there were four original instruments or one original and three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>copies of the decedent\u2019s will <em>(see Roche v Nason, </em>185 NY 128 [1906]; <em>Matter of Andriola, </em>160 Misc 775 [Sur Ct, Kings County 1936]). If the Surrogate determines that there were four original instruments, he must then decide whether the presumption of revocation was triggered and whether that presumption was rebutted <em>(see Crossman v Crossman, </em>95 NY 145 [1884] [presumption]; <em>Matter of Fox, </em>9 NY2d 400 [1961] [rebuttal]).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The majority discusses the ex-husband\u2019s testimony and surmises that \u201cthe natural, albeit less than certain, import of [the ex-husband\u2019s] testimony was that each copy was intended to be a functional instrument\u201d (majority op at 460). The majority further states that \u201cex-husband\u2019s testimony indicat [es] that the 1996 will had, by design, been executed in <em>four equally functional counterparts </em>to be kept separately at specified locations\u201d (majority op at 461 [emphasis added]). In doing so, the majority, in essence, discredits the ex-husband\u2019s testimony that he and the decedent executed \u201ctwo wills, two power of attorneys and two directive to physicians,\u201d and that there was only one original of \u201ceach six documents.\u201d The quality and weight afforded to ex-husband\u2019s testimony, as well as any other testimony, is clearly in the province of Surrogate\u2019s Court. In other words, whether there were \u201cfour equally functional counterparts\u201d of the decedent\u2019s will is a question of fact that is left to be resolved by the Surrogate.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The majority then suggests, again in dicta, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201cthe facts of record, adduced in critical part through the testimony of petitioner\u2019s son, supported inferences that decedent executed her 1996 will in quadruplicate, <em>with each document having been meant to possess the force of an original instrument', </em>that one of the will duplicates was kept at the Clayton, New York home where decedent resided after her divorce; and that, after a thorough search, no will was found there [and that] <em>[pjlainly, these circumstances sufficed to raise the presumption that decedent revoked her 1996 will by destroying it. It is equally plain that that presumption was not rebutted\u201d </em>(majority op at 462 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">While the majority may claim that it is simply reading the record before it, this dicta may be viewed by some as a disguised holding. \u201cHowever grievous the errors a court commits when it writes dictum disguised as holding, those errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>would be neutralized if the next court would <em>recognize the prior dictum as nonbinding and go on to grapple with and decide the issue\u201d (see </em>Pierre N. Leval, Madison Lecture, <em>Judging under the Constitution: Dicta About Dicta, </em>81 NYU L Rev 1249, 1268-1269 [2006] [emphasis added]).
