The record here, including the plea colloquy and the other relevant facts, such as proof of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>fendant\u2019s experience and background, is sufficient to uphold defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal as voluntary, knowing and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In the course of a May 2009 gang assault of the 16-year-old victim, defendant stabbed the victim in the chest with a knife, killing him. Upon his arrest, defendant received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and, after approximately two hours of questioning, admitted to the stabbing. He was charged in an indictment with murder in the second degree, gang assault in the first degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. After defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements was denied in part, he pleaded guilty on the eve of trial to manslaughter in the first degree and gang assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">During the plea colloquy, County Court set forth the terms of the plea, and the prosecutor conducted the voir dire examination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor discussed the rights normally forfeited upon a plea of guilty, inquired as to whether defendant was pleading voluntarily because he was guilty, and reviewed potential collateral consequences of the plea with him. The prosecutor also advised defendant of the consequences he could face if he failed to voluntarily appear for sentencing or committed another crime prior thereto. Regarding the waiver of the right to appeal, the following exchange then took place between the prosecutor and defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201cQ. Do you understand that as a condition of this plea you are waiving the right to appeal your conviction and sentence to the Appellate Division Second Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">\u201cQ. Have you discussed this waiver of the right to appeal with your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u201cQ. In consideration of this negotiated pleat,] do you now voluntarily waive your right to appeal your conviction and sentence under this indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Immediately thereafter, the prosecutor asked defense counsel whether he was \u201cwithdraw [ing] all motions made by you whether pending or decided?\u201d Counsel responded, \u201cYes, withdrawn.\u201d The prosecutor conducted the factual allocution and the court accepted the plea. Defendant was thereafter sentenced, as a predicate violent felony offender, to an aggregate term of 20 years in prison, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Defendant filed a pro se notice of appeal. The Appellate Division, Second Department affirmed, concluding that defendant\u2019s valid waiver of the right to appeal barred his challenge to County Court\u2019s suppression ruling (112 AD3d 748, 748-750 [2013]). A dissenting Justice of the Appellate Division granted defendant leave to appeal (22 NY3d 1160 [2014]), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">In <em>People v Seaberg, </em>this Court recognized for the first time that a defendant may waive his or her statutory right to an initial appeal, provided that the waiver is \u201cnot only . . . voluntary but also knowing and intelligent\u201d (74 NY2d 1, 11 [1989]). We explained that a trial court must review the waiver and \u201cdetermine! ] [whether] it meets those requirements by considering all the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the waiver, including the nature and terms of the agreement and the age, experience and background of the accused\u201d <em>(id.; see People v Calvi, </em>89 NY2d 868, 871 [1996]; <em>People v Callahan, </em>80 NY2d 273, 280, 283 [1992]). The trial court must also ensure that defendant\u2019s \u201cfull appreciation of the consequences\u201d and understanding of the terms and conditions of the plea, including a waiver of the right to appeal, are apparent on the face of the record <em>(Seaberg, </em>74 NY2d at 11; <em>Callahan, </em>80 NY2d at 280). In that regard, we emphasized in <em>Seaberg </em>that the trial \u201ccourt should have required [the defendant] to state his understanding and acceptance\u201d of the details of the plea bargain on the record (74 NY2d at 11); nevertheless, we upheld the waiver in that case despite the fact that the defendant did not personally participate in the court\u2019s colloquy with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>counsel, given the other relevant facts on the record that demonstrated the defendant\u2019s understanding of the waiver (see <em>id. </em>at 11-12; see <em>also People v Moissett, </em>76 NY2d 909, 911 [1990]).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Although we have since \u201cunderscore [d] the critical nature of a court\u2019s colloquy with a defendant explaining the right relinquished by an appeal waiver\u201d <em>(People v Lopez, </em>6 NY3d 248, 253 [2006]), we have continued to require assessment of all of the relevant factors surrounding the waiver, including the experience and background of the accused <em>(see People v Bradshaw, </em>18 NY3d 257, 264-265 [2011]). Moreover, we have never abandoned our oft-stated instruction that \u201ca trial court need not engage in any particular litany when apprising a defendant pleading guilty of the individual rights abandoned\u201d <em>(Lopez, </em>6 NY3d at 256; <em>see Bradshaw, </em>18 NY3d at 265; <em>People v Kemp, </em>94 NY2d 831, 833 [1999]; <em>Callahan, </em>80 NY2d at 283). Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, this Court has not \u2014 in <em>People v Nicholson, </em>a companion case decided with <em>Lopez, </em>or in any other case \u2014 set forth the absolute minimum that must be conveyed to a pleading defendant in the plea colloquy in order for the right to appeal to be validly waived. We have long rejected that approach on the ground that \u201ca sound discretion exercised in cases on an individual basis is best rather than to mandate a uniform procedure which, like as not, would become a purely ritualistic device . . . [that] eliminate [s] thinking\u201d <em>(People v Nixon, </em>21 NY2d 338, 355 [1967]).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">in.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">With those principles in mind, we conclude that the record before us sufficiently demonstrates that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal. There is no meaningful distinction between the plea colloquy here and the colloquy upheld in <em>Nicholson, </em>in which defendant acknowledged his understanding that he was \u201cgiving up [his] right to appeal, that is, to take to a higher court than this one any of the legal issues connected with this case\u201d <em>(Nicholson, </em>6 NY3d at 254). As in <em>Nicholson, </em>the plea colloquy here was sufficient because the right to appeal was adequately described without lumping it into the panoply of rights normally forfeited upon a guilty plea. In fact, the People went even further in this case and obtained defendant\u2019s confirmation that he had discussed the waiver of the right to appeal with his attorney and that he was waiving such right in consideration of his negotiated plea, as well as counsel\u2019s confirmation that all motions pending or decided were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>being withdrawn. Thus, while the better practice would have been to define the nature of the right to appeal more fully \u2014 as the court did in <em>Nicholson </em>\u2014 the Appellate Division correctly determined that no further elaboration was necessary on the phrase \u201cright to appeal your conviction and sentence to the Appellate Division Second Department\u201d in view of the whole colloquy, particularly given this defendant\u2019s background, including his extensive experience with the criminal justice system and multiple prior guilty pleas that resulted in terms of imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Under these circumstances, defendant\u2019s valid, general waiver of the right to appeal precludes his challenge to County Court\u2019s adverse suppression ruling <em>(see Kemp, </em>94 NY2d at 833). Accordingly, the order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\">. The parties have not addressed \u2014 either in this Court or in the courts below \u2014 the fact that the prosecutor, as opposed to the trial court, conducted most of the plea allocution. Although the Appellate Division Departments are divided on the propriety of the delegation of this important function, it has been \u201clong criticized\u201d <em>(People v Robbins, </em>33 AD3d 1127, 1129 [2006]) and we are troubled by it, as well. As we noted in <em>People v Nixon </em>(21 NY2d 338, 353 [1967], <em>cert denied sub nom. Robinson v New York, </em>393 US 1067 [1969]), the conduct of the plea allocution is \u201cbest left to the discretion of the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\">. While the factors raised by the dissent \u2014 whether a defendant has previously entered a guilty plea waiving rights to appeal, signed a written appeal waiver or taken a prior appeal \u2014 certainly would be relevant to determining defendant\u2019s understanding of the terms of a waiver, this Court\u2019s review of a defendant\u2019s background, as it impacts upon the validity of an appeal waiver, has not been so confined (see <em>People v Bradshaw, </em>18 NY3d 257, 265-266 [2011]; <em>People v Seaberg, </em>74 NY2d 1, 11-12 [1989]). Here, as reflected in the transcript of the <em>Sandoval </em>hearing and the violent predicate felony conviction statement submitted to the court, defendant was 27 years old at the time of the plea and had a criminal history that stretched back 10 years. His prior convictions obtained upon guilty pleas include a 2003 violent felony in New York, as well as federal, New Jersey and Pennsylvania convictions. Defendant was also convicted of a federal felony while on parole and was on supervised release at the time of the stabbing in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b434-5\">Rivera, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyV\">(dissenting). For the reasons set forth in the dissent below, I would find defendant\u2019s waiver invalid under our prior precedent and, accordingly, I would remit the matter to the Appellate Division for consideration of the merits of his suppression claim. I write separately to briefly address the majority\u2019s treatment of two significant issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">First, the majority concludes \u201c[t]here is no meaningful distinction\u201d between the plea colloquy challenged on this appeal and the colloquy this Court found sufficient in <em>People v Nicholson (see </em>majority op at 341). However, the majority acknowledges the trial court here could have \u201cdefine [d] the nature of the right to appeal more fully \u2014 as the court did in <em>Nicholson\u201d (id. </em>at 342). Nevertheless, the majority concludes that defendant\u2019s plea colloquy, with its reference to waiver of an appeal from his \u201cconviction and sentence to the Appellate Division Second Department,\u201d is legally sufficient because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>defendant\u2019s \u201cbackground [and] extensive experience with the criminal justice system\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 342).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s suggestion that a defendant\u2019s prior criminal record alone can cure a deficient plea allocution. While defendant\u2019s age, experience and background are factors to be considered in determining whether defendant\u2019s waiver is knowing and intelligent <em>(see People v Seaberg, </em>74 NY2d 1, 11 [1989]), we have never before held that a defendant\u2019s criminal history, regardless of its length, is dispositive of the defendant\u2019s understanding of the plea. A defendant\u2019s criminal background history is but one factor and cannot fill in the gaps when the colloquy fails to properly apprise a defendant of the rights abandoned by entering a plea agreement <em>{see id. </em>[the court must determine \u201call the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the waiver\u201d]). Nor can the defendant\u2019s record absolve a court from its responsibility to ascertain that defendant understands the nature of the rights waived <em>(see People v Lopez, </em>6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]). Otherwise, taken to its logical conclusion, in cases involving a defendant with a prior record, the majority\u2019s approach would negate the need for the type of \u201cfuller colloquy\u201d this Court sanctioned in <em>Nicholson, </em>indeed the need for any colloquy. Certainly our precedent neither permits nor intends such outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">This is not to say a defendant\u2019s prior background is irrelevant; we have expressly stated otherwise <em>(see Seaberg, </em>74 NY2d at 11). However, the extent to which the defendant\u2019s criminal history is a relevant factor regarding the defendant\u2019s understanding of the specifics of the plea and the rights waived depends, for example, on whether a defendant has previously entered a plea waiving rights to appeal, signed a written waiver of such rights, and actually gone through an appellate process. That information is simply lacking in the record before us. As observed by the dissent below, the record fails to establish what defendant understands of his right to appeal based on his prior experiences <em>(see People v Sanders, </em>112 AD3d 748, 753 [2d Dept 2013, Hall, J., dissenting] [\u201cIndeed, whatever information the defendant was, or was not, provided with regard to his right to appeal in those prior criminal proceedings is not in this record. As a result, this Court is forced to speculate that the defendant gained an understanding of the nature of his right to appeal from his prior contacts with the criminal justice system\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Second, as a point of clarification, and like the majority, I too find \u201ctroubling]\u201d a trial court\u2019s delegation of the plea allocution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>to the prosecutor <em>(see </em>majority op at 339 n 1). As the majority correctly states, under this Court\u2019s precedent \u201cthe plea allocution is \u2018best left to the discretion of the court\u2019 \u201d <em>(see </em>id., citing <em>People v Nixon, </em>21 NY2d 338, 353 [1967], <em>cert denied sub nom. Robinson v New York, </em>393 US 1067 [1969]; <em>see also Lopez, </em>6 NY3d at 256 [stating a trial court \u201cmust make certain that a defendant\u2019s understanding of the terms and conditions of a plea agreement is evident on the face of the record\u201d], citing <em>People v Callahan, </em>80 NY2d 273, 280 [1992]).</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-5\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Read, Pigott, AbdusSalaam and Fahey concur; Judge Rivera dissents in an opinion.</judges>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
