The Appellate Division correctly found that Greater Jamaica Development Corporation operates pursuant to a charitable purpose, because developing an economically distressed community relieves poverty and lessens the burdens of government. <em>(Matter of Symphony Space v Tishelman, </em>60 NY2d 33; <em>Matter of Farm Sanctuary v Patton, </em>221 AD2d 67; <em>Matter of Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corp. v Rosenbaum, </em>101 AD3d 21; <em>Economic Opportunity Commn. of Nassau County v Village of Hempstead, </em>148 AD2d 570; <em>Matter of Salvation Army v Town of Ellicott Bd. of Assessment Review, </em>100 AD2d 361; <em>Matter of Adult Home at Erie Sta., Inc. v Assessor &amp; Bd. of Assessment Review of City of Middletown, </em>10 NY3d 205; <em>Mohonk Trust v Board of Assessors of Town of Gardiner, </em>47 NY2d 476; <em>Matter of North Manursing Wildlife Sanctuary [City of Rye], </em>48 NY2d 135; <em>Matter of Rockefeller, </em>177 App Div 786; <em>Matter of Association of Bar of City of N.Y. v Lewisohn, </em>34 NY2d 143.)

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Appellate Division decision in this case fails to follow decisions of this Court which distinguish determinations of taxable status under New York\u2019s Real Property Tax Law from such determinations for other tax purposes. <em>(Matter of Association of Bar of City of N.Y. v Lewisohn, </em>34 NY2d 143; <em>Matter of Swedenborg Found, v Lewisohn, </em>40 NY2d 87; <em>Yeshiva Beth Yehuda V\u2019Chaim D\u2019Betlan v Town of Shandaken, </em>100 AD2d 641; <em>Matter of Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corp. v Rosenbaum, </em>101 AD3d 21.)

The Appellate Division correctly reversed the trial court because appellants failed to satisfy their burden to show that respondents\u2019 parking facilities are subject to taxation. <em>(People ex rel.

Appellants erroneously contend that the Internal Revenue Service determination concerning respondents\u2019 status as tax exempt entities under section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) provided the basis for the Appellate Division\u2019s decision. IV. Assuming arguendo that respondents\u2019 status as tax exempt entities under section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) and a charitable corporation under the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law is properly before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>this Court, respondents should be presumptively entitled to the charitable exemption under New York State law. <em>(Stephenson v Hotel Empls. &amp; Rest.

The issue on this appeal is whether respondent New York City Tax Commission improperly revoked Jamaica First\u2019s real property tax exemption pursuant to Real Property Tax Law \u00a7 420-a (1) (a). We hold that because Jamaica First\u2019s ownership and operation of the parking facilities is not incidental to a tax-exempt purpose, it is not entitled to a real property tax exemption under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Greater Jamaica was formed in 1967 to promote commerce and business growth in downtown Jamaica. It is exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) \u00a7 501 (c) (3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, as Greater Jamaica\u2019s certificate of incorporation states, it is \u201corganized and . . . operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>exclusively for charitable, scientific and educational purposes within the meaning of [that section].\u201d Such purposes include, among other things, the promotion and coordination of Jamaica\u2019s business, commercial and retail districts; the encouragement of development of Jamaica\u2019s commercial, industrial and manufacturing facilities; and the provision of support and assistance in the planning, development and expansion of Jamaica\u2019s cultural, recreational, governmental and transportation facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Consistent with those purposes, in 1996, Greater Jamaica purchased a parking garage from the City of New York through New York City\u2019s Economic Development Corporation (EDC). Two years later, Greater Jamaica formed Jamaica First, a Delaware limited liability company, with Greater Jamaica constituting Jamaica First\u2019s sole member. Jamaica First\u2019s amended and restated limited liability company agreement states that Jamaica First was \u201cformed for the purpose of acquiring, owning, developing and operating public parking facilities on a nonprofit basis, including financing the acquisition and development of three public parking facilities in Jamaica, New York, in furtherance of the charitable purposes of the Member.\u201d Jamaica First\u2019s certificate of formation provides that it \u201cshall carry on any lawful purpose or activity not inconsistent with\u201d Greater Jamaica\u2019s tax-exempt status under Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) \u00a7 501 (c) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In 2001, Jamaica First purchased three parking facilities from the City of New York through the EDC; said facilities had previously been operated by the New York City Department of Transportation. Greater Jamaica expended monies to renovate and upgrade the facilities. That same year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued Greater Jamaica a private letter ruling explaining that the separate legal existence of Jamaica First would be disregarded for federal income tax purposes, such that the acquisition, financing, renovation, operation and use of the parking facilities by Jamaica First would be treated for federal income tax purposes as the acquisition, financing, renovation, operation and use of the parking facilities by Greater Jamaica. Moreover, according to the letter ruling, Jamaica First\u2019s operation of the parking facilities would be substantially related to Greater Jamaica\u2019s charitable exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>purposes under Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) \u00a7 501 (c) (3) and would lessen the burdens of government within the meaning of 26 CFR 1.501(c)(3)-1 (d) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">In 2004, Greater Jamaica conveyed the parking garage it purchased in 1996 to Jamaica First. Jamaica First thereafter purchased vacant land from the City and finished construction of a 410-car parking garage on that property in 2006. According to Greater Jamaica and Jamaica First, all five parking facilities provide below-market, reasonably-priced parking for local retail stores, state and federal office buildings and religious organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In 2007, respondent New York City Department of Finance (DOF) granted real property tax exemptions for the five parking facilities pursuant to RPTL 420-a (1) (a). Four years later, the DOF revoked the exemptions, stating that the properties\u2019 uses as parking facilities did not fall into any of the enumerated uses of section 420-a and asserting that the status that the IRS bestowed upon Greater Jamaica was \u201cnot determinative of the issue of charitable use of the property as defined by 420-a.\u201d The DOF determined that the use of the parking facilities, even for economic development of an underdeveloped area, did not constitute a \u201ccharitable\u201d use, and that the parking facilities were \u201cnot incidental to another recognized charitable purpose but [were] the very purpose for which the property [was] being used.\u201d According to the DOF, although the parking facilities served an important public purpose like community development, that purpose by itself did not qualify the properties for a charitable exemption under section 420-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Greater Jamaica and Jamaica First (collectively, petitioners) commenced this hybrid proceeding pursuant to RPTL article 7 and CPLR article 78 against the DOF and the New York City Tax Commission (collectively, City) requesting a judgment declaring that the City\u2019s decision to revoke the exemptions was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law and that Jamaica First was entitled to the exemptions. Petitioners also sought a judgment directing the City to grant the tax exemptions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The City cross-moved for an order dismissing that part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>petition seeking relief pursuant to CPLR article 78, relying on its 2011 revocation letter along with the statements in the amended verified petition and Jamaica First\u2019s amended limited liability agreement that Jamaica First was \u201cformed for the purpose of acquiring, owning, developing and operating public parking facilities on a nonprofit basis\u201d as part of Greater Jamaica\u2019s charitable purpose of promoting commerce and business growth in Jamaica. The City argued that the parking facilities were not entitled to a section 420-a exemption because they were neither owned nor operated exclusively for a charitable purpose. Supreme Court upheld the City\u2019s revocation of the tax exemption and granted its cross motion to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The Appellate Division reversed the order and judgment insofar as appealed from by petitioners, granted the parking facilities the tax exemption, annulled the City\u2019s determination and denied the City\u2019s cross motion (111 AD3d 937, 937 [2d Dept 2013]). It held that the City failed to meet its burden of establishing \u201crevocation of the tax exemption on the grounds that the petitioners\u2019 activity did not conform to a charitable purpose within the meaning of RPTL 420-a\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 939). The Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">\u201c[a]bsent a precise statutory definition of \u2018charitable purpose,\u2019 courts have interpreted this category to include relief of poverty, advancement of governmental and municipal purposes, and other objectives that are beneficial to the community. Furthermore, a property owner seeking a real property tax exemption which demonstrates that it is a not-for-profit entity whose tax-exempt status has been recognized by the [IRS] and whose property is used solely for charitable purposes has made a presumptive showing of entitlement to exemption\u201d <em>(id. </em>[some internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The Appellate Division pointed to petitioners\u2019 submission of the IRS\u2019s letter ruling recognizing them as charitable organizations, and also to Greater Jamaica\u2019s certificate of incorporation \u2014 which stated that Greater Jamaica was to be operated for charitable purposes \u2014 as proof that it was operated for a charitable purpose <em>(see id.). </em>As to Jamaica First, the Court observed that Jamaica First\u2019s certificate of formation explained that it was created to carry out Greater Jamaica\u2019s \u201ccharitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>purposes by acquiring and operating public parking facilities on a nonprofit basis,\u201d such that both organizations had established that they were formed for a charitable purpose pursuant to RPTL 420-a <em>{id. </em>at 939-940). Finally, according to the Appellate Division, \u201cpetitioners demonstrated that the use of their public parking facilities was consistent with their exempt purpose, as expressly noted by the IRS in granting such operation tax exempt status,\u201d because their \u201ccharitable purpose was to improve Jamaica\u2019s business district through further economic development, [and] offering convenient and inexpensive public parking to attract visitors and businesses was central to their aim\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 940).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">We granted the City leave to appeal (23 NY3d 908 [2014]) and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">IIL</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">RPTL 420-a (1) (a) provides that real property owned by a corporation or association that is \u201corganized or conducted exclusively for . . . charitable . . . purposes,\u201d if used \u201cexclusively\u201d for such purposes, will be exempt from taxation. We have held that \u201c[t]he term \u2018exclusively\u2019, in this context, has been broadly defined to connote \u2018principal\u2019 or \u2018primary\u2019 such that purposes and uses merely \u2018auxiliary or incidental to the main and exempt purpose and use will not defeat the exemption\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Yeshivath Shearith Hapletah v Assessor of Town of Fallsburg, </em>79 NY2d 244, 249 [1992], quoting <em>Matter of Association of Bar of City of N.Y. v Lewisohn, </em>34 NY2d 143, 153 [1974]). Thus, whether property is used \u201cexclusively\u201d for purposes of section 420-a is dependent upon whether the \u201cprimary use\u201d of the property is in furtherance of permitted purposes <em>(Matter of Yeshivath Shearith Hapletah, </em>79 NY2d at 250).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Here, the City revoked the parking facilities\u2019 section 420-a tax exemption after having previously allowed the exemption in 2007. Although the burden of proof generally lies with the party seeking the exemption, in a situation like this, where the taxing authority seeks to revoke that exemption previously granted, it is the taxing authority that has the burden of establishing that the property is not exempt from taxation <em>(see Matter of Lackawanna Community Dev. Corp. v Krakowski, </em>12 NY3d 578, 581 [2009], citing <em>Matter of New York Botanical Garden v Assessors of Town of Washington, </em>55 NY2d 328, 334 [1982]). In order to meet that burden, the City was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>demonstrate either that petitioners were not \u201corganized or conducted exclusively for\u201d exempt purposes <em>or </em>that the parking facilities were not \u201cused exclusively for carrying out thereupon one or more\u201d exempt purposes (RPTL 420-a [1] [a]; <em>see Congregation Rabbinical Coll. of Tartikov, Inc. v Town of Ramapo, </em>17 NY3d 763, 764 [2011] [holding that municipality failed to establish that the primary use of the property was not in furtherance of a tax-exempt purpose]).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The City revoked the tax exemption on the ground that it was erroneously awarded in the first instance. It met its burden in this regard by demonstrating that the \u201cuse\u201d of the parking facilities was not for \u201ccharitable\u201d purposes but rather for economic development, and that the use of the parking facilities was not \u201cincidental to another recognized charitable purpose.\u201d Specifically, the City\u2019s revocation letter explained that the City reached its determination after reviewing documents submitted to it by Greater Jamaica and case law from this Court. The City also explained why it believed that the status granted Greater Jamaica by the IRS had no bearing on the issue of \u201ccharitable use\u201d of the parking facilities under section 420-a. The letter stated that although the parking facilities may have served \u201can important public purpose and support [ed] development of a community,\u201d those factors did not qualify the facilities for a charitable exemption. Indeed, according to the City\u2019s review of the ownership structure of the lots along with other documentation, it appeared that Jamaica First collected monies that exceeded the carrying, maintenance and depreciation charges attributable to the premises and that Jamaica First utilized those excess proceeds to fund other additional operations, such as the purchase of an additional parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The City submitted additional proof in the form of an affirmation by the City\u2019s Assistant Corporation Counsel, which pointed out that the factual allegations in the petition established that the facilities were not entitled to the exemption because Jamaica First was established for the sole purposes of acquiring, owning, developing and operating public parking facilities to promote Greater Jamaica\u2019s primary purpose of promoting commerce and business growth in Jamaica. Thus, the grounds in the City\u2019s revocation letter, which were plainly sufficient on their own but nonetheless elucidated by the affirmation of the City\u2019s Assistant Corporation Counsel detailing how the allegations in the petition established that the parking facilities were not being operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>for a charitable purpose, were sufficient to meet the City\u2019s initial burden of establishing that petitioners were not entitled to the tax exemption, i.e., that the use of the property was not in furtherance of a tax-exempt purpose, thereby shifting the burden to petitioners to establish their entitlement to an exemption. We hold that petitioners did not meet their burden in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Although our inquiry as to whether petitioners established that the parking facilities are entitled to a tax exemption would ordinarily begin with an analysis of whether petitioners were \u201corganized or conducted exclusively for\u201d a tax-exempt purpose (RPTL 420-a [1] [a]), we assume for purposes of this appeal that they were.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, we must nonetheless clarify that the Appellate Division erred to the extent that it held that petitioners made a <em>presumptive </em>showing of their entitlement to a real property tax exemption under section 420-a by establishing that their tax-exempt status as a \u201ccharitable organization\u201d had been recognized by the IRS (111 AD3d at 939, citing <em>Matter of Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corp. v Rosenbaum, </em>101 AD3d 21, 23 [3d Dept 2012], quoting <em>Yeshiva Beth Yehuda V\u2019Chaim D\u2019Betlan v Town of Shandaken, </em>100 AD2d 641, 642 [3d Dept 1984]). <em>Yeshiva Beth </em>involved an attempt by a school district to vacate a default judgment against it that had been obtained by a religious corporation (100 AD2d at 642). The Court held that the school district was unable to refute the religious corporation\u2019s \u201cpresumptive showing\u201d of entitlement to an exemption through its averment that it was a religious corporation whose tax-exempt status had been recognized by the IRS and that the property was used for a religious purpose <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In <em>Yeshiva Beth, </em>not only was the procedural posture different from the one presented here, it also involved a religious organization. Such organizations are recognized by both Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) \u00a7 501 (c) (3) and RPTL 420-a (1) (a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Indeed, a closer look at both provisions indicates that there is some overlap between the two in the criteria that the relevant taxing authorities will consider in determining whether a corporation is either exempt from federal income taxation under Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) \u00a7 501 (c) (3) or entitled to an exemption under RPTL 420-a (1) (a) <em>(see </em>Internal Revenue Code [26 USC] \u00a7 501 [c] [3] [organizations that are \u201corganized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific ... or educational purposes\u201d entitled to federal income tax exemption]; RPTL 420-a [1] [a] [real property entitled to tax exemption if \u201cowned by a corporation or association organized or conducted exclusively for religious (or) charitable . . . purposes\u201d]). However, there are significant distinctions between the two provisions that prohibit the application of the type of presumption that the Appellate Division utilized in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">First, as already noted, Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) \u00a7 501 (c) (3) exempts certain organizations from <em>federal income taxation. </em>Section 420-a exempts certain organizations from <em>real property taxation. </em>Our local governments derive significant revenue from the imposition of real property taxes, and federal income taxation standards cannot be utilized to create a presumption in favor of a property owner seeking an exemption from a state real property tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Second, Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) \u00a7 501 (c) (3) and section 420-a utilize different tests in determining whether a given organization is entitled to a tax exemption under the relevant statute. Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) \u00a7 501 (c) (3) utilizes a two-pronged \u201corganizational\u201d and \u201coperational\u201d test, meaning that the organization must be \u201corganized exclusively for one or more exempt purposes\u201d delineated in that section (26 CFR 1.501[c][3]-l [b] [1] [i]) <em>and </em>it must be \u201coperated exclusively for one or more exempt purposes\u201d (26 CFR 1.501[c][3]-l [c] [1]). This requires an analysis of the organization and its operation as a whole. In contrast, section 420-a (1) (a) considers whether the real property is <em>owned </em>by a corporation or organization that is \u201corganized or conducted exclusively\u201d for one of the exempt purposes and whether the property is <em>\u201cused exclusively </em>for carrying out thereupon one or more of such purposes\u201d (emphasis supplied), meaning that the critical analysis for real property tax exemption purposes requires an analysis of the ownership and use of the property by the organization seeking the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>And, finally, the Internal Revenue Code contains a broad definition of what constitutes a \u201ccharitable\u201d purpose. Specifically, the term \u201ccharitable\u201d as used by Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) \u00a7 501 (c) (3) is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">\u201c[r]elief of the poor and distressed or of the underprivileged; advancement of religion; advancement of education or science; erection or maintenance of public buildings, monuments, or works; lessening of the burdens of [g]overnment; and promotion of social welfare by organizations designed to accomplish any of the above purposes, or (i) to lessen neighborhood tensions; (ii) to eliminate prejudice and discrimination; (iii) to defend human and civil rights secured by law; or (iv) to combat community deterioration and juvenile delinquency\u201d (26 CFR 1.501[c][3]-l [d] [2]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In contrast, section 420-a does not contain a definition of what constitutes a \u201ccharitable\u201d purpose, although, if the legislature intended for such an expansive definition of charitable purpose to apply, it could have easily referenced the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s definition in section 420-a or adopted it outright.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\"> That being said, although an entity\u2019s section 501 (c) (3) status does not entitle it to a presumption that it is \u201corganized or conducted exclusively for\u201d a tax-exempt purpose under RPTL 420-a (1) (a), that does not mean that courts considering an owner\u2019s entitlement to an exemption under that statute are prohibited from considering the entity\u2019s section 501 (c) (3) status as part of their overall analysis. Rather, we hold that evidence of an organization\u2019s section 501 (c) (3) status, by itself, does not create a presumption that the entity is entitled to a tax exemption under section 420-a. This is evident from our prior holdings, where we have specifically stated that, for purposes of determining a real property tax exemption, a \u201cfavorable determination [ ] from the United States Department of the Treasury as to [an entity\u2019s] exempt status for other tax purposes\u201d is not dispositive <em>(see Matter of Swedenborg Found, v Lewisohn, </em>40 NY2d 87, 95 [1976] [holding that nonprofit corporation that distributed writings of theologian that were sold at or below cost or distributed at no cost was not entitled to real property tax exemption because its purpose was neither primarily religious nor charitable]; <em>Matter of Association of Bar of City of N.Y., </em>34 NY2d at 154 [finding unpersuasive decisions acknowledging the \u201ccharitable\u201d character of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>bar associations]). Therefore, to the extent lower court cases have held that such a presumption exists <em>(see e.g. Oorah, Inc. v Town of Jefferson, </em>119 AD3d 1179, 1181 [3d Dept 2014]; <em>Matter of Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corp., </em>101 AD3d at 23), they should no longer be followed for that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Although we do not disturb the Appellate Division\u2019s holding that petitioners met the \u201corganized or conducted exclusively for . . . charitable . . . purposes\u201d prong of the tax exemption test, we part company with the Appellate Division relative to its holding that \u201cpetitioners demonstrated that the <em>use </em>of their public parking facilities was consistent with their <em>exempt </em>purpose, <em>as expressly noted by the IRS in granting such operation tax exempt </em>status\u201d (111 AD3d at 940 [emphasis supplied]). By so holding, the Appellate Division utilized the petitioners\u2019 organizational status under Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) \u00a7 501 (c) (3) to support its holding that petitioners demonstrated that the <em>use </em>of the parking facilities was for an exempt purpose. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">As explained above, the IRS\u2019s definition of what constitutes an exempt \u201ccharitable\u201d purpose is exceedingly broad, including, among other things, \u201c[the] lessening of the burdens of [g]overnment\u201d (26 CFR 1.501[c][3]-l [d] [2]), while the second prong of section 420-a (1) (a) requires a court to review \u201cthe actual or physical use of the property . . . when it exempts from taxation property \u2018used exclusively for carrying out thereupon one or more\u2019 exempt purposes\u201d <em>(Matter of Lackawanna Community Dev. Corp., </em>12 NY3d at 581 [emphasis omitted], quoting RPTL 420-a [1] [a]). Thus, our analysis under section 420-a is concerned with the \u201cuse\u201d of the parking facilities as a whole, and whether the facilities are \u201cused exclusively for carrying out thereupon one or more of [section 420-a\u2019s] purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Petitioners argue that the facilities provide \u201cbelow-market, reasonably-priced parking\u201d for residents, workers and visitors to downtown Jamaica\u2019s retail stores and government offices. They claim that the revocation of tax-exempt status will result in the loss of business and visitors to malls and shopping areas with more affordable (or free) parking. While Greater Jamaica\u2019s overall goal to create and maintain a viable downtown Jamaica is commendable, as are the means in facilitating that goal, i.e., through the operation of parking facilities that enable visitors to frequent local businesses, that does not mean that the facilitation of parking for such purposes constitutes a charitable use of the property under section 420-a (1) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>We disagree with petitioners\u2019 assertion that the parking facilities are charitable in and of themselves because they fulfill the primary purpose of economic development. The economic benefit conveyed by below-market rate parking, however, inures to the benefit of private enterprise and cannot be said to further any charitable purpose. It lessens the burden of local businesses, obviating any need for them to make their own parking arrangements for prospective customers. The below-market rates that the facilities charge provide an incentive for the public to patronize those businesses, providing a dual benefit for local businesses and a benefit to prospective customers of those businesses. While these goals may be laudable, they are not charitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The petitioners further claim that the parking facilities lessen the burden on local government, which, incidentally, is deemed a \u201ccharitable\u201d purpose under the Internal Revenue Code <em>(see </em>26 CFR 1.501[c][3]-l [d] [2]). They claim that the creation of the parking facilities relieved Jamaica of the burden of operating public parking lots. Essentially, petitioners\u2019 argument is that the parking facilities provide a public benefit. But, as we have held on more than one occasion, \u201cpublic benefit is not the test of qualification for exemption\u201d <em>(Matter of Association of Bar of City of N.Y., </em>34 NY2d at 154-155; <em>see Matter of Swedenborg Found., </em>40 NY2d at 95).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">To be sure, we have observed that \u201c[f]or property to be entitled to an exemption on the ground that it is being used for a charitable purpose, it must <em>a fortiori </em>be used for a public purpose,\u201d explaining, for example, that \u201cone may not establish a trust solely for the benefit of oneself and one\u2019s family, and then obtain a tax exemption for property owned by such a trust by claiming that it is a charitable organization\u201d <em>(Matter of North Manursing Wildlife Sanctuary [City of Rye], </em>48 NY2d 135, 140 [1979] [emphasis supplied]). We explained in <em>Matter of North Manursing </em>that exemptions are provided for those charitable uses that benefit the public and \u201cnot for so-called \u2018charities\u2019 which benefit only their creators\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Our utilization of the term \u201cpublic purpose\u201d and indirect reference to \u201cpublic benefit\u201d acknowledges that while consideration of the benefit bestowed upon the public is but one factor that the courts may consider in determining whether the property is \u201cused exclusively\u201d for one of the enumerated tax-exempt purposes, it is the \u201cused exclusively\u201d test, and not the alleged \u201cpublic benefit\u201d test, that is the relevant inquiry. The parking facilities may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>very well provide a \u201cpublic benefit,\u201d but the overall use to which these facilities are put, i.e., to further economic development and lessen the burdens of government, cannot be deemed \u201ccharitable\u201d within the meaning of section 420-a (1) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Nor can it be said that the operation of the parking facilities is \u201cincidental\u201d to a charitable purpose in the vein of similar uses that we, and other courts, have upheld as tax-exempt <em>(see Matter of Merry-Go-Round Playhouse, Inc. v Assessor of City of Auburn, </em>24 NY3d 362, 368 [2014] [use of apartment buildings to provide housing for summer stock actors was incidental to theater organization\u2019s primary purpose of encouraging art appreciation through theater]; <em>Matter of Adult Home at Erie Sta., Inc. v Assessor &amp; Bd. of Assessment Review of City of Middle-town, </em>10 NY3d 205, 216 [2008] [use of residences by participants in a community reentry program was incidental to the property owner\u2019s \u201ccharitable purpose\u201d of combating homelessness and drug abuse among low-income people]; <em>Matter of St. Luke\u2019s Hosp. v Boyland, </em>12 NY2d 135, 143 [1962] [partial tax exemption granted to portions of 10 apartment buildings owned by hospital because use of the apartments, which were occupied by its staff and their families, was \u201creasonably incident\u201d to the hospital\u2019s primary purpose]; <em>see also Matter of Vassar Bros. Hosp. v City of Poughkeepsie, </em>97 AD3d 756, 759 [2d Dept 2012] [parking garage parcel only partially exempt where a substantial portion of said garage was \u201callocated for a use not reasonably incidental to the purpose of the hospital,\u201d i.e., a medical office adjacent to the garage]; <em>Matter of St. Francis Hosp. v Taber, </em>76 AD3d 635, 640 [2d Dept 2010] [partial exemption granted for parking garage adjacent to nonprofit hospital that was utilized by hospital\u2019s visitors, patients and staff, since such use was \u201cnecessarily incidental\u201d to the hospital\u2019s exempt purpose]; <em>Matter of Ellis Hosp. v Assessor of City of Schenectady, </em>288 AD2d 581, 583 [3d Dept 2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In <em>Vassar Bros., St. Francis Hosp. </em>and <em>Ellis Hosp., </em>the courts held that the nonprofit hospitals\u2019 parking spaces that were set aside for employees and patients of <em>private </em>medical clinics were not entitled to a tax exemption because such uses were not \u201cincidental\u201d to the nonprofit hospitals\u2019 primary purposes. The same can be said for the uses of parking facilities in this instance. They are commercial lots that exist to promote economic development in downtown Jamaica, providing easy access to local retail stores and government buildings. While there may be a tenuous connection between the monies raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>from the parking facilities and other charitable purposes engaged in by Greater Jamaica \u2014 indeed, petitioners acknowledge that Jamaica First \u201chas contributed excess revenues to assist [Greater Jamaica] in meeting its operating expenses\u201d\u2014 the <em>uses </em>of these facilities are not <em>incidental </em>to Greater Jamaica\u2019s charitable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Petitioners acknowledge that any monies in excess of the operating costs of the parking lots are utilized by Greater Jamaica in furtherance of charitable uses. But that does not detract from the fact that the parking lots\u2019 primary use is to generate profits for distribution to Greater Jamaica<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(see e.g. Matter of Stuyvesant Sq.

Inasmuch as the parking facilities themselves are not incidental to a charitable purpose, they are not entitled to a section 420-a (1) (a) tax exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to that Court for consideration of issues that were raised but not determined on the appeal to that Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-9\">.

Petitioner Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, formed in 1967 under New York\u2019s former Membership Corporation Law, is organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific and educational purposes within the meaning of section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Code (26 USC) with a broad remit to improve economic and living conditions in Jamaica, Queens,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an aging urban area that had fallen on especially hard times. From the outset of Greater Jamaica\u2019s efforts on behalf of the Jamaica community, it was apparent that the shortage of downtown parking hampered economic revitalization. Accordingly, in 1976 Greater Jamaica applied to the United States Economic Development Administration on behalf of the City of New York (the City) for a grant to construct a new municipal garage. The application was approved, resulting in a $3.4 million grant to the City, which completed construction of a 530-car garage in 1978. The New York City Department of Transportation initially operated this public parking facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Over time the garage sunk into a state of disrepair and, consequently, disuse. In 1996, Greater Jamaica purchased it from the City through the New York City Economic Development Corporation (EDC). Two years later, Greater Jamaica formed Jamaica First Parking, LLC as a special-purpose nonprofit entity with the sole purpose of owning and operating parking facilities exclusively \u201cin furtherance of the charitable purposes of the Member [i.e., Greater Jamaica].\u201d In 2001, Jamaica First purchased three additional run-down parking facilities from the City. Then in 2004, Jamaica First bought vacant land from the City and constructed a 410-car public parking garage with a $5 million grant from the City through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the EDC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Greater Jamaica matched the grant with $6 million in debt from the proceeds of tax-exempt facility revenue bonds issued by the New York City Industrial Development Agency. This garage was completed in 2006. Greater Jamaica alleges that these \u201cparking facilities, operated efficiently and at below-market prices, are integral to [its] mission of creating and maintaining a viable downtown Jamaica.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">In 2007, the New York City Department of Finance (DOF or the agency) granted Greater Jamaica a full exemption from real property taxes for the five parking facilities (three garages and two lots) <em>(see </em>RPTL 420-a [1] [a], discussed <em>infra). </em>DOF continued to grant the exemption for ensuing tax years until 2011. Then, although the tentative assessment roll for the 2011-2012 tax year, dated January 5, 2011, still listed the full exemption as applicable, DOF suddenly executed an about-face. In a letter dated February 23, 2011, DOF, by its General Counsel, notified Greater Jamaica of its intention to revoke the exemption, beginning with the 2011-2012 tax year. By notice dated February 24, DOF formalized the revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Greater Jamaica, and amici curiae the Lawyers Alliance for New York, the Queens Chamber of Commerce and the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York, Inc., assert that the decision to revoke Greater Jamaica\u2019s real property tax exemption was transparently \u201cpolitical,\u201d pointing to an opinion column in a New York City tabloid, with a dateline of December 3, 2010 (Juan Gonzalez, <em>Queens Garage Company Gets Unusual Tax Exemption for 2,000-Space Parking System, </em>NY Daily News, Dec. 3, 2010, http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ queens-garage-company-unusual-tax-exemption-2-000-space-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>parking-system-article-1.469283). The column\u2019s author lambasted the City for \u00a3\u00a3dol[ing] out charitable tax exemptions to parking garages\u201d while reportedly \u00a3\u00a3tak[ing] [them] away from churches\u201d; intimated that the exemption was granted only because of Greater Jamaica\u2019s allegedly close ties to \u201cseveral major Queens political figures\u201d; and stated that DOF\u2019s spokesman had assured the author that \u201cofficials are taking another look at the arrangement\u201d by \u201creviewing this issue to determine whether these properties are eligible for a charitable property tax exemption.\u201d Whatever prompted DOF\u2019s review and subsequent revocation of Greater Jamaica\u2019s section 420-a (1) (a) exemption, the agency has not justified its determination that as of 2011 the five parcels no longer qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Relevant Law</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Pursuant to Real Property Tax Law \u00a7 420-a (1) (a), real property is mandatorily exempt from taxation if it satisfies two criteria.

Corp. v Krakowski, </em>12 NY3d 578, 581 [2009] [emphasis added], quoting <em>Matter of New York Botanical Garden v Assessors of Town of Washington, 55 </em>NY2d 328, 334 [1982]).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Showing Necessary to Justify Revocation</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">In 1971, the legislature amended former section 420 (1) of the Real Property Tax Law, which mandated tax exemptions for real property owned by a host of nonprofit organizations, to carve out and place in paragraph (a) (present-day section 420-a [1] [a]) those nonprofits whose real property remained mandatorily exempt; and to create a new paragraph (b) (present-day section 420-b [1] [a]) to specify other categories of nonprofits whose real property municipalities were newly empowered to tax pursuant to duly enacted local legislation <em>(see </em>L 1971, ch 414). Although the categories specified in former section 420 (1) (b) are not exactly the same as those in its present-day counterpart, the statute\u2019s general scheme to qualify for a permissive exemption remains both the same as when first enacted in 1971, and effectively identical to that established by Real Property Tax Law \u00a7 420-a (1) (a) to qualify for a mandatory exemption: first, the property must have been owned by a nonprofit corporation or association organized or conducted exclusively for one or more specified purposes (e.g., bible, tract, benevolent, missionary, infirmary, public playground, scientific, literary, bar association, medical society, library, etc.); second, the property must have been used exclusively for carrying out one or more of the enumerated purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Many localities adopted local legislation permitting them to terminate the previously mandatory tax exemptions enjoyed by certain nonprofit organizations in their communities. The litigation that ensued generally called upon the courts to decide whether such a locality had, in fact, properly reclassified a particular nonprofit as qualified only for a permissive exemption. One of our first major cases addressing this aspect of the 1971 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>legislation involved an arboretum owned by the New York Botanical Garden and located in the Town of Washington in Dutchess County.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">After the Botanical Garden acquired the arboretum in 1973, the Town treated the property as exempt from real property taxation. In 1977, however, the Town adopted a local law to exercise its power under the Real Property Tax Law to tax property owned by a nonprofit organization and used for scientific purposes. Acting under this local legislation, the Town restored the arboretum property to the tax rolls on the ground that the Botanical Garden\u2019s primary purpose and the arboretum\u2019s primary use were scientific and research-oriented. The Botanical Garden commenced a CPLR article 78 proceeding to have the arboretum property declared tax-exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In order to resolve the case on the merits, we were first required to determine whether the Botanical Garden or the Town had the burden of proof, and what that burden entailed. We initially observed that while the taxpayer seeking a real property exemption ordinarily bears the burden of proof,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\u201cunder the circumstances presented here, in which the municipality, pursuant to its power under [the Real Property Tax Law], is seeking to withdraw a previously granted tax exemption, <em>the municipality bears the burden of proving that the real property is subject to taxation. </em>Thus, <em>the taxing authority must prove </em>that the corporation or association is organized for a purpose only qualifiedly exempt (in this case, a scientific purpose) <em>and </em>that the property is used for such a purpose\u201d <em>(New York Botanical Garden, </em>55 NY2d at 334-335 [emphases added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Proceeding to the merits, we examined the Botanical Garden\u2019s charter, and held that \u201c[g]iven the wide range of purposes for which [the Botanical Garden] is organized, we cannot say that the town has sustained its burden of proving that a scientific purpose predominates, notwithstanding [the Botanical Garden\u2019s] own declarations of its scientific, among other, purposes\u201d (id. at 335). In deciding whether the Botanical Garden was a qualifiedly exempt scientific or a mandatorily exempt charitable entity, we also considered it relevant that \u201cthe will provision under which the arboretum property was deeded to [the Botanical Garden] permits such a grant only to \u2018a charitable organization\u2019 \u201d (id. at 335 n).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Next, we determined that the Town had not shown that the arboretum property was primarily used for a purpose that was only qualifiedly exempt (i.e., a scientific purpose). We observed that \u201cthe use to which this particular parcel [was] put accomplished] several [absolutely] exempt purposes, including educational, charitable and moral improvement purposes\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 336). Finally, we rejected the Town\u2019s argument that restrictions on public access to the arboretum\u2019s lands \u201cdeprive [d] them of a public purpose\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 337).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Importantly, Town taxing authorities did not just wake up one day and decide to reevaluate Botanical Garden\u2019s tax-exempt status. Rather, something objective \u2014 a change of law (i.e., chapter 414 of the Laws of 1971 and the local law adopted pursuant thereto) \u2014 prompted the reevaluation. Further, the nature of the change in law was such that we were required to decide whether the Town had properly determined that the nonprofit\u2019s purpose and use qualified only for a permissive exemption, or stated another way, no longer qualified for a mandatory exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Although <em>Botanical Garden </em>arose in a particular context\u2014 the 1971 amendments to the Real Property Tax Law \u2014 we cited it in <em>Lackawanna </em>for the general proposition that a municipality (there, the City of Lackawanna) bore the burden of proof to justify revocation of a nonprofit\u2019s real property tax exemption. We did not articulate any particular test for the courts to apply when deciding that a revocation was not arbitrary; more to the point, we assuredly did <em>not </em>say that once a municipality makes colorable allegations that a nonprofit\u2019s use of real property fails to further an exempt purpose, then the burden shifts <em>back </em>to the nonprofit to establish its entitlement to an exemption <em>(cf. </em>majority op at 624-625). We simply stated conclusorily that \u201c[t]he Lackawanna tax assessor [had] satisfied his burden\u201d (Lackawanna, 12 NY3d at 581). This was an easy conclusion to reach on the record in <em>Lackawanna, </em>though, because the assessor justified his decision on an independent and objective basis \u2014 i.e., the New York State Office of Real Property Services (ORPS) Exemption Administration Manual, which clearly indicated that the property was taxable. Indeed, ORPS issued an advisory letter to that effect to an attorney for the City of Lackawanna. And notably, there was a change in use after the exemption was originally granted: the nonprofit acquired the properties between 1981 and 1985, and did not lease to a for-profit corporation until 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Here, the City has not satisfied its burden of proof. First, it has not shown that Greater Jamaica fails to fulfill section 420-a (1) (a)\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d or \u201corganized or conducted\u201d criterion, unless the majority is willing to go so far as to declare that economic and community development are not \u201ccharitable, educational, or mental or moral improvement\u201d purposes within the meaning of Real Property Tax Law \u00a7 420-a (1) (a). We have never so held<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and neither has the Appellate Division <em>(see Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corp., </em>101 AD3d at 24-25). Indeed, the majority acknowledges that \u201cthere is evidence in the record\u201d that both Greater Jamaica and Jamaica First were \u201corganized or conducted exclusively for\u201d a tax-exempt purpose (majority op at 625 and 629 n 3; <em>see also </em>631-632, 632 n 1, 632, 633 n 2, <em>supra). </em>As the majority also acknowledges, a nonprofit organization\u2019s section 501 (c) (3) status bears on the overall analysis of whether it is \u201corganized or conducted exclusively for\u201d a tax-exempt purpose within the meaning of section 420-a (1) (a). Accordingly, I now turn to the City\u2019s newly-minted opinion that the parking facilities are not used for Greater Jamaica\u2019s exempt purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">The City\u2019s Rationale for Revocation</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">It has long been the rule that \u201c[j]udicial review of an administrative determination is limited to the grounds invoked by the agency\u201d <em>(Matter of Rizzo v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>6 NY3d 104, 110 [2005] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see also Matter of New York State Ch., Inc., Associated Gen. Contrs. of Am. v New York State Thruway Auth., </em>88 NY2d 56, 75 [1996] [declining to adopt an agency\u2019s \u201c(p)ost hoc rationalization\u201d (emphasis omitted)]). Thus, the majority improperly considers proof offered by the City in response to the petition in this case <em>(see </em>majority op at 624-625, discussing an affirmation of a City attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Concomitantly out-of-bounds is the City\u2019s explanation, first advanced on appeal, that its decision to grant Greater Jamaica the tax exemption for tax years 2007-2008 through 2010-2011 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>was simply a \u201cmistake,\u201d or \u201cerroneously awarded in the first instance\u201d <em>(see id. </em>at 624). In any event, the City\u2019s bare assertion of mistake is insufficient to satisfy its burden of proof. As the Appellate Division observed, a municipality may meet its burden to establish that a nonprofit\u2019s real property is subject to taxation \u201cby proving, for example, a change in the law, a change in the use of the property, or that the tax exemption was erroneously awarded in the first instance\u201d (111 AD3d 937, 939 [2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">But there must be some objective indication that a revocation on the \u201cerroneously awarded\u201d basis was prompted by something other than a mere change of heart; that is, a prior decision does not become a \u201cmistake\u201d or \u201cerroneous\u201d any time a municipality decides to interpret existing authorities in a different way. Otherwise, the burden of proof has not, in reality, shifted from the nonprofit to the municipality when an exemption is withdrawn. The nonprofit still effectively bears the burden of showing entitlement and, importantly, enjoys no protection from being sandbagged by capricious and unpredictable administrative decisionmaking, which is what Greater Jamaica claims occurred here. Thus, the cases where the Appellate Division referred to exemptions that had been \u201cerroneously awarded\u201d all dealt with an exemption granted despite a particular clear precedent to the contrary; namely, exemptions that contradicted \u201cwell settled\u201d law that \u201c \u2018real property . . . being used as a retirement community for \u201cmiddle-income\u201d elderly does not qualify for a tax exemption under [RPTL] 420-a\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Quail Summit, Inc. v Town of Canandaigua, 55 </em>AD3d 1295, 1296 [4th Dept 2008], quoting <em>Matter of Greer Woodycrest Children\u2019s Servs. v Fountain, </em>74 NY2d 749, 751 [1989], and <em>citing Matter of Presbyterian Residence Ctr. Corp. v Wagner, </em>66 AD2d 998, 999 [1978], <em>affd for reasons stated </em>48 NY2d 885 [1979]; <em>see also Matter of Pine Harbour, Inc. v Dowling, </em>89 AD3d 1192 [3d Dept 2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Here, the letter from DOF\u2019s General Counsel indicates merely a change of heart about Greater Jamaica\u2019s entitlement to an exemption. No new factual circumstances are adduced; the only post-2007 case that the General Counsel mentions is <em>Lackawanna, </em>which is cited along with <em>Association of Bar </em>for the proposition, presumably well understood by the City in 2007, that an important public purpose does not alone qualify a nonprofit\u2019s real property for an exemption under Real Property Tax Law \u00a7 420-a (1) (a). As \u201ca preliminary matter,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>General Counsel observed that Greater Jamaica\u2019s tax-exempt status under federal law was \u201cnot determinative of the issue of charitable use of the property as defined by 420-a.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tellingly, though, she does not claim that DOF originally <em>granted </em>the exemption to Greater Jamaica in mistaken reliance on a presumption that Greater Jamaica was qualified therefor solely because of its federal tax-exempt status. For this reason, the majority\u2019s lengthy discussion about a presumption is beside the point in this case, which involves a revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Next, the General Counsel discounted <em>Matter of Salvation Army v Town of Ellicott Bd. of Assessment Review </em>(100 AD2d 361 [4th Dept 1984]) and similar unnamed cases on the ground that these authorities merely</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u201cdemonstrate [d] that where a commercial enterprise (such as a thrift shop) is incidental to the main exempt purpose (providing rehabilitation and therapy for religious and charitable reasons) the commercial aspect does not destroy the entitlement to the exemption. Here, the parking lots are not incidental to another recognized charitable purpose but are the very purpose for which the property is being used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">This last statement dodges the issue. There is no question that the parking lots are being \u201cused\u201d as parking lots \u2014 i.e., areas where visitors to Jamaica\u2019s urban core may leave their vehicles temporarily for a fee; the question is whether this use is incidental to Greater Jamaica\u2019s broad charitable purpose to foster economic and community development, just as the thrift shop\u2019s operation was incidental to the Salvation Army\u2019s broadly stated exempt purposes. Additionally, DOF could have and should have been well-aware of the decision in <em>Salvation Army </em>in 2007. At that time, the agency would have been obligated to grant the exemption based on a determination that existing precedent supported the proposition that the parking facilities did, in fact, represent a use incidental to Greater Jamaica\u2019s charitable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The General Counsel also discussed whether the fact that the properties were owned by Jamaica First, a single-member limited liability company, rather than by its sole member, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Greater Jamaica, disqualified Greater Jamaica from the exemption. In this regard, she stated that \u201cit appears that [Jamaica First] collects amounts from the lots that exceed the carrying, maintenance and depreciation charges attributable to the premises\u201d <em>(see </em>majority op at 624, citing this as a reason substantiating the City\u2019s revocation of Greater Jamaica\u2019s tax exemption). The General Counsel\u2019s comment apparently refers to one of the requirements for determining whether to disregard Jamaica First as a separate entity; namely, the requirement that <em>\u201c[r]ent </em>may not exceed carrying, maintenance and depreciation charges as specified in section 420-a\u201d (NY City Dept of Fin Letter Ruling No. 074873-021, 2007 NY City Tax LEXIS 17 [emphasis added]; <em>see also </em>RPTL 420-a [2] [a nonprofit organization leasing real property to a corporation or association organized or conducted exclusively for one of the exempt purposes enumerated in section 420-a will receive an exemption for that property if it is used primarily for an exempt purpose and \u201cany moneys paid for such use do not exceed the amount of the carrying, maintenance and depreciation charges of the property\u201d]; <em>Sisters of St. Joseph v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 429 [1980]). But in this case, Greater Jamaica did not lease the parking facilities to or collect rent from Jamaica First <em>(see Matter of Scenic Hudson Land Trust v Sarvis, </em>234 AD2d 301 [2d Dept 1996] and cases discussed therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Finally, the majority states that the \u201ceconomic benefit conveyed by below-market rate parking . . . inures to the benefit of private enterprise,\u201d and concludes, on that basis, that this use \u201ccannot be said to further any charitable purpose.\u201d To the extent that the majority argues that Greater Jamaica is not entitled to an exemption because it receives revenue, this misapprehends the nature of Greater Jamaica\u2019s activities and our precedent. In a broad sense, the parking facilities benefit, and are used by, Greater Jamaica in two distinct ways. First, the parking facilities generate revenue, which is funneled back into Greater Jamaica\u2019s numerous development initiatives. But crucially, the parking facilities directly further Greater Jamaica\u2019s charitable purpose of economic rejuvenation by providing shoppers and other visitors a safe place to park while they patronize local businesses and educational, arts and religious institutions. This is not a situation where Greater Jamaica\u2019s \u201cavowed [charitable] purpose [ ] [is] a guise or pretense\u201d for profit-making (RPTL 420-a [1] [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In <em>Lackawanna, </em>by contrast, we held that the LCDC was not entitled to a real property tax exemption for land that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>leased to a for-profit manufacturing firm <em>(Lackawanna, </em>12 NY3d at 580). In so holding, we explicitly noted that our decision was based solely on the fact that the only use of the property was as a revenue-producing rental. Greater Jamaica, however, does not simply use the parking facilities as revenue-generating properties meant to raise funds for its economic development mission; it does not lease the facilities to a for-profit enterprise. As a result, Greater Jamaica is more akin to the petitioners in <em>Erie Sta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">In that case, one petitioner, Adult Home at Erie Station, Inc. (AHESI), operated an adult home that provided its elderly residents with housing and what AHESI described as \u201ca program of personal care\u201d <em>(Erie Sta., </em>10 NY3d at 214). We held that although \u201crenting homes to elderly people who are not poor is not a \u2018charitable\u2019 activity,\u201d citing <em>Greer Woodycrest </em>and <em>Presbyterian, </em>AHESI\u2019s property was \u201cplainly [used for] a \u2018charitable\u2019 purpose\u201d because the property was provided at below-market rates <em>{id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The second petitioner in <em>Erie Sta., </em>Regional Economic Community Action Program, Inc. (RECAP), was in a different position than AHESI because RECAP received the market rate for its properties <em>{id. </em>at 215). Nonetheless, we held that RECAP\u2019s property was also exempt from property taxation because \u201cRECAP is engaged in social work, helping homeless people, alcoholics, drug addicts and other afflicted members of society to become productive and useful citizens,\u201d which we characterized as \u201cundoubtedly a charitable activity\u201d <em>{id.). </em>We elaborated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">\u201cThat [the beneficiaries of RECAP\u2019s housing] pay market rents, and that RECAP may even benefit economically from its rental income, does not change the result. The issue is not whether RECAP benefits, but whether the property is \u2018used exclusively\u2019 for RECAP\u2019s charitable purposes. RECAP could lose its exemption ... if the economic benefit went to its officers or employees personally, but an economic benefit to a charitable organization does not by itself extinguish a tax exemption. <em>The question is how the property is used, not whether it is profitable\u201d {id. </em>at 216 [emphasis added]; <em>see also Congregation Rabbinical Coll. of Tartikov, Inc. v Town of Ramapo, </em>17 NY3d 763, 765 [2011] [\u201can economic profit made by a religious corporation \u2018does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>not by itself extinguish a tax exemption\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Erie Sta., </em>10 NY3d at 216)]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">To sum up, cases decided both before and after 2007 support DOF\u2019s 2007 decision to grant a tax exemption to Greater Jamaica for the parking facilities. DOF points to no change in law or the use of the property or any other objective consideration to justify its 2011 flip-flop. Before today, we had never ruled that a local government might simply change its opinion and revoke an exemption without some demonstrable predicate for its revised determination. Whether or not the 2011 revocation was improperly motivated, as Greater Jamaica and various amici contend, is impossible to say. On this record, all we know is that DOF interpreted the facts and the law one way in 2007, and the opposite way in 2011, although neither the facts nor the law had changed in the interim. Such an unexplained reversal of position is the very epitome of arbitrary administrative decisionmaking. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b736-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Rivera, Abdus-Salaam and Fahey concur; Judge Read dissents in an opinion in which Judge Stein concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Order reversed, with costs, and matter remitted to the Appellate Division, Second Department, for consideration of the issues raised but not determined on the appeal to that court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\">. Greater Jamaica\u2019s certificate of incorporation delineates seven specific charitable corporate purposes: (1) to promote, assist, participate in and coordinate sound planning and improve development of Jamaica\u2019s business-commercial-retail district; (2) to encourage and effect the development and expansion of commercial, industrial and manufacturing facilities in Jamaica; (3) to support and assist in the planning, development and expansion of educational, cultural, recreational, residential, governmental, transportation and other related facilities in Jamaica; (4) to carry on research and other studies in order to develop an overall comprehensive plan and subsidiary plans as may be necessary or appropriate for Jamaica\u2019s sound growth and improved development; (5) to provide assistance of every kind, including the rendering of advice, technical services and financial aid in connection with securing private or government aid to individuals, associations, corporations and other organizations, whether organized for profit or otherwise, interested in or working toward the sound growth and improved development of Jamaica or any part thereof, and to provide such assistance in connection with the formation of such organizations; (6) to assist and cooperate with federal, state and local departments, agencies and government organizations of every kind in furtherance of Greater Jamaica\u2019s purposes to the end that Jamaica shall receive the maximum possible benefit from federal, state and local programs; and (7) to assist and cooperate with other organizations in furtherance of the aforesaid purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b725-6\">. Hereafter, \u201cGreater Jamaica\u201d refers collectively to Greater Jamaica and Jamaica First, unless the context specifically indicates otherwise. As a single-member limited liability company, Jamaica First is generally treated as a branch or division of its owner, Greater Jamaica, for federal income tax purposes rather than as a separate entity (see 26 CFR 301.7701-3). Similarly, the City disregards single-member limited liability companies as separate entities for purposes of RPTL 420-a (1) (a) so long as certain requirements are fulfilled (see <em>e.g. </em>NY City Dept of Fin Letter Ruling No. 074873-021, 2007 NY City Tax LEXIS 17 [Nov. 21, 2007]). The New York City Department of Finance\u2019s General Counsel raised a question about whether Greater Jamaica and/or Jamaica First met certain of these requirements when she informed Greater Jamaica that its real property tax exemption was going to be revoked. Although repeatedly referring to the five properties as \u201ca standalone, for-profit, commercial parking garage\u201d or a \u201cfree-standing commercial parking lot,\u201d the City does not suggest on this appeal that Greater Jamaica and Jamaica First are separate entities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\">.
