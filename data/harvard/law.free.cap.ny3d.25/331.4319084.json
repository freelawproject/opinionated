We hold that these prosecutions involved different criminal transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>On June 15, 2009, defendant used false information when filling out an application (an MV-44 form) for a non-driver identification card, a form he submitted to the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in Suffolk County. On the application, defendant represented himself to be Ricky Lynch, Jr., defendant\u2019s son, using his son\u2019s name, date of birth, and Social Security number.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In November 2009, while driving in Westchester County, defendant made an illegal U-turn for which he was stopped by the police. When asked for identification, defendant produced the non-driver ID card he had obtained in June 2009. During an inventory of the car after defendant was arrested for driving with a suspended license, the officer found two other fake or forged identification cards on the floor behind the passenger\u2019s seat. Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree, aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the second degree, and false personation. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the third degree in satisfaction of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Defendant\u2019s son, Ricky Lynch, Jr., returned to New York in November 2008 after living with his mother in Arizona for four years. When he attempted to obtain a new driver\u2019s license at the DMV in February 2010, he was told he had unpaid tickets and that his license was suspended. After reviewing its records, the DMV found that defendant had used his son\u2019s identifying information to apply for an ID card. Defendant\u2019s son identified his father\u2019s photograph on licenses ostensibly issued to Ricky Lynch, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In August 2010, a Suffolk County grand jury charged defendant with criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree, alleging that on June 15, 2009, he possessed a forged instrument (the MV-44 form); forgery in the second degree, alleging that on June 15, 2009, with intent to defraud his son, he falsely made and completed the form; identity theft in the first degree, alleging that on the same date, he assumed the identity of his son; and offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree, alleging that on the same date, he presented the said form.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Defendant moved to dismiss the Suffolk County charges on statutory double jeopardy grounds under Criminal Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Law \u00a7 40.20. The court denied the motion, reasoning that \u201cdefendant is not charged in Suffolk County with possession of the identity card and thus the \u2018res\u2019 of the crime is a completely different instrument\u201d and \u201c[although related, the alleged crimes in Suffolk were complete with the defendant filing his application.\u201d \u201cThat the defendant possessed the fruits of that crime is a separate and distinct act which is not subject to a defense of double jeopardy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The Appellate Division affirmed, holding that there was no statutory double jeopardy violation because the \u201ccrimes for which the defendant was prosecuted in Suffolk County were not based upon the same criminal transaction as the crime for which he was prosecuted in Westchester County\u201d (116 AD3d 979, 979 [2d Dept 2014]). \u201cThe Westchester County prosecution involved a separate offense, which arose out of the defendant\u2019s possession of a different forged instrument than the one at issue in the Suffolk County prosecution\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 980).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Under CPL 40.20 (2), a subsequent prosecution for offenses involving the \u201csame . . . criminal transaction,\u201d as defined by CPL 40.10 (2), violates, the statutory bar against double jeopardy unless an exception applies.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">\u201c \u2018Criminal transaction\u2019 means conduct which establishes at least one offense, and which is comprised of two or more or a group of acts either (a) so closely related and connected in point of time and circumstance of commission as to constitute a single criminal incident, or (b) so closely related in criminal purpose or objective as to constitute elements or integral parts of a single criminal venture\u201d (CPL 40.10 [2]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The definition contains two alternative tests to determine whether two offenses are part of the same criminal transaction. Paragraph (a) \u201cinvolves consideration of the nature, timing and circumstances of the offenses\u201d so that, for example, where a seller of pornographic materials sold two pornographic items at the same time to a single purchaser, the acts constituted the same criminal transaction (New York Pretrial Criminal Procedure \u00a7 2:6 [2d ed 7 West\u2019s NY Prac Series], citing <em>People v North St. Book Shoppe, </em>139 AD2d 118 [3d Dept 1988]). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>In contrast, a court identified two separate criminal transactions where defendants used stolen credit cards to purchase merchandise, for which they were convicted of criminal possession of stolen property and forged instruments in New York State, and <em>three months later </em>bought <em>different </em>stolen credit cards, for which they were convicted in federal court of conspiracy to purchase stolen credit cards <em>(see People v Vesprey, </em>183 AD2d 212 [1st Dept 1992], <em>lv denied </em>81 NY2d 894 [1993]). Different criminal transactions have also been recognized for separate sales of drugs to the same person at the same place, separated by 48 hours <em>(see People v Robinson, </em>65 AD2d 896 [3d Dept 1978]).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In <em>People v Dallas </em>(46 AD3d 489 [1st Dept 2007]), defendant\u2019s prosecution in New York County for possession of 12 counterfeit documents and prior prosecution in Kings County for the sale of different false identification documents \u201cof the same nature,\u201d did not violate the statutory protections against double jeopardy because the offenses \u201cwere not so closely related as to constitute a single criminal transaction\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 490 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cThe fact that defendant was in the business of selling counterfeit identifications, and that his conduct in both counties may have been admissible in both prosecutions . . . did not make his possession of different documents at different times a single criminal transaction\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Paragraph (b) of the CPL 40.10 (2) definition \u201ctends to be more applicable to crimes that involve planned, ongoing organized criminal activity, such as conspiracies, complex frauds or larcenies, or narcotics rings\u201d (New York Pretrial Criminal Procedure \u00a7 2:6 [2d ed 7 West\u2019s NY Prac Series]). This Court has recognized violations of statutory double jeopardy protections in drug trafficking cases where the \u201cembracive nature of the crime of conspiracy\u201d presents unique circumstances (Pe<em>ople v Abbamonte, </em>43 NY2d 74, 85 [1977]; <em>see Matter of Abraham v Justices of N.Y. Supreme Ct. of Bronx County, </em>37 NY2d 560 [1975] [concluding that successive prosecutions in state and federal court for drug trafficking of the same drugs constituted the same criminal transaction and violated statutory double jeopardy protections]). In <em>Abraham, </em>this Court observed that each defendant in the drug trafficking conspiracy \u201cplayed a well defined role in a highly structured, disciplined and vertically integrated criminal enterprise,\u201d and \u201cthe part with which each was immediately concerned . . . was de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>pendent upon the success of the whole\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 566-567 [citation, brackets and internal quotation marks omitted]). The Court concluded that the \u201cacts and conduct constituted \u2018integral parts of a single criminal venture\u2019 and, thus, a single \u2018criminal transaction\u2019 within the meaning of CPL 40.20\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 567).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Here, under the test presented by CPL 40.10 (2) (a), the offense of submitting a forged MV-44 form and the offense of presenting a forged non-driver ID to the police were many months apart and, as in <em>People v Dallas, </em>involved different forged instruments \u2014 the non-driver\u2019s license and the MV-44 application form \u2014 making them different criminal transactions. The Suffolk County charge was based on defendant\u2019s completion and filing of the application form. The offense was complete once defendant submitted the forged application to the DMV in June 2009. The Westchester offense occurred almost five months later and was based on defendant\u2019s presentation of the forged non-driver\u2019s license to the officer. With the non-driver ID card in hand, defendant could give the appearance of a clean record, which would enable him to evade his criminal history and obtain a loan or employment under a false identity. Applying the alternative test defined by CPL 40.10 (2) (b), this case does not involve the integrated, interdependent acts as seen in conspiracy cases or complex frauds, and as such does not constitute a \u201csingle criminal venture\u201d <em>(see </em>37 NY2d at 567).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">A closer case might be presented had defendant applied for a <em>driver\u2019s </em>license in Suffolk County with his son\u2019s papers and showed the temporary driver\u2019s license later that <em>same day </em>when his car was stopped by police. In such circumstances, the timing and criminal purpose of the two acts would be more interrelated than the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">As the successive prosecutions here involved two different criminal transactions, we need not reach defendant\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Accordingly, the Appellate Division order should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-9\">Judges Read, Pigott, Rivera, Abdus-Salaam, Stein and Fa-hey concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of all charges in the indictment. At sentencing, the court dismissed the conviction of forgery in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the second degree on the ground that one cannot be convicted of both criminal possession of a forged instrument and forgery of the same written instrument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
