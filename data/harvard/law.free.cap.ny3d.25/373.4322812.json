It then passes through municipal storm sewer systems into rivers and lakes, adding the pollutants accumulated during its journey to those bodies of water. These municipal storm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>sewer systems thus differ from other entities that discharge effluents into our state\u2019s surface waters (for example, industrial or commercial facilities and sewage treatment plants) in three major ways: precipitation is naturally occurring, intermittent and variable and cannot be stopped; although municipalities operate sewer systems, stormwater contamination results from the often unforeseen or unpredictable choices of individual residents and businesses (for example, to let litter pile up or to use certain lawn fertilizers), as well as decisions made long ago about the design of roads, parking lots and buildings; and because stormwater runoff flows into surface waters through tens of thousands of individual outfalls, each locality\u2019s contribution to the pollution of a particular river or lake is difficult to ascertain or allocate through numeric limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Federal and state law prohibit discharges of stormwater from New York\u2019s municipal separate storm sewer systems in urbanized areas (referred to as MS4s) without authorization under a State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) permit. As an alternative to an individual SPDES permit, municipal separate storm sewer systems that serve a population under 100,000 (or small MS4s) may seek to discharge storm-water under a SPDES general permit. The 2010 General Permit \u2014 the subject of this lawsuit \u2014 requires these municipal systems to develop, document and implement a Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) in compliance with detailed specifications developed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC or the Department) to limit the introduction of pollutants into stormwater to the maximum extent practicable. To obtain initial coverage (i.e., authorization to discharge) under the terms of the 2010 General Permit, small MS4s must first submit a complete and accurate notice of intent (NOI) to DEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">After the 2010 General Permit took effect on May 1st of that year,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (NRDC) and seven other environmental advocacy groups (collectively, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>NRDC) brought this hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding/ declaratory judgment action against DEC to challenge certain aspects of the 2010 General Permit. NRDC claims generally that by allowing small MS4s to gain coverage under the 2010 General Permit based upon an NOI reviewed only for completeness and not subject to an opportunity for a public hearing, DEC has created an \u201cimpermissible self-regulatory system\u201d that fails to force local governments to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable \u2014 the statutory standard \u2014 and violates federal and state law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Equating NOIs with applications for individual SPDES permits, Supreme Court granted partial relief to NRDC (35 Misc 3d 652 [Sup Ct, Westchester County 2012]). The Appellate Division, as relevant here, rejected NRDC\u2019s federal and state law challenges to the 2010 General Permit (120 AD3d 1235 [2d Dept 2014]).

Water Management Dist. v Miccosukee Tribe, </em>541 US 95, 102 [2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Although the federal government plays the dominant role in water pollution control under the Clean Water Act, states may continue their own water pollution control regulations as long as they are at least as stringent as federal law demands (33 USC \u00a7 1370). And importantly, states are allowed to administer the NPDES permit program for discharges into navigable waters within their borders, subject to the Administrator\u2019s approval (33 USC \u00a7 1342 [b]). To attain this approval, a state must demonstrate that its permit program meets the requirements of the Clean Water Act and that the state possesses adequate legal authority to implement it <em>(id.). </em>In 1973, the legislature amended the Environmental Conservation Law to create SPDES, New York\u2019s version of NPDES <em>(see </em>L 1973, ch 801 [adding a new title 8 to article 17 of the ECL and amending other provisions of article 17 to bring them into conformity with new title 8]). EPA approved New York\u2019s SPDES program, which is administered by DEC, in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">EPA\u2019s Stormwater Exemption</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In its 1973 regulations implementing the NPDES program, EPA excluded discharges from a number of classes of point sources from the permit requirement, including separate storm sewers containing only storm runoff uncontaminated by any industrial or commercial activity <em>(see </em>38 Fed Reg 18000 [July 5, 1973] [40 CFR former 124.11 (f)]). EPA justified the exclusion as necessary to conserve its regulatory resources for more significant polluters. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Clean Water Act did not give EPA this option, but interpreted the statute to grant the Agency considerable leeway in setting permit terms <em>(see Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v Costle, </em>568 F2d 1369, 1377 [DC Cir 1977]). Noting its \u201csensitivity] to EPA\u2019s concerns of an intolerable permit load,\u201d the D.C. Circuit suggested that area or general permits would be a permissible and \u201cwell-established\u201d device for coping with the avalanche of NPDES permit applications anticipated in the wake of its decision <em>(id. </em>at 1380-1381; <em>see also Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v Train, </em>396 F Supp 1393, 1402 [D DC 1975] [EPA has \u201csubstantial discretion to use administrative devices, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>as area permits,\u201d to make its burden of permit issuance \u201cmanageable\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The Water Quality Act</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In the Water Quality Act of 1987 (Pub L 100-4, 101 US Stat 7, codified as amended in scattered sections of 33 USC) (the Water Quality Act), Congress endorsed permits for municipal stormwater discharges \u201cissued on a system- or jurisdiction-wide basis\u201d (33 USC \u00a7 1342 [p] [3] [B] [i]). These permits were mandated to \u201cinclude a requirement to effectively prohibit nonstormwater discharges into the storm sewers,\u201d and \u201ccontrols to reduce the discharge of pollutants <em>to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control techniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other provisions as the Administrator or the State determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants\u201d {id. </em>\u00a7 1342 [p] [3] [B] [ii], [iii] [emphasis added]). The Water Quality Act did not define \u201cmaximum extent practicable,\u201d but section 1342 (p)\u2019s text and legislative history indicate that Congress had in mind something other than conventional end-of-pipe control techniques and numeric effluent limits <em>{see </em>132 Cong Rec S32381 [Oct. 16, 1986] [remarks of Senator Stafford, then Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee] [\u201cThese permits will not necessarily be like industrial discharge permits. Often, an end-of-the-pipe treatment technology is not appropriate for this type of discharge\u201d]; <em>see also Defenders of Wildlife v Browner, </em>191 F3d 1159, 1164-1165 [1999] [recognizing that Congress \u201cchose <em>not </em>to include\u201d provisions (like effluent limitations under 33 USC \u00a7 1311) for municipal storm sewer discharges (emphasis added)], <em>amended on denial of reh </em>197 F3d 1035 [9th Cir 1999]).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The Water Quality Act established a timetable for EPA to issue NPDES permitting regulations and for EPA and states to issue permits for certain categories of stormwater discharges, principally discharges associated with industrial activity and discharges from large municipal separate stormwater sewer systems (those systems serving a population of 100,000 or more) <em>{see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1342 [p] [2], [4]). But for the many small municipal systems (those serving a population under 100,000), the Water Quality Act embraced a different approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The statute directed the Administrator, in consultation with the states, to conduct studies and report the results to Congress before developing a program to regulate stormwater discharges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>from these systems <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1342 [p] [5]). The study was meant to identify sources or classes of stormwater discharges for which NPDES permits were not required by the Clean Water Act; determine, to the maximum extent practicable, the extent and nature of their pollution; and develop procedures and methods to mitigate the effect of these discharges on water quality <em>(id.). </em>Congress then directed EPA to \u201cissue regulations (based on the results of the studies . . . ) which designate stormwater discharges . . . to be regulated to protect water quality and [to] establish a comprehensive program to regulate such designated sources\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 1342 [p] [6]). This program was to be designed, \u201cat a minimum,\u201d to \u201c(A) establish priorities, (B) establish requirements for State stormwater management programs, and (C) establish expeditious deadlines. The program [might] include <em>performance standards, guidelines, guidance, and management practices and treatment requirements, </em>as appropriate\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">New York\u2019s 1988 Legislation</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">By chapter 360 of the Laws of 1988, the legislature amended the Environmental Conservation Law to authorize DEC to issue general SPDES permits, as allowed by the Water Quality Act. To this end, new section 17-0808 specified at subdivision (3) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201c[p]ermits for discharges from municipal storm sewers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201ca. May be issued on a system or jurisdiction-wide basis, pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision seven of section 70-0117 of this chapter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201cb. Shall include a requirement which regulates non-stormwater discharges into the storm sewers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">\u201cc. Shall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants <em>to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control techniques and system design and engineering methods, and such other provisions as the commissioner determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants\u201d </em>(emphasis added; <em>compare </em>33 USC \u00a7 1342 [p]  [B] [iii] [the cognate federal provision]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">Additionally, the legislature amended existing section 70-0117 of the Environmental Conservation Law to include a new subdivision (7) to provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u201c(a) Under the [SPDES] program . . . , the department may issue a general permit, upon application or on its own initiative, to cover a category of point sources of one or more discharges within a stated geographical area which (i) involve the same or substantially similar types of operations, (ii) discharge the same types of pollutants, (iii) require the same effluent limitations or operating conditions, (iv) require the same or similar monitoring, and (v) which will result in minimal adverse cumulative impacts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">\u201c(b) General permits can only be issued for the following categories of discharges, if, by virtue of their nature and location, the department determines such discharges are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under individual permits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u201c(i) separate storm sewers or stormwater conveyance systems; . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">\u201c(c) Any general permit under this subdivision shall set forth the conditions which shall apply to any discharge authorized by such general permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u201c(d) The department may require any person authorized by a general permit to apply for and obtain an individual permit and the department shall adopt rules and regulations specifying circumstances under which an individual permit may be required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">\u201c(e) General permits shall be governed by the procedures set forth in this article [70] for the issuance of major permits\u201d (former ECL 70-0117 [7], renumbered ECL 70-0117 [6] [L 1994, ch 170, \u00a7 202]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The bill that became chapter 360 was drafted by and introduced at the request of DEC, which sought general permitting authority in order to avoid \u201cissuance of thousands of individual SPDES permits covering discharges of heat, stormwater and non-industrial waste as well as . . . discharges of a minor naturef, which] <em>do not require the individual attention the statute currently </em>mandates\u201d (Bill Jacket, L 1988, ch 360 at 14 [emphasis added]). Similarly, DEC explained that general permitting would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u201creduce the amount of paperwork and resources dedicated to permitted discharges which <em>do not warrant technical case review. </em>Past regulation of such discharges has created <em>substantial administrative burdens without corresponding increases in environmental protection. </em>Staff time spent on processing these types of permits detracts from time that could be spent on major and toxic discharges\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphases added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The bill\u2019s Senate and Assembly sponsors repeated these rationales <em>(id. </em>at 18, 23, 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">EPA\u2019s Final Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">EPA promulgated its final rule regulating stormwater discharges from small municipalities\u2019 separate stormwater sewer systems on December 8, 1999, effective February 7, 2000 (64 Fed Reg 68722 [Dec. 8, 1999], codified at 40 CFR parts 9, 122, 123, 124). These so-called Phase II regulations expanded the existing NPDES Phase I stormwater program.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record to support the regulation of small MS4s included the studies and reports to Congress mandated by the Water Quality Act, as well as EPA\u2019s evaluation of comments and considerable additional research and studies. Based on this record, EPA determined that surface water contamination from wet-weather discharges from these systems was best controlled by means of measures designed to reduce the quantity of pollutants introduced into stormwater and the volume of stormwater flow rather than end-of-pipe numeric limits <em>(id. </em>at 68753). Accordingly, the regulations required small MS4s to develop and implement a SWMP that identified best management practices to attain \u201cminimum control measures\u201d in six key areas: public education and outreach; public involvement; illicit discharge detection and elimination; construction site runoff control; stormwater management in new development and redevelopment; and pollution prevention and good housekeeping of municipal operations <em>(id. </em>at 68736, 68754-68762).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>EPA determined that if small MS4s carried out best management practices in accordance with their SWMPs, they would comply with the statutory standard to reduce pollutants to the maximum extent practicable <em>{id. </em>at 68754; <em>see also id. </em>at 68843 [40 CFR 122.34 (a)]); and \u201c[a]bsent evidence to the contrary, . . . presume [d] that a small MS4 program that implements the six minimum measures . . . does not require more stringent limitations to meet water quality standards\u201d (64 Fed Reg 68753). EPA recommended that small MS4s include the public in developing, implementing and reviewing the SWMP <em>{id. </em>at 68844 [40 CFR 122.34 (b) (2) (ii)]);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and required that all records, including a description of the SWMP, must be made available to the public for review and copying at reasonable times during regular business hours (64 Fed Reg 68846 [40 CFR 122.34 (g) (2)]).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">EPA interpreted the Water Quality Act as authorizing it to develop a stormwater program for small municipalities either as part of the NPDES permit program or as a stand-alone nonNPDES program, such as a self-implementing rule. EPA settled on the use of NPDES permits instead of a rule for several reasons, including a desire to maintain consistency with its Phase I program for stormwater control; to capitalize upon the existing government infrastructure for administration of the NPDES program and the regulated community\u2019s understanding of how the NPDES program works; and to provide flexibility in order to facilitate watershed planning and sensitivity to local conditions <em>{id. </em>at 68739). EPA did note, however, that \u201c[k]ey provisions\u201d of the rule \u201cpromot[ed] a streamlined approach to permit issuance by, for example, using general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>permits\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 68740; <em>see also id. </em>at 68762 [although the permit to authorize a small MS4\u2019s discharges might take the form of either an individual NPDES permit issued to one or more facilities as co-permittees or a general NPDES permit that applied to a group of small MS4s, EPA \u201cexpect(ed)\u201d that most discharges would be authorized or \u201ccovered\u201d under general permits for reasons of administrative efficiency and reduced paperwork burdens]). In fact, EPA recommended using general permits, rather than individual permits, for all storm-water sources newly regulated under its rule <em>{id. </em>at 68737).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">A small MS4 that seeks coverage under a general NPDES permit for its stormwater discharges is required to submit an NOI to the permitting authority. The NOI must specify the best management practices to be implemented for each of the six required minimum control measures along with measurable goals for the development and implementation of each best management practice <em>{id. </em>at 68762-68764). Although \u201c[s]everal commenters suggested that EPA require permitting authorities to approve or disapprove the submitted BMPs and measurable goals [,] EPA disagree [d] that formal approval or disapproval by the permitting authority [was] needed\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 68764).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">EPA afforded small MS4s up to five years to fully develop and implement their SWMPs,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with annual reports required to document progress <em>{id. </em>at 68770, 68846 [40 CFR 122.34 (g) (3)]). The Agency stated that \u201c[t]he permitting authority will use the reports in evaluating compliance with permit conditions and, where necessary, will modify the permit conditions to address changed conditions\u201d (64 Fed Reg 68770).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The 2010 General Permit</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The 2010 General Permit is a 97-page document, with appendices, which requires small MS4s to develop, document and implement a SWMP that includes 44 mandatory best management practices grouped into the six program components, or minimum control measures. Many of the mandatory best management practices afford small MS4s little or no choice about what they must do to comply with the 2010 General Permit; others afford more freedom in implementation. As an example of the latter, under the minimum control measure addressing public outreach, small MS4s must develop and implement an ongoing public education and outreach program, but enjoy flexibility to decide how best to accomplish this in light of local conditions or considerations (e.g., a media campaign, presentations to community groups, outreach to commercial entities, a webpage, printed materials, posters and/or 13 other suggested ways or management practices to raise the public\u2019s awareness and engage its participation in reducing pollution of stormwater runoff).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">At the other end of the spectrum, the 2010 General Permit imposes highly prescriptive requirements for small MS4s to develop, implement and enforce a program to detect and eliminate non-stormwater (i.e., illicit) discharges. The small MS4s must develop and maintain maps showing the location of all outfalls, verify each of them in the field and conduct an outfall inventory in accordance with detailed guidance published on EPA\u2019s website. Further, each small MS4\u2019s program must include procedures to identify areas that are of greatest concern and describe those areas, available equipment, staff and funding; identify and locate illicit discharges; eliminate illicit discharges; and document the steps the small MS4 has taken to implement its program.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The NOI and Annual Reports Provided for by the 2010 General Permit</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The NOI is currently a 19-page document that sets out the six minimum control measures, listing the mandatory and optional best management practices for each. The small MS4 must commit to each mandated and any optional best manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ment practice initially identified in the SWMP;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> describe initially identified measurable goals for each of the required or chosen best management practices, with start and end dates, including work to be done by partners. And finally, either a principal executive or ranking elected official must sign the NOI, certifying that the information submitted is, to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete, and acknowledging awareness of the significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fines and imprisonment for knowing violations. As noted previously <em>(see </em>n 6, <em>supra), </em>the NOI is made available to the public for comment for a 28-day period. Small MS4s that submit an NOI are authorized to discharge stormwater upon written notification from DEC that a complete NOI has been received. DEC, however, may also choose to require the small MS4 to submit an application for an individual SPDES permit or an alternative SPDES general permit. DEC annually audits up to 10% of all municipal storm sewers, makes site inspections, reviews citizen complaints and, where necessary, takes enforcement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The vast majority of New York\u2019s 500 plus small MS4s achieved initial authorization to discharge stormwater prior to the effective date of the 2010 General Permit; they were able to maintain coverage under the 2010 General Permit by submitting their 2009 annual reports <em>(see </em>nn 1, 2, <em>supra). </em>The 2010 General Permit directs small MS4s to make annual reports and SWMPs available for public review; provides for notice of receipt of 2009 annual reports to be published in the Environmental Notice Bulletin;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and requires small MS4s to present draft annual reports to the public and to include its responses to any public comments (including, as appropriate, any modifications of the SWMP) when they submit these reports to DEC. The annual report summarizes the activities performed by the small MS4 during the reporting period and those planned for the next year, and includes, among other things, an assessment of compliance with permit conditions; the appropriateness of the identified best management practices; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>progress toward meeting the measurable goals for each minimum control measure and achieving the statutory goal of reducing the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. DEC\u2019S review of annual reports allows the Department to keep tabs on small MS4s and to require any necessary refinement of best management practices. DEC refers to these contemplated successive rounds of reviewing and, as necessary, fine-tuning and refocusing best management practices as the \u201citerative process\u201d that is the hallmark of the flexible \u201cmaximum extent practicable\u201d standard, which Congress deliberately chose as best suited for regulating small municipalities\u2019 storm-water discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The Clean Water Act</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">There is no doubt that the 2010 General Permit complies with EPA\u2019s 1999 regulations, which allow permitting authorities to authorize small MS4s to discharge stormwater under a general NPDES permit upon receipt of an NOI \u2014 i.e., without <em>any </em>regulatory review, public notice and comment or opportunity for a public hearing. There is likewise no doubt that the 2010 General Permit affords more generous regulatory review and public participation than EPA\u2019s 1999 regulations require. But NRDC contends, and the dissent agrees, that the federal courts have held that the regulatory review and public participation features of EPA\u2019s 1999 regulations, on which the 2010 General Permit is necessarily modeled, constitute an \u201cimpermissible self-regulatory system\u201d in contravention of the Clean Water Act, and that New York courts are bound to follow suit with respect to the New York program. Stated slightly differently, NRDC and the dissent assert that federal court decisions make clear that the Clean Water Act does not allow DEC to authorize a small MS4\u2019s stormwater discharges under the 2010 General Permit without first engaging in an undefined more detailed review of the NOI (and, apparently, the SWMP) and providing the public an opportunity to request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">After EPA promulgated its 1999 regulations, various environmental, municipal and industry groups brought petitions for review, which were consolidated in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <em>(see Environmental Defense Ctr., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>Inc. v United States Envtl. Protection Agency, </em>344 F3d 832 [9th Cir 2003] <em>[EDC]). </em>The environmental petitioners argued that, by allowing permitting authorities to authorize small MS4s to discharge stormwater on the basis of \u201cunreviewed NOIs,\u201d the regulations created an \u201cimpermissible self-regulatory system,\u201d and additionally \u201cfail[ed] to provide for public participation as required by the Clean Water Act, because the public receive [d] neither notice nor opportunity for hearing regarding an NOI\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 854, 856). A divided panel agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Applying <em>Chevron </em>analysis,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the <em>EDC </em>majority first determined that the Clean Water Act unambiguously expressed Congress\u2019s intent that \u201cEPA issue no permits to discharge from municipal storm sewers unless those permits require [d] controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 854 [internal quotation marks omitted]), and that EPA\u2019s 1999 regulations did not fulfill this plain command. This was the case, the majority reasoned, because absent a permitting agency\u2019s \u201cmeaningful review\u201d of the minimum control measures selected by a small MS4, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the municipal operator might \u201cmisunderstand! ] or misrepresent! ] its own stormwater situation and propos [e] a set of minimum measures for itself that would reduce discharges by far less than the maximum extent practicable\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 854-856). The <em>EDC </em>majority also concluded that NOIs (unlike NRDC and the dissent, the court did not mention SWMPs) are \u201cfunctionally equivalent\u201d to NPDES permit applications, and therefore are subject to the same public availability and public hearing requirements <em>{id. </em>at 857).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The dissenting judge considered the \u201ccentral issues\u201d in the case to be whether the Clean Water Act allowed EPA to use a general permit system to administer the NPDES program and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>whether NOIs should properly be regarded as \u201cpermits.\u201d Citing <em>Chevron, </em>he noted that \u201cresolution of these issues require [d] a complicated weighing of policies (e.g., administrative streamlining vs. robust inquiry) that is precisely what agencies are designed to do and courts are without the resources or experience to do\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 881 [Tallman, J., dissenting]).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In the dissenting judge\u2019s view, although the majority correctly recognized that EPA was allowed to use a general permit system, it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cignore [d] the effects of the general permit. By filing an NOI, a discharger obligates itself to comply with the limitations and controls imposed by the general permit under which it intends to operate. EPA mandates that all permits (including general permits) condition their issuance on satisfaction of pollution limitations imposed by the Clean Water Act[;] . . . [therefore, the <em>general permit </em>imposes the obligations with which the discharger must comply (including applicable Clean Water Act standards), and EPA\u2019s decision not to review every NOI is not a failure to insure compliance with the [statute]\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 882).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">As for the majority\u2019s objection that EPA\u2019s general permit system did not allow for sufficient public participation, the dissenting judge chided his colleagues for \u201cfailfing] to give deference to EPA and imposing] the majority\u2019s own wishes instead\u201d <em>(id.). </em>He added that where \u201can agency promulgates rules after a deliberative process, it is incumbent upon [the federal courts] to respect the agency\u2019s decisions or else risk trivializing the function of that agency\u201d; and that \u201c[i]n this case, EPA made a permissible decision to create a general permit program supported by NOIs\u201d <em>(id.).</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">In <em>Texas Ind. Producers &amp; Royalty Owners Assn. v Environmental Protection Agency </em>(410 F3d 964 [7th Cir 2005]), the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed with the dissenting judge in <em>EDC </em>that NOIs are not subject to the Clean Water Act\u2019s public participation requirements for NPDES permit applications. As mentioned earlier <em>(see </em>n 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>supra), </em>EPA\u2019s Phase I stormwater regulations addressed construction activities involving five or more acres, and its Phase II stormwater regulations addressed construction sites that disturb one to five acres (as well as small MS4s). EPA eventually promulgated a general permit for stormwater discharges from both large and small construction sites in those jurisdictions where it had not authorized the state or an Indian tribe to administer the NPDES program. This general permit required operators to submit an NOI to acquire coverage; a responsible corporate officer to certify the basis for eligibility for coverage; creation, maintenance and implementation of a site-specific Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), also to be certified by a corporate official; and implementation of best management practices necessary to comply with water quality standards, assure weekly site inspections and document those inspections, including detailing weather conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">In its petition for review, NRDC attacked the general permit\u2019s failure to make NOIs and SWPPPs available to the public and afford the opportunity for a public hearing, citing 33 USC \u00a7 1342 (j) and (a) (l).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> EPA responded that these provisions did not apply to NOIs and SWPPPs because NOIs and SWPPPs were not permits or permit applications. The Seventh Circuit concluded that because the Clean Water Act spoke only of permits and permit applications, not NOIs or SWPPPs, the statute was silent or ambiguous for purposes of <em>Chevron </em>analysis. Accordingly, the court was called upon to decide whether EPA had reasonably construed the relevant provisions of the Clean Water Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In support of its interpretation, EPA \u201cstresse[d]\u201d that general NPDES permitting did not \u201cmake use of a permit application\u201d; rather, general permits were proposed through a notice in the Federal Register to solicit public comment, and \u201c[i]t [was] at that time that the public [had] the opportunity to request a public hearing\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 978). Once EPA issued the general permit as a final rule, a discharger intending to operate under the general permit\u2019s authority was required to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>that permit\u2019s already established terms; therefore, \u201cthere [was] no need for additional public comment or a notice period,\u201d and potentially requiring a public hearing for individual NOIs and SWPPPs risked \u201ceviscerat[ing] the administrative efficiency inherent in the general permitting concept, in effect making the general permit scheme no different from the process for obtaining individual permits [, which] would be inconsistent with Congress\u2019 intent to allow for the use of general permits\u201d <em>(id. </em>[citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Calling these rationales \u201ceminently reasonable,\u201d the Seventh Circuit concluded that \u201cEPA\u2019s interpretation of the terms \u2018permit application\u2019 and \u2018permit\u2019 as not including NOIs and SWPPPs is a permissible construction\u201d <em>(id.). </em>In so holding, the court acknowledged that it disagreed with the <em>EDC </em>majority and agreed with the dissenting judge in that case, thus creating a split between the circuits <em>(id. </em>n 13).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In sum, then, the federal circuit courts are split on the question of whether EPA has permissibly interpreted the Clean Water Act to mean that an NOI is not a \u201cpermit application.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And we obviously may not engage in <em>Chevron </em>analysis to review EPA\u2019s interpretation, which underlies the corresponding, although not identical, parts of the 2010 General Permit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>which NRDC objects. The federal courts and EPA will have to sort this out.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In that regard, NRDC has recently filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the Ninth Circuit in the <em>EDC </em>case, asking that court to order EPA to amend its 1999 regulations within six months to provide individualized review of NOIs with notice and opportunity for public hearings. This is all the more reason, DEC argues, to reject \u201cNRDC\u2019s attempt to litigate an underlying dispute with EPA by ordering relief against DEC for <em>complying </em>with EPA\u2019s regulations.\u201d We agree. Unless and until EPA revises its 1999 regulations, DEC\u2019s SP-DES general permitting program for small MS4s must comply with them (as it concededly does), and DEC need not go beyond the specifications of those regulations unless New York law requires it to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The Environmental Conservation Law</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">A SPDES general permit covers multiple entities with similar characteristics and minimal impacts <em>(see </em>ECL 70-0117 [6] [a]). SPDES general permitting allows DEC to avoid detailed review where it is not warranted and thereby frees up finite regulatory resources for the individual SPDES permitting of entities with greater impact on the environment. These were the reasons that DEC gave the legislature when it sought SP-DES general permitting authority in 1988, after Congress endorsed NPDES general permitting in the Water Quality Act, and the explanations that the legislation\u2019s sponsors gave when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the Environmental Conservation Law was amended to empower DEC to issue SPDES general permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The legislature has exhibited a continuing willingness to simplify and streamline the SPDES permitting process to reduce or eliminate administrative complexities that burden DEC and the regulated community alike in ways that do not benefit the environment. For example, in 1994 the legislature amended the Environmental Conservation Law to expand general permitting and require DEC to develop a priority ranking system for individual SPDES permits in order to carry out an \u201cenvironmental benefit permit strategy\u201d (EBPS) <em>(see </em>L 1994, ch 701). Broadly described, the EBPS prioritizes SPDES permits for full technical review and, when necessary, modification, in order to insure that those point source discharges presenting the greatest risk to the environment receive the most expedient and detailed regulatory attention <em>(see generally </em>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Technical and Operational Guidance Series 1.2.2 [\u201cAdministrative Procedures and the Environmental Benefit Permit Strategy for Individual SPDES Permits\u201d (issued June 2003, rev Jan. 2012)]; <em>see also </em>ECL 17-0805 [1] [b] [making a SPDES permit\u2019s priority ranking subject to an opportunity for a public hearing]).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">NRDC and the dissent blur the distinction between SP-DES general and individual permits by seeking to require DEC to undertake an undefined more comprehensive review of NOIs (and, apparently, to review SWMPs), and to provide an opportunity for a public hearing on NOIs/SWMPs. Thus, NRDC would like DEC to treat an NOI as though it were, or at least more like, an application for an individual SPDES permit <em>to be issued </em>rather than what it really is \u2014 a request for coverage under a general SPDES permit that has <em>already been issued </em>pursuant to the full panoply of article 70 procedures <em>(see </em>ECL 70-0117 [6] [e]; 6 NYCRR part 621).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But the Environmental Conservation Law does not obligate DEC to conduct SPDES <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>general permitting for small MS4s in accordance with NRDC\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s policy preferences. SPDES general and individual permits represent <em>alternative </em>ways for small MS4s to obtain authorization for their stormwater discharges. To the extent the courts force DEC to apply the same or similar procedures for both alternatives, the resource-conserving benefits sought by the legislature when it enacted the 1988 legislation are compromised, if not altogether lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Here, DEC has determined that examining NOIs for completeness constitutes a sufficient level of technical regulatory review to qualify a small MS4 for initial coverage under the 2010 General Permit; and that the 2010 General Permit\u2019s public participation requirements for NOIs (i.e., notices in the Environmental Notice Bulletin to let the public know when a small MS4\u2019s NOI has been submitted to DEC and where the NOI and SWMP are physically located and may be inspected; making the NOI, which DEC posts on its website, subject to a pre-authorization 28-day public comment period) are adequate. These are reasonable judgments that DEC possesses the discretion and expertise to make in furtherance of its responsibilities under the Environmental Conservation Law to regulate storm-water discharges from small MS4s <em>(see Matter of Howard v Wyman, 28 </em>NY2d 434, 438 [1971] [\u201cIt is well settled that the construction given statutes and regulations by the agency responsible for their administration, if not irrational or unreasonable, should be upheld\u201d]; <em>Matter of Davis v Mills, </em>98 NY2d 120, 125 [2002] [\u201c(T)his Court treads gently in second-guessing the experience and expertise of state agencies charged with administering statutes and regulations\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">We have reviewed NRDC\u2019s other challenges to the lawfulness of the 2010 General Permit and consider them likewise to be without merit. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\">. DEC issued the first General Permit in 2003 for a five-year period, and in 2008 issued a revised two-year General Permit, which expired on April 30, 2010. The five-year 2010 General Permit expired on April 30, 2015. A substantively identical new two-year General Permit took effect on May 1, 2015 and expires on April 30, 2017. Almost all the 500 plus small MS4s authorized to discharge stormwater under the challenged 2010 General Permit were initially covered by the 2008 (or, before that, the 2003) General Permit. The 2010 General Permit authorized them to discharge stormwater on an interim basis for up to 180 days after May 1, 2010. These small MS4s gained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>coverage under the 2010 General Permit by submission of their annual reports (discussed later in more detail) due in June 2010; they were not required to and did not submit NOIs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\">. As previously observed <em>(see </em>n 1, <em>supra), </em>virtually all the small MS4s in the state achieved coverage under the 2010 General Permit by virtue of NOIs that they submitted to DEC for initial coverage under the 2003 or 2008 General Permits, and their 2009 annual reports. As a result, the practical effect of a ruling in favor of NRDC is not self-evident, and threatens to create considerable confusion; i.e., would these small MS4s be required to resubmit an NOI, or would they be grandfathered? <em>(See </em>6 NYCRR 750-1.21 [d] [3].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\">. As the first step in carrying out the requirements of the Water Quality Act, the Phase I program covered NPDES permitting of stormwater discharges from MS4s serving a population of 100,000 or more and stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activities involving five or more acres (33 USC \u00a7 1342 [p] [2], [4]; <em>see also </em>55 Fed Reg 47990 [Nov. 16, 1990]).

By contrast, the 2010 General Permit requires DEC to publish a notice in the Environmental Notice Bulletin when an NOI is received from a small MS4.

We recognize that at least one statement in EPA\u2019s 1999 regulations does not appear facially consistent with its position in the <em>EDC </em>and <em>Texas Ind. Producers </em>lawsuits. The <em>EDC </em>majority remarked that \u201c[t]he text of [EPA\u2019s] Rule itself acknowledges that a Phase II NOI is a permit application that is, <em>at least in some regards, </em>functionally equivalent to a detailed application for an individualized permit\u201d <em>(EDC, </em>344 F3d at 853 [emphasis added]). In support of this proposition, the <em>EDC </em>majority (and the dissent <em>[see </em>dissenting op at 423 n 10]) cite 40 CFR 122.34 (d) (1), which starts out by stating \u201c[i]n your permit application (either a notice of intent for coverage under a general permit or an individual permit application).\u201d Section 122.34 is written in a \u201creadable regulation\u201d format as an answer to the question \u201cAs an operator of a regulated small MS4, what will my NPDES storm water permit require?\u201d It is the task of the federal courts, not this Court, to figure out whether section 122.34 (d) (1) or anything else in EPA\u2019s 1999 regulations is inconsistent with the Agency\u2019s litigation posture in <em>EDC </em>and <em>Texas Ind.

This is quite different from <em>Seittelman. </em>DEC operates the SPDES program as EPA\u2019s NPDES delegee, and is bound to follow EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act, here expressed, as challenged, in EPA\u2019s 1999 regulations.

Under the dissent\u2019s view and notwithstanding section 1369 of title 33, the highest court in every state that administers the NPDES permit program would be empowered to second-guess EPA\u2019s governing regulations, creating an obvious impediment to implementation of a coherent nationwide NPDES permitting scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b488-6\">.

As far back as 1903, New York State prohibited sewage and waste discharge into public waters <em>(see </em>L 1903, ch 468). There was also early federal concern with contamination of New York\u2019s water, as reflected by congressional passage of laws in 1886 and 1888 prohibiting discharges of certain pollutants and refuse into New York Harbor <em>(see </em>49th Cong, ch 929, \u00a7 3, 24 US Stat 310, 329 [Aug. 5, 1886]).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 was the first statute to consolidate these and other prior federal prevention efforts, in order to establish nationwide water pollution controls. The act prohibited discharge of \u201cany refuse matter of any kind or description whatsoever,\u201d into any navigable water of the United States without approval or a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers <em>(see </em>William L. Andreen, <em>The Evolution of Water Pollution Control in the United States </em>\u2014 State, <em>Local, and Federal Efforts, 1789-1972: Part II, </em>22 Stan Envtl LJ 215, 220-221 [2003]; American Bar Association, Section of Natural Resources, Energy, and Environmental Law, The Clean Water Act Handbook at 1 [3d ed 2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Water pollution, however, remained unabated and continued to present serious public health issues <em>(see </em>Andreen at 222; Philip H. Dixon, Environmental Law and Regulation in New York \u00a7 6:2 [2d ed 9 West\u2019s NY Prac Series]). Congress eventually passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act in 1948 (FWPCA) to address stream pollution which, as a result of World War II, had intensified due to \u201cincreased industrial activity and dramatically lower expenditures on wastewater treatment\u201d (Andreen at 235). Under the FWPCA, the states bore primary responsibility for water pollution within their jurisdictions, and federal enforcement was limited <em>(see </em>Andreen at 237-238; <em>see also </em>80th Cong, ch 758, 62 US Stat 1155 [June 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>1948]). Over time, Congress amended the FWPCA to provide financial assistance to municipalities in the form of grants to construct sewage treatment plants and to shore up federal enforcement (see Andreen at 240; 62 US Stat 1158).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">As national concern increased over environmental degradation and the adverse impacts of water pollution on society and the economy, Congress established the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration (see Water Quality Act of 1965, Pub L 89-234, 79 US Stat 903), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (see 42 USC \u00a7 4321 [Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 establishing the EPA]). It also enacted the Water Quality Act of 1965 and the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970. This administrative and regulatory framework was intended to ensure the adoption and enforcement of appropriate water quality standards and pollution controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">After these efforts failed to protect the nation\u2019s waters from dangerous levels of contamination, or to halt the continued decline of water quality, Congress passed a comprehensive revision and recodification of the FWPCA in 1972 <em>(see </em>Pub L 92-500, 86 US Stat 816 [Oct. 18, 1972], codified as amended at 33 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1251-1388). These amendments form the basis for what is best known as the Clean Water Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">B. The Clean Water Act and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">The Clean Water Act (CWA) heralded the modern era of federal water pollution control, with the stated objective to \u201crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters\u201d and the goal of eliminating water pollution <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1251 [a]). It provided for more robust federal enforcement of pollution controls and the development and implementation of waste treatment programs <em>(see </em>Andreen at 283-284). It also declared unlawful \u201cthe discharge of any pollutant by any person,\u201d to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d from a \u201cpoint source\u201d <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1311 [a]) unless authorized by federal permit, in accordance with the newly established national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1342 [a]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">This federal permit scheme, central to the CWA and administered by the EPA, subjects permit holders to pollutant dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>charge limitations as well as mandatory monitoring and reporting requirements <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1311 [b] [1] [A]; 1342 [b] [1] [A] [requiring SPDES permits to comply with section 1311]; <em>see also </em>Andreen at 261; Jeffrey M. Gaba, <em>Generally Illegal: NPDES General Permits under the Clean Water Act, </em>31 Harv Envtl L Rev 409, 410 [2007]). While the NPDES permit \u201cauthoriz[es] some water pollution, [it] placets] important restrictions on the quality and character of that licit pollution\u201d <em>(Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v United States Envtl. Protection Agency, </em>399 F3d 486, 491 [2d Cir 2005]).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The CWA imposes effluent limitations, which are \u201crestriction [s] ... on [the] quantities, rates, and concentrations of chemical, physical, biological, and other constituents which are discharged from point sources into navigable waters\u201d <em>(id., </em>citing <em>South Fla. Water Management Dist. v Miccosukee Tribe, </em>541 US 95, 102 [2004]). The CWA defines effluent limitations as \u201cany restriction established by a State or the Administrator on quantities, rates, and concentrations of chemical, physical, biological, and other constituents which are discharged from point sources into navigable waters, the waters of the contiguous zone, or the ocean, including schedules of compliance\u201d (33 USC \u00a7 1362 [11]). Certain effluent limitations are technology-based, meaning they are \u201cestablished in accordance with various technological standards that the [CWA] statutorily provides and that . . . vary depending upon the type of pollutant involved, the type of discharge involved, and whether the point source in question is new or already existing\u201d <em>(Waterkeeper, </em>399 F3d at 491). The CWA also provides for more stringent water quality-based effluent limitations when necessary to ensure state water quality standards <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1311 [b] [1] [C]). The technology-based and water quality-based limitations are generally represented as numerical limits on specific pollutant discharges <em>(see Waterkeeper, </em>399 F3d at 491).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">A permit is issued \u201cupon condition that such [pollutant] discharge will meet... all applicable requirements including the effluent limitations statutorily required\u201d by the CWA <em>(id. </em>at 498 [brackets omitted]). Thus, under the CWA\u2019s NPDES permit structure, \u201ca discharger\u2019s performance is now measured against strict technology-based effluent limitations \u2014 specified levels of treatment \u2014 to which it must conform, rather than against lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>itations derived from water quality standards to which it and other polluters must collectively conform\u201d <em>(EPA v California ex rel. State Water Resources Control Bd., </em>426 US 200, 204-205 [1976]). As described by the United States Supreme Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">\u201c[a]n NPDES permit serves to transform generally applicable effluent limitations and other standards \u2014 including those based on water quality\u2014 into the obligations (including a timetable for compliance) of the individual discharger, and the Amendments provide for direct administrative and judicial enforcement of permits ... In short, the permit defines, and facilitates compliance with, and enforcement of, a preponderance of a discharger\u2019s obligations under the [Clean Water Act] Amendments\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 205).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The CWA itself \u201cimposes only limited procedural obligations on the issuance of NPDES permits\u201d (Gaba at 417). The process for obtaining a permit is specifically set forth in EPA regulations <em>(see </em>40 CFR 122.21 <em>et seq.). </em>As a general matter, an applicant must file an EPA permit application form (see 40 CFR 122.21 [a] [2]). The application must be submitted at least 180 days before the applicant intends to commence discharging <em>(see </em>40 CFR 122.21 [c] [1]), and no permit will issue if an application is deemed incomplete by the EPA <em>(see </em>40 CFR 122.21 [e] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The CWA anticipates and requires certain opportunities for public participation. As prominently set forth in the CWA declaration of goals and policy, \u201c[p]ublic participation in the development, revision, and enforcement of any regulation, standard, effluent limitation, plan, or program established by the [EPA] or any State . . . shall be provided for, encouraged, and assisted by the [EPA] and the States\u201d (33 USC \u00a7 1251 [e]). The EPA may issue a NPDES permit only \u201cafter opportunity for public hearing\u201d (33 USC \u00a7 1342 [a] [1]), and \u201c[a] copy of each permit application and each permit issued . . . shall be available to the public\u201d (33 USC \u00a7 1342 [j]). In addition, the EPA regulations provide for public participation in the issuance of NPDES permits, including requiring notice and opportunity for comment on the denial of permit applications or the issuance of draft permits <em>(see </em>40 CFR 124.10 [a] [1] [i], [ii]), and the opportunity for a public hearing at the request of interested parties <em>(see </em>40 CFR 124.11). The Administrator of the EPA shall hold a hearing where the Administrator \u201cfinds, on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>requests, a significant degree of public interest in a draft permit(s)\u201d (40 CFR 124.12 [a] [1]), or \u201cat [the Administrator\u2019s] discretion, whenever, for instance, such a hearing might clarify one or more issues involved in the permit decision\u201d (40 CFR 124.12 [a] [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Maximization of public involvement as a federally recognized goal is illustrated not only by the CWA\u2019s public participation requirement, but also by its statutory provisions authorizing private civil suits <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1365). Under the CWA, a person may commence a civil suit against individual polluters as well as federal and state government entities for failure to act in accordance with the law <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1365 [a] [1], [2]). Private actors have actively litigated the proper enforcement of the CWA and compliance with NPDES permits <em>(see e.g. Los Angeles County Flood Control Dist. v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>568 US \u2014, 133 S Ct 710 [2013] [environmental organizations brought action against California municipal entities, alleging that they were discharging urban stormwater runoff into navigable waters in violation of the CWA]; <em>Decker v Northwest Environmental Defense Center, </em>568 US \u2014, 133 S Ct 1326 [2013] [environmental organization brought action against Oregon officials and timber companies, alleging that they violated the CWA by discharging stormwater from ditches alongside logging roads in state forest without NPDES permits]).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">C. State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The CWA also allows for a federally-authorized, EPA-approved state to issue permits \u201cfor discharges into navigable waters within\u201d the state\u2019s jurisdiction (33 USC \u00a7 1342 [b]). Currently, a majority of states are EPA-approved to operate their own state pollutant discharge elimination system (SPDES). The laws of such state must \u201cprovide adequate authority to carry out the [permit] program\u201d (33 USC \u00a7 1342 [b]), and the permits issued pursuant to this EPA authorization, must \u201capply, and insure compliance with, any applicable [CWA effluent limitations and standards]\u201d (33 USC \u00a7 1342 [b] [1] [A]).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">In 1975, the EPA authorized New York to issue permits under the State\u2019s SPDES, established pursuant to article 17 of the Environmental Conservation Law. Thus, discharges or pollutants from point sources into the waters of the state are prohibited, unless authorized under New York\u2019s SPDES permit program <em>(see </em>ECL 17-0803; <em>see also </em>33 USC \u00a7 1311 [a]). In ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>cordance with the ECL, any discharges allowed by these permits shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">\u201cconform to and meet all applicable requirements of the [CWA] . . . and rules, regulations, guidelines, criteria, standards and limitations adopted pursuant thereto relating to effluent limitations, water quality related effluent limitations, new source performance standards, toxic and pretreatment effluent limitations, ocean discharge criteria, and monitoring, and to participate in the [NPDES] created by the [CWA]\u201d (ECL 17-0801).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In addition to applicable federal requirements, such permits are also subject to regulations issued by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) <em>(see </em>6 NYCRR part 750).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In New York, in order to obtain a permit, an interested party must file an application <em>(see </em>ECL 17-0803; 6 NYCRR 750-1.4 [a]). The applicant must secure the permit prior to actual discharge of any prohibited pollutant (ECL 17-0803 [\u201cit shall be unlawful to discharge . . . without a SPDES permit\u201d]; 6 NYCRR 750-1.4 [a] [\u201cno person shall discharge . . . without a SPDES permit\u201d]). As required by law, DEC reviews and, where appropriate, approves the permit and issues a draft permit setting forth the effluent limitations and other conditions applicable to the discharger (ECL 17-0809 [1]; 6 NYCRR 750-1.10 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Public participation under New York\u2019s SPDES permit program is advanced through public notice requirements and an opportunity for public hearing on the permit application <em>(see </em>ECL 17-0805 [1] [b]; <em>see also </em>6 NYCRR 750-1.12 [a] [requiring notice]). The DEC must provide notice of every draft SP-DES permit, describing its terms and conditions, and must allow for a minimum 30-day public comment period (ECL 17-0805 [1] [b]). During the comment period, \u201c[t]he department may, in its discretion, provide an opportunity for the applicant or any interested agency, person or group of persons to request or petition for a public hearing\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">D. General Permits</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">As an alternative to the NPDES permit established by the CWA, the EPA passed regulations allowing the issuance of general permits \u201cto cover one or more categories or subcategories of discharges . . . within a geographical area\u201d (40 CFR 122.28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>[a] [1]). A general permit \u201cis a single NPDES permit that covers a number of individual discharges that would otherwise require individual NPDES permits\u201d <em>(Ohio Val. Envtl. Coalition v Horinko, </em>279 F Supp 2d 732, 758 [SD W Va 2003], citing 40 CFR 122.28; <em>see also Environmental Defense Ctr., Inc. v United States Envtl.

As such, it provides for certain efficiencies and reduces the administrative burdens associated with an individual permit process <em>(see Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v Costle, </em>568 F2d 1369, 1381 [DC Cir 1977] [\u201cArea-wide regulation is one well-established means of coping with administrative exigency\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">With the exception of the CWA\u2019s authorization for general permits allowing discharges of \u201cdredged or fill material\u201d <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1344 [e] [1]), the CWA contains no special provisions for a category of \u201cgeneral permits,\u201d thus leaving the procedures and substantive contours of a general permit scheme to the EPA <em>(see </em>40 CFR 122.28 [b]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those EPA regulations allow states to issue general permits through their SPDES programs, in accordance with federal regulatory provisions <em>(see </em>40 CFR 123.1 [c] [\u201cThe (EPA) Administrator will approve State programs which conform to the applicable requirements of this part\u201d]). All general permits, whether issued by the EPA or by an authorized state, must comply with the CWA and federal regulations <em>(see </em>40 CFR 123.25 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Since under a general permit program the permit is not issued for individual dischargers, but rather sets forth requirements that all applicants must satisfy in order to lawfully discharge pollutants, public participation under this scheme is provided through a notice and comment period directed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>soliciting public comments on the contents of the general permit <em>(see </em>40 CFR 124.10 [requiring notice]; 124.11 [allowing comment and requests for a hearing]).

Storm water runoff may contain or mobilize high levels of contaminants, such as sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, pathogens, toxins, oxygen-demanding substances, and floatables\u201d (40 CFR 122.30 [c]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Regulation of stormwater discharges are particularly challenging because of the ever present rain and snow that lead to stormwater runoff, and the fact that third parties may be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>source of illicit discharges to storm sewer systems <em>{see </em>64 Fed Reg 68789 [\u201cEPA acknowledges the need to devise a regulatory program that is both flexible enough to accommodate the episodic nature, variability and volume of wet weather discharges and prescriptive enough to ensure protection of the water resource\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">As provided under the CWA, the NPDES permit for municipal storm sewer discharges \u201cshall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control techniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other provisions the [EPA] Administrator or the State determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants\u201d <em>{see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1342 [p] [3] [B] [iii]). The CWA does not define the maximum extent practicable standard. However, it appears to provide broad authority to agencies to control stormwater pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In 1990 and 1999, the EPA adopted rules regulating municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s), which are systems designed to carry stormwater <em>{see </em>40 CFR 122.26 [b] [8]). The problems associated with regulating small MS4s are complex because of these municipalities\u2019 limited resources, the sheer numbers and diversity of the localities impacted by the general permit system, and the opportunity for an MS4 drainage system to cross geographic boundary lines, thus implicating multiple government entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The federal regulations authorize state agencies to issue general permits for such discharges <em>{see </em>40 CFR 122.26 [a] [5]; 122.28 [a] [2] [i]). According to the EPA regulations, the state general permit must require that the MS4 \u201cdevelop, implement and enforce a storm water management program designed to reduce the discharge of pollutants from [the] MS4 to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), to protect water quality, and to satisfy the appropriate water quality requirements of the [CWA]\u201d <em>{see </em>40 CFR 122.34 [a]). Further, the MS4\u2019s storm-water management program (SWMP) \u201cmust include the minimum control measures\u201d set forth in the EPA regulations <em>{id.). </em>The EPA has also concluded that with respect to MS4s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201cnarrative effluent limitations requiring implementation of best management practices (BMPs) are generally the most appropriate form of effluent limitations when designed to satisfy technology requirements (including reductions of pollutants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the maximum extent practicable) and to protect water quality. Implementation of best management practices consistent with the provisions of the storm water management program required pursuant to this section and the provisions of the permit required pursuant to \u00a7 122.33 constitutes compliance with the standard of reducing pollutants to the \u2018maximum extent practicable\u2019 \u201d (40 CFR 122.34 [a]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">B. New York State\u2019s MS4 SPDES Stormwater Discharges General Permit</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In 2003, DEC issued a General Permit for Stormwater Discharges for MS4s (General Permit), which applies to small municipalities as defined in the federal regulations <em>(see </em>40 CFR 122.26 [b] [16]). The General Permit was renewed for two years in 2008, and renewed again for five years in 2010.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This single General Permit currently covers 559 municipal separate storm sewer systems, statewide.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The General Permit authorizes stormwater discharges by small MS4 operators covered by the permit. Coverage is effective once the MS4 submits, and the State accepts as complete, an NOI (see New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, SPDES General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems [MS4s], Permit No. GP-0-10-002 at 2, available at http:// www.dec.ny.gov/docs/water_pdf/ms4gp2011.pdf, cached at http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/webdocs/ms4gp2011.pdf [hereinafter General Permit] [\u201c(A)uthorization under this SP-DES general permit is effective upon written notification from the (DEC) of the receipt of a complete NOI\u201d (emphasis omitted)]). The New York NOI is a form document filled out by an MS4. It contains the MS4\u2019s affirmances that it will comply with the general permit requirements, and that it has developed an initial SWMP to be implemented in accordance with the terms of the General Permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Under the General Permit scheme, an MS4</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">\u201cmust develop (for newly authorized MS4s, implement), and enforce a SWMP designed to reduce the discharge of pollutants from small MS4s to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>maximum extent practicable (\u2018MEP\u2019) in order to protect water quality and to satisfy the appropriate water quality requirements of the ECL and the CWA. The objective of the permit is for the MS4s to assure achievement of the applicable water quality standards\u201d (General Permit at 14 [Part IV. Storm-water Management Program (SWMP) Requirements, A. SWMP Background] [emphasis omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The General Permit requires the SWMP to contain the six mandatory minimum control measures set forth in the General Permit, and which mirror those contained in the EPA regulations. These control measures are titled: (1) public education and outreach on stormwater impacts; (2) public participation in the development, implementation and review of the MS4\u2019s SWMP; (3) development of a program for detecting and eliminating \u201cillicit discharges\u201d; (4) development of a program to control construction site stormwater runoff; (5) post-construction stormwater management; and (6) pollution prevention for municipal operations (General Permit at 49-67 [Part VIII. Minimum Control Measures \u2014 Traditional Non-Land Use and Non-Traditional MS4s]; <em>see also </em>40 CFR 122.34 [b] [1]-[6]).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Also, DEC has identified for each minimum control certain mandatory \u201cbest management practices\u201d to be utilized by the MS4 \u201cto prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the state\u201d (General Permit at 88 [Part X. Acronyms and Definitions]). The MS4\u2019s SWMP must specifically set forth \u201cmeasurable goals\u201d for each management practice <em>(see id. </em>at 95). An MS4 documents the developed, planned, and implemented SWMP elements in a SWMP Plan (Plan),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which \u201cdescribe[s] how pollutants in stormwater runoff will be controlled\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 96).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In addition to the minimum controls and management practices identified by the DEC, an MS4 \u201cmust comply with all applicable technology-based effluent standards or limitations promulgated by EPA pursuant to\u201d the CWA (General Permit at 22 [Part VI. Standard Permit Conditions, E. Technology Standards]). Further, \u201c[i]f an effluent standard or limitation more stringent than any effluent limitation in the SPDES general permit or controlling a pollutant not limited in the permit is promulgated or approved after the permit is issued, the SWMP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>plan shall be promptly modified to include that effluent standard or limitation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 22-23 [emphasis omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">The ECL further requires that SPDES permits \u201cinsure compliance with water quality standards adopted pursuant to state law\u201d (ECL 17-0811 [5]). The EPA regulations also prohibit issuance of SPDES permits that do not \u201censure compliance with the applicable water quality requirements of all affected States\u201d <em>(see </em>40 CFR 122.4 [d]; 123.25 [a] [1], [15]; 122.44 [a] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The CWA requires a state to establish, as effluent limitations, water quality standards for the state\u2019s water bodies by designating uses for every waterway and the amount of permissible pollutants that may be present without impairing those designated uses <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1313 [c] [2] [A]). Where current technology-based pollution controls are ineffective to attain or retain water quality standards for a water body, then that body is considered \u201cimpaired\u201d <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1313 [d]). The CWA requires that the states priority rank these impaired waters, \u201ctaking into account the severity of the pollution and the uses to be made of such waters\u201d <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1313 [d] [1] [A]), and calculate for each the total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the relevant pollutants that the water body may receive from all sources while still maintaining its water quality standards for any particular pollutant (33 USC \u00a7 1313 [d] [1] [C]). The states must set reductions for sources responsible for discharging pollutants in order for the dischargers to meet the TMDL <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1313 [d] [1] [C]). As petitioners and the State recognize, it can take years to determine a TMDL.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">For those impaired waters in New York that do not have a TMDL, the State\u2019s General Permit has established interim measures to address stormwater discharges pending designation of the applicable TMDL. In particular, effective the date the MS4 attains permit coverage, the MS4 must ensure \u201cno net increase\u201d in its discharge for certain pollutants, referred to as \u201cpollutants of concern\u201d and which are identified in the General Permit <em>(see </em>General Permit at 11, 101-108 [Part III. Special Conditions, B. Impaired Waters]). The General Permit includes pollutant load reductions for various water bodies in the state (General Permit at 78 [Part IX. Watershed Improvement Strategy Requirements, C. Pathogen Impaired Watershed MS4s]). Further, the MS4 must take all necessary actions to ensure future discharges do not cause or contribute to any existing violation of water quality standards. In other words, the Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>eral Permit requires the MS4 maintain the pollutant level at status quo. With respect to those water bodies for which New York has established a TMDL, the General Permit requires that the MS4 comply with the discharge reduction as \u201cdefined by the TMDL program\u201d (General Permit at 12 [Part III. Special Conditions, B. Impaired Waters, 2. Watershed Improvement Strategies]).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The MS4\u2019s affirmative agreement to comply with the General Permit requirements is represented in the NOI form, which consists mainly of a simplified checklist of the minimum control measures and management practices. In other words, the MS4 selects from a \u201cmenu\u201d of required and optional management practices, and thus indicates which items the MS4 will employ to meet a given minimum control measure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In order to select from the list, the MS4 need only fill in the circle corresponding to each management practice. The NOI form also provides for a narrative description of \u201cmeasurable goals,\u201d with start and end dates \u201cthat will be used for each best management practice for each of the minimum control measures\u201d (NOI at 12-13, 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>m.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Petitioners filed this hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action challenging portions of the General Permit as inconsistent with federal and state law. Petitioners requested the court remand the General Permit to DEC, with instructions that DEC modify the permit to conform with all applicable legal requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Our scope of review requires that we determine whether DEC\u2019s issuance of the General Permit \u201cwas made in violation of lawful procedure, was affected by an error of law or was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion\u201d to the extent that the permit\u2019s requirements violate state and federal law (CPLR 7803 [3]). Contrary to the majority, I conclude that DEC is in violation of applicable mandatory statutory and regulatory requirements on two grounds. First, DEC improperly grants coverage under the General Permit to an MS4 without a pre-coverage substantive review of the MS4\u2019s intended storm-water discharge control measures. Second, the State\u2019s General Permit scheme fails to provide members of the public with an opportunity to request a hearing on the contents of a MS4\u2019s NOI and SWMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">A. New York\u2019s Small MS4 General Permit</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Petitioners allege that the General Permit relies on an impermissible self-regulatory system, one that is dependent on the MS4 implementing pollution controls unverified by DEC for compliance with federal and state requirements. Specifically, petitioners claim that under federal law, the General Permit must contain effluent limitations that reduce pollutant discharges to the \u201cmaximum extent practicable,\u201d and also ensure compliance with water quality standards. Petitioners explain that New York\u2019s General Permit scheme fails to ensure the adoption of legally sufficient pollution controls because DEC authorizes an MS4 to develop and implement a stormwater discharge management program, without DEC first making an administrative determination that the specific measures chosen by the MS4 will satisfy statutory pollutant reduction standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">DEC responds that by requiring an MS4 to adopt the six minimum control measures and certain best management practices, DEC has set the bench mark for compliance with the CWA\u2019s \u201cmaximum extent practicable\u201d standard. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>DEC, so long as the MS4 agrees to the minimum control measures and management practices, the MS4 has chosen a course of action that meets legal requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The majority concludes that the General Permit is in compliance with the CWA and ECL, and that the petitioners merely seek for this Court to hold the SPDES General Permit to the same standards applicable to a SPDES individual permit, in contravention of the state legislature\u2019s intent <em>(see </em>majority op at 396-397). Essentially, the majority adopts DEC\u2019s position that the stormwater general permit scheme is lawful because it complies with EPA stormwater regulations and ECL requirements, and reflects the legislative preference for a streamlined regulatory process which reduces or eliminates administrative burdens (see <em>id. </em>at 395-396).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">I agree with the majority that the General Permit is designed to reduce the administrative burdens associated with the SP-DES individual permit program, and that our analysis of petitioners\u2019 claims must consider that these are different permitting schemes. Where I disagree with the majority is with its conclusion that the State\u2019s stormwater General Permit complies with the CWA and ECL when it does no more than allow those who seek to discharge pollutants to determine for themselves the pollution controls that satisfy the federal standard, and as a consequence insulate themselves from liability should they fall short of the federal mandate to reduce discharges to the \u201cmaximum extent practicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">DEC\u2019s own description of the General Permit and its regulatory efforts establishes that DEC has created an impermissible scheme that allows pollution without first ensuring that the MS4s\u2019 pollution controls comply with the CWA and ECL. While the General Permit sets forth certain control measures and management practices that every MS4 must incorporate as part of its pollutant discharge control program, the MS4 is wholly responsible for the task of identifying, developing and implementing the activities and measurable goals necessary to achieve the reduction of stormwater discharges to the \u201cmaximum extent practicable.\u201d This is not itself unlawful because DEC could reasonably conclude there are administrative and substantive benefits associated with allowing the state\u2019s several hundred municipalities to develop pollution control programs designed to address local circumstances. However, by leaving to an MS4 the development and adoption of its pollutant discharge controls, and granting general permit coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>without DEC having reviewed the MS4\u2019s program to ensure compliance with the CWA and ECL, the State has abdicated its essential regulatory role, in violation of the CWA and ECL.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The mechanics of the general permit scheme are undisputed. The General Permit replaces the individual permit system with a single permit applicable to a class of dischargers. New York\u2019s General Permit contains the six minimum control measures identified by the EPA as appropriate to reducing pollutant discharges to the maximum extent practicable. DEC contends that it has determined that these measures can be achieved by application of certain best management practices and has included those in the General Permit, grouped according to their corresponding control measure. Thus, the measures, as expanded by the specified management practices, are the foundation of the DEC\u2019s approach to ensuring an MS4\u2019s reduction of stormwater pollutant discharges within the mandates of the CWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In directing an MS4 to employ these control measures and management practices in order to achieve compliance with the \u201cmaximum extent practicable\u201d standard, the General Permit does little to explain the standard, other than to state that if an MS4 utilizes all the applicable management practices it will satisfy the federal standard. However, the text of the controls and management practices lacks the type of quantitative explication of objective standards which an MS4 can apply to assess whether its stormwater system\u2019s protocols actually reduce pollutant discharges to a legally sufficient level.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">For example, the minimum control measure titled \u201cIllicit Discharge Detection and Elimination,\u201d which refers to mixed stormwater discharges such as sanitary sewage, garage drain effluent, and waste motor oil, requires as a management practice that an MS4 \u201c[d]evelop . . . , implement and enforce a program to detect and eliminate illicit discharges . . . into the small MS4\u201d <em>(see </em>General Permit at 34-35 [Part VII. Minimum Control Measures \u2014 Traditional Land Use Control, A. Traditional Land-Use Control MS4 Minimum Control Measures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>(MCMs), 3. Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination (IDDE) \u2014 SWMP Development/Implementation] [emphasis omitted]). This, of course, says nothing more than that the MS4 must establish a program to comply with the law. This is but one example of the vague management practices that provide little by way of instruction on how an MS4 develops and implements specific controls to achieve sufficient reduction of discharge levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Each and every one of those six control measures requires that the MS4 \u201c[d]evelop (for newly authorized MS4s), record, periodically assess, and modify as needed, measurable goals,\u201d and also that the MS4 \u201c[s] elect and implement appropriate . . . [activities or best management practices] and measurable goals to ensure the reduction of all [pollutants of concern] in stormwater discharges to the [maximum extent practicable]\u201d (General Permit at 29, 33, 35, 39, 46 [Part VII. Minimum Control Measures \u2014 Traditional Land Use Control] [emphasis omitted]). As the General Permit requires, the SWMP \u201cdescribe [s] the [best management practice]/measurable goal\u201d; \u201cidentifies] time lines/schedules and milestones for development and implementation\u201d; includes \u201cquantifiable goals to assess progress over time\u201d; and describes \u201chow the covered entity will address [pollutants of concern]\u201d (General Permit at 95 [Part X. Acronyms and Definitions]). These are hardly the type of \u201chighly specific\u201d controls DEC claims them to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">While the General Permit references other guidance, the guidance is non-binding. Moreover, it is still the case that the MS4 could choose to ignore the guidance, believing it has complied with the maximum extent practicable standard only to learn later that it has violated the CWA. This is not a merely speculative assessment of the general permit structure because as the permit itself states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201c[i]f a covered entity chooses only a few of the least expensive methods, it is likely that MEP has not been met. On the other hand, if a covered entity employs all applicable BMPs except those where it can be shown that they are not technically feasible in the locality, or whose cost would exceed any benefit to be derived, it would have met the standard. MEP required covered entities to choose effective BMPs, and to reject applicable BMPs only where other effective BMPs will serve the same purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the BMPs would not be technically feasible, or the cost would be prohibitive\u201d (General Permit at 91 [Part X. Acronyms and Definitions]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">As this suggests, something less than adoption of all of the management practices may comply with the maximum extent practicable standard, but when that would be the case and under what circumstances is uncertain and subject to the particularities of the MS4.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">More significant than the opportunity for an MS4 to select additional management practices \u2014 or even substitute mandatory best management practices with management practices the MS4 determines on its own are better suited or economically feasible, and yet still designed to achieve reduction to the maximum extent practicable \u2014 is the fact that, even if the mandatory management practices were clearer and specific, the General Permit does not, alone, set the limitations that each MS4 will implement. Instead, DEC delegated that task to the MS4. The General Permit requires that in order to utilize the measures and management practices, the MS4 must determine the details and logistics of the management practices it has selected. Thus, the general permit scheme depends on each MS4\u2019s determination and eventual adoption of the most efficacious practices that the MS4 will apply to achieve the statutory goal of pollutant discharge reductions to the maximum extent practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">To that end, the General Permit specifically requires that the MS4 develop and implement a SWMP \u201cdesigned to reduce the discharge of pollutants from small MS4s to the maximum extent practicable ... in order to protect water quality and to satisfy the appropriate water quality requirements of the ECL and the CWA\u201d <em>(see </em>General Permit at 14 [Part IV. Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) Requirements, A. SWMP Background]). Although the General Permit requires the SWMP to contain the six measures and the mandatory management practices, the SWMP does more than merely recite them. Rather, the SWMP expounds upon them, and thus reflects the MS4\u2019s determination of the appropriate limits necessary to achieve CWA compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">That determination is set forth in the \u201cmeasurable goals\u201d the MS4 develops for each of the management practices. These goals are intended to \u201chelp the covered entities assess the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>status and progress of their program\u201d (General Permit at 95 [Part X. Acronyms and Definitions]). They \u201cshould reflect the needs and characteristics of the covered entity and the areas served by its small MS4. Furthermore, the goals should be chosen using an integrated approach that fully addresses the requirements and intent of the [minimum control measures]\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 91).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">This is not a static process, because as the General Permit indicates, \u201c[t]he assumption is that the program schedules would be created over a 5 year period and goals would be integrated into that time frame\u201d <em>{id.). </em>Particularly troubling is the fact that DEC does not review the SWMP or the Plan. In fact, it appears DEC has gone to great lengths to avoid formal consideration of both by prohibiting inclusion of the SWMP with the MS4\u2019s NOI, and by allowing up to three years after the effective date of permit coverage for the MS4 to develop and implement the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">If, as DEC argues, all that is required to result in discharge reductions sufficient to comply with the CWA is the employment of the minimum control measures and the mandatory management practices, there would be no need for municipal development and articulation of \u201cactivities,\u201d \u201cmeasurable goals\u201d and \u201cother techniques.\u201d In reality, the MS4 is left to details where none have been provided, and to craft a SWMP and Plan to guide the implementation of its stormwater discharge reduction efforts. Notably, DEC anticipates that those efforts will change over time, and thus allows the Plan to be developed and implemented up to three years after the MS4 gains coverage under the General Permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The majority concludes that \u201c[t]here is no doubt that the 2010 General Permit complies with EPA\u2019s 1999 regulations\u201d (majority op at 390). However, those very same federal regulations for small municipal separate storm sewer systems were deemed to violate the CWA in <em>EDC </em>because they failed to provide for meaningful administrative review <em>{see </em>344 F3d 832, 856 [9th Cir 2003]). In that case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals considered a challenge to the EPA\u2019s stormwater Phase II rule, under which small MS4s were authorized by an NPDES general permit to immediately commence the discharge of stormwater after submitting an NOI. Unlike the \u201ctraditional general permitting model,\u201d the court explained, \u201cthe Phase II Rule requires that each NOI contain information on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>individualized pollution control program that addresses each of the six general criteria specified in the Minimum Measures\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 853). Under the rule, the EPA was not required to conduct a review of each NOI prior to discharge authorization, as it is required to conduct before granting an application for an individual permit <em>{id. </em>at 854-856). The Ninth Circuit held that the permitting scheme violated 33 USC \u00a7 1342 (p) (3) (B) (iii) because \u201cnothing prevents the operator of a small MS4 from misunderstanding or misrepresenting its own stormwater situation and proposing a set of minimum measures for itself that would reduce the discharges by far less than the maximum extent practicable\u201d <em>{EDC, </em>344 F3d at 855). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">\u201cin order to receive the protection of a general permit, the operator of a small MS4 needs to do nothing more than decide for itself what reduction in discharges would be the maximum practical reduction. No one will review that operator\u2019s decision to make sure that it was reasonable, or even good faith\u201d <em>{id.).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">As a consequence, the \u201cEPA would allow permits to issue that would do less than <em>require </em>controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable\u201d <em>{id.). </em>Accordingly, the court remanded that aspect of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The Second Circuit applied similar reasoning to reject EPA\u2019s NPDES permitting scheme, albeit in a case involving different water pollutants, namely emissions from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) proscribed by the EPA\u2019s CAFO rule. In <em>Waterkeeper, </em>the Circuit Court concluded that the CAFO rule did not require NPDES permitting authorities to review the management plans to ensure that the plans were developed and implemented so as to reduce discharges as required by the federal regulations <em>{Waterkeeper, </em>399 F3d at 500).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">New York\u2019s General Permit similarly fails for the reasons articulated by the circuit courts in <em>EDC </em>and <em>Waterkeeper. </em>Although the Appellate Division concluded that the General Permit \u201cinclude [s] a variety of enforcement measures that are sufficient to comply with the maximum extent practicable standard\u201d (M<em>atter of Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v New York State Dept. of Envtl. Conservation, </em>120 AD3d 1235, 1243 [2014]), that is beside the point because the issue is not the propriety of the measures or the management practices, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>because those alone do not establish the details of any particular MS4\u2019s stormwater discharge program. Indeed, petitioners do not challenge DEC\u2019s choice of minimum controls or management practices. Rather, they challenge DEC\u2019s failure to assess for legal adequacy the pollutant discharge proscriptions actually developed by the municipalities, and intended to be applied by the MS4s.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The fact that DEC provides a menu of management practices cannot save the general permit scheme because \u201cnothing requires that the combination of items that the operator of a small MS4 selects from this \u2018menu\u2019 will have the combined effect of reducing discharges to the maximum extent practicable\u201d <em>(EDC, </em>344 F3d 832, 855 n 32). Moreover, it is not the amount of choices that matters here \u2014 as the DEC suggests by arguing that it imposes 44 mandatory management practices \u2014 because more practices are meaningless if there is no assessment as to whether the MS4 understands how those practices work and how to apply them to ensure pollutant discharge reduction to the level required by the CWA. This is certainly the case here where the CWA\u2019s maximum extent practicable standard is intentionally undefined, and where DEC\u2019s management practices are vague and generalized, often redundant of the minimum controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The majority appears to marginalize the decision in <em>EDC, </em>characterizing it as part of a federal circuit court split <em>{see </em>majority op at 394).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, in <em>EDC, </em>the Ninth Circuit vacated the EPA regulations to the extent they did \u201callow permits to issue that would do less than <em>require </em>controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable\u201d <em>{EDC, </em>344 F3d at 855-856, citing 64 Fed Reg 68753). Rather than a division among the circuit courts, the Ninth Circuit decision is the only circuit decision on the validity of the regulations\u2019 content. While the United States Supreme Court is the final word on the proper interpretation of the CWA and the EPA regulations, that Court has chosen not to take up the case <em>(see Texas Cities Coalition on Stormwater v EPA, </em>541 US 1085 [2004] [denying petition for writ of certiorari]). Moreover, the Ninth Circuit decision has affected the EPA\u2019s application of the regulations. Indeed, the EPA issued post-ADC guidance to Wa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ter Management Division Directors stating that \u201c[t]he permitting authority will need to conduct an appropriate review of Phase II MS4s\u2019 NOIs to ensure consistency with the permit.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Even assuming we could simply ignore that the EPA regulations have been vacated in relevant part, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s conclusion that the State\u2019s General Permit \u201cconcededly\u201d complies with the EPA regulations, the fact is that the EPA regulations require implementation of best management practices consistent with the SWMP <em>(see </em>40 CFR 122.34 [a] [\u201cImplementation of best management practices consistent with the provisions of the storm water management program required pursuant to this section and the provisions of the permit required pursuant to \u00a7 122.33 constitutes compliance with the standard of reducing pollutants to the \u2018maximum extent practicable\u2019 \u201d]). Therefore, so long as DEC allows general permit coverage to an MS4 without ensuring the intended consistency between management practices and the individualized protocols set forth in the SWMP, the State is in violation of the CWA <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1342 [p] [3] [B] [iii] [providing that MS4 permits \u201cshall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices, control techniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other provisions as the Administrator or the State determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">It is undeniable that DEC has made efforts to adopt a general permit scheme that complies with the CWA and ECL, and which provides an administratively feasible approach to the difficult task of reducing stormwater pollutant discharges. Nevertheless, DEC\u2019s current approach is legally impermissible. Of course, it is for the State, and not the judiciary, to establish the State\u2019s review and assessment protocols <em>(see Akpan v Koch, </em>75 NY2d 561, 570 [1990] [\u201ccourts may not substitute their judgment for that of the agency for it is not their role to weigh the desirability of any action or to choose among alternatives\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)]). It very well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>may be that the State determines, as have other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that review of the SWMP and the Plan is but one way by which the State may comprehensively and expeditiously comply with its regulatory mandate. How best to address this issue should be left to New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">B. Public Participation Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Petitioners argue that DEC violates statutory public participation requirements by failing to provide an opportunity for public comment and to request a public hearing on a MS4\u2019s NOI and SWMP, prior to DEC\u2019s authorization of coverage under the General Permit. DEC currently provides a full public notice and comment period and an opportunity to request a public hearing on the General Permit, and DEC also affords an additional 28-day pre-coverage public comment period with respect to each NOI <em>(see </em>General Permit at 8 [Part II. Obtaining Permit Coverage]). The majority concludes this meets all applicable legal requirements. I disagree and would find that the CWA and ECL require more pre-coverage public participation. Specifically, because the NOI and SWMP must contain the MS4s\u2019 pollution controls, and the SWMP must be developed in advance of the NOI, which is then submitted to obtain coverage under the General Permit, DEC must provide an opportunity to request a public hearing for any particular NOI and SWMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Congress explicitly sought to encourage public participation in the development and implementation of the nation\u2019s water pollution control measures, and required that the EPA and the states provide for, encourage, and assist with \u201c[p]ublie participation in the development, revision, and enforcement of any regulation, standard, effluent limitation, plan, or program established by the [EPA] or any State\u201d (33 USC \u00a7 1251 [e]). The intended transparency of the process is reflected in the CWA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>requirement that permit applications, and the NPDES and SP-DES permits themselves be made public <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1342 |j']). With respect to the demand for administrative hearings, the CWA provides that the EPA may issue a permit <em>\u201cafter </em>opportunity for public hearing\u201d (see 33 USC \u00a7 1342 [a] [1] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The ECL also mandates public participation with respect to SPDES coverage. State law requires \u201c[p]ublic notice of a complete application for a SPDES permit\u201d (ECL 17-0805 [1] [a]), which shall include \u201ca statement that written comments or requests for a public hearing on the permit application . . . may be filed by a time and at a place specified\u201d (ECL 17-0805 [1] [a] [ix]). The public comment shall last \u201cnot less than thirty days following the date of the public notice . . . during which time interested persons may submit their written views with respect to the application and the priority ranking of the permit\u201d (ECL 17-0805 [1] [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Petitioners argue that the public should have the opportunity to request a hearing on the contents of the NOI and SWMP because both contain the MS4\u2019s pollution controls. Petitioners are correct that an MS4 must identify and list in the NOI its chosen management practices, and it must include in the SWMP the controls to reduce the discharge pollutants in accordance with the maximum extent practicable standard. Thus, the NOI and SWMP not only affirm that the MS4 will comply with the General Permit\u2019s terms, but they also explain how the MS4s will meet legal requirements, based on the localities\u2019 unique circumstances. Indeed, to ensure for itself that an MS4 understands its duties and obligations, the DEC must refer to the NOI and SWMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Here, DEC issued a General Permit for the specific purpose of allowing stormwater pollutant discharges by a covered MS4, where an MS4 has agreed to meet conditions set forth in the CWA, ECL, federal and state regulations, and the General Permit. A cursory review of the General Permit makes clear that it is not specific to any particular MS4, but rather it is generic, intended to set forth the minimum requirements identified by DEC, which must be complied with by every MS4 seeking coverage under the General Permit. However, as DEC has vigorously contended, general permit coverage is not automatic, but requires that the MS4 submit an NOI which DEC must then accept as complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>According to the General Permit, the NOI affirms that a SWMP has been developed. As the parties concede, the NOI and SWMP contain what DEC considers to be the mandatory limitations and measurable goals an MS4 proposes to implement in order to ensure stormwater pollutant discharge reduction to the maximum extent practicable, as required by the CWA. Clearly, then, submission of a completed NOI, based as it is on an initial SWMP, is the MS4\u2019s entree to the general permit system, and is a necessary step to securing authorization to lawfully discharge pollutants in accordance with the CWA and ECL. If the NOI, and the prerequisite SWMP, do not constitute a permit application, then what other avenue does an MS4 have to secure permit coverage and authorization to lawfully discharge pollutants? The NOI and SWMP constitute an application in everything but name.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The DEC argues that the CWA and ECL public hearing requirements apply only to individual permit applications, and that public participation requirements are satisfied because the public has the opportunity to submit comments and request a public hearing regarding the General Permit itself. The EPA similarly argued in <em>Texas Ind. Producers &amp; Royalty Owners Assn. v Environmental Protection Agency </em>(410 F3d 964 [7th Cir 2005]). In that case, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the EPA that the CWA did not require the agency to provide a comment period or an opportunity to request a public hearing on NOIs and Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plans (SWPPP) submitted under the EPA\u2019s \u201cFinal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General Permit for Storm Water Discharges From Construction Activities.\u201d The court concluded that the CWA was ambiguous as to whether NOIs and SWPPPs are \u201cpermits\u201d or \u201cpermit applications,\u201d and in accordance with <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. </em>(467 US 837 [1984]) judicially deferred to the EPA\u2019s interpretation of those statutory terms <em>(see Texas Ind. Producers, </em>410 F3d at 978). The court accepted as reasonable EPA\u2019s argument that individual public hearings for NOIs and SWPPPs would eviscerate the administrative efficiency of the general permit scheme <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In contrast, in <em>EDC, </em>the Ninth Circuit had previously rejected the EPA\u2019s argument that the CWA public hearing opportunity requirement did not apply to NOIs because they are not \u201cpermits.\u201d Instead, the Ninth Circuit held that the \u201cNOI establishes what the discharger will do to reduce discharges to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the \u2018maximum extent practicable\u2019 \u201d and therefore is \u201cfunctionally equivalent to a detailed application for an individualized permit\u201d (344 F3d at 853).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The majority contends that the federal courts will have to resolve this \u201ccircuit split,\u201d and concludes that DEC\u2019s general permit scheme is permissible because it complies with the EPA\u2019s regulations and New York\u2019s law does not require more. I disagree because the majority\u2019s conclusion is unsupportable on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Notably, the EPA\u2019s position in both cases is counter to the EPA\u2019s own description in its stormwater regulations that a permit application is inclusive of \u201ca notice of intent for coverage under a general permit\u201d (40 CFR 122.34 [d] [1]). This inconsistency alone undermines the State\u2019s argument that the NOI is something other than a permit or permit application.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Additionally, the majority\u2019s \u201chands-off\u201d approach would leave this Court with no authority to consider the legality of state agency conduct. That is most certainly not the law, as made plain by this Court\u2019s administrative law jurisprudence <em>(see Seittelman v Sabol, </em>91 NY2d 618, 625 [1998] [invalidating state regulation that was \u201cinconsistent with the controlling Federal statute it was intended to implement\u201d]; <em>see also Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 451, 459 [1980] [the Court affords an agency <em>no </em>deference if its interpretive regulations \u201crun( ) counter to the clear wording of a statutory provision\u201d]; <em>Matter of Raritan Dev. Corp. v Silva, </em>91 NY2d 98, 100 [1997] [holding that \u201cwhen an (agency) interpretation is contrary to the plain meaning of the statutory language,\u201d the court may overrule and \u201cdecline( ) to enforce an agency\u2019s conflicting application thereof\u201d]; <em>Matter of New York Statewide Coalition of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce v New York City Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>23 NY3d 681 [2014] [striking down the New York City Board of Health\u2019s restriction on soda portions as exceeding its regulatory authority given by the legislature]).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, absent binding precedent from the United States Supreme Court, there is no legal impediment to this Court interpreting federal law <em>(see Flanagan v PrudentialBache Sec., </em>67 NY2d 500, 506 [1986] [\u201cWhen there is neither decision of the Supreme Court nor uniformity in the decisions of the lower Federal courts ... a State court required to interpret (a) Federal statute has the same responsibility as the lower Federal courts and is not precluded from exercising its own judgment\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We should reject DEC\u2019s argument because under the general permit scheme the NOI and SWMP replace an individual permit application. To adopt approvingly DEC\u2019s position, and EPA\u2019s argument in <em>Texas Ind. Producers, </em>fails to sufficiently interrogate the general permit regulatory scheme, or fully appreciate the role of the general public in the general permitting process. Moreover, the Court\u2019s conclusion that requiring public hearings for each individual NOI and SWPPP would be inconsistent with congressional intent is not supported by the language of the CWA. The stated purpose of that statute is to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation\u2019s waters, eliminate the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters, and ensure public participation in the development and implementation of any \u201cplan or program\u201d administered under the CWA by the states. While there may be administrative efficiencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>supporting the use of a general permit scheme, they do not outweigh the explicit objectives and goals of the CWA to protect the country\u2019s waters. In any event, because the EPA regulations allow for individual permits even where a general permit is in place, the efficiency argument propounded by the DEC and EPA is underwhelming <em>(see </em>40 CFR 122.28 [b] [3] [i]).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">What is actually counter to the intent of the CWA is to provide an opportunity to request a public hearing in cases involving individual permits, while denying the same under a statewide general permit scheme involving pollutant discharges from hundreds of MS4s. The latter potentially implicates the integrity of local water bodies more significantly than the actions of any single polluter, and therefore requires the type of public scrutiny and engagement envisioned by the CWA <em>(see </em>33 USC \u00a7 1342 [a] [1] [the EPA may issue a NPDES permit only \u201cafter opportunity for public hearing\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Therefore, DEC\u2019s determination that neither the CWA nor the ECL requires an opportunity for a public hearing on the NOIs and SWMPs, prior to DEC granting permit coverage, ignores the obvious purpose and role of these documents, and undermines the CWA\u2019s public participation requirement. As such, DEC\u2019s interpretation is not entitled to deference, and is, for the reasons I have stated, arbitrary and capricious. Therefore, the NOI and SWMP should be subject to statutory public participation requirements that include the opportunity to request a public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Accordingly, the 2010 General Permit does not provide for adequate review of NOIs or meaningful public participation in accordance with the CWA. Thus, I would modify the Appellate Division order to remit the Permit to DEC for compliance. I agree with the majority that petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit <em>(see </em>majority op at 397).</p>\n<judges id=\"b517-9\">Judges Pigott, Abdus-Salaam and Stein concur; Judge Rivera dissents in part in an opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman and Judge Fahey concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Order, insofar as appealed from, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-11\">.

However, whether the EPAhas taken a position at odds with what DEC now asserts is the correct and intended interpretation of the federal regulations is, of course, relevant to this Court\u2019s analysis of DEC\u2019s defense to petitioners\u2019 claims. Turning to the regulations, it is clear from the text of 40 CFR 122.34 (d) (1) that a small MS4\u2019s NOI is a general permit application.
