We agree with defendant\u2019s latter contention, and hold that Supreme Court erred by failing to order a mistrial or to strike the testimony. Accordingly, we reverse the Appellate Division order.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Defendant was charged with multiple counts of statutory and non-consensual rape and other sex crimes, for allegedly engaging in sexual activity with the 16-year-old complainant when he was 23 years old. Complainant testified that, on the day of the alleged sexual assault, she and defendant \u2014 who she knew through her ex-boyfriend \u2014 went to an apartment in Brooklyn sometime between 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. While they were watching a movie, defendant began to kiss and grope her and, despite her protests and attempts to resist, allegedly raped her twice. Based on complainant\u2019s testimony and cell phone records, the People claimed the alleged rapes occurred between 9:21 p.m. and 10:57 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">At a pretrial hearing, the People explicitly represented to the court and defense counsel that there would be no prompt outcry testimony, as complainant had not disclosed the sexual assault to anyone until at least six months after it allegedly happened. In response to the court\u2019s inquiry, defense counsel stated that \u201cthe People have said that there\u2019s no prompt outcry, so I think that takes care of that issue.\u201d The court ruled that the People could present expert testimony about rape trauma syndrome if defendant attempted to impeach complainant based on her delayed disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">In his opening statement to the jury, defense counsel \u2014 relying on the People\u2019s earlier representation \u2014 stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u201c[t]he complaining witness is going to tell you that she was on the phone that night more than once\u2014 her mother, her friends, different people. She was on the phone, had access to her phone, but she didn\u2019t call 911, she didn\u2019t tell any of the people she was on the phone with . . . You\u2019re going to hear about a long delay in her telling anybody about these accusations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">However, shortly thereafter, complainant testified on direct examination that she called a friend on her way home from the apartment that night, and \u201ctold her [friend] what happened . . . [but] didn\u2019t tell her the whole story\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t tell her [friend] that [she] didn\u2019t want [it] to happen.\u201d The People purposefully elicited this testimony and \u201cexpected\u201d the complainant to testify that she told her friend she had \u201cengaged in sexual intercourse\u201d with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Defense counsel objected and sought a mistrial or, alternatively, a ruling striking that portion of complainant\u2019s testimony regarding the alleged conversation with her friend on the night of the alleged sexual assault. Defense counsel argued that such testimony was prompt outcry evidence, which the People had represented would not be introduced at trial. According to defense counsel, complainant\u2019s testimony \u201ctotally change [d] [his] trial strategy\u201d as \u201cit would have changed voir dire, it would have changed [his] opening [statement].\u201d The People characterized the testimony as a partial disclosure, claimed that it \u201cc[a]me to light at the last minute,\u201d and argued that it did not prejudice defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The court concluded that the testimony described a prompt outcry,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but denied defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial and let the testimony stand, concluding that it was not \u201can unfair surprise that unduly prejudice[d] . . . defendant.\u201d The court reasoned that the testimony was not overly prejudicial because the jury could find that complainant was incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">When the trial resumed, complainant testified that she fully disclosed the sexual assault to her brother-in-law and two administrators from her school some six months after it allegedly occurred. The People then presented an expert witness, who explained the characteristics of rape trauma syndrome to the jury. More specifically, the expert testified that delayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>disclosure was a common response to sexual assault, as was disclosure to a trusted adult outside the nuclear family. The expert further explained that sex crime victims often make \u201cpartial disclosure [s]\u201d by minimizing or omitting the details of a sexual assault to \u201ctest[ ] the waters\u201d before fully disclosing the events. The People also introduced cell phone records, which confirmed that complainant spoke with her friend shortly after 11:00 p.m. on the evening of the alleged assault, consistent with complainant\u2019s testimony that she called the friend on her way home from the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Defense counsel attempted to discredit complainant, suggesting that she fabricated the allegations of rape after a dispute with defendant regarding her relationship with his cousin. Defense counsel focused on complainant\u2019s delayed disclosure, and impeached complainant with her grand jury testimony that she did not tell anyone about the alleged rapes that night. In addition, counsel introduced into evidence probation records tending to establish that probation officers conducted a home visit at defendant\u2019s apartment during the time the People alleged that the rapes had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">After the close of proof and summations, the jury found defendant guilty of two counts of rape in the third degree <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 130.25 [2]), criminal sexual act in the third degree <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 130.40 [2]), sexual abuse in the third degree <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 130.55), and endangering the welfare of a child <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 260.10 [1]). However, the jury acquitted defendant of the remaining crimes charged, which were based on a theory of lack of consent by reason other than age.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The Appellate Division affirmed, holding, in relevant part, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on complainant\u2019s prompt outcry testimony (107 AD3d 829 [2d Dept 2013]). A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal (22 NY3d 1141 [2014]), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Based on this record, the trial court abused its discretion when it denied defense counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial or to strike a portion of complainant\u2019s testimony. Undisputedly, complainant\u2019s testimony that she told her friend \u201cwhat happened\u201d conveyed to the jury that she had engaged in sexual intercourse with defendant that evening. Although this testimony was relevant, we have observed that relevancy, alone, does not render evidence admissible because \u201c \u2018it may be rejected if its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>probative value is outweighed by the danger that its admission would . . . unfairly surprise a party ... or create substantial danger of undue prejudice to one of the parties\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Davis, </em>43 NY2d 17, 27 [1977], <em>cert denied </em>435 US 998 [1978], quoting Jerome Prince, Richardson on Evidence \u00a7 147 at 117 [10th ed 1973]; <em>see People v Cortez, </em>22 NY3d 1061, 1079 [2014, Abdus-Salaam, J., concurring], <em>cert denied </em>574 US \u2014, 135 S Ct 146 [2014]).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Relying on the People\u2019s pretrial representation, defense counsel shaped his trial strategy \u2014 from voir dire to his opening statement \u2014 based on his founded belief that complainant did not disclose the alleged rapes until months after they occurred. Complainant\u2019s testimony that she disclosed her accusations against defendant \u2014 even partially \u2014 the same night as the alleged assaults, took defendant by surprise because it was inconsistent with the People\u2019s earlier position and with complainant\u2019s grand jury testimony. Despite the People\u2019s admission that they \u201cexpected\u201d complainant to testify in such a manner, the prosecutor inexplicably failed to convey this information to defense counsel. As a result, the surprise testimony eviscerated counsel\u2019s credibility with the jury and irreparably undermined his trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We are not persuaded that the resulting prejudice was insubstantial. Notably, complainant\u2019s cell phone records and the expert\u2019s testimony corroborated and explained the nature and timing of complainant\u2019s disclosure, thereby exacerbating the prejudice to defendant. The People claim that complainant\u2019s disclosure was not prejudicial because she failed to tell her friend that the alleged rapes were non-consensual. This claim is unavailing. To the contrary, although unknown to the trial judge at the time of his ruling, complainant\u2019s testimony later proved especially prejudicial to defendant because the jury convicted him of the age-based charges but acquitted him of the charges based on lack of consent for reasons other than age.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Under these circumstances \u2014 where the People failed to correct a prior representation to the court and defense counsel, where counsel was deprived of the opportunity to timely and meaningfully revise his trial strategy and emphasized the absence of any prompt outcry evidence during his opening statement, and where the error occurred early in the proceedings \u2014 the trial court abused its discretion by denying defendant a remedy for the unfair and prejudicial surprise <em>(see Davis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>43 NY2d at 27; <em>see also People v </em>Walker, 83 NY2d 455, 458 [1994]). In light of our conclusion, we need not reach defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Accordingly, the Appellate Division order should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-6\">Chief Judge Lippmajsf and Judges Read, Pigott, Rivera, Abdus-Sadaam and Fahey concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Order reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\"> On appeal, neither party disputes that the testimony did, in fact, amount to prompt outcry evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
