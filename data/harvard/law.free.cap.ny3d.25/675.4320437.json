We conclude that the agreement is unambiguous and \u201cfraudulent entry\u201d refers to unauthorized access into plaintiff\u2019s computer system, and not to content submitted by authorized users. Therefore, we affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Plaintiff, Universal American Corp. (Universal), is a health insurance company that offers, as relevant to this appeal, a choice of federal government-regulated alternatives to Medicare, known as \u201cMedicare Advantage Private Fee-For-Service\u201d plans (Medicare Advantage).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> These plans allow Medicare-eligible individuals to purchase health insurance from private insurance companies, and those companies are, in turn, eventually reimbursed by the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services\u2019 Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for health care services provided to the plans\u2019 members. Universal has a computerized billing system that allows health care providers to submit claims directly to the system. According to Universal, the great majority of claims submitted are processed, approved, and paid automatically, without manual review.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The matter before us involves Universal\u2019s demand for indemnification to cover losses resulting from health care claims for unprovided services, paid through Universal\u2019s computer system. At issue is the coverage available to Universal pursuant to rider No. 3 (rider) of a financial institution bond (bond), issued by defendant National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (National Union). The bond insured Universal against various losses, inclusive of certain losses resulting from dishonest and fraudulent acts. The rider amended the bond to provide indemnification specifically for computer systems fraud, and states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">\u201cCOMPUTER SYSTEMS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">\u201cIt is agreed that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\u201c1. the attached bond is amended by adding an Insuring Agreement as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">\u201cCOMPUTER SYSTEMS FRAUD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201cLoss resulting directly from a fraudulent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201c(1) entry of Electronic Data or Computer Program into, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">\u201c(2) change of Electronic Data or Computer Program within</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">\u201cthe Insured\u2019s proprietary Computer System . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-10\">\u201cprovided that the entry or change causes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-11\">\u201c(a) Property to be transferred, paid or delivered,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\">\u201c(b) an account of the insured, or of its customer, to be added, deleted, debited or credited, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-13\">\u201c(c) an unauthorized account or a fictitious account to be debited or credited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">The rider, and the basic bond coverage, carry a $10 million limit and a $250,000 deductible for each \u201csingle loss,\u201d which, as defined in the rider, includes \u201cthe fraudulent acts of one individual,\u201d or of \u201cunidentified individuals but arising from the same method of operation.\u201d Universal\u2019s annual premium during the relevant policy period was $170,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">A few months after obtaining coverage, Universal suffered over $18 million in losses for payment of fraudulent claims for services never actually performed under its Medicare Advantage plans. When Universal sought payment from National Union for its post-deductible losses, National Union denied coverage on the ground that the rider did not encompass losses for Medicare fraud, which National Union described as losses from payment for claims submitted by health care providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">Universal then commenced an action for damages and declaratory relief against National Union. Thereafter, Universal moved pursuant to CPLR 3212 for partial summary judgment, and an order declaring the losses to be covered under the policy. National Union cross-moved for summary judgment. Supreme Court denied Universal\u2019s motion, granted National Union\u2019s motion, and dismissed the complaint (38 Misc 3d 859 [Sup Ct, NY County 2013]), concluding that the rider is not ambiguous and does not extend to fraudulent claims entered into Universal\u2019s system by authorized users. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>determined, instead, that the intended coverage is for an unauthorized entry into the computer system by a hacker or through a computer virus.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The Appellate Division unanimously modified the summary judgment order, on the law, to declare the policy does not cover the loss, and otherwise affirmed. The Court concluded the unambiguous language of the policy does not cover fraudulent content entered by authorized users, but rather \u201cwrongful acts in manipulation of the computer system, i.e., by hackers\u201d (110 AD3d 434, 434 [1st Dept 2013]). We granted Universal leave to appeal (23 NY3d 904 [2014]), and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">An insurance agreement is subject to principles of contract interpretation. \u201cAs with the construction of contracts generally, \u2018unambiguous provisions of an insurance contract must be given their plain and ordinary meaning, and the interpretation of such provisions is a question of law for the court\u2019 \u201d <em>(Vigilant Ins. Co. v Bear Stearns Cos., Inc., </em>10 NY3d 170, 177 [2008], quoting <em>White v Continental Cas. Co., </em>9 NY3d 264, 267 [2007]). \u201cAmbiguity in a contract arises when the contract, read as a whole, fails to disclose its purpose and the parties\u2019 intent\u201d <em>(Ellington v EMI Music, Inc., </em>24 NY3d 239, 244 [2014], citing <em>Brooke Group v JCH Syndicate 488, </em>87 NY2d 530, 534 [1996]), or where its terms are subject to more than one reasonable interpretation <em>(see Dean v Tower Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>19 NY3d 704, 708 [2012], quoting <em>Seaboard Sur. Co. v Gillette Co., </em>64 NY2d 304, 311 [1984]; <em>Chimart Assoc. v Paul, </em>66 NY2d 570, 573 [1986] [ambiguity exists if \u201cthe agreement on its face is reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation\u201d]; <em>see also Greenfield v Philles Records, </em>98 NY2d 562, 569-570 [2002]). However, parties cannot create ambiguity from whole cloth where none exists, because provisions \u201care not ambiguous merely because the parties interpret them differently\u201d <em>(Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co. v Creative Hous., </em>88 NY2d 347, 352 [1996]). Rather, \u201cthe test to determine whether an insurance contract is ambiguous focuses on the reasonable expectations of the average insured upon reading the policy and employing common speech\u201d <em>(Matter of Mostow v State Farm Ins. Cos., </em>88 NY2d 321, 326-327 [1996] [citations omitted]; <em>see also Cragg v Allstate Indem. Corp., </em>17 NY3d 118, 122 [2011] [\u201cInsurance contracts must be interpreted according to common speech and consistent with the reasonable expectations of the average insured\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Turning to the language of the rider, we conclude that it unambiguously applies to losses incurred from unauthorized ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>cess to Universal\u2019s computer system, and not to losses resulting from fraudulent content submitted to the computer system by authorized users. The term \u201cfraudulent\u201d is not defined in the rider, but it refers to deceit and dishonesty <em>(see </em>Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary 464 [10th ed 1993]). While the rider also does not define the terms \u201centry\u201d and \u201cchange,\u201d the common definition of the former includes \u201cthe act of entering\u201d or \u201cthe right or privilege of entering,\u201d \u201caccess,\u201d and the latter means \u201cto make different,\u201d \u201calter\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 387, 190). In the rider, \u201cfraudulent\u201d modifies \u201centry\u201d or \u201cchange\u201d of electronic data or computer program, meaning it qualifies the act of entering or changing data or a computer program. Thus, the rider covers losses resulting from a dishonest entry or change of electronic data or computer program, constituting what the parties agree would be \u201chacking\u201d of the computer system. The rider\u2019s reference to \u201cfraudulent\u201d does not also qualify what is actually acted upon, namely the \u201celectronic data\u201d or \u201ccomputer program\u201d itself. The intentional word placement of \u201cfraudulent\u201d before \u201centry\u201d and \u201cchange\u201d manifests the parties\u2019 intent to provide coverage for a violation of the integrity of the computer system through deceitful and dishonest access.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Other language in the rider confirms that the rider seeks to address unauthorized access. First, the rider is captioned \u201cCOMPUTER SYSTEMS,\u201d and the specific language at issue is found under the subtitle \u201cCOMPUTER SYSTEMS FRAUD.\u201d These headings clarify that the rider\u2019s focus is on the computer system qua computer system. Second, under \u201cEXCLUSIONS,\u201d the rider exempts from coverage losses resulting directly or indirectly from fraudulent instruments \u201cwhich are used as source documentation in the preparation of Electronic Data or manually keyed into a data terminal.\u201d If the parties intended to cover fraudulent content, such as the billing fraud involved here, then there would be no reason to exclude fraudulent content contained in documents used to prepare electronic data, or manually keyed into a data terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Nonetheless, Universal argues that in the context of the rider, \u201cfraudulent entry\u201d means \u201cfraudulent input\u201d because a loss due to a fraudulent entry by necessity can only result from the input of fraudulent information. This would render superfluous the word \u201ca\u201d before \u201cfraudulent,\u201d and the word \u201cof\u201d before \u201celectronic data or computer program.\u201d Universal\u2019s proposed interpretation is easily achieved by providing coverage for a \u201closs resulting directly from fraudulent data.\u201d Of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>course, that is not what the rider says. Moreover, Universal\u2019s reading ignores the other language contained in the rider and its categorical application to \u201cComputer Systems\u201d and \u201cComputer Systems Fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">We are also unpersuaded by Universal\u2019s reliance on <em>Owens, Schine &amp; Nicola, P.C. v Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. of Am. </em>(2010 WL 4226958, *1, 2010 Conn Super LEXIS 2386, *1-3 [Sept. 20, 2010, No. CV095024601], <em>vacated </em>2012 WL 12246940, 2012 Conn Super LEXIS 5053 [Apr. 18, 2012] [memorandum of decision vacated by stipulation of the parties]), in support of its argument that the heading \u201cCOMPUTER SYSTEMS FRAUD\u201d can reasonably be interpreted to encompass fraud committed through a computer, meaning fraud that is not limited to computer hacking incidents. The <em>Owens </em>decision is of little assistance to Universal\u2019s cause. In <em>Owens, </em>the policy provision was far broader, and contained an internally applicable definition of \u201cComputer Fraud\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\u201c[t]he use of any computer to fraudulently cause a transfer of Money, Securities or Other Property from inside the Premises or Banking Premises:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201c1. to a person (other than a Messenger) outside the Premises or Banking Premises; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>to a place outside the Premises or Banking Premises\u201d (2010 WL 4226958, *4, 2010 Conn Super LEXIS 2386, *9-10).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">The insurer argued that \u201ccomputer fraud\u201d within the meaning of the policy required manipulation of the computer system, i.e., hacking. It further argued that there was no actual computer fraud because the use of emails and a computer to create a fraudulent check, as part of a scheme to steal funds from the insured, did not cause the physical transfer of money out of the insured\u2019s account. Instead, the loss resulted from the insured\u2019s wiring of the funds out of the account. The court found the phrase \u201cuse of any computer\u201d to be ambiguous as to \u201cthe amount of computer usage necessary to constitute computer fraud\u201d (2010 WL 4226958, *7, 2010 Conn Super LEXIS 2386, *19). Thus, <em>Owens </em>was concerned with whether the computer had been utilized sufficiently to constitute computer fraud as contemplated by the parties, based on their reasonable understanding of the policy\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">Here, it is undisputed that use of Universal\u2019s computer is absolutely essential to trigger coverage for a loss, and that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>computers were indeed used in a manner that resulted in payment of claims for health care services that were never provided. Thus, unlike in <em>Owens, </em>the question is not how much computer use is required under the policy, but whether the use involved here is the type actually covered by the rider.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">We conclude that the \u201creasonable expectations of the average insured upon reading the policy\u201d <em>(Mostow, </em>88 NY2d at 326-327) are that the rider applies to losses resulting directly from fraudulent access, not to losses from the content submitted by authorized users. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b775-6\">Judges Read, Pigott, Abdus-Salaam, Stein and Fahey concur; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</judges>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b770-11\"> Medicare, a hospital, medical, and prescription drug insurance program, is administered by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services within the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services <em>(see </em>42 USC \u00a7 1395 <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
