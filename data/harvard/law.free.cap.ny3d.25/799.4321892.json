Auto. Ins. Co. v Amato </em>(72 NY2d 288 [1988]), we squarely \u201ch[e]ld\u201d that \u201cInsurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) \u2014 providing that all \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 insurance policies must contain uninsured motorist coverage \u2014 has no application to police vehicles\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 295). Nonetheless, in this case, the Appellate Division deemed that holding inapplicable to supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorist (SUM) coverage mandated by Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2). Distinguishing <em>Amato </em>on its facts, the Appellate Division proceeded to define \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of statutorily required SUM coverage as inclusive of police vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">This was error. With respect to the statutory definition of the critical term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d there is no material distinction between the uninsured motorist coverage at issue in <em>Amato </em>and the disputed SUM coverage here, and the factual differences between this case and <em>Amato </em>do not compel a different result. Consequently, a police vehicle is not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d covered by a SUM endorsement under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) (A). Furthermore, to the extent there is any question of the continuing precedential force of <em>Amato </em>\u2014 and the parties here have not raised such a question \u2014 the language and legislative history of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420, as well as the doctrine of stare decisis, fully support our retention of <em>Amato </em>as binding precedent in this matter of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">While riding in a police vehicle driven by fellow Officer Michael Knauss, respondent Police Officer Patrick Fitzgerald was injured when the allegedly intoxicated driver of an underinsured vehicle struck the police car. At the time, Knauss maintained an automobile liability insurance policy issued by appellant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, and the policy included a SUM endorsement. In addition to covering Knauss as the named insured and his family, the SUM endorsement insured against injuries to \u201cany other person while occupying\u201d Knauss\u2019s personal vehicle or \u201cany other <em>motor vehicle </em>while being operated by [the named insured] or [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>named insured\u2019s] spouse\u201d (some emphasis added and some emphasis omitted). The policy did not define the term \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">On or before July 25, 2011, GEICO, the insurer for the underinsured motorist who had hit Knauss\u2019s car, tendered payment to Fitzgerald in the amount of $25,000, which was the limit of the underinsured motorist\u2019s policy. On August 18, 2011, based on the injuries he received while occupying Knauss\u2019s police vehicle during the accident, Fitzgerald made a demand upon State Farm for underinsured motorist arbitration under the SUM endorsement of Knauss\u2019s policy. State Farm refused to make any payment to Fitzgerald on the ground that he had occupied a police vehicle at the time of the accident, which was not a covered \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the SUM endorsement. State Farm then filed a petition to permanently stay arbitration based on the asserted unavailability of SUM benefits for Fitzgerald.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Supreme Court granted State Farm\u2019s petition to permanently stay arbitration. As relevant here, the court held that, although an individual who is the principal insured can receive benefits under <em>his or her own </em>insurance policy when he or she is in a police vehicle during an accident, that rule does not apply to an individual such as Fitzgerald, who seeks coverage under a SUM endorsement in <em>someone else\u2019s </em>insurance policy. Citing <em>Amato, </em>the court determined that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) (A), which controls the SUM endorsement in Knauss\u2019s policy, incorporates Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2)\u2019s definition of a covered \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d which specifically excludes police vehicles such as the one containing Fitzgerald at the time of the accident. Thus, the court concluded that Knauss\u2019s policy does not cover Fitzgerald, and it permanently stayed arbitration on Fitzgerald\u2019s claim for coverage. Fitzgerald appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">The Appellate Division unanimously reversed Supreme Court\u2019s order and denied the petition to permanently stay arbitration, holding that the police car in which Fitzgerald had been riding at the time of the accident constituted a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under the SUM endorsement in Knauss\u2019s automobile insurance policy <em>(see </em>112 AD3d 166, 167-170 [2d Dept 2013]). In that regard, since neither the SUM endorsement itself nor In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>surance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) defines the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d the Appellate Division looked to the provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law defining that term <em>(see id. </em>at 168). In that Court\u2019s view, since Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 sets forth the general definition of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to be used throughout the Vehicle and Traffic Law, that statute provides the most widely applicable definition of the term, which encompasses all motor-powered vehicles and includes police vehicles <em>(see id. </em>at 168-169). Thus, the Court opined, Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 \u201cshould be used to define the term \u2018motor vehicle,\u2019 as it appears in the uninsured/underinsured motorist endorsement,\u201d because \u201cVehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 is a general provision that defines the relevant terminology for the entire Vehicle and Traffic Law\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 169). Citing its prior decision in <em>Matter of Progressive Northeastern Ins. Co. v Scalamandre </em>(51 AD3d 932 [2d Dept 2008]) and the Fourth Department\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v Rondina </em>(32 AD3d 1230 [4th Dept 2006]), the Court said, \u201cAdditionally, it has been recognized that uninsured motorist coverage extends to all \u2018motor vehicles,\u2019 as defined by Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">The Court noted that Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2) defines the term \u201cvehicle\u201d for purposes of civil liability as \u201ca \u2018motor vehicle,\u2019 as defined in [Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125] . . . , except fire and police vehicles,\u201d but the Court found that definition inapplicable because Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2) does not feature the most common general definition of \u201cvehicle\u201d and defines the term \u201cvehicle\u201d rather than the critical term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d at issue here <em>(id. </em>at 168-169). The Court attempted to distinguish <em>Amato, </em>positing that, there, this Court decided only that New York City as a self-regulating insurer did not have to provide liability coverage for police vehicles under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) and (f) (1) because a police vehicle does not qualify as a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under those statutes, whereas here the issue is whether a separate statutory subsection, Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2), classifies a police car as a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d <em>(see id.). </em>Given that Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125\u2019s definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d applies to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) and encompasses police vehicles, the Court maintained, \u201cthe police vehicle at issue here falls within the definition of a \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 under the uninsured/underinsured motorist endorsement,\u201d and consequently, respondent was entitled to SUM benefits under the policy that State Farm issued to Knauss <em>(id. </em>at 170).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Upon State Farm\u2019s application, we granted a stay of the Appellate Division\u2019s order and leave to appeal (22 NY3d 1168 [2014]). We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Principles of Interpretation, Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 and <em>Amato</em></p>\n<p id=\"Apm\">Although provisions of an insurance policy drafted by the insurer are generally construed against the insurer if ambiguous <em>(see Dean v Tower Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>19 NY3d 704, 708 [2012]), a policy provision mandated by statute must be interpreted in a neutral manner consistently with the intent of the legislative and administrative sources of the legislation <em>(see Matter of Country-Wide Ins. Co. v Wagoner, 45 </em>NY2d 581, 586-587 [1978]). Since State Farm did not choose the terms of the SUM endorsement here of its own accord but, rather, was required to offer SUM coverage in compliance with the terms of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) (A) and Department of Insurance regulations <em>(see </em>11 NYCRR 60-2.3 [f]), we must interpret the SUM endorsement and the language of the statute in the manner intended by the neutral sources of that enactment <em>(see generally </em>Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1977, ch 892; <em>see also </em>Bill Jacket, L 1958, ch 759; Letter from Executive Secretary of NY Law Rev Commn to Governor\u2019s Counsel, Mar. 28, 1958, Bill Jacket, L 1958, ch 577).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 specifies the standard forms of coverage that must be included in a liability insurance policy. Subsection (e) requires automobile insurance policies to insure against civil liability for the negligence of those who drive the principal insured\u2019s car with his or her permission, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-8\">\u201cNo policy or contract of personal injury liability insurance or of property damage liability insurance, covering liability arising from the ownership, maintenance or operation <em>of any motor vehicle or of any vehicle as defined in section three hundred eighty-eight of the vehicle and traffic law, </em>or an aircraft, or any vessel as defined in section forty-eight of the navigation law, shall be issued or delivered in this state . . . unless it contains a provision insuring the named insured against liability for death or injury sustained . . . as a result of negligence in the operation or use of such vehicle, aircraft or vessel\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 [e] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Subsection (f) (1) mandates that automobile insurance policies feature uninsured motorist coverage, which covers liability arising from an accident involving the named insured and a motorist who has no applicable insurance coverage. Thus, subsection (f) (1) states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-4\">\u201c[n]o policy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any natural person arising out of the ownership, maintenance and use of a <em>motor vehicle </em>by the insured shall be issued or delivered . . . unless it contains a provision whereby the insurer agrees that it will pay to the insured, as defined in such provision . . .all sums . . . which the insured or his legal representative shall be entitled to recover as damages from an owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 [f] [1] [emphasis added].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Subsection (f) (2) (A) declares that \u201c[a]ny such policy shall, at the option of the insured, also provide supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists insurance for bodily injury,\u201d which is a species of uninsured motorist insurance that covers liability stemming from accidents involving the named insured and a motorist who possesses automotive insurance with limits or other restrictions that are inadequate to cover the full extent of the loss. The statute further states that SUM coverage is triggered \u201cif the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies of another motor vehicle liable for damages are in a lesser amount than the bodily injury liability insurance limits of coverage provided by such policy\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 [f] [2] [A]). Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) does not use the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d but because that subsection applies to \u201c[a]ny such policy,\u201d referring to a policy of the kind described in Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (1), Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) necessarily restricts SUM coverage to \u201cmotor vehicle[s]\u201d in the same manner as subsection (f) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">As noted, Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) and (\u00ed) (1) do not directly define \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in so many words, but Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) does refer to \u201ca[ ] motor vehicle or . . . a[ ] vehicle as defined in [Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2)].\u201d Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 is the sole provision of Vehicle and Traffic Law article 11, which governs civil liability for negligence in the operation of vehicles. Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2) states, \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018vehicle\u2019 means a \u2018motor vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>cle\u2019, as defined in [Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125], except fire and police vehicles,\u201d and certain other vehicles not relevant here. The Vehicle and Traffic Law also includes a definition of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125, which is part of the article defining terms of general use in the Vehicle and Traffic Law. Under that statute, \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d means \u201c[e]very vehicle operated or driven upon a public highway which is propelled by any power other than muscular power,\u201d with exceptions for all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles and mobility aids for the disabled (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125). Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 exempts police vehicles from registration requirements under title IV of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, but does not otherwise list any exclusion for police vehicles. Other provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and the Insurance Law also set forth definitions of the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d often exempting police vehicles (see Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 311 [2]; Insurance Law \u00a7 5202 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In <em>Amato, </em>this Court resolved two consolidated cases by specifying the types of vehicles that, when involved in an accident, can trigger uninsured motorist coverage under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f). In one case, Police Officer Amato had uninsured motorist coverage for his personal vehicle under a policy issued by State Farm <em>(see Amato, </em>72 NY2d at 291). The City insured any police vehicles used by Amato, but it did not provide uninsured motorist coverage under its policy <em>(see id. </em>at 290-291). While Amato was riding on his police scooter, he was struck by a stolen taxicab, which was not covered by the cab owner\u2019s insurance <em>(see id. </em>at 290). When Amato filed a claim with State Farm, State Farm petitioned for a permanent stay of arbitration under the policy, asserting that Amato had to look to the City for uninsured motorist coverage because the City was required by statute to provide such coverage <em>(see id. </em>at 291). Special Term denied the petition, reasoning that the City did not have to give Amato uninsured motorist coverage and that therefore State Farm was responsible for covering Amato\u2019s loss <em>(see id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">In the companion case, a motorist, who ultimately turned out not to have active insurance coverage, ran into the rear of Police Officer Rutherford\u2019s police car (see <em>id. </em>at 291). Rutherford filed a claim with State Farm, which, as in Amato\u2019s case, denied coverage, citing the City\u2019s status as the primary insurer and its supposed statutory obligation to provide uninsured motorist coverage for police vehicles (see <em>id. </em>at 292). In a consolidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>appeal in Amato\u2019s and Rutherford\u2019s cases, the Appellate Division reversed and held that the City had the primary obligation to grant uninsured motorist coverage to the officers pursuant to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) <em>(see id. </em>at 292; <em>Matter of State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v Amato, </em>129 AD2d 221, 225-227 [2d Dept 1987]).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">On further appeal, this Court reversed (72 NY2d 288, 290-292 [1988]). The Court began its opinion by describing the statutory provisions, such as Vehicle and Traffic Law articles 6 and 7, which reflect the legislature\u2019s desire to ensure that motorists have sufficient financial security to cover the consequences of an accident, and the Court explained that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) mandates the inclusion of uninsured motorist coverage in every automobile insurance policy issued in New York addressing the \u201cuse of a <em>motor vehicle </em>by the insured\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 292-293, quoting Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 [f]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The Court agreed with the Appellate Division that self-insurers, such as the City, \u201cgenerally have the same statutory responsibility as other insurers to provide uninsured motorist coverage,\u201d but it found that point irrelevant to the question at hand because no liability coverage existed at all, regardless of the insurer, if the liability does not arise from the use of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) <em>(id. </em>at 294). And, the Court determined, Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) excludes police vehicles from the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d for that statute cites Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2), which governs civil liability for negligence in the use of motor vehicles and explicitly excludes police vehicles from its scope <em>(see id.). </em>\u201cAlthough this exclusionary language is not repeated in the uninsured motorist provision of the Insurance Law (Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 [f]),\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cit would be illogical to assume that, while there is no legal obligation to insure police vehicles for death or bodily injury in the first instance, the City is nevertheless required to provide uninsured motorist coverage for its police vehicles\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Thus, the Court stated that, in light of the \u201cneed to interpret the statutes relating to uninsured motorist coverage as a whole and in a way consistent with their legislative purpose,\u201d \u201cwe hold that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) \u2014 providing that all \u2018motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>vehicle\u2019 insurance policies must contain uninsured motorist coverage \u2014 has no application to police vehicles\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 295). The Court further \u201ch[e]ld\u201d that \u201cthere is no such statutory obligation\u201d for the City, as an unregulated self-insurer, to insure police officers against injuries caused by an uninsured motorist hitting their police vehicles <em>(id. </em>at 290). Accordingly, the Court decided that the City had no statutory obligation to provide uninsured motorist coverage for Amato\u2019s and Rutherford\u2019s police vehicles <em>(see id. </em>at 290, 294). Two Judges dissented because, in their view, the legislature\u2019s failure to create an express exemption for police vehicles within the text of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) reflected a legislative intent to place all motor vehicles, including police vehicles, within the scope of statutory uninsured motorist coverage <em>(see id. </em>at 295-296 [Wachtler, Ch. J., dissenting]).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">With this legal background in mind, we turn to the arguments advanced by the parties here. In this case, State Farm and Fitzgerald agree that the disputed SUM endorsement\u2019s coverage of accidents involving a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d must use the same definition of that term employed by Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f), and Fitzgerald has not proceeded under any other statute, such as the No-Fault Law. However, the parties dispute whether that definition includes police vehicles like the one occupied by Fitzgerald.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">State Farm contends that, because Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) refers to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2)\u2019s definition of \u201cvehicle,\u201d which in turn incorporates Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125\u2019s definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and yet also excludes police vehicles, the closely related provisions of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) should be read to similarly define \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in accordance with Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2), thereby excluding police vehicles from SUM coverage. According to State Farm, <em>Amato </em>adopted this approach, as the <em>Amato </em>Court interpreted the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (1) to have the same meaning as it does in Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e), i.e., to exclude police vehicles. By logical extension, State Farm urges, \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d must mean the same thing under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) as it does in subsections (e) and (f) (1) because the statute must be interpreted as a cohesive whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">In response, Fitzgerald does not argue that <em>Amato </em>was wrongly decided or should be altered in any way, but instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>tries to parse that decision and the statutory text in a manner favorable to him. Fitzgerald asserts that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) must be read to incorporate the most common and generalized statutory meaning of the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d and that therefore one must look to the general definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 to define the same term in the insurance statute. Because Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 defines a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as essentially any powered vehicle, including a police vehicle, Fitzgerald posits that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) provides SUM coverage for accidents involving police vehicles via its inherent incorporation of the Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d In Fitzgerald\u2019s view, it does not matter that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) covers accidents arising from the operation \u201cof any motor vehicle <em>or </em>of any vehicle as defined in [Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2)]\u201d (emphasis added) because that statute only references Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2) to define the distinct term \u201cvehicle,\u201d and it does not define the separate term \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d That being so, Fitzgerald says, Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) does not adopt Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2)\u2019s exclusion of police vehicles from the definition of \u201cvehicle\u201d because Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) does not use the term \u201cvehicle\u201d at all, instead using the entirely different term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as defined in Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 to establish the breadth of its coverage. According to Fitzgerald, <em>Amato </em>is factually distinguishable because that case involved the liability of an unregulated self-insurer for uninsured motorist coverage under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (1), whereas the issue here is whether a private insurer must provide SUM coverage under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">The simple answer to Fitzgerald\u2019s claims, and hence to this whole case, is that <em>Amato </em>means what it says: \u201cInsurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) \u2014 providing that all \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 insurance policies must contain uninsured motorist coverage \u2014 has no application to police vehicles\u201d <em>(Amato, </em>72 NY2d at 295). Just as the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) generally, and paragraph (1) in particular, does not encompass police vehicles, that same term in paragraph (2) likewise does not bring police vehicles within its scope. Therefore, both uninsured motorist coverage under paragraph (1) and SUM coverage under paragraph (2) clearly exclude police vehicles in accordance with subsection (f) (l)\u2019s reference to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Indeed, as we have noted <em>post-Amato, </em>SUM coverage under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) is a subspecies of uninsured motorist coverage under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (1), and the reach of the two statutory subsections is essentially coterminous, except that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) covers accidents involving underinsured motorists and can provide for a higher limit on the amount of recovery <em>(see Raffellini v State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>9 NY3d 196, 204-205 [2007]). In light of the similarities between the two paragraphs of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f), the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d must have the same definition under those paragraphs and limit the benefits they provide in the same manner. Given that police vehicles do not fall within the ambit of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (\u00ed) (1) and (2), State Farm rightly declined to cover Fitzgerald, who was a passenger in a police vehicle at the time of the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Fitzgerald seeks to distinguish <em>Amato, </em>observing that <em>Amato </em>involved the priority of coverage to be provided by a self-insurer, the City of New York, and an automobile insurance company, State Farm. But, in <em>Amato, </em>we never suggested that we were limiting our holding to a self-insurer or to situations involving the priority or \u201cstacking\u201d of coverage. In fact, we specifically noted that, under prior precedent, \u201cself-insurers generally have the same statutory responsibility as other insurers to provide uninsured motorist coverage,\u201d and thus, our decision turned not on the City\u2019s status as a self-insurer but instead on the definition of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f), which we found to exclude police vehicles <em>(Amato, </em>72 NY2d at 294-295). Nor does it make sense to conclude that the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) means one thing when the priority of coverage must be determined and yet means something completely different when the scope of coverage is at issue. Surely, a term in a single undivided subsection of a statute \u2014 here subsection (f) (2) (A) \u2014 cannot have more than one definition depending on the facts of the case to which it is applied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Fitzgerald also points out that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) applies to a policy that covers any \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as well as any \u201cvehicle as defined in [Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2)],\u201d whereas Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) applies to a policy that covers only \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d without mentioning \u201cvehicles\u201d under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2). Fitzgerald takes this as proof that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f), unlike Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e), extends coverage to cases involving any \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as that term is defined in Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125, including police vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">But we essentially rejected that notion in <em>Amato. </em>There, we noted, as Fitzgerald does now, that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e)\u2019s \u201cexclusionary language\u201d and citation to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2) are \u201cnot repeated in the uninsured motorist provision of the Insurance Law (Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 [f])\u201d <em>{Amato, </em>72 NY2d at 294). Nonetheless, we determined that the legislature intended to carry the exclusion of police vehicles from Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) over to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) because \u201cit would be illogical to assume that, while there is no legal obligation to insure police vehicles for death or bodily injury in the first instance, the City is nevertheless required to provide uninsured motorist coverage for its police vehicles\u201d <em>{id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Even without the benefit of <em>Amato's </em>binding precedent, Fitzgerald\u2019s attempt to import Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125\u2019s definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d into Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f), but not into Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e), would make no sense. After all, Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) and (f) do not mention Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 at all, and as a result, there is no reason to suppose, as Fitzgerald does, that the legislature meant to incorporate Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125\u2019s broad definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d into either of those insurance statutes. Rather, the only Vehicle and Traffic Law provision cited by the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>statutes is Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2), which explicitly exempts police vehicles from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Accordingly, the legislature presumably meant to exclude police vehicles from coverage under the interrelated provisions of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e), (f) (1) and (2), and the SUM endorsement here necessarily features that same exclusion. For that reason, we have never looked to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 for guidance as to the meaning of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f), instead relying on the use of comparable terms in Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2) <em>(see Amato, </em>72 NY2d at 293-294) and the MVAIC Act (Insurance Law art 52) <em>(see Wagoner, </em>45 NY2d at 586-588).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">While Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cof any motor vehicle or of any vehicle as defined in [Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2)]\u201d may be confusing insofar as the terms are inherently conflicting in their scope under the Vehicle and Traffic Law, it appears that the legislature chose those words as an imprecise expression of its intent to incorporate Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2)\u2019s limitations into the relevant sections of the Insurance Law. Significantly, Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2)\u2019s definition of \u201cvehicle\u201d is narrower than that of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 in most respects. Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2) incorporates nearly all of the exclusions listed in Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 by defining \u201cvehicle\u201d as a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125, and adding extra exclusions for a variety of agricultural equipment, fire vehicles, police vehicles and onsite construction vehicles. Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2)\u2019s only additional inclusions are for trailers and for vehicles used on roads other than highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">As a result, a literal reading of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e)\u2019s reference to the negligent operation \u201cof any motor vehicle or of any vehicle as defined in [Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388]\u201d would be largely self-contradictory. It would suggest that the statute covers \u201c[e]very vehicle operated or driven upon a public highway which is propelled by any power other than muscular power,\u201d <em>including </em>police vehicles, agricultural vehicles and the like (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125), or, somewhat paradoxically, a motor vehicle, <em>excluding </em>police vehicles, agricultural vehicles, and onsite construction equipment, but including non-highway vehicles and trailers. Of course, had the legislature wished for the broader definition of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 to apply to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) and (f), it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>have easily referred to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 alone. And if the legislature was solely concerned about placing trailers and vehicles on non-public roads in the ambit of the insurance statute, it could have directly referred to those minor differences between the inclusions of the two Vehicle and Traffic Law statutes without citing Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2). Since the legislature did not refer to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 at all in drafting Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e), did not indicate a desire to define \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d without limitation in that section and directly cited the narrow provisions of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388, it plainly intended to narrow the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">Legislative History Supporting <em>Amato</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFJ\">The legislative history of these statutes buttresses our conclusion, as previously stated in <em>Amato, </em>that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) does not define \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to include police vehicles. In that regard, even at the time of the passage of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, the general definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in that statutory scheme excluded police vehicles, and the original civil liability provision of the Vehicle and Traffic Law imposed such liability only for the negligent operation of \u201cmotor vehicles,\u201d excluding police vehicles <em>(see </em>L 1936, ch 911, \u00a7 1; L 1929, ch 54 [enacting Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7\u00a7 2 (8); 59]; Letter from Commr of Highways, St Dept of Pub Works, to Governor\u2019s Counsel, Mar. 6, 1929, Bill Jacket, L 1929, ch 54 at 8; <em>see also </em>Arnold W. Wise, The History of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 62A at xv [1960 ed]). Hence, from its inception, the Vehicle and Traffic Law did not provide for civil liability arising out of the negligent operation of police vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>Later, when the legislature amended the predecessor to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420, it used language that paralleled the civil liability provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, and it used the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to define the scope of statutorily required automobile liability insurance, thereby presumably excluding police vehicles in a similar way <em>(see </em>L 1939, ch 882 [enacting Insurance Law \u00a7 167]). Accordingly, at the time the predecessors to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125, Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 and Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) were enacted, the relevant laws had these salient features: (1) the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in general excluded police vehicles; (2) statutory civil liability did not lie for the negligent use of police vehicles; and (3) insurers were not statutorily required to cover vicarious liability with respect to vehicles that were not \u201cmotor vehicles,\u201d which term was continued in the Insurance Law at a time when the only statute defining it, Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 2 (8), clearly excluded police vehicles <em>(see </em>L 1938, ch 183, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">When Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 was enacted, it did not contain the police vehicle exclusion in its definition of \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d but that was of no moment because Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 125 did not apply to the civil liability statute within the Vehicle and Traffic Law <em>(see </em>L 1957, ch 698 [adding Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7\u00a7 125, 100]). Likewise, after the predecessor to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 was amended to define the scope of civil liability based on the operation of \u201cvehicles\u201d rather than \u201cmotor vehicles,\u201d a 1958 bill ensured that it still referred to a section of the Vehicle and Traffic Law that incorporated the police vehicle exclusion, thereby maintaining that limitation <em>(see </em>L 1958, ch 577, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The same bill made a \u201cconformity amendment\u201d to the predecessor to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) to \u201cmake it clear that the term \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 as used in that section includes all vehicles as defined in section 59 [the predecessor to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388]\u201d (Recommendation of Law Rev Commn to Legislature, Bill Jacket, L 1958, ch 577 at 45). Maintaining the consistency between the predecessors to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 and Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e), the legislature added a citation to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388\u2019s predecessor and its terminology to define the coverage of the requisite liability insurance policy. To the existing clause of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e)\u2019s predecessor that said, \u201cNo policy or contract of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>injury liability insurance . . . covering liability arising from the ownership, maintenance or operation of any motor vehicle,\u201d the legislature appended the phrase \u201cor of any vehicle as defined in section fifty-nine of the vehicle and traffic law\u201d (L 1958, ch 577, \u00a7 3). As the Bar Association of the City of New York noted, this change was \u201ca source of confusion\u201d insofar as the terms \u201cvehicle\u201d and \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d were conflicting under the Vehicle and Traffic Law, but it was nonetheless \u201cunder-st[oo]d\u201d that \u201cthe intended application of Section 167(2) [the predecessor to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e)] [wa]s <em>only to the liability arising under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 59\u201d </em>(Mem of Assn of Bar of City of NY Common St Legis, Bill Jacket, L 1958, ch 577 at 19 [emphasis added]). The Law Revision Commission, which proposed the legislation, essentially confirmed this understanding of the reach of the predecessor to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) <em>(see </em>Recommendation of Law Rev Commn to Legislature, Bill Jacket, L 1958, ch 577 at 38-39). Therefore, in enacting the 1958 amendments to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 <em>388\u2019s </em>and Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e)\u2019s antecedents, the legislature adopted legislation meant to continue to exclude police vehicles from the ambit of the predecessor to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) <em>(see also </em>Mem of Assistant Director of Research of Law Rev Commn, Bill Jacket, L 1962, ch 825 at 19 [\u201csection 167(2) of the Insurance Law . . . now require(s) coverage of the insured\u2019s liability under section 388 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law,\u201d which was the successor to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 59 and still exempted police vehicles]).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">1958 also brought the advent of uninsured motorist coverage. The legislature sought to guarantee that all owners of covered vehicles had uninsured motorist coverage from one of two sources: (1) automobile insurance policies including that coverage; or (2) uninsured motorist benefits paid by the Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation to those who did not have such insurance <em>(see generally </em>L 1958, ch 759). Accordingly, the legislature crafted a new article 17-A of the Insurance Law, establishing MVAIC and directing it to process all claims for uninsured motorist benefits, regardless of whether the claims ultimately were to be paid by an insurance company or by MVAIC itself <em>(see id.). </em>Under that article, a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to which uninsured motorist benefits applied was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>inclusive of police vehicles <em>(see </em>L 1958, ch 759, \u00a7 2; <em>see also </em>former Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 2 [1958]).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The legislature also amended Insurance Law \u00a7 167 (2), the predecessor to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e), to compel insurers to add uninsured motorist endorsements to automobile insurance policies. The legislature placed the uninsured motorist provision in a new subsection (2-a) immediately following subsection (2) of Insurance Law \u00a7 167 <em>(see </em>L 1958, ch 759, \u00a7 4). Like its modern counterpart, Insurance Law \u00a7 167 (2-a) mandated that uninsured motorist coverage be contained in any \u201cpolicy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death . . . arising out of the ownership, maintenance and use of a <em>motor vehicle </em>by the insured,\u201d and that the policy had to establish that coverage either through the insurer itself or through MVAIC (L 1958, ch 759, \u00a7 4 [emphasis added]). Tellingly, although the statute did not define \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d it was placed immediately following Insurance Law \u00a7 167 (2) and its incorporation of a definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d that exempts police vehicles. Indeed, the legislature saw the relationship between these two statutory subsections as quite close, for Insurance Law \u00a7 167 (2-a) was meant to fill what were simply \u201cloopholes\u201d (Sponsor\u2019s Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1958, ch 759 at 6) or \u201cgaps\u201d (Governor\u2019s Open Letter to Legislature, Bill Jacket, L 1958, ch 759 at 11) in the compulsory insurance statutes and Insurance Law \u00a7 167 (2), merely adding an uninsured motorist subdivision as an appendage to the existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Along those lines, uninsured motorist endorsements under Insurance Law \u00a7 167 (2-a) were also intended to extend the same coverage as the MVAIC statute, and nothing more, because the statutory uninsured motorist endorsements and MVAIC were regarded as related \u201cprong[s]\u201d of the same \u201cat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>tack\u201d on the problem of uninsured motorists (Mem of Supt, St Ins Dept, Bill Jacket, L 1958, ch 759 at 23; <em>see also McCarthy v Motor Veh. Acc. Indent. Corp., </em>16 AD2d 35, 38-42 [4th Dept 1962] [\u201cThe MVAIC Law was not designed to supplement the insurance coverage of insured automobiles or to protect injured persons against risks which were not covered by the standard automobile liability policies\u201d because \u201c(t)hey are, and under the scheme of the statute, they must be, coextensive,\u201d and certain terms in policies under Insurance Law \u00a7 167 (2-a) must be given the same meaning as under the MVAIC Law], <em>affd </em>12 NY2d 922 [1963]; <em>Moffitt v Moffitt, </em>46 AD2d 944, 945 [3d Dept 1974] [in the context of uninsured motorist accident, \u201cMVAIC coverage is coextensive with that of a standard policy and article 17-A of the Insurance Law does not supplement the coverage of insured automobiles or protect insured persons against risks not covered by a standard policy\u201d]). So it was that, in <em>Wagoner </em>(45 NY2d 581), we looked to the definitions section of the MVAIC Law as authority for the proposition that a \u201cmotorcycle\u201d was a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under Insurance Law \u00a7 167 (2-a), which was section 3420 (f)\u2019s predecessor, because it was defined as such for purposes of the MVAIC Law <em>(see id. </em>at 586-588). This suggests that, just as MVAIC did not generally define a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as inclusive of police vehicles, the uninsured motorist statute likewise removed police vehicles from the ambit of that term. And, the state of affairs remained the same following the passage of the legislation that rearranged and renumbered portions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law into its modern configuration <em>(see </em>L 1959, ch 775 [adding Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7\u00a7 125, 125-a, 388 (2)]; L 1960, ch 608, \u00a7 4; L 1967, ch 139, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">SUM coverage became compulsory in 1977 via an amendment to Insurance Law \u00a7 167 (2-a). This combined uninsured motorist/SUM coverage statute retained the original language of the uninsured motorist provision and added within that same undivided subsection the following: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>As we have recognized, these statutory SUM benefits were \u201cdesigned to give insureds the same level of protection that would have been available to others under the policy if the insureds were the tortfeasors who caused personal injuries,\u201d and the legislature first addressed SUM coverage and general uninsured motorist coverage in the same statutory section because \u201cboth paragraphs of section 167 (2-a) related to uninsured motorist benefits and supplementary coverage was framed as an extension of the mandatory coverage outlined in the first paragraph\u201d (Raffellini, 9 NY3d at 204-205). Therefore, SUM coverage was an extension of uninsured motorist coverage that generally applied in the same situations, just with different policy limits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>\u201cAny such policy shall, at the option of the insured, also provide supplementary uninsured motorists insurance for bodily injury, in an amount up to the bodily injury liability insurance limits of coverage provided under such policy, subject to a maximum of [$100,000 due to bodily injury or death per accident].\u201d (L 1977, ch 892, \u00a7 3.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Finally, in 1984, the Insurance Law was renumbered in its entirety, resulting in the transfer of the old SUM, uninsured motorist and general liability coverage provisions into new Insurance Law \u00a7 3420. As a result, the requirements of general liability insurance policies are now outlined in Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e), uninsured motorist coverage requirements can be found in Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (1), and SUM coverage provisions are in Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) (A) (see L 1984, ch 367). Despite the separation of the uninsured motorist and SUM measures into distinct subsections (f) (1) and (f) (2), \u201c[t]his recodification was not meant to effect a substantive change in the law \u2014 certainly, there is no reason to conclude that the Legislature split the two paragraphs into separate subsections to create a distinction between the two types of coverages that did not already exist\u201d (Raffellini, 9 NY3d at 205; <em>see </em>Letter from Supt of Ins to Governor\u2019s Counsel, July 13, 1984, Bill Jacket, L 1984, ch 367 at 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">When <em>Amato </em>arrived in this Court, the law stood as follows: New York had traditionally exempted police vehicles from statutes dealing with civil liability under the Vehicle and Traffic Law; the legislature had long bound the Vehicle and Traffic Law civil liability statute and the predecessors to Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) together, making their coverage coextensive; the legislature had also created essentially coterminous MVAIC and uninsured motorist statutes, the former of which defined \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to exclude police vehicles; the legislature had expressed a desire to maintain consistency in the scope of coverage of general automobile liability insurance and uninsured motorist coverage; and statutory uninsured motorist coverage and SUM coverage gave rise to matching benefits and limitations, such that if one excluded police vehicles, the other logically did so as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Against this backdrop, the <em>Amato </em>Court had every reason to conclude that, because the liability insurance provision of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) had traditionally dovetailed with the coverage of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 and its predecessors, Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) employed the phrase \u201cof a motor vehicle or of a vehicle as defined in [Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388]\u201d as an imprecise way of incorporating the limitations of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 into Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e). In other words, Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e) used Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388 (2) to redefine \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as exempting police vehicles from the automobile insurance sections of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420. Given that the uninsured motorist and SUM coverage sections of Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 had originated as outgrowths designed to simply fill the uninsured or underinsured motorist \u201cgaps\u201d in the compulsory insurance statute and Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e), rather than to expand the class of covered vehicles, the Court rightly decided that Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (1) and (2) logically applied to the limited category of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d referenced in Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (e), thus also excluding police vehicles. Since SUM coverage under Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) was just a variant of uninsured coverage under subsection (f) (1) of the same statute, the Court appropriately found that SUM coverage was likewise limited to non-police vehicles. Accordingly, the <em>Amato </em>Court properly interpreted Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) in a manner fully consistent with the legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">Stare Decisis and Developments <em>Post-Amato</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Even if we were to disagree with our holding in <em>Amato, </em>we would nonetheless be bound to follow it under the doctrine of stare decisis. \u201c \u2018Stare decisis is the doctrine which holds that common-law decisions should stand as precedents for guidance in cases arising in the future\u2019 and that a rule of law \u2018once decided by a court, will generally be followed in subsequent cases presenting the same legal problem\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Peque, </em>22 NY3d 168, 194 [2013], quoting <em>People v Damiano, </em>87 NY2d 477, 488 [1996, Simons, J., concurring]). Even under the most flexible version of the doctrine applicable to constitutional jurisprudence, prior decisions should not be overruled unless a \u201ccompelling justification\u201d exists for such a drastic step <em>(People v Lopez, </em>16 NY3d 375, 384 n 5 [2011]; <em>see People v Silva, </em>24 NY3d 294, 300 [2014]). As we recently reiterated, an even more extraordinary and compelling justification is needed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>overturn precedents involving statutory interpretation, such as <em>Amato, </em>because unlike in constitutional cases, \u201cif the precedent or precedents have misinterpreted the legislative intention [embodied in a statute], the Legislature\u2019s competency to correct the misinterpretation is readily at hand\u201d <em>(Palladino v CNY Centro, Inc., </em>23 NY3d 140, 151 [2014] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). Indeed, in <em>Palladino, </em>we upheld a statutory interpretation precedent that we found to be riddled with shortcomings both at the time it had been decided and thereafter. While we openly \u201cquestion [ed] \u201d the \u201cutility or wisdom\u201d of that precedent, we nonetheless followed it <em>(id. </em>at 150; <em>see also id. </em>at 147-150).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Here, Fitzgerald does not so much as ask us to overturn <em>Amato, </em>much less advance any compelling justification for disturbing that precedent. Nor do we find it appropriate to discard <em>Amato </em>on our own initiative, as there is no evidence that it has become unworkable, is unjust or has created an irreconcilable conflict in our case law. Certainly, legislative developments since our decision in <em>Amato </em>have not cast doubt on its validity, for the legislature has repeatedly amended Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 after <em>Amato </em>without making any effort to undo that decision <em>(see </em>L 2013, ch 11, \u00a7 1; L 2012, ch 496, \u00a7 1; L 2008, ch 388, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6; L 2002, ch 584, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2; L 1997, ch 568, \u00a7 1; L 1997, ch 547, \u00a7 2; L 1995, ch 305, \u00a7 1; L 1994, ch 425, \u00a7 2; <em>see generally </em>Bill Jacket, L 2013, ch 11; Bill Jacket, L 2012, ch 496; Bill Jacket, L 2008, ch 388; Bill Jacket, L 2002, ch 584; Bill Jacket, L 1997, ch 547; Bill Jacket, L 1995, ch 305). This is true even with respect to the specific amendments altering the limits of SUM coverage, and even at times when the legislature made efforts to overturn other pertinent judicial decisions with which it disagreed <em>(see </em>L 2012, ch 496, \u00a7 1; L 1997, ch 568, \u00a7 1; L 1997, ch 547, \u00a7 2; <em>see e.g. </em>Sponsor\u2019s Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1997, ch 547 at 6-7 [seeking to expedite disclosure of coverage of SUM policies in response to Appellate Division case law strictly construing timing requirements for filing of SUM claims, and also citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Maurizzio v Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(73 NY2d 951 [1989])]; Mem of NY Law Rev Commn, Bill Jacket, L 2002, ch 584 at 9 [calling legislature\u2019s attention to need for amendment to overrule <em>Black v Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(274 AD2d 346 [1st Dept 2000])]).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Therefore, stare decisis compels retention <em>o\u00ed Amato. </em>Because there is no basis for distinguishing that case from the one before us, Fitzgerald\u2019s status as a passenger of a police vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>at the time of the accident dooms his claim under <em>Amato </em>and Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">An unbroken line of historical practice, legislative history, statutory text and precedent establishes that a SUM endorsement prescribed by Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) (2) (A) exempts police vehicles from its definition of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d absent a specific provision to the contrary in a given SUM endorsement. Since there is no contrary provision in the SUM endorsement here, it does not cover liability for injuries arising from the use of a police vehicle of the sort occupied by Fitzgerald during his accident. While Fitzgerald may pursue the available remedies, if any, under the No-Fault Law, a lawsuit or any insurance policy he has purchased for himself, he cannot recover under the SUM endorsement of Knauss\u2019s policy, and the Appellate Division erred in overturning the stay of arbitration under that policy. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the petition for a permanent stay of arbitration granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\">. The record does not disclose whether Fitzgerald had automobile insurance or liability insurance at the time of the accident. In his motion papers and correspondence with State Farm, Fitzgerald did not discuss his own insurance status, and he did not claim to be uninsured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b899-7\">. At the time of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Amato, </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f) had already been divided into paragraphs (1) and (2) (see L 1984, ch 367), though the Court did not distinguish between those two paragraphs for purposes of its analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b902-6\">. The dissent opines that we should direct State Farm to extend coverage to Fitzgerald because, in <em>Amato, </em>we noted that the officers there could receive SUM coverage under their own insurance policies <em>(see </em>dissenting op at 822). But that aspect of <em>Amato </em>is of no help to Fitzgerald. In <em>Amato, </em>we commented that the officers could not receive Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation (MVAIC) benefits because they were designated \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d of the particular \u201cuninsured motorist indorsement contained in their respective policies with State Farm\u201d <em>(Amato, </em>72 NY2d at 293 n 1). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>other words, the officers in <em>Amato </em>could still receive uninsured motorist benefits because, presumably, they were <em>named insureds </em>under State Farm\u2019s policy, and State Farm extended uninsured motorist coverage to them regardless of the type of vehicle they occupied. In fact, here, Officer Knauss was covered for the same reason: the SUM indorsement expressly identified him as a named insured entitled to such coverage under any circumstances. By contrast, Fitzgerald was not a named insured under Knauss\u2019s policy, and hence he could not receive coverage on the same grounds that Knauss or the officers in <em>Amato </em>could. Rather, Fitzgerald could only qualify for SUM coverage under the statutorily required SUM clause in Knauss\u2019s policy, which limited coverage to occupants of statutory \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d As we have explained, Fitzgerald was not occupying a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d at the time of his accident, and he was not entitled to SUM coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b905-5\">. When confronted with another phrase in this statute joined by a similarly perplexing coordinating conjunction, we have previously declined to construe the phrase literally to create an expansion of coverage not otherwise clearly contemplated by the legislature (see <em>Matter of Allstate Ins. Co. v Li-bow, </em>65 NY2d 807, 809 [1985] [affirming \u201cfor the reasons stated in the opinion\u201d of the Appellate Division, which refused to interpret literally a clause in former Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 (f), which requires payment of \u201call sums, not exceeding a maximum amount or limit of ten thousand dollars exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to <em>and </em>all sums, not exceeding a maximum amount or limit of fifty thousand dollars exclusive of interest and costs, on account of death of one person, in any one accident\u201d because the literal reading would have permitted the unintended aggregation of certain claims under that statute]; <em>see also Matter of Allstate Ins. Co. v Libow, </em>106 AD2d 110, 116-118 [2d Dept 1984]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\">. Today, the MVAIC statute still defines \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201cexcluding] fire and police vehicles\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 5202 [a]). The <em>Amato </em>Court stated that \u201cthe uninsured occupant of a police vehicle may file a claim with the MVAIC for injuries sustained in an accident caused by an uninsured motor vehicle,\u201d but that \u201cpolice vehicles are exempted from the provisions of the MVAIC statute to the extent that otherwise eligible claimants are barred from filing a claim for injuries <em>caused by </em>the negligent operation of a police vehicle\u201d <em>(Amato, </em>72 NY2d at 294 n 2). Thus, the Court seems to have found that, although a police vehicle is not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under the MVAIC Law, it can still be involved in an actionable \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d under that statutory scheme (Insurance Law \u00a7 5208 [a] [1]), as long as its operation is not the cause of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b913-6\">Pigott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXa\">(dissenting). The issue in this case is simple: whether plaintiff can recover from State Farm, the carrier that issued a SUM endorsement to Knauss\u2019s personal motor vehicle insurance policy. Plaintiff, a person injured while occupying a motor vehicle driven by Knauss, is entitled to recover under the SUM endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">In <em>Matter of State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v Amato </em>(72 NY2d 288 [1988]), this Court was asked to decide whether the City of New York, as an unregulated self-insurer, was statutorily required to provide uninsured motorist coverage to two of its police officers who were injured when their police vehicles were struck by uninsured motor vehicles <em>{Amato, </em>72 NY2d at 294). The officers each filed uninsured motorist claims with State Farm, their insurance carrier, to recover for their personal injuries <em>(see id.). </em>When State Farm denied their claims, both officers sought to arbitrate their uninsured motorist claims, and, in both cases, State Farm petitioned to stay the arbitration <em>(see id.). </em>State Farm argued that it was not obligated to provide uninsured motorist coverage because the City of New York, \u201cas owner of the host vehicle, had the primary obligation to provide uninsured motorist coverage\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 292 [internal quotation marks omitted]). This Court rejected that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>contention, holding that, as an unregulated self-insurer, the City was not statutorily required to provide uninsured motorist coverage to its officers <em>(id. </em>at 290). The <em>Amato </em>Court recognized nonetheless that the officers may make a claim against <em>their own uninsured motorist policy (id. </em>at 293 n 1; <em>see also Williams v City of New York, </em>144 AB2d 553 [2d Dept 1988] [finding that while the City had no obligation to provide uninsured motorist benefits to the police officer plaintiff, she was entitled to summary judgment against the insurer of her personal vehicle]).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Here, plaintiff is not seeking uninsured motorist coverage from the City, as it is settled under <em>Amato </em>that the City has no obligation to provide the plaintiff with uninsured motorist benefits. It therefore follows, as in our prior precedent, that plaintiff is entitled to coverage under the Knauss\u2019s SUM endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The legislature intended to make compensation available in cases in which insured persons suffer automobile accident injuries at the hands of financially irresponsible motorists. As this Court recognized in <em>Amato, </em>\u201c[The] Legislature has specifically declared its grave concern that motorists who use the public highways be financially responsible to ensure that innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents be recompensed for their injuries and losses\u201d <em>(Amato, </em>72 NY2d 288, 292, citing <em>Matter of Allstate Ins. Co. v Shaw, 52 </em>NY2d 818, 819 [1980]). Under the majority\u2019s holding, plaintiff is left without uninsured motorist coverage altogether. Clearly, neither the legislature nor this Court would ever intend such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">For these reasons, I dissent and would affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<judges id=\"b914-8\">Judges Read, Stein and Gonzalez<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concur; Judge Pigott dissents and votes to affirm in an opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman and Judge Fahey concur; Judge Rivera taking no part.</judges>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Order reversed, with costs, and petition for a permanent stay of arbitration granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
