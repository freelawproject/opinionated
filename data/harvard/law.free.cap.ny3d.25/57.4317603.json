On April 6, 2007, the People applied to County Court to have defendant adjudicated a persistent felony offender, pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.10. Subdivision (1) of this provision defines a \u201cpersistent felony offender\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-15\">\u201c(a) ... a person, other than a persistent violent felony offender . . . , who stands convicted of a felony after having previously been convicted of two or more felonies, as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subdivision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u201c(b) A previous felony conviction within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this subdivision is a conviction of a felony in this state, or of <em>a crime in any other jurisdiction, </em>provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">\u201c(i) that a sentence to a term of imprisonment in excess of one year . . . was imposed therefor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201c(ii) that the defendant was imprisoned under sentence for such conviction prior to the commission of the present felony; . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201c(c) For the purpose of determining whether a person has two or more previous felony convictions, two or more convictions of crimes that were committed prior to the time the defendant was imprisoned under sentence for any of such convictions shall be deemed to be only one conviction\u201d (emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u201cthe [1994 and 1995] state court convictions at issue may only be counted as one pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.10(l)(c) (since defendant was not imprisoned for the first crime [s] until after he had committed the second), the earlier federal convictions stand separate and apart from the state convictions and are unaffected by this statutory provision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>In support of their application to County Court, the People relied on three sets of defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions. First, on March 14, 1991, defendant was convicted in the Federal District Court for the Middle District of Florida of two federal felonies \u2014 making a false statement on a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms form (18 USC \u00a7 924 [a]), and being a convicted felon possessing a firearm <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 922 [g]). Neither federal crime has a New York counterpart. Second, on January 3, 1994, defendant was convicted in New York of the felony of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 220.06). And third, on March 17, 1995, defendant was convicted in New York of three more felonies: second-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 220.41) and third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 220.16 [two counts]).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">After two days of hearings in July 2007, County Court issued a decision and order on September 4, 2007, finding that defendant was a persistent felony offender and concluding that a recidivist sentence was warranted by virtue of his \u201chistory and character . . . and the nature and circumstances of his criminal conduct\u201d <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 70.10 [2]; <em>see also </em>CPL 400.20 [9]). As relevant to his finding that defendant had previously been convicted of the \u201ctwo or more\u201d felonies required to qualify as a persistent felony offender (Penal Law \u00a7 70.10 [1] [a]), the Judge observed that although defendant correctly contended that</p>\n<p id=\"AhL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>County Court sentenced defendant to two concurrent indeterminate terms of incarceration of 15 years to life for his forgery crimes. On February 14, 2014, the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence (114 AD3d 1239 [4th Dept 2014], <em>lv denied </em>23 NY3d 1038 [2014]).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Meanwhile, prior to the disposition of his direct appeal, defendant moved pro se in July 2009 for an order pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside his sentence as \u201cunconstitutional, unauthorized, illegally imposed and invalid as a matter of law since the two federal felony convictions . . . relied upon . . . do not have equivalent elements to crimes under New York State Law.\u201d Defendant contended that County Court impermissibly \u201cdetermine [d] that [he] was a persistent felony offender instead of a second felony offender and sentenced him accordingly in violation of his due process rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">County Court denied defendant\u2019s CPL 440.20 motion by order dated August 26, 2009; on November 30, 2009, a Justice of the Appellate Division granted defendant permission to appeal to that Court; and in September 2013, the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed County Court\u2019s order (109 AD3d 1108 [4th Dept 2013]). The Court noted that defendant \u201cprimarily relie [d] upon cases interpreting the second felony offender statute [Penal Law \u00a7 70.06],\u201d which \u2014 unlike Penal Law \u00a7 70.10\u2014 specifies that a predicate conviction \u201c \u2018must have been in [New York] of a felony, <em>or in any other jurisdiction of an offense for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment in excess of one year . . . was authorized and is authorized in [New York] irrespective of whether such sentence was imposed,\u2019 \u201d (id. </em>at 1110 [some emphasis added and some emphasis omitted], quoting Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [1] [b] [i]). By contrast, the persistent felony offender statute \u201ccontains no language requiring that the underlying out-of-state conviction be for a crime that would constitute a felony in New York\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The Appellate Division also pointed out that \u201cthe legislative history of the persistent felony offender statute reflects that the drafters specifically considered and rejected the contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>advanced by defendant\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1111, citing <em>Griffin v Mann, </em>156 F3d 288, 291 [2d Cir 1998]). Additionally, the Court declined to follow Third Department cases relied upon by defendant, noting that they \u201ctrace [d] back\u201d to <em>People v Morton </em>(48 AD2d 58 [3d Dept 1975]), which was \u201ceffectively overruled\u201d by us in <em>People v Parker </em>(41 NY2d 21 [1976]) (109 AD3d at 1111, 1112). A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal (22 NY3d 1157 [2014]), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">New York\u2019s persistent felony offender statute, by its plain terms, does not require that, in order to classify someone as a persistent felony offender, an out-of-state predicate felony must have a New York counterpart. Section 70.10\u2019s silence with regard to New York equivalency is dispositive. As the Second Circuit explained in <em>Griffin, </em>when holding that section 70.10 was rational as applied to the defendant in that case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">\u201c[s]ection 70.10(l)(b) does not distinguish among felony convictions that arise under federal, New York State, or out-of-state law. <em>Thus, if the acts constitute a felony under federal or another state\u2019s law, they will be deemed a felony for purposes of persistent offender status under [sjection 70.10 even if there is no counterpart felony in New York law\u201d </em>(156 F3d at 290 [emphasis added]; <em>see also People v Ortiz, </em>283 AD2d 256, 256 [1st Dept 2001], <em>lv denied </em>96 NY2d 922 [2001]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Further, section 70.10\u2019s legislative history shows that the New York equivalency test, as construed in <em>People v Olah </em>(300 NY 96 [1949]), was \u201cexplicitly considered and rejected at the time of [section 70.10\u2019s] enactment\u201d <em>(Griffin, </em>156 F3d at 291; <em>see also </em>109 AD3d at 1111, quoting Staff Notes of Temp St Commn on Rev of Penal Law and Crim Code, 1964 Proposed NY Penal Law [Study Bill, 1964 Senate Intro 3918, Assembly Intro 5376] \u00a7 30.10 at 285). Accordingly, like the Appellate Division, we refuse to adopt defendant\u2019s proposed construction of Penal Law \u00a7 70.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Finally, defendant\u2019s facial constitutional challenge to Penal Law \u00a7 70.10 is unpreserved, and his as-applied constitutional challenge lacks merit. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-10\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Pigott, Rivera, AbdusSalaam and Stein concur; Judge Fahey taking no part.</judges>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
