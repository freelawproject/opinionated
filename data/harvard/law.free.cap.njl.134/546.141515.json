The Commissioner brought suit, joining both drivers and the respective owners. Nonsuits were denied. Both defendants then rested without adducing any evidence, and moved for \u201cdirected verdicts\u201d on the same grounds as those urged on motion to nonsuit. The court then said: \u201cI feel that under the presumptions allowed under the law I am in a different position now than I was at the resting of the state\u2019s case and I will grant the motions of the defendants for the direction of verdicts of no cause of action in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff, the State of New Jersey.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then took an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">We conclude that there was legal error in that ruling. It is true, of course, that there was no jury, and that the judge was therefore a trier of the facts. If, as such trier, he had found for the defendant, on the evidence before him, that probably would have ended the matter: but the \u201cdirection of a verdict\u201d even though there was no jury, amounted to an adjudication that there was no evidence in the case to inculpate the operator of either automobile. There was such evidence, however; and consequently the plaintiff was entitled to have it considered. <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Goerke Kirch Co., </em>92 <em>N. J. L. </em>424, citing <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Benecke, </em>82 <em>Id. </em>445.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Those considerations lead to a reversal and trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
