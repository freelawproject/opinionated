Defendant is and has been during all the times concerned in this controversy a corporation of the State of West Virginia, having a license to do business in the State of New Jersey and having a place of business in New Jersey, namely a manufacturing plant, at 970 New Brunswick Avenue, Rah-way, New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-14\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Petitioner is the duly authorized, certified and recognized collective bargaining agent of the production and maintenance employees of the defendant at its Rahway, New Jersey, manufacturing plant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-15\"><em>\u201c3. </em>On the 30th day of October, 1945, Petitioner and Defendant entered into a collective bargaining agreement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>effect up to August 1st, 1946, relating to rates of pay, wages, hours of work, and other conditions of employment governing the Defendant\u2019s aforesaid employees, * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">\u201c4. Section 21, sub-sections (b) and (c) of said collective bargaining agreement provide as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">\u201c\u2018(b) The Company agrees to increase the rate of each employee and of all rate ranges by the sum of five cents (5c) per hour on October 1st, 1945; by a further sum of five cents (5c) per hour on December 1st, 1945; and by a further sum of five cents (5c) per hour on Eebruary 1st, 1946.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">\u201c \u2018(c) Subject to the conditions and limitations hereinafter set forth, the Company agrees to increase the rate of each employee and of all rate ranges by a further sum of five cents (5c) per hour on April 1st, 1946, and by a further sum of five cents (5e) per hour on June 1st, 1946.

Section 53 and Section 54 o\u00a3 said collective bargaining agreement provide as follows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201c <em>\u2018Section 53. Grievances</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201c\u2018(a) It is mutually agreed that the prompt settlement, disposition and adjustment of all disputes, disagreements, complaints and grievances is desirable in the interest of sound relations between the Union and the Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\u2018\u201c(b) The differences, disputes, complaints and grievances that may arise between the Union and the Company shall be taken up as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201c\u2018(1) Between the aggrieved employee and the department Steward on the one hand, and the department- supervisor on the other.

It is agreed that they will continue to work at their assigned jobs at all times except when they leave their work to investigate or handle grievances or requests for reclassification, as the case may be, as provided herein. This privilege shall exist only to the extent that it is necessary for the above-enumerated Union representatives to carry out their duties under the grievance procedrire herein set forth; it being specifically understood that the activities of departmental Stewards on the day shift shall be confined to their own respective departments except in carrying out their duties under the second step of the grievance procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\"><em>\u201c \u2018(e) </em>The Union officers, Stewards, committeemen and representatives shall be governed by plant rules regarding employees entering or leaving the plant.

A decision of the Board shall be complied with within five (o) days after the decision is rendered.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201c9. On the 17th day of June, 1946, Petitioner, served Notice of Arbitration upon the Defendant by mailing to the Defendant a letter dated June 17th, 1946, a copy of which letter is annexed hereto, made part of this stipulation and marked \u2018Schedule C.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201c10. On or about June 19th, 1946, Petitioner, through its attorney, received a letter dated June 18th, 1946, from Defendant, copy of which is annexed hereto, made a part of this stipulation, and marked \u2018Schedule D.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u201c11. Defendant took the position that the wage question involved was not subject to arbitration within the terms of the collective bargaining agreement by a letter dated June 24th, 1946, from defendant\u2019s attorneys, duly authorized to act in the premises, to Petitioner, through its attorneys, copy of which is hereto annexed, made a part of this stipulation and marked \u2018Schedule E.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>The defendant takes the position that the wage question was not subject to arbitration within the terms of the contract and that the court i's powerless in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In support of its position, I am referred to the following case: <em>In re Buffalo and Erie Railway Co., </em>250 <em>N. Y. </em>275; 165 <em>N. E. Rep. </em>291. The principle of this case was approved in the following Few York cases: <em>In re Amsterdam Dispatch, Inc., et al., </em>4 <em>N. Y. S. (2d) </em>908 (Sup. Ct., App. Div., 1st Dept., 1938); <em>affirmed, per curiam, sub nom. Amsterdam Dispatch </em>v. <em>Devery, </em>278 <em>N. Y. </em>688; 16 <em>N. E. Rep. (2d) </em>403 (1938). These cases must rest on the facts established. The general principles enunciated are in no sense contrary to the views hereinafter expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">It is apparent from the stipulation in this case that there was a wage dispute. It is also apparent from sections 53 and 54 of the elective bargaining agreement that all disputes, disagreements, complaints and grievances are'subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">I can find in the agreement itself no clause which in any way limits the arbitration of disputes, disagreements and grievances. It is a well known fact that most labor disputes arise because of a disagreement as to wages. It is not desirable that where the parties have agreed otherwise that the sole remedy be a strike rather than arbitration as intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The contract in question, section 31, subsection c, provides for an increase upon certain conditions which did not occur. The company, therefore, gave notice to reopen the question. Since the Local and the company were unable to settle the wage question, the Local sought arbitration. The company\u2019s answer was that the wage question was not subject to arbitration. From a broad reading of the contract, T fail to see why not. The purpose desired in labor contracts is that disputes, as the contract in question expressly provides, shall be promptly settled in the interest of a continuance of sound relations between the Union and the company. If the contract so provides, as it does in this case, it is not the function of the court to so construe it so as to defeat the intention of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Under section 21 of the contract, renegotiations may be with the company and the Union. If such renegotiations fail, as they did in the present instance, the logical thing to do is to turn to section 53 and section 54 of the contract. If there was any doubt as to the correctness of this view, section 55, as follows, confirms the Union\u2019s position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">\n<em>\u201cSection So. Strikes, Slow-Downs, Lockouts</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-XM\">\u201cSince it is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that the procedures herein shall serve as a means for peaceable settlement of all differences, disputes, complaints and grievances that may arise between them, it is agreed that the Union shall not authorize nor participate in any strike or slow-down and the Company agrees that there shall be no lockouts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The relief sought will be granted and an appropriate order may be submitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
