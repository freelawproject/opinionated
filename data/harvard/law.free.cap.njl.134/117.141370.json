ANNIE COHEN ET VIR., APPELLANTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b165-7\">Submitted January 15, 1946</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aye\">Decided March 21, 1946.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b165-10\">Before Justices Parker, Bobine and Oijptiant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-11\">For the appellants, <em>Joseph H. Blumberg </em>and <em>Irving I. Jacobs.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-12\">For the respondent, <em>Albert C. Abbott.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b165-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b165-14\">Botone, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZZ\">The defendants appeal from a judgment entered on a directed verdict in favor of the plaintiff in a suit by the vendee for the recovery of a down payment made in pursuance of a written contract for the purchase of land and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the building thereon erected situate in,Atlantic City, New Jersey. The contract provided, so far as pertinent, as follows: \u201c4. The title to be delivered shall be a marketable title and . shall be free and clear of all encumbrances including municipal liens and assessments and liability for assessments for improvements now constructed * *</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The action has its origin in <em>R. S. </em>2:45-1 which provides for the recovery of deposit money, with interest and costs, and the reasonable expense of examining title and making survey when the vendor under a contract to sell real estate is unable to carry out the contract because of a <em>defect in the title. </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The proofs disclose that after a survey was made it appeared (1) that the bottom step leading to a porch above a store encroached 1% inches upon Kentucky Avenue; and (2) that the fourth story eaves encroached about six inches upon an adjoining property, the eaves extending for a distance of about fifty feet. The overhang was of wood and galvanized construction. It, like the encroachment upon the street, was easy to remove and at a very slight expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The errors assigned are: 1, refusal to nonsuit the plaintiff; 2, error in directing a verdict in his favor, and 3, error in rejecting the offer to establish by competent witnesses the cost of removing the encroachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The encroachments did not affect the title in any way. <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>Taub, </em>3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>216; <em>affirmed, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>472. There is nothing in the record to show unmarketability of the title and a nonsuit should have been granted. <em>Scheinman </em>v. <em>Bloch, </em>97 <em>Id. </em>404; <em>affirmed, </em>98 <em>Id. </em>571.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Since there was no defect in title shown, the judgment below must be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
