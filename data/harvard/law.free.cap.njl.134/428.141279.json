The lands cover about 165 acres. The main building is situate about one-half mile from the main (Somerville) road, at the side of a mountain, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>heavily wooded spot. It was constructed by prosecutor\u2019s predecessors in title along the lines of a European castle at a cost of between $80,000 and $95,000. It is built of stone primarily, with walls approximately two feet thick. The central portion of the building is of Norman architecture and the wings are designed to reproduce Elizabeth ian additions to an old castle. The building has a heavy slate roof and oak trim on the outside. It contains sixteen high and spacious rooms, the floors of which are of hardwood or flagstone and the walls are all insulated. The building is located in a sparsely settled section of the township. There is clear ground for about 50 feet around the building, woods surrounding three sides thereof and the fourth side overlooks open country. There are about a dozen buildings on the entire three mile length of the Somerville Road from the township boundary line and its connection with the Liberty Corner-Eox Hill Road. The first building from the prosecutor\u2019s building to the southwest is about a mile and four-tenths; the first building to the northeast from the prosecutor\u2019s building is about a mile and two-tenths therefrom; and the nearest building situate on the opposite side of the road from the prosecutor\u2019s building is about six-tenths of a mile therefrom. The many photographs submitted emphasize the beauty and splendor of the <em>sil,us </em>and the interior and exterior of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">- To the end of using the stated building as a non-sectarian private boarding school to accommodate about thirty boys between the ages of six and fourteen years, prosecutor obtained the approval of our State Commissioner of Education, and arranged for a teaching staff of educators of high standing and repute.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In this background, prosecutor, on July 12th, 1945, made application to the building inspector of the township for a certificate of occupancy to use the described building for the \u2022aforestated purposes. The application was denied. That denial was obviously based upon the ground that prosecutor\u2019s premises were located in a residence A zone under the township zoning ordinance,'adopted December 22d, 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">On appeal to the Board of Adjustment of the township, that body, after hearing on public notice, concluded \u2014 in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the fact that but one objector appeared and his premises were not within a radius of 200 feet from the premises in question, and in light of all the other proofs \u2014 that, in their opinion, \u201cthe establishment of the school would render a service to the community and would not injuriously affect the rights of adjoining property owners nor be contrary to the public interest.\u201d Based on that conclusion, it recommended to the governing body of the township that a \u201cspecial exception\u201d be granted to permit prosecutor to establish a nonsectarian boarding school for boys as requested by him. <em>Cf. R. S. </em>40:55-39.d.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">On appeal to the governing body of the township, that body, without notice of hearing <em>(Cf. Sandler </em>v. <em>Trenton, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>392, 395; 19 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>788) disapproved the recommendation of the Board of Adjustment. Prosecutor was allowed a writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We think that the disapproval by the governing body of the recommendation made by -the Board of Adjustment is not tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The uses to which the premises are limited in the \u201cEesidential A\u201d zone are, among others, \u201cfarming or agriculture,\u201d and \u201cchurch, chapel or other place of divine worship including (a) * * * school * * * owned or leased and</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">conducted by such church.\u201d Under the permissive uses of farming or agriculture, the premises may concededly be legally used for, among other things, the raising of chickens and pigs, and may, of course, be legally used as a school by a church. But the same premises may not be legally used to conduct a non-sectarian private boarding school for the education of boys, about thirty in number, between the ages of six and fourteen years. The provisions of an ordinance which compel such a conclusion are indeed foreign, to say the least, to our democratic concept of the dignity of man, and of his personal and property rights. A regulation compelling such a conclusion was never contemplated by the Zoning Act. It bears no reasonable relation to the powers conferred by that act. <em>R. S. </em>40:55-30, <em>et seq. Cf. Brookdale Homes, Inc., </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>602, 604; 10 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>477; <em>affirmed, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>516; 19 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>868. It does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>not come within the exceptions to the general rule of law that there is no power in a municipality to limit or regulate the use to which property may be put. For here the limitations resulting in the denial of the prosecutor\u2019s application for a certificate of occupancy bear no substantial relation to the public health, public morals, the public safety or the general welfare in their proper sense, or to any of the other considerations embraced in the statute. <em>R. S. </em>40 :55 \u2014 32. See cases collated in the opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Brookdale Homes, Inc., </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>(at <em>pp. </em>604, 605).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Thus the dismissal of the recommendation of the Board of Adjustment by the governing body was, in the circumstances, an arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious exercise of power. <em>Cf. Bianchi </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>258, 260; 11 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>405. It lacks the requisites of \u201csound discretion, governed by law.\u201d <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Then, </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>413, 416; 177 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>87; <em>LaBell </em>v. <em>Quasdorf, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>368, 372; 177 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>77. It is indeed pregnant with the fatal attributes of \u201cshock to reason and to justice.\u201d <em>Cf. Nelson </em>v. <em>Eastern Air Lines, Inc., </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>46, 58; 21 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>371; <em>Chiesa </em>v. <em>Public Service Co-ordinated Transport, </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>69, 72; 24 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>369. It denies prosecutor\u2019s fundamental rights under the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution and of article I, paragraph 1 of our state constitution. <em>Brookdale Homes, Inc., </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>(123 <em>N. J. L.), </em>and cases collated at <em>pp. </em>604, 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Prosecutor is entitled to a certificate of occupancy. The action of the governing body of the township is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
