The shingles which struck him weighed about ten pounds and were blown about eight feet before they struck him. He sat on the roof after being struck until he was helped down, about four-thirty, and driven to his home where he had to be assisted to the house. He reported for work on April 6th but was sent home.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">There was medical testimony that he died of traumatic coronary occlusion and that the blow from the shingles was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the proximate cause of his death.
