S. </em>31:15-7, <em>et seq. </em>It presents for decision the question as to whether the heart injury suffered by the employee was the result of an accident which arose out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>In the Bureau, Deputy Commissioner Medinets answered the posed question in the affirmative. He based his answer upon the holding by our Court of Errors and Appeals in the cases of <em>Molnar </em>v. <em>American Smelting and Refining Co., </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>11; 24 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>392, and <em>Hentz </em>v. <em>Janssen Dairy Corp., </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>494; 6 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>409.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">On appeal to the Essex County Court of Common Pleas, Judge Elannagan gave the same answer as that which was given in the Bureau and affirmed the judgment of the Bureau in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">On the employer\u2019s application for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>Mr. Justice Parker ordered that the application be made before this court <em>en banc. </em>Counsel at the argument of this cause before us agreed, subject to our approval, that if we concluded to allow the writ that the cause be determined on the record as now submitted. We allow the writ and decide the cause accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Succinctly stated, prosecutor contends that respondent did .not expend any unusual effort or exertion and therefore he suffered no \u201caccident\u201d within the statutory meaning of that term. It makes a sharp distinction between a heart condition which it characterizes as <em>coronary insufficiency </em>and <em>coronary thrombosis. </em>It asserts that respondent suffers from the latter. It concedes that the former may be brought on by exertion or effort because such exertion or effort \u201cconsumes the reserve supply of blood and makes impossible the proper functioning of the myocardium;\u201d whereas the latter, coronary thrombosis, \u201censues from a sclerotic condition of the coronary artery and needs no precipient other than time to cause disability or death.\u201d Prosecutor argues that it is the failure to have recognized this asserted distinction which led the lower tribunals to their erroneous conclusions just as it assertedly led the Court of Errors and Appeals in erroneously deciding the Molnar and Hentz cases. Eespondent, on the other hand, contends that he suffered a compensable accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Our independent finding of the facts and determination of the applicable law <em>(Owens </em>v. <em>Bennett Air Service, </em>133 <em>N. J. L. </em>540), discloses that there is no substantial dispute as to the facts save as to those which relate to the opinions of the medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>cal experts for the respective parties and which form the basis for the stated distinction upon which prosecutor disclaims liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Our independent findings are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Respondent, Peter M. Dalton, petitioner below, forty-eight years of age, had been employed as a route salesman for the past seventeen years, prior to Ms claimed accident, by the prosecutor hero, Consolidated Laundries Corporation, at its Lackawanna Division. During that entire period the respondent neither knew of nor gave indication of any heart trouble. Nor is there any proof that he otherwise suffered any serious physical ailment during his entire period of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">His work consisted of making deliveries oE clean towels and linens to stores, offices and barber shops operated by prosecutor\u2019s customers and picking up the soiled linens and of collecting bills from those customers. He was obliged to, and did, load and unload the truck operated and used at the beginning and end of each working day.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">On the morning of September 14th, 1943, respondent reported for work about 7 :00 A. 11. He removed fifteen bags of towels from his bin because they did not belong there. He then loaded his truck with supplies for his day\u2019s work and drove away to make his usual rounds. He returned to the plant about 5:00 p. m., and unloaded the soiled linens collected, consisting of about fifteen bags, each weighing about 335 pounds, on the Summer Avenue side of the laundry. Each bag was lifted on to a hand truck, about six feet high and three feet wide. This unloading took about fifteen minutes. After this he drove the truck to the High Street side of the laundry and unloaded some clean linens which he had in the truck, and promptly commenced to load the truck with linens for the following day\u2019s deliveries. The linens were in a hand truck, inside the laundry building, similar to the one in which he had unloaded the soiled linens, and this hand truck and linens weighed about 300 to 350 pounds. He pushed the hand truck about two feet towards the loading platform when he suffered a terrific pain in the Center of his chest, the back of his neck became very cold and he had difficulty in breathing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>got blue in color and felt \u201cas if [he] was going to die.\u201d He went outside the building to get some air and laid down .on the truck. The pain became worse while lying down and he asked the supervisor to help him inside the building. He was assisted and when he got to the third and top step leading into the building, he vomited and became unconscious. He recovered consciousness in the toilet room of the laundry where he found some of his co-workers removing the vomit and effects of an involuntary defecation. A doctor was called who gave him an injection and caused him to be removed to St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, where he remained about four weeks. Thereafter he was admitted to the Veterans Hospital in the Bronx, Hew York, where he remained for five weeks. Upon discharge from the Veterans Hospital, he was taken home where he has remained ever since. He is unable to work because, as he states, any exertion or excitement brings on pain across his chest, pain under his arms, and he \u201cjust stiffens up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The medical testimony is in dispute. Drs. Block, Kaufman and Oleott testified for the respondent. Dr. Block, a general practitioner, first saw the respondent on Hovember 19th, 1942, after he came out of the hospital. Thereafter the doctor saw the respondent eleven times between Hovember 19th, 1942, and January 5th, 1943, and again saw him on two other occasions, May 19th, 1943, and September 28th, 1943. The respondent was treated for the \u201cclinical appearance of coronary thrombosis\u201d which in the doctor\u2019s opinion was \u201cdue to the work he [respondent] was doing,\u201d and it was due to the \u201cexertion\u201d of his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Dr. Kaufman, a specialist in internal medicine and cardiology, first examined the respondent at his home on December 9th, 1942. The doctor made a thorough examination of respondent and took an electrocardiograph. The doctor diagnosed the respondent\u2019s ailment as \u201cposterior wall infarction as the result of coronary thrombosis.\u201d Another examination was made on May 20th, 1943, another cardiograph was taken and respondent was fieuroscoped. Finding respondent\u2019s condition somewhat better as compared with his condition when first examined, the doctor conducted an \u201cexercise test\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>consisted of the respondent bending over and touching the ground twenty times. On the seventeenth time respondent became \u201cdyspneie, began to cough, his forehead became ashen gray in color, he began to perspire freely,\u201d and respondent had to stop. This doctor was of the opinion that respondent was suffering from \u201carterio-sclerosis involving the coronary vessels,\u201d that in September of 1942, respondent had a \u201cclosure of the vessel which affects the posterior wall of the heart,\u201d as a \u201cresult\u201d of which \u201che had an infarction of the myocardium.\u201d The doctor \u201cbelieved\u201d that there was a causal relationship between the exertion of respondent\u2019s work on September 14th, 1942, and the attack which he suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Dr. Olcott, a specialist in pathology and internal medicine, examined respondent at his home on January 6th, 1944. \"lie examined the electro-cardiograms and concluded that respondent suffered \u201can infarction of the posterior wall\u201d of his heart, and that there was a \u201cdirect causal relationship between the exertion [respondent] was undergoing on September 14th, 1942, and the infarction and the resulting disability.\u201d The exertion referred to was the \u201cpushing of the loaded truck.\u201d This doctor did not know, and thus would not commit himself as to whether respondent had a coronary thrombosis or a coronary insufficiency. Whether respondent had one or the other could, in the doctor\u2019s opinion, be only definitely determined by an autopsy. Here respondent\u2019s attack was not fatal. The doctor, however, said that the \u201cimportant thing\u201d is not whether respondent had either a \u201ccoronary thrombosis\u201d or a \u201ccoronary insufficiency\u201d but rather the \u201cimportant thing\u201d is that respondent had an \u201cinfarction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Dr. Eishberg and Dr. Eehikson testified for prosecutor. Dr. Eishberg, a specialist in internal medicine with particular reference to diseases of the circulation and kidneys, examined respondent on February 2d, 1943. In addition thereto the doctor also took an electro-cardiograph of respondent and reviewed his hospital records and examined the electrocardiographs of the other physicians. This doctor concluded that respondent suffered a \u201ccoronary thrombosis of his right artery\u201d on September 14th, 1942. This specialist shared the opinion that heart insufficiency is \u201cdefinitely caused\u201d by effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>or exertion, or over effort or over exertion, but in coronary thrombosis such exertion or effort \u201cplays no demonstrable role;\u201d .Thus he concluded that there was \u201cno connection between the labor carried out\u201d (by respondent) on that day (September 14th, 1942) and the occurrence of \u201ccoronary thrombosis\u201d which in his opinion respondent suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Dr. Echikson, a specialist in internal medicine, examined respondent on October 28th, 1943. He took an electrocardiograph of respondent, and examined those taken of respondent. As a result the doctor concluded that respondent had suffered a \u201cposterior coronary thrombosis,\u201d and that there was no causal connection between the \u201ceffort\u201d that respondent was \u201cexerting\u201d on September 14th, 1942, and the attack of coronary thrombosis. In this doctor\u2019s judgment coronary thrombosis could not be caused by effort but coronary insufficiency could.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The differences in the medical testimony lie in the frankly conceded fact that prosecutor\u2019s experts share the view of others in their profession, that neither effort nor exertion, nor trauma is causally related to coronary thrombosis, while other experts as those for respondent entertain a contrary view. The views of prosecutor\u2019s experts, as we have had occasion to observe^ ignores the construction which we have given to the meaning of a compensable accident under our statute. <em>Cf. Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Von Volkum, </em>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>83, 85; 34 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>897; <em>affirmed, </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>344; 40 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>572; <em>Breheny </em>v. <em>County of Essex, </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>584, 588; 41 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>890; <em>affirmed, </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>129; 45 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>700.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Our careful study of all the proofs, the legitimate inferences to be drawn therefrom, and the preponderance of probabilities according to the common experience of mankind <em>(Gilbert </em>v. <em>Gilbert Machine Works, Inc., </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>533, 535; 6 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>213; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hasbrouck Heights Building and Loan Association, </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>569, 574; 41 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>898), leads us to'the factual finding that respondent suffered a compensable accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The undisputed facts are that the work which respondent was doing, at the time he suffered a heart attack, was in line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>with his usual work; that he had not suffered a prior heart attack during his entire period of employment; and that his attack occurred after a full day\u2019s work, and within about five minutes after he had finished unloading the soiled linens from the truck which unloading lasted about fifteen minutes. Under such circumstances, it is clear that there was a causal relationship between respondent\u2019s work and the attack suffered. We so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">We see nothing in principle which distinguishes the case at bar from the cases criticised (Molnar and Hentz) by prosecutor and which are, of course, binding upon us. <em>Cf. Fraser </em>v. <em>State Board of Education et al., </em>133 <em>N. J. L. </em>597. Nor is the case at bar controlled by the holding in the case of <em>Schlegel </em>v. <em>H. Baron &amp; Co., </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>611; 34 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>132. In that case the majority in the Supreme Court were not impressed by the proofs adduced by and for petitioner in support of his version as to how the accident happened and, therefore, concluded that he had failed to establish his asserted claim to compensation. No such issue is here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">One thing is absolutely clear. It is that respondent had a weakened heart whether it was due to coronary insufficiency or to arterio-selerosis of the coronary artery. Thus when, as here, the effort, exertion or strain, irrespective of its degree <em>(Molnar </em>v. <em>American Smelting and Refining Co., supra), </em>incident to the work respondent was doing precipitated the \u201cinfarction,\u201d he suffered a compensable accident, one which arose out of and in the course of his employment within the meaning of our statute and decisions. <em>Bernstein Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>500; 177 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>533; <em>affirmed, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>500; 180 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>832; <em>Hentz </em>v. <em>Janssen Dairy Corp., supra; Molnar </em>v. <em>American Smelting and Refining Co., supra; Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Von Volkum, supra; Breheny </em>v. <em>County of Essex, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
