Laird.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b651-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b651-12\">Bodine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aty\">In the present case, a workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding, the cause had been remanded by Judge Richard Hartshorne of the Essex Pleas to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau with respect to certain of the petitioners named in the claim petition. There was no final judgment but a mere remand to the Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">Obviously the order was in all respects proper. <em>Hawthorne </em>v. <em>Van </em>Keuren, 121 <em>N. J. L. </em>501. There should be no review in this court except on a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">During the trial in the Bureau, the petitioner recalled its witness one Smolski, and the following occurred: <em>\u201cQ. </em>Now, Mr. Smolski, I am going to show you a <em>picture-A. </em>(Interrupting) Yes. <em>Q. </em>I am going to ask you whether you recognize it. (Handed to,the witness.) Mr. Hubley: I will ask that the witness be instructed to answer, yes or no, your</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Honor. The witness: That\u2019s right. <em>Q. </em>Yes or no? <em>A. </em>Yes, sir. <em>Q. </em>What does that picture show? <em>A. </em>This is the drier that Metro got killed. Mr. Scherling: I offer the photograph in evidence. Mr. Hubley: Does the date appear when that picture was taken ? Mr. Scherling: No. Mr. Hubley: I object if it please the court. <em>Q. </em>Does this photograph show the place where Metro died? <em>A. </em>Eight here (indicating). Mr. Hubley: Just a minute-\u2022 <em>Q. </em>(Interrupting) And does it show the conditions as they existed at that time? Mr. Hubley: Just a minute. I object to the question, if it please the court, as leading. The court: It is leading. The witness: Eight there (indicating). Mr. Hubley: This is not a proper way to identify it. Mr. Scherling: There are certain questions which I think are fundamentally leading when you ask them. I asked him whether or not the photograph taken at that time was a photograph of the room, and he said, yes. <em>Q. </em>Is that the way the room looked at that time? <em>A. </em>That\u2019s right. <em>Q. </em>Yes or no? <em>A. </em>That\u2019s right. Mr. Scherling: I offer the photograph in evidence. Mr. Hubley: I object. There has been no offer made as to when the picture was taken. Counsel is apparently a little shy about when it was taken. Mr. Scherling: It was taken immediately after. I don\u2019t want to testify, but it was taken the next day-by the police department of the City of Newark. Mr. Hubley: It was taken the next day ? Mr. Scherling: That\u2019s right. Mr. Hubley : I object, if it please the court. The court: I will sustain the objection. That is not the way to prove it. Mr. Scherling: I submit, if it please the court, as I understand the law in this state; photographs can be identified by the person who took it, if available, or some'person who can testify as to the authenticity of the photograph at the time the circumstances occurred, and I submit most respectfully that this photograph does show the conditions that existed at the time, and as testified to by this witness. The Court: I will sustain the objection. Mr. Scherling: I pray an exception. One more question.\u201d Obviously, the ruling was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The purpose of the question was to show the appearance of the place where the man was killed. The witness was a foreman; he found the dead man\u2019s body. The exclusion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>pertinent testimony (the photograph of the place.where the accident occurred), which was most material upon the question whether the death occurred by accident in the course of the. employment, was error. There was no justification for such ruling. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fox, 25 N. J. L. </em>566, 602; <em>Wigm. Ev. (3d ed.), </em>\u00a7\u00a7 793, 794; <em>Sidway </em>v. <em>Greater Atlantic Finance, &amp;c., Co., </em>12 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>83 (at <em>p. </em>86).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">The application for <em>certiorari </em>was, in the first instance, denied by a single j'ustice. Its renewal before us was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Although it was stipulated that we may decide the case as though final j'udgment had gone, we do not see how that can be done. <em>We </em>cannot forecast what the judgment of the Bureau may be, when the proofs are complete, or what the judgment of the Pleas may be. Unnecessary delays prevented the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The writ will be denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
