Taylor.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-11\">For the petitioner-defendant, <em>David Cohn, Alfonse De Bose </em>and <em>Milton J. Ontell.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b389-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b389-13\">Bodine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArF\">This is a workmen\u2019s compensation case. There was an award in the Common Pleas. <em>Certiorari </em>was allowed. The findings of two concurring tribunals is not lightly disturbed. <em>Mountain Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>1111; <em>affirmed, </em>105 <em>N. J. L. </em>636. See, also, cases cited in <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Onyx Oil and Resin Co., </em>130 <em>Id. </em>381. The same principle has been reiterated at nearly every term of court. The question, however, raised in this case is, on the facts, slightly novel.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The petitioner claimed injury because of repeated traumatic vibrations which injured his left thumb. He applied art rods used in the manufacture of aeroplane engines to a revolving polishing wheel receiving, because of the high speed of the wheel, jarring sensations in the left thumb. We can find no evidence of a time or place when the alleged accident occurred. <em>Liondale Bleach Works </em>v. <em>Riker, </em>85 <em>N. J. L. </em>426; <em>Bollinger </em>v. <em>Wagaraw Building Supply Co., </em>122 <em>Id. </em>512. The proofs show an almost constant irritation which resulted in an impairment df the thumb, unfortunately not a compensable disease. See <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>E. J. Brooks &amp; Co., </em>134 <em>Id. </em>94.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The respondent contends that the recovery finds support in <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Onyx Oil and Resin Co., </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>381. In that case, the court found indicia of an accident. In the case before us, the proofs show only a continual jarring of the thumb which resulted from the ordinary use of a polishing machine. The sunstroke and pneumonia cases, due' to over exposure, relate to 'specific matters and not general principles. In <em>Mecca </em>v. <em>Phoenix Brass Fittings Corp., </em>124 <em>Id. </em>6, there were abrasions of the skin resulting in injury. Such is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The judgment will be reversed, with direction that the claim petition be dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
