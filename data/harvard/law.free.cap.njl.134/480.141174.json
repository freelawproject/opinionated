Dr. Atwood called on behalf of the injured workman found a 20% loss of vision which was due to a scar on the cornea; Dr. Lobsenz on behalf of the employer testified that \u201cten per cent, 'disability could be allowed considering the disfigurement caused by the scar, and ray estimate was ten per cent, disability.\u201d While differing greatly as to the extent of the disfigurement involved, the case of <em>Everhart </em>v. <em>Newark Cleaning and Dyeing Co., </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>474, is authority for an award based upon disfigurement. In the instant ease there was evidence of a 10% disability based solely upon disfigurement in addition to the 20% loss of vision. In this situation we are of the opinion that the evidence fully supports the award in the Bureau and its affirmance by the Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
