The <em>allocatur </em>directed that the writ operate as a <em>supersedeas; </em>and the parties were thereby granted leave to take depositions. Later, on defendants\u2019 motion, and after hearing, an order was entered by the court <em>en banc </em>precluding the taking of depositions upon the merits of the charges of misconduct, and confining the inquiry to the issue of the defendant board\u2019s power \u201cto set down for hearing\u201d and to determine \u201cthe charges of improper conduct\u201d by the individual prosecutor, and to \u201csuspend him from appearing or practicing\u201d before the board pending the determination of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The action thus taken followed a report made by a member of the defendant board, sitting as a hearing commissioner, that during hearings held by him on the prior September 6th and 7th, the individual prosecutor, while acting as counsel for the City of Jersey City, \u201chad made insulting remarks addressed to him\u201d and \u201chad refused to withdraw such insulting remarks or to apologize therefor as requested by him;\u201d that he \u201chad on several occasions persisted in talking to the exclusion of the hearing commissioner even after he had been ordered to cease,\u201d and \u201cin general had been impertinent and disrespectful and had conducted himself in a manner unbecoming a member of the bar of this State,\u201d as a result of which the commissioner \u201cwas unable to continue his scheduled hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ings on September 7th, 1945, necessitating their adjournment indefinitely.\u201d Upon the coming in of this report, the board adopted a resolution suspending the individual prosecutor \u201cfrom practice\u201d before it, and denying him \u201cthe right to represent any litigants before\u201d the board. This resolution was later rescinded; and then came the resolution under review. It was predicated upon a rule authorizing the board, \u201cfor cause,\u201d to \u201cdeny or suspend the right of any person to represent a party before it.\u201d This rule is defended as a proper exercise of the authority conferred by <em>B. S. </em>54:3-14, providing that such bodies \u201cmay make all rules, regulations and orders not inconsistent with the rules, regulations and orders of the commissioner, and issue such directions as may be necessary to carry into effect the provision of this Title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u2022This is not a contempt proceeding. It is conceded that the defendant body is not clothed with the power to punish for contempt, either inherent, as an auxiliary to the due performance of its function, or statutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Thus, the issue posed is whether the defendant tribunal is invested with power to debar an attorney-at-law from the exercise of his professional representative office in that forum. We are clear that it is not. .</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The appellate function of the county boards of taxation is judicial in character; and attorneys and counsellors-at-law who represent parties to proceedings before such tribunals, in the pursuit of the remedies within their, cognizance, thereby exercise the calling or profession of the law, for which they have been commissioned by the Governor on the recommendation of the Supreme Court. Such boards are termed <em>quasi-</em>judicial bodies; but the essential difference between a determination by a special tribunal and the adjudication of a court of general jurisdiction consists in the presumption of jurisdiction in the latter forum. <em>Riddle Co. </em>v. <em>New Auditorium Pier Co., </em>78 <em>N. J. L. </em>520. See, also, <em>Freeholders of Ocean </em>v. <em>Township of Lacey, </em>42 <em>Id. </em>536. And, by the samejoken, the power to terminate or curtail the license thus granted, and to discipline the practitioner thereunder, resides exclusively in the Supreme Court, the tribunal whence it came. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>It is not for other tribunals, whether of general or special and limited jurisdiction, to nullify or impair the efficacy of the Governor\u2019s commission. Our law was designed to avoid the evil of the English practice which permitted a man to practice in one court who had been stricken off the roll of another court. <em>In re Hahn, </em>85 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>510; <em>Hackensack </em>v. <em>Winne, </em>116 <em>Id. </em>87; <em>In re Wall, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>560.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">But it is said <em>contra </em>that these boards \u201care not courts of record over which the Supreme Court has reserved exclusive jurisdiction for the grant, impairment or revocation of the privilege of practicing law\u201d in this state; and that the timely performance of the quasi-judicial functions of these tribunals is indispensable to the effective operation of the tax assessment machinery, and therefore public policy requires that these bodies have power \u201cto control their <em>own </em>proceedings,\u201d and the rule in question \u201cis reasonable and necessary for the orderly and expeditious disposition of the board\u2019s statutory duties.\u201d It is pointed out that the individual prosecutor\u2019s commission as an attorney-at-law merely authorized him \u201cto appear in all the courts of record within\u201d the state, \u201cand there to practice as an attorney-at-law according to the laws and customs\u201d of the State \u201cfor and during his good behavior in the said practice,\u201d and that it directed \u201call judges, justices, and others concerned * * * to admit him accordingly;\u201d and it is said that this authorization \u201cis limited to the practice of law in courts of record,\u201d and that since county boards of taxation and such yimi-judieial bodies are not courts of record, \u201cneither the Supreme Court\u2019s grant nor reservation\u201d of the power to suspend or revoke the license to practice \u201care applicable to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Such is plainly not the case. If it were, the attorney-at-law would not be answerable to the Supreme Court for derelictions in the multifarious legal activities that have no relation to litigation in courts of record; and thus there would be no protection against the culpable misconduct of erring practitioners in the other fields of legal service. And a disbarred attorney would not be excluded from practice in this wider sphere of the law. The practice of law is not confined to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>conduct of litigation in courts of record. Apart from such, it consists, generally, in the rendition of legal service to another, or legal advice and counsel as to his rights and obligations under the law, calling for a degree of legal knowledge or skill, usually for a fee or stipend, <em>i. </em>e., that which an attorney as such is authorized to do; and the exercise of such professional skill certainly includes the pursuit, as an advocate for another, of a legal remedy within the jurisdiction of a quasi-judicial tribunal. Such is the concept of <em>R. S. </em>2:111 \u2014 1, classifying as a misdemeanor the practice of law by an unlicensed person. The attorney\u2019s commission is not to be circumscribed as defendants suggest, simply because of its specific authority to practice in all the state\u2019s courts of record. The grantee is therein constituted an attorney-at-law; and he is thus invested with all the powers usually exercisable as such. The character of the service rendered is the controlling consideration. Legal service that avoids the pitfalls leading to litigation is not of less value, economic and otherwise, than that contributed to the judicial solution of controversies arising out of unintelligent legal advice or no counsel at all. Indeed, it is usually of far greater advantage. The licensing of attorneys and counsellors is grounded in the public right to protection against unlearned and unskillful advice in matters relating to the science of the law. <em>Lowell Bar Association </em>v. Loeb, 315 <em>Mass. </em>176; 52 <em>N. E. Rep. (2d) </em>27; <em>Fink </em>v. Peden, 214 <em>Ind. </em>584; 17 <em>N. E. Rep. (2d) </em>95.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Thus it is that, in the course taken here, the defendant board invaded the exclusive province of the Supreme Court. It was open to the board to report the alleged misconduct to that tribunal for disciplinary action. Whether in such circumstances it had the power of suspension, pending the determination of the disciplinary proceeding, we have no occasion to decide. That was not the course pursued. If the present laws are inadequate to enforce the respect and obedience which are due all gwosi-judicial bodies in the exercise of their public functions, recourse must be had to the legislative forum. The extension to such cases of the authority to punish for contempt no doubt will provide the antidote; and this will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>constitute an infringement of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. This power has been sparingly granted to statutory tribunals, due primarily to its intimate relation to individual liberties and its liability to abuse, but it should not be denied where the need is urgent, and its exercise may be had through the process of a court of general jurisdiction, if need be. At all events, we cannot supply the remedy except by the established mode.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The resolution is accordingly set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
