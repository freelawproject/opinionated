DI CARLO, COMPLAINANT-RESPONDENT, v. ELIZABETH BRUNS, DEFENDANT-PROSECUTRIX.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b443-6\">Submitted May 7, 1946</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A9C\">Decided August 19, 1946.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b443-9\">Before Justices Bodine, Pebskib and Wachenfeld.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-10\">For the prosecutrix, <em>George F. Losche.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-11\">For the respondent, <em>Francis G. Schmid, Jr.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b443-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"A65\">Pbesicie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayc\">The writ of <em>certiorari </em>calls upon, us to review prosecutrix\u2019s conviction by the Recorder of the Borough of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Westwood for the violation of an ordinance of the Borough providing, <em>inter alia, </em>(4) \u201cNo person shall utter any loud, profane, indecent, lewd, abusive or offensive language <em>in any public place,\u201d </em>(italics supplied); and (5) \u201cNo person shall utter any threatening, offensive, profane, indecent or obscene language, or commit any act which tends to endanger the public peace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">We pass over the many attacks made upon the complaint and conviction and proceed to what in our opinion is the one insuperable infirmity in the conviction. The only proofs that need be recounted in support of that infirmity are that prosecutrix entered a photography store owned by one Carlton M. Di Carlo. No one other than the clerk was on hand; the owner was in the \u201cdark room\u201d in the rear of the premises. Prosecutrix is alleged to have \u201chollered\u201d in a loud voice, \u201cWhere is your God damn boss ?\u201d and then to have \u201cslammed\u201d the door and left the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">As indicated, prosecutrix was charged with and found guilty of violating the provisions of the ordinance herein-above set forth. She was fined $25; the payment thereof was suspended. She sought and obtained a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Conceding that the language used by the prosecutrix was prohibited by section four of the ordinance, nonetheless we think that the conviction is fatally defective. For it will be observed that this (fourth) section prohibits the uttering of the language therein set down \u201cin any public place.\u201d The store involved is not a public place within the meaning of that phrase. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>23 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>45; <em>State </em>v. <em>Colgan, </em>92 <em>N. J. L. </em>307; 108 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>108; 48 <em>A. L. R. </em>98, 99; <em>Cf. Peer </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>366; 83 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>180. And the fifth section of the ordinance prohibits the use of such language only when, as we construe it, the use of the language tends to endanger the public peace. There is no proof whatever that such was the effect of the language uttered by the prosecutrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">This view of the case renders unnecessary any discussion of the many other points raised and argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The judgment of conviction is reversed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
