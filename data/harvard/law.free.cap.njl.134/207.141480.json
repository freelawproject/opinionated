On Kiely\u2019s appeal under <em>R. S. </em>40:47-10, the charges were tried <em>de novo </em>in the Hudson Common Pleas, and the conviction was reversed as not warranted by the proofs. On prosecutors\u2019 motion, Kiely was ruled to show cause before the court <em>en banc </em>why a writ of <em>certiorari </em>should not issue to review the judgment of the Pleas; and it is now argued that the evidence sustains the charges, and that the Pleas erred in reversing the conviction. The issue is before us for final adjudication on the merits. The parties have stipulated that, if the court should decide to allow the writ, the question thus raised \u201cshall be determined on the record\u201d made \u201cas if the proceedings had been brought up by a writ of <em>certiorari </em>and judgment may be entered accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><em>R. S. </em>2:81 \u2014 8- requires that there be a trial <em>de novo </em>in this court, notwithstanding such a trial was had in the Pleas. In such cases, the Pleas exercises the summary statutory jurisdiction only; and, at all events, this court is called upon to \u201creview,\u201d on the facts as well as the law, the \u201cdismissal\u201d of the holder of a municipal office or position -removable only for cause and after trial. <em>Vide, City of Plainfield </em>v. McGrath, 117 <em>N. J. L. </em>348.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We find that the conviction is without substantial basis in' the proofs. The essential facts in the main are not in dispute. On the day in question, while Kiely was engaged for a brief period in relief traffic duty at Washington and Newark Streets, in the municipality, two boys, Gartner and Aucock, ten and eleven years of age, respectively, hurried across the intersection as traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian, was heavy. It was Saturday, about noon, and children as well as adults were crossing the intersection in considerable number, many of them on their way to a theatre nearby. As Gartner and Aucock passed Kiely, the former said: <em>\u201cWe </em>have been robbed.\u201d Gartner testified that Kiely replied: \u201c \u2018Kun along, or something like that; I don\u2019t know.\u2019 \u201d Aucock quoted Kiely as saying \u201cwe should go and play someplace else.\u201d Although he could not identify the boys, Kiely frankly acknowledged the incident the next day when interrogated by superior officers whose attention had been called to the mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ter by Gartner\u2019s father. He recalled the remark, \u201cWe have been robbed,\u201d as the boys \u201cran across\u201d the intersection; and he said he replied: \u201cGome on; hurry over here.\u201d The boys continued on, running, without further comment. Kiely then had traffic \u201cstopped three ways for children and pedestrians to pass th\u00e9se corners,\u201d and he \u201cwaved the boys across the street,\u201d to \u201cget traffic moving.\u201d He did not take the remark seriously; he considered it childish play. The boys agreed there was no mention of a holdup; they did not tell Kiely where or under what circumstances the robbery had occurred. As related on the witness stand, it did not take place at the intersection, but in an alley some distance away, out of the sight and hearing of the officer; and the perpetrator was a boy not much older than the victim. The amount taken was forty-five cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Plainly, this was not a violation of the law \u201cknown\u201d to the officer within the intendment of the regulation. Evidently, in his mind there was no reasonable ground to suspect the commission of the robbery. What he said in reply clearly indicated that he did not consider Gartner\u2019s statement as seriously made; and the boys\u2019 failure to pursue the matter and dispel the known false impression thus conveyed served to confirm Kiely\u2019s interpretation of the remark as one made in jest. The boys are of average intelligence, at least, and their reaction to the policeman\u2019s response could not but dissipate any notion that a crime had in fact been committed. The experienced police officer has an understanding of child psychology and behaviorism that cannot be ignored in appraising his conduct in circumstances such as these. In the lexicon of youth, the not unfamiliar cry of \u201crobbery\u201d has a meaning and a use quite apart from its literal sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The charges import a careless, if not indeed an intentional, failure of duty; and the evidence is not adequate to sustain them. Viewed in the light of the particular circumstances, Kiely\u2019s conduct is altogether consistent with a conscientious effort to perform his full duty. <em>Vide, Morrow </em>v. <em>Somers Point, </em>112 <em>N. J. L. </em>291. He exercised an honest judgment that cannot reasonably be said to be tainted with culpable carelessness; and, such being the case, he is not subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>discipline. He had been a police officer for nearly eight years. His service record was excellent. He had never before been charged with misconduct or a violation of departmental regulations; and the drastic nature of the disciplinary action is inexplicable on just grounds. This and the long delay in the presentation of the accusation (his superior officers learned of the incident and called for and received an explanation on the following day, but the charges were not served until May 3d) suggest an ulterior motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The rule to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
