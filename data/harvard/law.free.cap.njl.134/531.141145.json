The judgment will therefore include the following items as part of the costs:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">Supreme Court Examiner.........\u2022........, $141.60</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Printing of brief ........................... 37.50</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">Printing of brief ............................ 25.25</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">Printing of state of the case and postage........ 553.79</p>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">Total.....\u2022 ....................... $758.14</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
