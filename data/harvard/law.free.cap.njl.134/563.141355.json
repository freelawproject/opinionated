The deputy commissioner found as a fact, \u201cthat there was no such physical distress that the attendance of a licensed physician was required within twenty-four hours after the occurrence of the hernia.\u201d <em>R. 8. </em>34:15-12 x. Accordingly, he dismissed the petition. On appeal to the \u2019Common Pleas, that court affirmed the dismissal, but on the ground that petitioner failed to comply with the fifth requirement of the \u201chernia\u201d statute, that \u201cthere was such physical distress that the attendance of a licensed physician was required within twenty-four hours after the occurrence of the hernia;\u201d citing and relying on <em>Black </em>v. <em>DeVries, </em>133 <em>N. J. L. </em>368, as directly in point. That case expressly holds that the word \u201crequired\u201d in the act means more than \u201cneeded\u201d or \u201cnecessary\u201d and connotes an actual attendance by the physician. To quote the concluding language of the opinion, \u201cthe statute calls for attendance by a licensed physician within twenty-four hours,\u201d and does not refer to mere need of such attendance, or even a futile request therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>In this case, as in many others, there was a regular plant physician, but he was not available at the time. But that fact does not help the petitioner. Comparatively few employers have a staff physician on duty at the plant. The gist of the statutory requirement is prompt resort by the injured party to some licensed physician for diagnosis and treatment. That was not done, and for this reason the judgment of the Pleas will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
