An appeal to the Hudson County Tax Board resulted in an affirmance and an appeal was taken to the Division of Tax Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">Testimony taken before the County Tax Board by stipulation was considered and accepted by the Division of Tax Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the County Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">Respondents offered no evidence at the hearing and rested upon their contention that the prosecutor\u2019s evidence of value was insufficient to overcome the presumption of correctness of the assessment. <em>Central Railroad Company of New Jersey </em>v. <em>State Tax Department, </em>112 <em>N.
