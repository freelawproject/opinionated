ALFRED E. DRISCOLL, ESQ., COMMISSIONER OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b503-4\">Argued May 8, 1946</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ayz\">Decided September 17, 1946.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b503-7\">Before Justices Bodine, Perskie and Wacheneeld.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-8\">Eor the prosecutor, <em>Irving I. Jacobs.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-9\">Por the respondent, <em>Walter D. Van Riper </em>and <em>Samuel B. H elfand.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b503-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b503-11\">Wachenfeld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aav\">The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, amongst other things, provides <em>(R. S. </em>33 :l-25) : \u201cNo license of any class shall be issued to any individual who is an alien; * * * to any person who has been convicted of a crime</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">involving moral turpitude\u201d and <em>(R. 8. </em>33:1 \u2014 26) \u201cNo person who would fail to qualify as a licensee under this chapter shall be knowingly employed by or connected in any business capacity whatsoever with a licensee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">The prosecutor was indicted in the Atlantic Oyer and Terminer Court for the offenses of aiding and abetting in lewd and lascivious entertainment. He retracted a plea o\u00a3 not guilty to that indictment and entered a plea of <em>nolo contendere. </em>The prosecutor contends that such a plea is not equivalent to a \u201cconviction\u201d so as to come within section 33 :l-25, and relies upon the case of <em>Schireson </em>v. <em>State Board of Medical Examiners, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>570. The <em>Schire</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>son </em>case in this respect seems to be both applicable and controlling. At least it presents an arguable question.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The respondent contends that the Commissioner\u2019s action was merely an opinion and was, therefore, not subject to review by <em>certiorari, </em>relying upon <em>Newark </em>v. Fordyce, 88 <em>N. J. L. </em>440, and other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The record shows the opinion and recommendation in the Commissioner\u2019s office was \u201cApproved \u2014 Applicant is ruled ineligible as determined herein. Alfred E. Driscoll, Commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The letter addressed to the prosecutor by the Commissioner under date of February 21st, 1946, advises him that the Commissioner has \u201cruled,\u201d and refers to the opinion and recommendation as a \u201cdecision in your case.\u201d In addition to the question raised by the <em>Bchires'on </em>case there is also an arguable question as to whether or not this disposition by the Commissioner is subject to review by <em>certiorari. O'Connell </em>v. <em>Bayonne, </em>4 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>708.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The writ is granted, without stay.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
