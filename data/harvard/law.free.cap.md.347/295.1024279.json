Over the objection of the biological father, pursuant to a private adoption agreement between the biological mother and prospective adoptive parents, the child was taken to Harford County, Maryland, where the adoptive parents, the petitioners, sought and were granted a decree of adoption. A divided panel of the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Harford County, finding that the trial court should not have granted the adoption, because of the petitioners\u2019 violation of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC). <em>In Re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>109 Md.App. 475, 503, 675 A.2d 170, 184, <em>cert. granted, </em>342 Md. 582, 678 A.2d 1047(1996). We shall hold that the best interest of the child standard continues to be the uncompromising standard in all adoption proceedings and, in relying on that standard, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the adoption petition at issue. Accordingly, we shall reverse the Court of Special Appeals and affirm the judgment of the circuit court. We observe, however, that certain facts and circumstances may provide an adequate basis for the dismissal of an adoption petition as a penalty for violating the ICPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In early 1991, Jerry C., the respondent and the natural father of Baby Girl S., and Amy S., her natural mother, both residents of State of New York, met at \u201cLet\u2019s Dance,\u201d a night club located in Dutchess County, New York, and developed a casual friendship. The respondent and his brother were popular night club dancers; the natural mother frequented the area night clubs to dance and socialize with friends. As avid night club patrons, the respondent and the natural mother would meet at different clubs approximately twice a week. Over a short period of time, their casual relationship became intimate and, as a result, the natural mother, an eighteen year old high school senior, spent one night with the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>and became pregnant. The respondent, known to the natural mother only by the nickname \u201cManny,\u201d was twenty-one years old at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">A few days following the sexual encounter, the natural mother\u2019s father moved to Vermont, thus prompting the natural mother to move to the other side of the Hudson River to live with her mother and stepfather in a mobile home. The respondent had no knowledge of either the natural mother\u2019s relocation or her pregnancy until he saw her at a night club several months later.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon learning of the pregnancy, the respondent did not deny paternity; rather, he expressed a willingness to support the child. According to his testimony, the respondent said, \u201cIf you say I am the father, I am the father. I will live up to my responsibilities.\u201d The respondent\u2019s assistance, as it turns out, materialized only in the form of casual services, not financial assistance. Although the natural mother was a high school student and the respondent was employed, the respondent never offered to pay any of the natural mother\u2019s medical expenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only overt acts by the respondent evidencing his willingness to assist the natural mother during her pregnancy consisted of driving the natural mother, on two occasions, from school to Vassar Brothers Hospital for prenatal care. On the first occasion, the respondent waited outside and then drove the natural mother home. On the second occasion, when they left the hospital, the respondent took the natural mother to his home, where she met his mother and other family members. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>natural mother was experiencing difficulties in connection with the pregnancy at her mother\u2019s home, the respondent\u2019s mother invited the natural mother to move in with the respondent\u2019s family, an invitation that, for reasons not in the record, the natural mother declined. On that occasion, after introducing the natural mother to his family, the respondent went out for the remainder of the evening without informing the natural mother of his whereabouts. In fact, when he had not returned by the next morning, and the natural mother had not received a phone call from him, the natural mother walked back to Vassar Brothers Hospital, where she called her relatives to come take her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Aside from the hospital visits, the respondent and the natural mother had minimal contact, especially during the last few months of the pregnancy. The respondent testified that the natural mother was responsible for the lack of contact, as he tried calling and visiting the natural mother, but the natural mother\u2019s mother and stepfather told him to stay away. On one occasion, the respondent and his mother visited the natural mother\u2019s mobile home, but were told by her stepfather to leave and that the natural mother did not want to see the respondent. The natural mother confirmed this incident, testifying that she was at home on that occasion, but that she did not want to see the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">During the last couple of months of the pregnancy, the natural mother received home-teaching and began meeting with a school-sponsored social worker. The latter advised her to consider adoption as an option for the child after birth. Coincidentally, the social worker learned through a mutual friend that the petitioners, Paul and Deborah M.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, were inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ested in adopting a child. The natural mother testified that, faced with a Hobson choice, she concluded that, rather than rearing a child without financial support from the respondent, adoption was the optimal course of action for her. Therefore, she telephoned the petitioners and they began negotiating the terms of the adoption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Throughout the negotiations, which included several telephone conversations and a personal meeting, the natural mother told the petitioners that the father of the child was \u201cout of the picture\u201d and was not interested. She also told them that she did not know his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In late April 1992, after the petitioners and the natural mother had agreed on the terms of the adoption, the petitioners engaged counsel in New York to represent the natural mother and to prepare and file the necessary documents to comply with the ICPC. On the application submitted to the New York State ICPC Administrator, the natural mother indicated that the father of the child was \u201cunknown.\u201d Prior to trial, it was stipulated by all parties that the natural mother knew at all relevant times the identity and whereabouts of the respondent, the natural father.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">On May 3, 1992, the natural mother gave birth to a female child, Baby Girl S., in Poughkeepsie, New York. Two days later, the respondent, accompanied by his mother and other family members, came to the hospital to see Baby Girl S. carrying balloons, flowers, and gifts. As soon as they reached the natural mother\u2019s floor, however, and, thus, before they were able to see new born Baby Girl S., at the behest of the natural mother\u2019s mother and one of the petitioners\u2019 relatives, pursuant to a complaint from the natural mother, hospital security escorted the respondent and his relatives out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>hospital. As the respondent and his family were being escorted out of the hospital under protest, Mrs. M., who had been in New York since the natural mother went into labor and who had spent time with Baby Girl S. the previous day, was waiting in the hospital lobby to take possession of Baby Girl S. Upon receiving custody of Baby Girl S. from the natural mother\u2019s attorney, Mrs. M. went to her father\u2019s house in New Paltz, New York to await permission from the ICPC Administrator to transport Baby Girl S. to Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Later that day, the natural mother, through counsel, filed an Affidavit Relating to the Biological-Father\u2019s Consent and an Extrajudicial Consent Form 2-G with the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Ulster County, New York. Those forms were necessary in order for the natural mother to obtain approval to place Baby Girl S. with the petitioners. The natural mother\u2019s affidavit, signed over her attorney\u2019s signature and notary seal, states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">2. The biological father of the child is unknown to [the natural mother] and no person has taken steps to establish legal responsibility for the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">3. The biological father, if known, has not made payment of pregnancy nor birth expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">4. The biological father, if known, has not publicly acknowledged paternity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">5. The biological father, if unknown, has taken no other steps to evince a commitment to the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Likewise, in the Extrajudicial Consent Form, the natural mother stated that the respondent\u2019s full name and address were \u201cunknown.\u201d That statement, like its counterpart in the affidavit, was false. Moreover, the respondent was never notified of the proceedings in the Surrogate\u2019s Court. Thus, it is clear, and the petitioners do not dispute, that the natural mother\u2019s purpose in making these false statements was to obtain certification from the Surrogate\u2019s Court in order to effectuate the placement of the child and ultimately to facilitate the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Two days after the incident at the hospital, on May 7, 1992, the respondent filed a petition in the Family Court of Dutchess County, New York, for a Filiation Order, declaring him to be the father of Baby Girl S. In response to this petition, by letter dated May 15, 1992, addressed to the court, the natural mother\u2019s attorney informed the court that the natural mother admitted that the respondent was Baby Girl S.\u2019s natural father. The letter states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">I represent [the natural mother] of Gardiner, New York, who received a copy of a Summons and Petition of the above-captioned petitioner to be declared the father of a child born out of wedlock to my client on May 3, 1992. The matter is returnable before you for an initial appearance on June 15,1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">My client does not deny the allegations of the Petition (although she was unaware of the true name of petitioner) and would consent to the entry of a decree of paternity at this time. There are two reasons for this request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">My client entered into an agreement, before the birth of the child, to place the child for adoption with an out-of-state couple. As of this writing, the requirements for the Interstate Compact approval are near completion and we expect the child to be released to the adoptive parents. When have simultaneously scheduled an appearance by the birth mother at the Ulster County Surrogate\u2019s Court to formalize her surrender. In light of the recent Court of Appeals decision [sic] in <em>Matter of Raquel Marie X., </em>76 N.Y.2d 387, 559 N.Y.S.2d 855, 559 N.E.2d 418, it appears likely that the putative father would be entitled to notice of the Surrogate\u2019s Court proceeding and an order in the Dutchess County Family Court at this time acknowledging paternity would enable us to proceed in the Ulster County Surrogate\u2019s Court without further delay, now that my client is aware of the name and address of the putative father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">This letter had no effect on the paternity case. Notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>standing the letter,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the respondent was not declared to be the father of Baby Girl S. until June 7, 1993. Indeed, during the paternity proceedings, the natural mother contested the respondent\u2019s paternity, necessitating that she, the respondent and Baby Girl S. undergo blood analysis. This caused a significant delay: blood could not be drawn from Baby Girl S. until she was at least six (6) months old, and thereafter, the petitioners canceled two scheduled blood examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Between May 16, 1992 or May 18, 1992, about two weeks after the birth of Baby Girl S., the petitioners transported Baby Girl S. from New York to Maryland. The petitioners testified that they did so only after their attorney in Maryland told them that she had received verbal approval from the ICPC Administrator.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As it turns out, neither New York nor Maryland ever approved the application. A handwritten letter dated May 27, 1992, from Maryland\u2019s ICPC Administrator to New York\u2019s ICPC Administrator, with a copy to the petitioners\u2019 attorney, confirms that no approval was never granted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKX\">Somehow a mixup occurred and this couple came to MD with the baby prior to approval. Referral is incomplete. I received only 100 A\u2019s from your office. Please send special medical history of birth parents, home study of adoptive parents, delivery and discharge hospital information, and statement from the N.Y. attorney as to how the birth father\u2019s rights will be addressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">To date, neither the Maryland nor the New York ICPC administrator has approved the placement of Baby Girl S. with the petitioners in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>On May 22, 1992, a few days after the petitioners arrived in Maryland with Baby Girl S., the petitioners filed a Complaint for Adoption and Change of Name in the Circuit Court for Harford County.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Complaint named the respondent as the natural father of Baby Girl S and acknowledged that he had not consented to the adoption. Accompanying the Complaint were the natural mother\u2019s signed consent to the adoption, and a Show Cause Order and Notice of Objection to be served upon the respondent. On June 18, 1992, the circuit court granted temporary custody of Baby Girl S. to the petitioners. On the same day, the Show Cause Order was issued, notifying the respondent that he had the right to object to the adoption. Service of the show cause order was first attempted in early July by restricted certified mail. The show cause order was returned marked \u201cunclaimed.\u201d In August 1992, service of the show cause order by private process server was again attempted. Unable to serve the respondent, the process server swore in his affidavit that, \u201cNumerous attempts were made at the [respondent\u2019s] home address. Never able to find him home. According to neighbors, he works very late in evening and leaves early morning. Tried setting up appointment but he never returned call.\u201d A third show cause order was issued, but not served, in November 1992. The respondent was finally served in April 1993, by the natural mother\u2019s attorney, at a paternity hearing in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Although not served until April 1993, the respondent had knowledge of the pending adoption action in Harford County. At trial, the respondent testified that he learned about the adoption proceedings in August 1992 when, at a paternity hearing, the natural mother told him. She explained that she no longer had Baby Girl S. Also, in late November 1992, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>petitioners contacted and met the respondent, his mother, and his aunt at a diner in New Paltz, New York. At that meeting, which both parties described as amicable, the petitioners showed the respondent pictures of Baby Girl S., whom, he testified, he knew beyond doubt, was his biological child, as soon as he saw the pictures. That meeting did not resolve the differences, between the petitioners and the respondent, however; both sides maintained their desire to have Baby Girl S.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The blood analysis indicated that the probability of the respondent\u2019s paternity was 98.19% and, accordingly, on June 7, 1993, the Dutchess County court entered an Order of Filiation declaring the respondent to be the natural father of Baby Girl S. Shortly thereafter, on June 11, 1993, the respondent filed his notice of objection to the adoption, accompanied by with a copy of the filiation order, in the Circuit Court for Harford County.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On July 26, 1993, the circuit court appointed counsel to represent the interest of Baby Girl S., conduct an investigation of the case, and make a recommendation to the court. The court also appointed a social worker to conduct an investigation as required by Maryland Code (1991 RepkVol., 1997 Supp.) \u00a7 5-312(c) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Both, the attorney and the social worker, submitted reports concluding that the best interest of Baby Girl S would be served by allowing the petitioners to adopt the child.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>On December 14, 1993, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss the adoption petition citing, as justification, violations of the ICPC by the petitioners. The circuit court denied the motion. On September 16, 1993, Jerry C. filed a motion for visitation, which the court held in abeyance. . Trial on the adoption petition commenced on March 7, 1994.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On November 9, 1994, the trial court issued a memorandum opinion granting the petitioners\u2019 petition for adoption. The trial judge found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the respondent made no sincere effort to fulfill his role as the natural father of Baby Girl S, having failed to contribute to the prenatal and postnatal care of Baby Girl S. The judge also found that adoption was in the best interest of Baby Girl S. because, over a period of two (2) years, she had emotionally bonded to the petitioners and a separation at that point would have been traumatic. On March 24, 1995, therefore, the court entered a final decree of adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>A divided panel of the Court of Special Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and ordered dismissal of the adoption decree. The majority held that the petitioners, or their attorney, \u201cknowingly violated the ICPC,\u201d and that those violations mandated dismissal of the adoption petition. The court also held that the trial court granted the adoption in violation of \u00a7 5\u2014312(d)(2) of the Family Law Article. That section prohibits the granting of an adoption when the sole basis is because one birth parent has deprived the other birth parent of custody. The dissenting judge countered by contending that the trial court \u201cis vested with the discretion to balance the nature and gravity of the [ICPC] violation with the best interest of the child and that, based on this case, there is sufficient evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The standard of review in adoption cases, like custody cases, is whether the trial court, in making its determination, abused its discretion or made findings of fact that were clearly erroneous. <em>Petrini v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 470, 648 A.2d 1016, 1023, (1994); <em>In Re Adoption No. 11137, </em>106 Md.App. 308, 314, 664 A.2d 443, 446 (1995); <em>Coffey v. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>41 Md.App. 340, 345, 397 A.2d 233, 237 (1979). We said in <em>Petrini:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">The standard of review in custody cases is whether the trial court abused its discretion in making its custody determination. <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 125, 372 A.2d 231 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 939, 98 S.Ct. 430, 54 L.Ed.2d 299 (1977), <em>reh. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1025, 98 S.Ct. 754, 54 L.Ed.2d 774 (1978). In setting forth this standard, we concluded that \u201cwhen the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the chancellor founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the chancellor\u2019s decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>280 Md. at 126, 372 A.2d 231.

There is an abuse of discretion \u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u201d <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13, 648 A.2d 1025, 1031, (1994)(quoting <em>In Re Marriage of Morse, </em>240 Ill.App.3d 296, 180 Ill.Dec. 563, 571, 607 N.E.2d 632, 640 (1993)) or when the court acts \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d <em>North, </em>102 Md.App. at 13, 648 A.2d 1025 (quoting <em>Long John Silver\u2019s, Inc. v.

An abuse of discretion may also be found where the ruling under consideration is \u201cclearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court,\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Shockley v. Williamson, </em>594 N.E.2d 814, 815 (Ind.App.1992)), or when the ruling is \u201cviolative of fact and logic,\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Young v.

In sum, to be reversed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWA\">[t]he decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><em>North, </em>102 Md.App. at 14, 648 A.2d at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The petitioners argue that the Court of Special Appeals exceeded its scope of review, with respect to the ICPC, in finding that they or their attorney \u201cknowingly violated the ICPC,\u201d and consequently, the respondent\u2019s legal rights were impaired. The intermediate appellate court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">We believe that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the trial court abused its discretion in denying [the respondent\u2019s] motion to dismiss on grounds of a violation of the ICPC. [The petitioners] or their attorney knowingly violated the ICPC by bringing Baby Girl S. into Maryland before Compact approval.

We conclude that the violation was not a mere technicality; it prevented the Maryland Compact Administrator and the New York State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Compact Administrator from making a proper determination; it prevented both administrators from conducting further investigations that might have revealed [respondent\u2019s] objections; it deprived the State of New York of jurisdiction over a child born within its boundaries; and it ultimately led to a situation whereby sufficient time elapsed that the child\u2019s welfare seemingly dictated adoption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><em>In Re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>109.

The ICPC further requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">The child shall not be sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state shall notify the sending agency, in writing, to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-\">\u00a7 5-604(d). Compliance with the procedures set forth in the ICPC are mandatory. <em>Bernhardt v. Lutheran Social Services, </em>39 Md.App. 334, 344, 385 A.2d 1197 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In the case sub judice, the petitioners engaged attorneys in New York and Maryland to obtain ICPC approval. The ICPC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>application and accompanying documents were filed with the New York compact office and were later transmitted to the Maryland compact office. The petitioners testified that they were advised by their attorney in Maryland that the compact administrator had approved the placement of Baby Girl S. in Harford County. Based solely on that communication, the petitioners testified, they brought Baby Girl S. into Maryland, and soon thereafter filed a petition for adoption in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The trial court found that the petitioners acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d in bringing Baby Girl S. to Maryland only after they were orally advised to do so. It also found that the petitioners\u2019 attorney did receive a call from a compact administrator stating that the ICPC application had been approved, noting, in support, the evidence of the completed application that the New York compact office transmitted to the Maryland compact office. That application included a notation asking a Maryland administrator to call with verbal approval. These findings are supported in the record, and therefore are not clearly erroneous. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. In fact, based on the evidence, the trial judge exercised sound judgment. It bears repeating that the best interest of the child is paramount. That interest may well be found to have been met along with the purpose and goals of the ICPC to have been achieved when, as here, the adoptive parents are previously-approved foster parents and whose home has been determined to be suitable by a prior home study, and subsequently by a court-appointed social worker and attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The trial court also found that the respondent\u2019s legal rights had been protected. To reach that conclusion, the trial court considered and weighed the natural mother\u2019s conduct vis-a-vis the respondent\u2019s conduct, and in the final analysis, concluded that the respondent\u2019s substantial rights were not impaired and that Baby Girl S. should not suffer as a result of the natural mother\u2019s actions. The trial court acknowledged that the natural mother was not totally truthful when she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>denied knowledge of the respondent\u2019s whereabouts, but it was not convinced that she was \u201cperpetrating an injustice upon him.\u201d Rather, the court\u2019s view was that the respondent \u201csimply did not move quickly enough to plan for and provide a home for an infant child.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals held that these findings were a clear abuse of discretion. In so holding, the intermediate appellate court determined the respondent\u2019s rights were impaired by \u201cnumerous violations of the ICPC,\u201d to wit, the natural mother\u2019s purposeful omission of the respondent\u2019s identity and whereabouts on the ICPC application, and the affidavit and extra-judicial consent form filed with the Surrogate Court for Ulster County, New York. Another basis for the court\u2019s holding that the respondent\u2019s rights were violated was the natural mother\u2019s failure to serve him with notice of the proceedings in the Surrogate\u2019s Court. Thus, the Court of Special Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">Because [the respondent] was not notified of those proceedings and thus did not appear before it, the Surrogate Court gave the natural mother the certification required by New York law to proceed with the adoption. If [the respondent] had been identified as the father of the child and his objection revealed, New York State Compact Administrator and the New York Surrogate Court in Ulster County would certainly not have permitted appellees to remove Baby Girl S. from New York.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>109 Md.App. at 492, 675 A.2d at 178. Contrary to the Court of Special Appeals, we hold that the findings of the trial court are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">With respect to the false statements in the ICPC documents, there is no evidence, nor any reason to believe, that the Maryland ICPC Administrator would have withheld ICPC approval had she been informed of the respondent\u2019s objection to the adoption. The procedure set forth in the ICPC does not provide for the rejection of a complete application on the basis that a non-custodial parent is contesting the adoption. Indeed, the ICPC was not designed to protect the rights of birth parents; instead, it is designed to ensure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>placements for children across state lines are safe. As discussed <em>supra, </em>that goal was found by the trial court to have been achieved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Regarding the failure to provide the respondent with notice of the Ulster County Surrogate\u2019s Court proceeding, here too, there is no evidence that the respondent would have successfully opposed the natural mother\u2019s efforts to proceed with the adoption of Baby Girl S. Under New York law, the respondent\u2019s consent would not have been required for this adoption, as, in that State, an unwed father has the right to veto an adoption only if he manifests a willingness to assume full custody of the child within a six-month period immediately preceding the placement of the child for adoption. <em>Matter of Raquel Marie X, </em>76 N.Y.2d 387, 408, 559 N.Y.S.2d 855, 865, 559 N.E.2d 418, 428 (N.Y.), <em>cert. denied, Robert C. v.

A few days before the biological mother\u2019s consent was executed, however, the biological father commenced a custody proceeding against the biological mother, and an order of filiation was subsequently entered. At the adoption proceeding, initiated by the prospective adoptive parents, the trial court denied the petition for adoption. After several appeals on related legal issues, the intermediate appellate court, on remand, held that, although there was evidence that the biological father had made minimal financial contributions toward the post-natal care of the child,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>[i]n our view, the evidence of legal responsibility, public acknowledgement of paternity, and contribution to pregnancy and birth expenses fails to demonstrate that [the biological father] is \u2018a father who has promptly taken every available avenue to demonstrate that he is willing and able to enter into the fullest possible relationship with his under-six-month-old child\u2019 <em>(Matter of Raquel Marie X., 76 </em>N.Y.2d 387, 403, 559 N.Y.S.2d 855, 559 N.E.2d 418, <em>supra).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><em>Id., </em>at 713, 570 N.Y.S.2d at 607. Thus, the court concluded that the biological father\u2019s \u201cmanifestation of parental responsibility in this case Vas neither sufficiently prompt nor sufficiently substantial\u2019 to require constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Id (quoting Matter of John E. v.

That section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The sending, bringing, or causing to be sent or brought into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both the state in which the sending agency is located or from which it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state. Such violation may be punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its laws. In addition to liability for any such punishment or penalty, any such violation shall constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit, or other legal authorization held by the sending agency which empowers or allows it to place, or care for children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Section 5-605 of the ICPC does not provide sanctions, other than suspension or revocation of a State agency\u2019s license, that could or should be imposed on adoptive parents who violate the ICPC. As the Court of Special Appeal stated, retroactive compliance in this case would be impractical and inequitable, four years having passed since the violation of the ICPC occurred.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In <em>In Re Adoption No. 10087, </em>324 Md. 394, 597 A.2d 456 (1991), the seminal case in Maryland on the ICPC, we addressed violations of the ICPC and their effect on an adoption petition. In that case, the prospective adoptive parents were residents of Maryland who sought to adopt a child born in the State of Virginia. Before the child was born, the adoptive parents were told by the Virginia compact office that, in order to obtain approval, the birth mother would need to submit a handwritten application which included the names and address of the adoptive parents. The adoptive parents, however, did not want to disclose their address to the birth mother, and so they refused to file a handwritten ICPC application and the Virginia compact office refused to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>324 Md. at 401, 597 A.2d at 460. The Maryland ICPC office, however, received all of the necessary paperwork to process and approve the placement, but were unable to do so because Virginia was withholding approval. <em>Id. </em>After the baby\u2019s birth, the adoptive parents, knowing that they did not have ICPC approval, transported the baby from Virginia into Maryland. The following day, the adoptive parents notified the Maryland and Virginia compact offices that the placement had occurred. Immediately thereafter, the adoptive parents filed in Circuit Court for Montgomery County, a petition for adoption. After determining that the ICPC had been violated, the trial court dismissed the action. <em>Id. </em>at 402, 597 A.2d at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">This Court reversed, holding that a violation of the ICPC does not mandate dismissal of the adoption petition; rather, \u201c it indicates the need for a prompt determination of the best interest of [the] child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 597 A.2d at 465. We commented that the most appropriate sanction for an ICPC violation was retroactive compliance, where possible. <em>Id. </em>at 413, 597 A.2d at 465. We noted, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">[I]t should not be concluded from this decision that it is permissible to illegally remove a child from another state and hold it in Maryland until a sufficient time elapses so that the child\u2019s welfare dictates adoption. The particulars of this case are unique in that neither the natural parents nor the state of Virginia have, so far, sought to exercise their claims over the child. In addition, at the time they brought the child into Maryland, the petitioners had sought to comply with the ICPC and were acting under the misconception that their act was not wrongful and that compact approval would be immediately forthcoming.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 414, 597 A.2d at 465. Based on the \u201cparticulars\u201d of the case, we concluded that dismissal of the adoption petition was inappropriate; removing the child from a suitable home with caring parents and delivering the child to a Maryland state agency \u201cwould most penalize the only innocent party involved, the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 597 A.2d at 464. Additionally, the Court observed that neither the child\u2019s natural parents, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the State of Virginia sought to exercise their claim over the child. Another factor that the Court considered was that the adoptive parents had brought the child into Maryland knowing that they had not yet received, but were expecting, approval from the compact office, as shown by evidence showing that the adoptive parents contacted both the Maryland and Virginia compact offices a day after bringing the child into Maryland. Thus, we concluded that, based upon the facts and circumstance in that case, dismissing the adoption petition was not in the best interest of the child.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 412, 597 A.2d at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In <em>In Re Adoption No. 10087, </em>we neither accepted nor rejected the analysis set forth in <em>In Matter of Adoption of T.M.M., </em>186 Mont. 460, 608 P.2d 130, 134 (1980), the only reported opinion in which an independent adoption was dismissed by a court as a sanction adoptive parents violating the ICPC. In <em>In Re Adoption of T.M.M., </em>the natural mother of a seven year old child consented to his adoption. The adoptive parents, without making any attempt to comply with the ICPC, brought the child form Mississippi to Montana. The Supreme Court of Montana held that a placement made in violation of the ICPC was an \u201cillegal\u201d placement of the child for purposes of an adoption. The sanction for this was the revocation of the natural mother\u2019s consent or \u201clegal authorization\u201d and the return of the child to the natural mother. 608 P.2d at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Although we still do not adopt the <em>In Re Matter of Adoption T.M.M. </em>analysis, as it does not discuss the best interest of the child standard, we do not rule out the possibility of a trial court, under appropriate circumstances, dismissing an adoption petition as a violation of the ICPC. Certainly, the best interest of the child remains the overarching consideration and the needs of the child should not be subordinate to enforcement of the ICPC. That determination should be informed by relevant factors, which, although we do not think they are applicable to this case, might include those articulated by the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">Some of the factors that a trial court should take into consideration are whether the violation (1) was knowingly committed by the adoptive parents or their attorney; (2) impaired the rights of a natural parent; (3) was more than a mere procedural technicality that adversely affected both the receiving and sending state\u2019s ability to determine the best interests of the child; (4) impeded the sending state\u2019s jurisdiction to determine the best interests of their children; (5) circumvented a sending state\u2019s laws in order to effectuate the adoption; (6) was made to enhance the adoptive parent\u2019s ability to form emotional ties with the child in order to dictate adoption in receiving state\u2019s courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><em>In Re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>109 Md.App. at 503, 675 A.2d at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In adoption cases, the \u201cgolden rule\u201d has always been the best interest of the child. <em>Beckman v.

The court noted that Baby Girl S, who was two years old at the time of trial, had never been in the custody of the respondent. The court found further that, based primarily on the testimony of the court-appointed social worker, with whom the respondent failed to schedule a meeting, the petitioners were \u201cfit and proper parents,\u201d and Baby Girl S. had developed emotional ties with them, they being the only parents she has ever known. The trial court thus concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acq\">There is no question in our mind that it is in the best interests of the child that she remain with [the petitioners]. They are well qualified to fulfill the role of parents, are eager to do so, and have the intellectual, emotional and financial wherewithal to complete that task. [The respondent] on the other hand in our judgment is emotionally immature and has no real concept as to the responsibilities of parenting a child. He is caught up with the concept that it reflects upon his manhood if he does not parent the child.... He believes it will be fun to be a parent. He has grandiose ideas as to how he will advance and how he will be able to provide a home for this child. In fact, he has done little to think through the process of being physically as well as financially responsible for the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The trial court then addressed whether the respondent had maintained meaningful contact with Baby Girl S and whether he contributed to the care of Baby Girl S. As to that, the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">[W]hen made aware that Amy had conceived a child, Jerry C. had the opportunity to start maintaining contacts and developing a relationship to allow himself to be in touch with the child. He did not maintain significant contact with Amy during the pregnancy. We find as a fact that he only took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>her to the doctor twice and did not pay for, or offer to pay for, any of the medical services. He took her to his home on one occasion but left her in a crowded home with persons who were strangers to her without advising her he was leaving and without leaving any messages as to where he was going. This only added to her belief that he could not be trusted to provide a stable environment for her and the child. He did not participate with Amy S. to develop any plans for the care, nurturing, development and parenting of [the] child. He made no effort to have any contact with the mother and child between the time he was confronted at the hospital on May 5, 1992 and sometime in August of 1992 when he first learned that the child was not with Amy S. He filed a petition for paternity or filiation but never filed a petition for custody or visitation until March of 1994. He evaded service of process until he could obtain his order of filiation. He was more interested in pursuing the legal gamesmanship than he was in making actual contact with the child. He did not cooperate with court appointed social worker to allow himself to be evaluated so that she could make judgments about the impact on the child if the child was returned to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">[The respondent] has alternatively claimed an ability to provide properly for the child and to be indigent. In fact, he has provided nothing toward the financial support of the child or toward the physical care of the child.

The limitation to which the court referred is set out in \u00a7 5-312(d), which, as pertinent, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">(d) Limitation.\u2014A court may not grant a decree of adoption under this section solely because a natural parent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">(2) has been deprived of custody of the child by the act of the other natural parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">As the Court of Special Appeals acknowledged, the trial court did address this limitation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">[The respondent] did not ask [the natural mother] for custody. [The respondent] made no arrangements with [the natural mother] for the support of the child. [The natural mother] decided that she had to take steps to take care of this child since [the respondent] was showing no willingness to provide for the child. She consulted her social worker and decided upon a plan of adoption. [The respondent] left [the natural mother] to depend upon public assistance and herself to take care of this child. Therefore, [the natural mother] was not acting to deprive [the respondent] of contact when she made a decision to place the child for adoption. She was acting in a responsible way under a difficult set of circumstances to provide for this child. [The respondent] up to this point has acted irresponsibly by not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>formulating plans to care for the child and not having provided any assistance to [the natural mother] during her pregnancy. [The respondent] did not request custody or offer to care for the child himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">$ * H* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">Under the circumstances [natural mother] made a reasonable decision to care for th[e] child\u2019s needs. That decision impacted upon [respondent\u2019s] future access to the child. However, [the respondent] had abandoned his rights to make demands when he failed to step forward to help care for the child\u2019s needs on a prenatal basis as well as after it was bom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The Court of Special Appeals determined, however, that the findings of the trial court set forth above merely support the conclusion that the natural mother was justified in putting Baby Girl S up for adoption; however, \u201cthey do not justify the natural mother\u2019s deceiving the New York Compact Administrator and the Surrogate\u2019s Court as to the identity of the [respondent] as the child\u2019s father.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals found that the respondent did not abandon his right as a parent. In fact, it points out, it was the natural mother, not the respondent, who became \u201caloof\u2019 two months prior to Baby Girl S.\u2019s birth. Then the intermediate appellate court notes that the natural mother testified that she did not want to see respondent during the later months of the pregnancy, and that on numerous occasions, when the respondent attempted to visit the natural mother, he invariably was turned away by the natural mother\u2019s parents. Moreover the court further observed, as soon as respondent heard of Baby Girl S\u2019s birth, he attempted to visit the child and the natural mother, but was escorted out of the hospital by security guards. Also, it states, while many fathers in similar circumstances would deny paternity, the respondent filed a paternity action, seeking a declaration that he was natural father and thereby had rights to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>The intermediate appellate court clearly pointed to facts in the record that are contrary to the findings of the trial court. However, as a reviewing court, its role is to assess the sufficiency of the evidence, not embark on an independent fact-finding mission and substitute its judgment for that of the trial judge. It is the trial judge\u2019s role to assess the evidence and the credibility of witnesses, and to resolve the conflicting evidence. His factual findings should not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. Here, it is crystalline that no such error occurred. <em>Wamsley v.

On March 14, 1994, after two days of testimony, the Honorable James D.

He therefore granted the respondent temporary physical custody of Baby Girl S. In addition, Judge Pagones issued a writ of habeas corpus, ordering the petitioners to transfer custody of Baby Girl S. to the respondent. Three days later, Judge Pagones conferred, by telephone, with Judge Cypert O. Whitfill, who was presiding over the Maryland adoption case.
