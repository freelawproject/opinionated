Petitioner, Tariq A-R Y, asserts that searches may not be effected without the consent of the minor owner. The State disagrees, positing that valid consent searches are permissible when the consent is given by one with authority to do so, such as a parent. For reasons that we set out <em>infra, </em>we shall hold that a parent of an unemancipated minor can consent to a search of his or her child\u2019s personal belongings left in the common area of their home, over the child\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">On May 16, 1995, in response to an anonymous telephone call, Officers Robert Marker and Shawn Stewart of the Frederick County Police Department went to a residence in the Heather Ridge section of the County. A knock on the front door of the home was answered by petitioner; an unidentified woman was observed walking from the house. Both denied having made a telephone call to the police department. At the same time, Tariq\u2019s mother drove up to the house. The officers spoke briefly with the unidentified woman, returned to the house, and observed that items there were strewn about and that plants were upset. On the floor was loose tobacco, the butt of a cigar,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and an empty, overturned bottle of malt liquor. An odor of marijuana was present in the air and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>alcohol was detected on Tariq\u2019s breath. The officers brought these facts to the attention of Tariq\u2019s mother, who, according to the officers, thereafter consented to a search of the house \u201cand anything in it.\u201d Starting in the dining room, Officer Marker picked up a vest that was lying on the table. As he did this, Tariq stood and indicated that the vest belonged to him. He was told to sit down and, in the pocket of the vest, a small bag containing what appeared to be marijuana was retrieved. As Tariq was being placed under arrest, he punched and kicked both officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">At the delinquency hearing held on the State\u2019s petition on August 10, 1995, the trial court denied Tariq\u2019s motion to suppress the marijuana recovered during the search of his vest. Tariq was later found involved in the possession of marijuana and in resisting arrest; he was found not involved in the possession of paraphernalia. He was thereafter committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Services. The Court of Special Appeals in an unreported opinion affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Before this Court, Tariq urges that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we look only to the record of the suppression hearing and do not consider the evidence admitted at trial. <em>Gamble v. State, </em>318 Md. 120, 125, 567 A.2d 95, 98 (1989); <em>Herod v. State, </em>311 Md. 288, 290, 534 A.2d 362, 363 (1987); <em>Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 670, 521 A.2d 749, 755 (1987). We are further limited to considering only that evidence and the inferences therefrom that are most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion, in this instance the State. <em>Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239, 1240 (1990); <em>see also Simpler v. State, </em>318 Md. 311, 312, 568 A.2d 22, 22 (1990). In considering the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, we extend great deference to the fact-finding of the suppression hearing judge \"with respect to determining the credibility of witnesses and to weighing and determining first-level facts. <em>Riddick, </em>319 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>at 183, 571 A.2d at 1240. When conflicting evidence is presented, we accept the facts as found by the hearing judge unless it is shown that those findings were clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>As to the ultimate conclusion of whether a search was valid, we must make our own independent constitutional appraisal by applying the law to the facts of the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">In ruling on Tariq\u2019s motion to suppress the marijuana retrieved from the pocket of his vest, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkF\">\u201cI think that the evidence is admissible under Maryland law____ And it would not seem to me that there would be any reasonable expectation of privacy in this vest that was laying in open view on the dining room table. The evidence shows that the owner of the premises gave consent to search the premises and its contents. Therefore, I\u2019m going to deny your motion to suppress for the reasons given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvT\">Notably, the only witness who testified at the suppression hearing was Officer Marker and, as a result, we are limited to a review of that testimony alone in performance of our review. Guided by the principles of limited review set forth above, we defer to the court\u2019s assessment of Officer Marker\u2019s testimony and demeanor and hold that it did not err in finding as a fact that the consent given by Tariq\u2019s mother encompassed the entire house <em>and </em>its contents. <em>See Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 251-52, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 1803-04, 114 L.Ed.2d 297, 303 (1991) (scope of consent search defined by expressed object of search unless expressly limited by consenter); <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 820-21, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2170-71, 72 L.Ed.2d 572, 591 (1982) (consent \u201cextends to the entire area in which the object of the search may be found and is not limited by the possibility that separate acts of entry or opening may be required to complete the search\u201d). We now address whether Tariq\u2019s mother was in a position to consent to a search of Tariq\u2019s personal effects within the house in the first instance. For that, we look to the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">A principal tenet of the Fourth Amendment is the security of privacy rather than property. <em>Warden, Md. Peni</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>tentiary v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 301, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 1647, 18 L.Ed.2d 782, 788-89 (1967). To this end, its main import is the protection against invasions of the sanctity of one\u2019s person, home, and the privacies of life. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 87 S.Ct. at 1647,18 L.Ed.2d at 788-89; <em>Duncan v. State, </em>281 Md. 247, 254, 378 A.2d 1108, 1113 (1977); <em>see also Gorman v.

While the requirement that a warrant based upon probable cause serves to effectuate this goal, only those searches and seizures that are unreasonable are constitutionally prohibited. <em>Little v. State, </em>300 Md. 485, 493, 479 A.2d 903, 907 (1984); <em>Duncan, </em>281 Md. at 254, 378 A.2d at 1113; <em>Buettner v. State, </em>233 Md. 235, 239, 196 A.2d 465, 467 (1964). While searches and seizures conducted without a warrant are considered <em>per se </em>unreasonable, <em>see Ricks v. State, </em>322 Md. 183, 188, 586 A.2d 740, 743 (1991); <em>Riddick, </em>319 Md. at 192, 571 A.2d at 1245; <em>Peterson v.

New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 454-55, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2031-32, 29 L.Ed.2d 564, 576 (1971); <em>Chambers v.

United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 585 (1967)), if it can be demonstrated that the search falls within one of a carefully defined set of exceptions, it will be upheld, <em>Ricks, </em>322 Md. at 188, 586 A.2d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">When the sanctity of the home is involved, exceptions to the warrant requirement are few. A permissive search pursuant to voluntary consent is one such limited exception. <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 165-66, 94 S.Ct. 988, 990, 39 L.Ed.2d 242, 246 (1974); <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 219, 93 S.Ct. at 2043-44, 36 L.Ed.2d at 858 (citing <em>Zap v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 624, 66 S.Ct. 1277, 90 L.Ed. 1477 (1946); <em>Davis v.

The reason therefor is clear\u2014the individual whose right it is to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures may waive Fourth Amendment protection. This waiver will be effective, however, only as to property in which the individual possesses an actual expectation of privacy, and then only if that expectation is one that society would recognize as reasonable. <em>Liichow v. State, </em>288 Md. 502, 511, 419 A.2d 1041, 1046 (1980); <em>see also Doering v. State, </em>313 Md. 384, 397, 545 A.2d 1281, 1287 (1988) (\u201cIn assessing the gravity of an intrusion, we consider the objective expectation of privacy that reasonably existed, and the extent to which it was invaded.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Ramapuram, </em>632 F.2d 1149, 1154 (4th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1030, 101 S.Ct. 1739, 68 L.Ed.2d 225 (1981) (Ownership alone is insufficient to establish a reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy for purposes of determining the validity of a warrantless search and seizure; ownership is relevant to the inquiry but the totality of the circumstances determines whether the individual challenging the search has a reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy in the locus of the search.). In further assessing the validity of the search, one\u2019s expectation of privacy is to be measured as of the time of the offending intrusion. <em>Faulkner v. State, </em>317 Md. 441, 447, 564 A.2d 785, 788 (1989). As we have observed, \u201cThe concept of a reasonable expectation of privacy in a particular place is not simplistically singular. It involves, instead, a bundle of privacy interests.\u201d <em>Doering, </em>313 Md. at 394, 545 A.2d at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Encompassed within the rubric of permissive searches is the notion of third-party consent, <em>see Nestor v. State, </em>243 Md. 438, 443-45, 221 A.2d 364, 367-68 (1966); <em>McCray, </em>236 Md. at 14, 202 A.2d at 322, the constitutional validity of which has been recognized by the United States Supreme Court, <em>see Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 740, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 1425, 22 L.Ed.2d 684, 693 (1969). To this end:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">\u201cwhen the prosecution seeks to justify a warrantless search by proof of voluntary consent, it is not limited to proof that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>consent was given by the defendant but may show that permission to search was obtained from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\"><em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171, 94 S.Ct. at 993, 39 L.Ed.2d at 249-50; <em>see also Carter v. State, </em>236 Md. 450, 453, 204 A.2d 322, 323 (1964) (A search by permission of person entitled to constitutional protection from unreasonable search is lawful.); <em>Gross v. State, </em>235 Md. 429, 443, 201 A.2d 808, 816 (1964) (same). It was in <em>Matlock </em>that the concept of \u201ccommon authority\u201d as a determinative factor in the validation <em>vel non </em>of warrantless searches became firmly entrenched in Supreme Court jurisprudence. Although earlier cases such as <em>Frazier </em>and <em>Coolidge </em>indicated that \u201cthe consent of one who possesses common authority over premises or effects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting person with whom that authority is shared,\u201d <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 170, 94 S.Ct. at 993, 39 L.Ed.2d at 249, the <em>Matlock </em>Court looked specifically to joint access or control in upholding the search authorized by a woman with whom Matlock shared a room, that recovered, <em>inter alia, </em>evidence incriminating Matlock in a bank robbery. Thus, it appears that the Supreme Court\u2019s theoretical basis for the third-party consent in <em>Matlock </em>is: \u201c(i) that the consenting party could permit the search in \u2018his own right\u2019; and (ii) that the defendant had \u2018assumed the risk\u2019 that a co-occupant might permit a search.\u201d 3 W. La Fave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 8.3(a), at 720 (3d ed.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The waiver of Fourth Amendment rights by a third party most often involves a spouse, cotenant or co-owner, or a parent or guardian. It is the last circumstance with which we concern ourselves in the case <em>mb judice. </em>As the State properly observes, searches authorized by a parent or guardian have been justified on three grounds: 1) the parent is the head of the household or owner of the property; 2) the parent is exercising his or her parental authority and control over the unemancipated minor child; and/or 3) the parent is a cotenant or common resident of jointly occupied property. Timothy E. Travers, Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Evidence Discovered in Search of Defendant\u2019s Property or Residence Authorized by Defendant\u2019s Adult Relative Other Than Spouse\u2014State Cases, 4 </em>A.L.R.4th 196, 211-19 (1981). The applicability of each is dependant upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case. We need only address the first and third in order to sustain the search conducted in the instant case. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Seizing upon the language in <em>Frazier, Coolidge, </em>and <em>Mat-lock, </em>Maryland courts have generally held that one who shares with others access to, ownership of, or possessory rights over property necessarily enjoys a diminished expectation of privacy therein. As early as 1964, this Court upheld the trial court\u2019s admission of incriminating evidence recovered from a room in which the defendant occasionally slept in his parents\u2019 home. <em>See McCray v. State, supra, </em>236 Md. 9, 202 A.2d 320. The facts in <em>McCray </em>were as follows: The defendant was observed attempting to break into a store that had been the scene of an earlier burglary; burglary tools were lying in the vicinity of the door. Following McCray\u2019s arrest, officers went to his parents\u2019 home. Upon answering the door, McCray\u2019s father invited them in and gave them verbal permission to search the residence. After the father directed the officers to the sun parlor in which his son slept from time to time, he left to summon McCray\u2019s mother to execute written authorization for the search. It was while he was away that officers found an electric hand saw reported taken from the store. The search was thereafter discontinued when McCray\u2019s mother refused to sign the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>McCray challenged the admission of the saw into evidence at trial, contending that the search was made with neither a warrant nor permission therefor. Deferring to the trial court\u2019s finding that the search was permissive, we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVk\">\u201cBoth of the investigating officers testified that the father of the defendant, having been informed of the reason for their visit, not only invited them in, but consented to a search and conducted them to the sun parlor. As <em>an owner and cooccupant of the house, the father was entitled to give such consent and to bind his son in so doing.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">236 Md. at 14, 202 A.2d at 322 (emphasis added). It is this rationale, as the State points out, that predicates many decisions in this area. The consent of a parent to search his or her residence will act to bind a child such that any evidence recovered as a result will be properly admissible against that child because ordinarily that parent has shared, if not superi- or, access to or authority over the area and/or items to be searched. See <em>Waddell v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 606, 501 A.2d 865 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>305 Md. 622, 505 A.2d 1342 (1986), where the mother\u2019s consent to search a room the defendant rented from his parents and to which the mother had unrestricted access was held valid under the theory of common authority; <em>Tate v. State, </em>32 Md.App. 613, 619-20, 363 A.2d 622, 626 (1976), where the mother\u2019s consent to search the defendant\u2019s bedroom was held to overrule any objection proffered by defendant thereto; the mother \u201cpossessed not only a common authority with Tate over the searched premises, but in fact possessed superior authority ..., including the right to exclude him from the premises\u201d; and <em>Jones v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 309, 315, 283 A.2d 184,187-88 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>264 Md. 749 (1972), where the court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that his mother could not validly authorize a search of his room; she \u201chad the sole control, power and superior right to exclude others, including the appellant, from her home, and also from the very bedroom that the appellant used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We recognize that the parent-child relationship poses special problems in the context of consent searches under the Fourth Amendment. First, families typically have mutual use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>of most household areas and parents usually maintain some degree of control over their child\u2019s personal effects and living spaces. <em>See State v. Carsey, </em>295 Or. 32, 664 P.2d 1085 (1983). Second, parents have many responsibilities to their minor child and with those responsibilities come corresponding rights. <em>See generally, </em>Maryland Code (1984, 1991 RepLVol.), Titles 5 and 12 of the Family Law Article. Among those rights is the right to control and direct the child\u2019s conduct in the home. This parental right is sometimes in tension with the minor child\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See In re Scott K, </em>24 Cal.3d 395, 155 Cal.Rptr. 671, 679, 595 P.2d 105, 112 (1979), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Fare v. Scott William K., </em>444 U.S. 973, 100 S.Ct. 468, 62 L.Ed.2d 388 (1979) ( Richardson, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, children have Fourth Amendment rights and the parent\u2019s authority and control of the child do not singlehandedly define the scope of a child\u2019s right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. It may well be that the parent\u2019s control over the living spaces and personal effects of a minor child will validate the parent\u2019s consent to search in the vast majority of cases. There may also be cases, however, in which a parent\u2019s consent to search would not be valid in the face of the child\u2019s objection. We leave that determination for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Tariq contends that case law augurs in favor of suppression of the evidence because his mother was not in fact in a position to consent to a search of his personal belongings. Specifically, he asserts that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">\u201c(1) [his] mother lacked the requisite actual and apparent common authority over [his] vest to give consent to its search; (2)[he] had a reasonable expectation of privacy in [the] vest which he did not waive; and (3)[his] mother could not override his constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The short answer to this contention is that petitioner left his vest in the common area within the family home, i.e., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>dining room. The State established that (1) Petitioner was residing in his mother\u2019s home; (2) Petitioner was paying no rent; (3) Petitioner was a minor; (4) Petitioner\u2019s mother manifested her authority over the premises by inviting the officer into the house and telling him that he was free to search the entire house; and (5) the vest the officer searched was located in the dining room. Applying <em>Matlock </em>to this case, when Petitioner left his vest in the dining room, a room to which other family members had equal access, he assumed the risk that his mother, who had authority in her own right to consent to a search of the vest left in a common area of the house, would herself look into his vest pockets, or expose his vest to a search by others. <em>See generally </em>1 W. LaFave &amp; J.

We, therefore, hold that the trial court properly denied Tariq\u2019s motion to suppress the marijuana recovered during the search of his mother\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Dissenting opinion by ELDRIDGE, J., in which BELL, C.J., joins.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\">.

Under the totality of the circumstances presented, the search of Tariq\u2019s vest was unreasonable and violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Prior to the search the police officers received consent from Tariq\u2019s mother to search the house and \u201canything in it.\u201d Thus, it may have been reasonable at the outset for the officers to believe they had permission to conduct a broad general search of areas such as the dining room. Subsequently, however, Tariq\u2019s objection to the search of his vest should have raised an ambiguity in the minds of the police officers. At the moment Tariq asserted his interest and expectation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>privacy in the vest, the officers should have turned to his mother, who was present at the scene, and specifically clarified that the original general consent to search also included the search of the item of Tariq\u2019s clothing located in the dining room.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">It is clear that an individual may waive the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment through knowing and voluntary consent. The standard for measuring the scope of a person\u2019s consent under the Fourth Amendment is that of objective reasonableness, that is, what would an ordinary reasonable person understand to be the scope of consent between the officer and the consenting person. <em>Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991); <em>Wilkerson v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 173, 594 A.2d 597 (1991). In conducting the reasonableness inquiry, the court must consider what the parties knew to be the object of the search at the time. <em>Jimeno, supra, </em>500 U.S. at 251, 111 S.Ct. at 1803-1804, 114 L.Ed.2d at 302-303. Thus, the scope of a search is generally defined by its expressed object. <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982); <em>see also Gamble v. State, </em>318 Md. 120, 129, 567 A.2d 95, 100 (1989) (\u201cOf course, \u2018[a] consensual search may go no farther than the limits\u2019 defined by the consent,\u201d quoting <em>State v. Jensen, </em>44 Wash.App. 485, 723 P.2d 443, 446 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">While the majority concedes that \u201cchildren have Fourth Amendment rights and the parent\u2019s authority and control of the child do not singlehandedly define the scope of a child\u2019s right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d (Opinion at 495, 701 A.2d at 696), it ends its inquiry with a finding that the mother had the <em>authority </em>to consent to the search. The majority fails to examine whether the scope of the search was reasonable and states that \u201cany objection lodged in the face of a parent\u2019s lawful consent under these circumstances is unavailing\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 496, 701 A.2d at 697). In so holding, the majority ignores its own statement that, \u201c[i]n further assessing the validity of the search, one\u2019s expectation of privacy is to be measured <em>as of the time of the offending intrusion\u201d (id. </em>at 491, 701 A.2d at 694 emphasis added). The validity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>reasonableness of the search, therefore, are determined at the moment Tariq expressed an expectation of privacy in his vest. Tariq\u2019s protest gave rise to an ambiguous situation which the officers were in an excellent position to resolve with little or no burden. They needed simply to turn to Tariq\u2019s mother and confirm that they did, indeed, have permission to proceed with the search of the vest.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In holding that there was a valid consensual search of Tariq\u2019s vest, the majority particularly relies on <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974); <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969), and their progeny. The facts in the case at bar, however, are fundamentally different from the facts in the above-cited cases. In each of those cases, there was no question or ambiguity concerning the scope or object of the consented search.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In <em>Matlock, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 166, 94 S.Ct. at 991, 39 L.Ed.2d at 247, the officers conducting the warrantless search identified that \u201cthey were looking for money and a gun\u201d prior to asking permission to search. When consent for the search was given, the object and scope were known and adhered to. Similarly, in <em>Frazier, supra, </em>394 U.S. at 740, 89 S.Ct. at 1425, 22 L.Ed.2d at 693, the police requested permission to search a duffel bag that belonged to the defendant but was in his cousin\u2019s house and was being used by his cousin. The police received permission to search the bag from both the cousin and the cousin\u2019s mother. Again, the scope of the warrantless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>search was established prior to its execution and carried out in accordance with the permission given. In both instances the police officers and the consenter were clear concerning the permission given. The scope of the consented search was identified to the third party and the permission given was specific to the asserted scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The majority also relies on dicta from <em>McCray v. State, </em>236 Md. 9, 202 A.2d 320 (1964), for the proposition that an owner and co-tenant of a home has the authority to consent to a search. Although <em>McCray </em>is not an authority to consent case, it presents a set of facts illustrative of reasonable behavior that is lacking in the instant case. In <em>McCray, supra, </em>236 Md. at 14, 202 A.2d at 322, the police officers executing the warrantless search \u201cinformed [the defendant\u2019s father] of the reason for their visit\u201d and asked permission to search the premises. Thereafter the father escorted the officers to the room his son occupied on the few occasions when he spent the night. The father refused to sign a consent to search form, but he left the officers alone in the room, saying his wife would sign it. At that moment the police officers reasonably believed that they had permission to search the room: the father invited them into the home, knew they were investigating a robbery, left them to their own devices in the room where his son slept, and went to get his wife so that she could sign the consent form. Under the totality of the circumstances it was reasonable for the officers to believe they had permission to conduct a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Likewise, it may have been reasonable for the police officers in the present case to believe, at the outset of the search, that they had permission to conduct a broad search of rooms used by all family members. At the instant Tariq objected, however, a warning light should have gone off in the minds of the officers. In <em>McCray, </em>the wife refused to sign the consent to search form and the search was immediately discontinued. The officers faced with Tariq\u2019s protest should have confirmed that they had his mother\u2019s permission to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Another case relied on by the majority which illustrates reasonable behavior is <em>Tate &amp; Hall v. State, </em>32 Md.App. 613, 363 A.2d 622, <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 736 (1976). In <em>Tate, </em>the officers first received permission to search the home for the defendant. Failing to find him, the officers then asked for and received permission to \u201cconduct a search of the house for evidence.\u201d <em>Tate &amp; Hall, supra, </em>32 Md.App. at 618, 363 A.2d at 626. Thus, the officers recognized that the initial consent limited the scope of their search, and it was appropriate for them to seek permission to broaden their search.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><em>Jones v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 309, 310-311, 283 A.2d 184, 185 (1971), <em>cert denied, </em>264 Md. 749 (1972), is the sole case relied on by the majority which involved consent to a general undefined search. As here, the mother in <em>Jones </em>gave broad general permission to the police to search the house, and both she and her son were present during the search. <em>Jones, </em>however, is easily distinguished. In <em>Jones, </em>the mother went to the police station and requested that her son be arrested on drug charges. An arrest warrant was obtained for the defendant, and the police officers accompanied the mother back to her home. Her son was arrested, and she consented to the police officer\u2019s request to search the property. She knew that drugs were present in the home when she gave her permission to search. The defendant was present during the search, and at no time did he object to the search or assert a privacy interest in the personal items being searched. Thus, there was no ambiguity, and under the totality of the circumstances the police officers\u2019 behavior was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Conversely, under the totality of the circumstances presented in this case, the officers\u2019 conduct was not reasonable. Here, Tariq and his mother were present at the search. The original consent given was extremely general in nature and was not in response to a request to search for specific items. Subsequently, Tariq asserted an interest in the vest. At that moment the question arose: Did the consent given include items in which Tariq expressed a privacy interest? Faced with such an ambiguous situation, the officers should have made further inquiries. \u201cIt is the government\u2019s burden to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>establish that a third party had authority to consent to a search ... [and that] burden cannot be met if the agents, faced with an ambiguous situation, nevertheless proceed without making further inquiry.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>939 F.2d 1071, 1075 (D.C.Cir.1991). The additional burden of asking Tariq\u2019s mother for permission to search the vest was slight. Thus, I would hold that the search was unreasonable and that the evidence should have been suppressed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">BELL, C.J., agrees with the views expressed herein and joins this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\">. It is interesting that the majority relies on <em>Coolidge, supra, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564. In <em>Coolidge, </em>the Court held that the officers did not go to the defendant\u2019s home to conduct a search. Rather, they merely asked if the defendant owned any guns and the guns were <em>offered </em>to the officers. The officers then asked for and were given the clothes of the defendant. The Court held that under these facts a search did not take place. <em>Coolidge, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 489, 91 S.Ct. at 2050, 29 L.Ed.2d at 596. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that <em>Coolidge </em>is a consent to search case, the items sought were clearly identified, the scope of any \u201csearch\u201d was known by the third party at the time of the consent, and there was no ambiguity concerning the consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b535-5\">. If the officers had asked Tariq\u2019s mother for permission to search the vest, and if she had specifically granted the permission despite Tariq's objection, 1 would agree with the majority that Tariq's mother could \u201cconsent to a search of [her minor] child\u2019s personal belongings left in the common area of their home, over the child\u2019s objection.\u201d (Opinion at 487, 701 A.2d at 692). It is important to emphasize that the majority\u2019s holding is limited lo the circumstances here, involving a child\u2019s vest left in a common area of the home. Whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances, a parent may be authorized to consent to a search of a child\u2019s person, or of a container belonging to the child, or of a room used exclusively or primarily by the child, are questions not presented by this case and not decided by the majority. <em>(See </em>Opinion at 494-496, 701 A.2d at 696-697). While I also express no views on such questions at this time, it should be noted that children do have constitutional rights independent of their parents and that, under some circumstances, parents cannot waive their children's rights. <em>See generally, e.g., New Jersey v. T.L.O., </em>469 U.S. 325, 333-337, 105 S.Ct. 733, 738-740, 83 L.Ed.2d 720, 729-732 (1985) (Fourth Amendment applies to search of a 14-year-old student's purse by school officials who arguably stood <em>in loco parentis </em>at the time); <em>Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, </em>428 U.S. 52, 74, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 2843, 49 L.Ed.2d 788, 808 (1976) (\u201cMinors, as well as adults, are protected by the Constitution and possess constitutional rights\u201d), and cases there cited; <em>Brown v. Fauntleroy, </em>442 F.2d 838 (D.C.Cir.1971); <em>In re Scott K., </em>24 Cal.3d 395, 155 Cal.Rptr. 671, 595 P.2d 105, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 973, 100 S.Ct. 468, 62 L.Ed.2d 388 (1979) (police officers were not authorized to search a tool box belonging to a minor based on his father's consent); <em>State v.
