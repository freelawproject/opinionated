We hold that the Court of Special Appeals did err as to both issues. Therefore, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to the circuit court with instructions to remand the claim to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">On October 10, 1988, Anthony Manzano was admitted to Southern Maryland Hospital (the Hospital) by Dr. Robert M. Nedzbala to receive treatment for pneumonia. Mr. Manzano died six days later, while under the care of Dr. Nedzbala and the Hospital. Petitioner, Maria R. Manzano, instituted this medical malpractice action, individually and as personal representative of the Estate of Anthony Manzano, against Dr. Nedzbala and the Hospital (collectively, Respondents).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">As required by the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act (the Act), Petitioner filed a claim with the Health Claims Arbitration Office (HCAO), on May 23, 1991, and an arbitration panel was assembled. The chair of the arbitration panel originally set a hearing date of August 4, 1992, but continued the hearing to March 15, 1993, when he became aware that claimant\u2019s expert, Dr. George Sample, had not made himself available for deposition by the opposing party. On August 11, 1992, the chair issued a revised scheduling order that required Petitioner to identify an expert witness by October 9, 1992, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>and to provide Respondents with three dates upon which the expert would be available for deposition by November 6, 1992. Petitioner did identify her expert within the time mandated by the scheduling order, and the expert chosen was, again, Dr. Sample. Petitioner also provided the potential deposition dates, albeit not until November 13, 1992, one week later than required by the scheduling order. Again, the delay was caused by Dr. Sample\u2019s refusal to cooperate. When the dates were finally obtained, Petitioner\u2019s counsel forwarded them to the chair via letter, dated November 16, 1992, in which he explained: \u201cThe delay in furnishing these dates was in no way due to the fault of the [Petitioner] or counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Respondents moved to have Petitioner\u2019s claim dismissed as a sanction for the violation of the chair\u2019s scheduling order. The chair had the three prospective deposition dates in the file at the time of the hearing on Respondents\u2019 motions to dismiss. Petitioner\u2019s counsel argued that the minimal delay was neither his fault nor Petitioner\u2019s and did not prejudice Respondents in any way. Nevertheless, the chair granted Respondents\u2019 motions to dismiss by Order dated November 25, 1992, nine days after the dates had been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Petitioner filed a notice of rejection of the arbitration award in the HCAO and an action to nullify the arbitration award in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Respondents filed motions to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s action to nullify, arguing that Petitioner was \u201cflagrantly dilatory\u201d and that her delay should be considered a failure to arbitrate. Petitioner argued, in her opposition to Respondents\u2019 motions to dismiss, that her actions had not been willful, that Respondents had not been prejudiced by the delay, and that her actions did not constitute a failure to arbitrate. Petitioner also filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award in the circuit court, arguing that the panel chair exceeded his power by imposing the extreme sanction of dismissal for Petitioner\u2019s one-week delay in complying with the scheduling order. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06(c), 3-224(b)(3). Respondents opposed Petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate, arguing that she \u201cfailfed] to comply with [a] discovery order,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>and that a panel chair may dismiss a claim as a sanction for such a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The circuit court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitration award on May 31, 1995.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court found that \u201cdismissal of an action for failure to comply with discovery requests is well within the discretion of the Panel Chairman,\u201d and that the failure to comply \u201cis not required to be willful and contumacious.\u201d Thus, the court concluded that the panel chair did not abuse his discretion in dismissing Petitioner\u2019s claim. The circuit court also granted Respondents\u2019 motions to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s action to nullify, on June 29, 1995, and July 14, 1995, respectively, but it offered no supporting analysis for its finding that Petitioner\u2019s delay constituted a failure to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in an unreported opinion. The intermediate appellate court held (1) that Petitioner\u2019s failure to provide dates for her expert\u2019s deposition by the date set by the panel chair constituted a failure to submit to arbitration as required by the Act, and (2) that the panel chair did not exceed his authority when he dismissed Petitioner\u2019s claim for violation of a scheduling order. This Court issued a writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals on December 11, 1996. Petitioner asks this Court to address, in addition to the two issues raised below, whether the intermediate appellate court applied the correct standard of review when resolving issue number one.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The Act requires a claimant, as a condition precedent to instituting an action in a court of law, to submit his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>claim to non-binding arbitration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-02(a), 3-2A-04(a)(1); <em>Attorney General v. Johnson, </em>282 Md. 274, 283-84, 385 A.2d 57, 63 (1978), <em>partially overruled on other grounds, Newell v. Richards, </em>323 Md. 717, 594 A.2d 1152 (1991). If a claimant files an action in a circuit court without having first submitted the claim to arbitration, the court must dismiss the action. <em>Bailey v. Woel, </em>302 Md. 38, 45, 485 A.2d 265, 268 (1984). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Court of Special Appeals held that the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s action was proper because her delay in complying with the scheduling order constituted a failure to submit the claim to arbitration as required by the Act. The two cases the court relied upon to support its holding, <em>Bailey, </em>302 Md. 38, 485 A.2d 265, and <em>Robinson v. Pleet, </em>76 Md.App. 173, 544 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 689, 548 A.2d 128 (1988), however, are inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">In <em>Bailey, </em>the claimants filed their claim with the HCAO and participated in discovery but, at the arbitration hearing, refused to make an opening statement or to put on any evidence. 302 Md. at 40-41, 485 A.2d at 265-66. The arbitration panel, unable to decide the merits of the case without evidence, dismissed the claim. <em>Bailey, </em>302 Md. at 40, 485 A.2d at 266. The claimants then filed an action to nullify the award in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, arguing that they were not required to put on evidence at the arbitration hearing because the mere filing of their claim with the HCAO constituted compliance with the Act\u2019s arbitration requirement. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court disagreed and found that the plaintiffs, by refusing to participate in the arbitration hearing, had not satisfied the Act\u2019s arbitration requirement. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>On its review of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, this Court held that, in order to satisfy the condition precedent to filing an action in a court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>law, the Act requires that a claimant present evidence before an arbitration panel. <em>Bailey, </em>302 Md. at 45, 485 A.2d at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">In <em>Robinson, </em>the claimant filed her claim in arbitration but failed to comply with another of the Act\u2019s requirements, the filing of a certificate of qualified expert. 76 Md.App. at 174, 544 A.2d at 1. The panel chair, following the dictates of the Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> dismissed Robinson\u2019s claim. <em>Robinson, </em>76 Md.App. at 174-75, 544 A.2d at 2. Robinson then filed an action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to nullify and vacate the arbitration award. <em>Robinson, </em>76 Md.App. at 175, 544 A.2d at 2. The circuit court dismissed Robinson\u2019s action, finding that the panel chair had acted properly under the Act. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decision, holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of Robinson\u2019s action was proper because, as in <em>Bailey, </em>the claim was never arbitrated. <em>Robinson, </em>76 Md.App. at 176-78, 544 A.2d at 3. Thus, the court held, the condition precedent necessary to file suit in circuit court was not satisfied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><em>Bailey </em>and <em>Robinson </em>each addressed a claimant\u2019s total failure to comply with an explicit requirement of the Act. These two cases provide no support for the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding in the present case, however, because Petitioner did not fail to comply with the Act. She submitted her claim to the HCAO, and she filed a certificate of expert witness. Petitioner was fully participating in discovery at the time her claim was dismissed, and the delay in submitting her expert\u2019s prospective deposition dates was caused through no fault of Petitioner or her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The more accurate analysis, which should have been made in this case, is to examine whether Petitioner failed to make a <em>good faith effort </em>at arbitration, that is, whether she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>intentionally delayed in turning over prospective deposition dates or in any way connived with her chosen expert in an effort to circumvent the Act\u2019s arbitration requirement. <em>See Karl v. Davis, </em>100 Md.App. 42, 639 A.2d 214, <em>cert. denied, </em>336 Md. 224, 647 A.2d 444 (1994). In <em>Karl, </em>claimants\u2019 counsel informed opposing counsel that he intended to present his expert\u2019s discovery deposition testimony, rather than live testimony, at the arbitration hearing. 100 Md.App. at 46, 639 A.2d at 216. Opposing counsel stated that he would object to the admission of the deposition testimony because \u201cthe expert\u2019s opinions were not rendered to a reasonable degree of medical probability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the arbitration hearing, claimants offered the expert\u2019s deposition testimony in lieu of live testimony, and the panel chair granted opposing counsel\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the expert\u2019s \u201cdeposition testimony as to violation of the standard of care was not stated to be within a reasonable degree of medical probability.\u201d <em>Karl, </em>100 Md.App. at 47, 639 A.2d at 216. Claimants then filed an action to nullify the arbitration award in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, which dismissed the action. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court found that the claimants, by presenting the deposition testimony after being notified of its inadequacies, had failed to arbitrate in good faith. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals stated: \u201cThe question squarely before us is what will constitute a good faith effort at arbitration such that cases that subsequently proceed to the circuit court pursuant to ... \u00a7 3-2A-06 will not be dismissed for failure to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Karl, </em>100 Md.App. at 50, 639 A.2d at 218. The court held that, in order to dismiss a case from the circuit court on the basis of a lack of good faith, \u201csome evidence of deliberate or knowing conduct on the part of the claimant or his or her counsel\u201d is required. <em>Karl, </em>100 Md.App. at 58, 639 A.2d at 222. The court did not find any willful or deliberate action on the part of counsel that was intended \u201cto circumvent the mandatory requirement that medical negligence cases be submitted to arbitration to undergo a thorough dispute resolution process prior to presenting the controversy to circuit court.\u201d <em>Karl, </em>100 Md.App. at 59, 639 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>A.2d at 222. Claimants\u2019 attorney had honestly believed that the testimony, when viewed in conjunction with other evidence in the case, was adequate. <em>Karl, </em>100 Md.App. at 58, 639 A.2d at 222. The court held that counsel\u2019s \u201cmisplaced reliance\u201d on the expert\u2019s deposition did not \u201csuffice[ ], as a matter of law, to demonstrate a lack of good faith in appellant\u2019s approach to the mandated arbitration process.\u201d <em>See Karl, </em>100 Md.App. at 49, 639 A.2d at 217. Thus, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the decision of the circuit court. <em>Karl, </em>100 Md.App. at 60, 639 A.2d at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">In the case at bar, the Court of Special Appeals never considered whether Petitioner or her counsel deliberately and willfully failed to turn over the prospective deposition dates in an effort to circumvent the mandatory arbitration requirement of the Act. Instead, the court stated: \u201cSo long as the panel\u2019s decision to dismiss appellant\u2019s claim was proper, the [circuit] court\u2019s finding that the claim was not properly arbitrated before the HCAO panel was correct.\u201d As our discussion of <em>Karl </em>demonstrates, this is not the standard of review. If the court had considered whether or not Petitioner\u2019s delay was willful and deliberate, it would have been compelled to reverse the decision of the circuit court. Petitioner\u2019s counsel stated that the delay was neither Petitioner\u2019s fault nor his; rather, the delay was caused by Petitioner\u2019s expert witness, who refused to cooperate in setting the three dates. There is no evidence that Petitioner and her counsel were attempting to avoid or unduly delay arbitration; they had participated fully in all of the events surrounding arbitration up to the time that the claim was dismissed. Thus, under the facts and circumstances of this case we cannot say that Petitioner or her counsel displayed a lack of good faith designed \u201cto circumvent the mandatory requirement that medical negligence cases be submitted to arbitration.\u201d We must, therefore, reverse the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The Court of Special Appeals also held that the chair did not abuse his discretion by imposing upon Petitioner the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>extreme sanction of dismissal for her violation of the scheduling order. Petitioner argues that the chair had no authority to sanction her for violating the scheduling order or, alternatively, that the chair abused his discretion by dismissing Petitioner\u2019s claim under the circumstances of this case. We shall hold that the chair did possess the authority to sanction Petitioner for violating the scheduling order but that imposing the ultimate sanction of dismissal, under the circumstances of this case, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The chair of an arbitration panel has a role similar to a judge in a trial. <em>See McClurkin v. Maldonado, </em>304 Md. 225, 235, <em>498 </em>A.2d 626, 631 (1985)(interpreting 1985 amendments to the Act). The chair decides \u201call issues of law\u201d that arise between the filing of a claim and its final disposition, \u00a7 3-2A-05(a), and \u201call prehearing procedures including issues relating to discovery.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-05(c). Additionally, \u00a7 3-2A-05(b)(2) states that \u201cthe provisions of the Maryland Rules relating to discovery are applicable to proceedings under [the Act].\u201d Accordingly, the chair of an arbitration panel may sanction a party for a discovery violation. <em>See McClurkin, </em>304 Md. at 236, 498 A.2d at 632 (\u201cOnce the adjudicator has determined a party has violated a discovery rule, the choice of sanctions involves weighing a number of factors including the seriousness of the violation and the extent of prejudice suffered by the adversary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Petitioner argues that the chair does not have the power to impose sanctions for the violation of a scheduling order, however, because a scheduling order is not \u201cdiscovery.\u201d This argument is without merit. In <em>Golub v. Spivey, </em>70 Md.App. 147, 520 A.2d 394, <em>cert. denied, </em>310 Md. 2, 526 A.2d 954 (1987), the Court of Special Appeals held that failure to comply with an arbitration panel\u2019s scheduling order is sanctionable under \u00a7 3-2A-05(c). In that case, the defendant in a medical malpractice claim failed to name a qualified expert until nearly two months after the date prescribed by the scheduling order. <em>Golub, </em>70 Md.App. at 160, 520 A.2d at 401. As a sanction for the violation, the panel chair refused to allow the defendant to present any expert testimony at the arbitration hearing. <em>Go</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>lub, </em>70 Md.App. at 151, 520 A.2d at 396. The claimant won a $150,000 arbitration award, which Dr. Golub asked the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to vacate. <em>Golub, </em>70 Md.App. at 150, 159, 520 A.2d at 395, 400. The circuit court refused to vacate the award, and on appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit court. The intermediate appellate court held that the violation of the discovery deadline in the scheduling order was sanctionable by the panel chair and that the particular sanction imposed was appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">\u201cThe panel chairman in a health claims arbitration proceeding has the authority to decide all prehearing procedures including issues relating to discovery. \u00a7 3-2A-05(c). We believe exclusion of expert testimony on Dr. Golub\u2019s behalf was an appropriate sanction for Dr. Golub\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery deadline in the panel chairman\u2019s scheduling order.\u201d (Footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\"><em>Golub, </em>70 Md.App. at 160-61, 520 A.2d at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In the instant case, Petitioner failed to comply with a discovery deadline set in a scheduling order. Under the Act, the panel chair had the power to decide all issues relating to discovery, \u00a7 3-2A-05(c); <em>see also McClurkin, </em>304 Md. at 235, 498 A.2d at 631, and under <em>Golub, </em>the violation of a discovery deadline set in a scheduling order is a discovery-related issue. 70 Md.App. at 160-61, 520 A.2d at 401. Therefore, the panel chair was entitled to sanction Petitioner for her delay in turning over the prospective deposition dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Maryland Rule 2-504, entitled \u201cSCHEDULING ORDER\u201d and adopted in 1994, plays no part in our analysis of this case because Petitioner\u2019s claim was dismissed in 1992. However, our holding would be the same if the Rule were applicable to this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 2-504 was one of several provisions this Court adopted in an attempt \u201cto expedite and</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>control the orderly flow of civil litigation in the circuit courts.\u201d <em>Tobin v. Marriott Hotels, </em>111 Md.App. 566, 572, 683 A.2d 784, 787 (1996) (discussing Rules 2-504, 2-504.1, 2-504.2, and 1211 b). When adopting Rule 2-504, this Court did not intend to abrogate the preexisting case law pertaining to scheduling orders. Thus, although the Rule does not, by its terms, provide for sanctions, the case law of Maryland makes the imposition of sanctions for the violation of a scheduling order appropriate. <em>See, e.g., McClurkin, </em>304 Md. at 235, 498 A.2d at 631; <em>Golub, </em>70 Md.App. at 160-61, 520 A.2d at 401. Indeed, if our courts could not enforce their scheduling orders through the threat and imposition of sanctions, the entire process of expedited case management would be at risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Additionally, although most of the rules relating to discovery are contained in chapter 400, the nature of the scheduling order has not changed by virtue of its placement in chapter 500. Scheduling orders, among other things, are intended to promote efficient and timely discovery. Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 3-2A-05(c), a panel chair is entitled to enforce the discovery deadlines contained in a scheduling order.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Having reaffirmed that the violation of a chair\u2019s scheduling order is sanctionable, we now address whether the violation in this case warranted the extreme sanction of dismissal. Whether and in what manner to sanction a party for a discovery violation is generally left to the chair\u2019s discretion. <em>See Mason v. Wolfing, </em>265 Md. 234, 236, 288 A.2d 880, 881 (1972) (referring to discretion of trial judge to impose sanctions for violation of discovery rules); <em>Lynch v. R.E. Tull &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>251 Md. 260, 261-62, 247 A.2d 286, 286-87 (1968) (same). The dismissal of a claim, however, is among the gravest of sanctions, <em>Mason, </em>265 Md. at 236, 288 A.2d at 881; <em>Lynch, </em>251 Md. at 261, 247 A.2d at 287, and as such, is warranted only in cases of egregious misconduct such as \u201cwil[l]ful or contemptuous\u201d behavior, \u201ca deliberate attempt to hinder or prevent effective presentation of defenses or counterclaims,\u201d or \u201cstalling in revealing one\u2019s own weak claim or defense.\u201d <em>Rubin v. Gray, </em>35 Md.App. 399, 400-01, 370 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>600, 601 (1977) (holding dismissal appropriate where plaintiffs counsel admitted that he deliberately refused to answer interrogatories for thirteen months as a trial tactic) (citing <em>Lynch, </em>251 Md. at 261-62, 247 A.2d at 287.); <em>see also, e.g., Peck v. Toronto, </em>246 Md. 268, 269-70, 228 A.2d 252, 258-54, <em>cert. denied, </em>889 U.S. 868, 88 S.Ct. 139, 19 L.Ed.2d 142 (1967) (holding dismissal appropriate where, after twice failing to appear for depositions, petitioner appeared but refused to answer several material questions); <em>cf. Williams v. Williams, </em>32 Md.App. 685, 695-97, 363 A.2d 598, 604-05 (1976)(holding dismissal inappropriate where, among other things, plaintiffs failure to be deposed was not willful or contumacious and resulted in no prejudice to defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The panel chair, in this case, abused his discretion when he dismissed Petitioner\u2019s claim. There was no continuing refusal to comply with the scheduling order. There was merely a one-week delay, and the chair had the prospective deposition dates in his possession for a full nine days before he dismissed Petitioner\u2019s claim. Also, there is no evidence of willful or contumacious behavior on the part of Petitioner or her counsel designed to hinder Respondents\u2019 presentation of their defenses or to stall in revealing Petitioner\u2019s own weak claim. The dates were provided to the chair in a letter, in which Petitioner\u2019s counsel stated that he had great difficulty obtaining deposition dates and that it was neither his fault nor Petitioner\u2019s. Finally, the delay did not prejudice Respondents. There is no evidence to suggest that the parties would have been unable to comply with the remaining dates in the scheduling order: to complete discovery by February 26, 1993, and to hold a hearing on the merits on March 15, 1993. Under these circumstances, the panel chair was not justified in imposing the ultimate sanction of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is reversed. In order to dismiss an action for failure to arbitrate in good faith, a circuit court must find that a party exhibited deliberate or willful behavior with the effect of circumventing the</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Act\u2019s mandatory arbitration requirement. In the instant case, there is no evidence that Petitioner or her counsel caused the delay willfully or deliberately, or that they in any way attempted to avoid arbitration. To the contrary, Petitioner had fully participated in the preliminary proceedings, and the chair had been informed that the delay was caused by an uncooperative expert witness. Thus, we hold that Petitioner\u2019s claim should not have been dismissed by the circuit court for failure to arbitrate in good faith. We also hold that Petitioner\u2019s claim should not have been dismissed by the arbitration panel cha\u00f1as a sanction for violating the scheduling order. In this case, the failure to comply with the chair\u2019s scheduling order for a mere seven days was not intentional; rather, it was caused by Petitioner\u2019s uncooperative expert witness. In addition, the violation was corrected a full nine days before the claim was dismissed, and Respondents suffered no prejudice as a result of the delay. Imposing the extreme sanction of dismissal under the circumstances present here was an abuse of the panel chair\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
