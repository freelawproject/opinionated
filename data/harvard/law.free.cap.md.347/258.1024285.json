Domino denied his application under a company-wide no-beard policy because Mr. Kohli refused to shave his beard, which he wears for religious reasons. In January 1988, Mr. Kohli filed a complaint with the Maryland Human Relations Commission, asserting that rejection of his employment application under these circumstances constituted religious discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">After lengthy administrative and judicial review proceedings, and after the case was remanded back to the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commission\u2019s Appeal Board on January 17, 1996, issued a final administrative decision and order pursuant to Maryland Code (1957,1994 RepLVol., 1997 Supp.), Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 3(d), 11,15(f), and 16, and the Administrative Procedure Act, Code (1984, 1995 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-221 of the State Government Article. The Commission found that Domino had engaged in unlawful religious discrimination in its employment practices in violation of Art. 49B, \u00a7 16, and ordered Domino to revise its no-beard policy, to pay Mr. Kohli back pay, and to offer him the next available position as a manager in training.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>On February 13,1996, in accordance with the judicial review section of the Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article, Domino filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision and order. At the same time, Domino filed a motion to \u201cstay\u201d the decision and order pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-205 and \u00a7 10-222(e) of the State Government Article, and Domino requested a hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The circuit court on March 18, 1996, without a hearing, denied the motion to stay. Domino then filed a motion for reconsideration and another request for a hearing. The circuit court denied this motion in an order dated May 14, 1996. The court\u2019s May 14th order, however, went beyond a simple denial of the motion to reconsider. The circuit court also ordered</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">\u201cthat [Domino] shall immediately comply with the Decision and Order of the Maryland Commission on Human Relations pending this Court\u2019s consideration of [Domino\u2019s] appeal.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">On May 17, 1996, the Commission sent a letter to Domino demanding that Domino take certain action in accordance with the final decision and order of the Commission, and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u201cIf, Domino fails to immediately act in accord with the orders of the Commission and circuit court, on Thursday, May 23, 1996, the Commission will file a Petition for Contempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Domino, on May 20, 1996, filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from the circuit court\u2019s order of May 14, 1996. At the same time, Domino filed in the Court of Special Appeals a motion to stay the circuit court\u2019s order pending appeal. The Court of Special Appeals denied the motion for a stay. Shortly thereafter, and prior to the filing of briefs in the Court of Special Appeals, Domino filed in this Court a petition for writ of certiorari and a motion to stay the circuit court\u2019s order. This Court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari and ordered that the circuit court\u2019s May 14th order be stayed pending the decision by this Court. <em>LOOC, Inc. v. Kohli </em>342 Md. 582, 678 A.2d 1047 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Domino argues that the circuit court\u2019s compliance order of May 14, 1996, constituted a preliminary or interlocutory injunction which violated the Maryland Rules regarding injunctions, presently codified as Maryland Rules 15-501 through 15-505. Alternatively, Domino contends that the order was unauthorized under the statutory provisions governing the Human Relations Commission and the enforcement of the Commission\u2019s orders, Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol., Supp.1997), Art. 49B.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The Commission, on the other hand, asserts that the circuit court\u2019s order of May 14, 1996, went no further than its earlier order of March 18, 1996, which had simply denied Domino\u2019s motion for a stay. The Commission contends that any court order denying a stay of an administrative \u201ccease and desist\u201d or similar administrative order is \u201cinjunctive in effect as are all orders denying requests for stay of injunctive agency orders\u201d (Commission\u2019s brief at 14), and that the earlier March 18th order denying a stay \u201crequired and commanded [Domino] ... to do exactly what the Commission\u2019s final decision and Order required and commanded\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 15). Because, in the Commission\u2019s view, the earlier March 18th circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>court order had the same \u201cinjunctive effect\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 14) as the later May 14th circuit court order, the Commission contends that Domino\u2019s notice of appeal should have been filed within 30 days of March 18th. Since the notice of appeal was filed on May 20, 1996, more than 30 days from March 18th, the Commission maintains that the appeal should be dismissed as untimely.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commission further argues that, even if Domino\u2019s appeal were timely, there was neither a violation of the Maryland Rules concerning injunctions nor of Art. 49B. Again, the Commission views the May 14th order as going no farther than the March 18th order denying a stay. While stating that a court order denying a stay of an administrative cease and desist order has \u201cinjunctive effect,\u201d the Commission asserts that such a court order is not subject to the Maryland Rules regulating injunctions. Finally, the Commission contends that the circuit court\u2019s order was authorized by Art. 49B.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We agree with Domino\u2019s argument that the circuit court\u2019s May 14, 1996, compliance order both violated the Maryland Rules regulating injunctions and was unauthorized by Art. 49B. We flatly reject the Commission\u2019s theory that the May 14th and earlier March 18th orders were identical in effect and that Domino\u2019s appeal was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The circuit court\u2019s order of March 18, 1996, simply denying a motion to stay the administrative decision and order, was in no sense an \u201cinjunction\u201d as contended by the Commission. It was not a court \u201corder mandating or prohibit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ing a specified act,\u201d and thus did not amount to an \u201cinjunction\u201d as defined by Maryland law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the March 18th denial of the motion for a stay left the earlier administrative decision operative, to the same extent as it was operative when rendered by the Commission, nothing in the <em>court\u2019s </em>order of March 18th required or prohibited any party from doing anything. To whatever extent, if any, immediate action was then required, such requirement resulted entirely from the Commission\u2019s order and not the court\u2019s order. No party could have been held in contempt for violating the March 18th court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Moreover, we have held \u201cthat a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for a ... stay is ordinarily not appealable\u201d as a grant or denial of an injunction, <em>County Comm\u2019rs v. Schrodel, </em>320 Md. 202, 213, 577 A.2d 39, 45 (1990). <em>See, e.g., Highfield Water Co. v. Washington County Sanitary District, </em>295 Md. 410, 416-417, 456 A.2d 371, 374 (1983) (stay or refusal to stay proceedings in the same matter ordinarily does not constitute the grant or denial of an injunction), and cases there cited; <em>Waters v. Smith, </em>277 Md. 189, 195-197, 352 A.2d 793, 796-798 (1976). Under our cases, the March 18th order denying a stay was not an order granting or denying an injunction, and Domino could not have filed an appeal from that order pursuant to Code (1974,1995 RepLVol., Supp.1997), \u00a7 12-303(3)(i) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The May 14, 1996, order, however, did constitute the granting of the injunction. The circuit court on May 14th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ordered that Domino \u201cshall immediately comply with the Decision and Order of the Maryland Commission on Human Relations____\u201d This was a court order \u201cmandating ... a specified act;\u201d it therefore fell within the definition of \u201cinjunction\u201d set forth in Rule 15-501(a). If this Court had not stayed the May 14th order, and if Domino had not complied with it, Domino could have been subject to contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Furthermore, because the May 14th order did not contain an expiration date \u201cnot later than ten days after issuance,\u201d it was not a valid temporary restraining order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In substance, the order was a preliminary injunction. Nevertheless, it was erroneously issued without giving Domino an opportunity for a hearing. Rule 15-505(a) states, without exceptions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201cRule 15-505. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac\">\u201c(a) Notice.\u2014A court may not issue a preliminary injunction without notice to all parties and an opportunity for a full adversary hearing on the propriety of its issuance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayq\">Since the injunctive portion of the May 14th order was not issued in accordance with the rules, it must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Alternatively, even if the injunctive portion of the May 14th order had been issued in compliance with Rules 15-501 through 15-505, reversal would be required under the provisions of Art. 49B. The statutory provisions applicable to the Human Relations Commission do not authorize such an order at the time and under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In contending that it was authorized to seek the compliance portion of the May 14th order, and that the circuit court was authorized to grant its request, the Commission relies upon Art. 49B, \u00a7 12(a). That subsection provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u201c\u00a7 12. Enforcement of Commission\u2019s orders; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">\u201c(a) If any respondent refuses to comply with an order of the Commission made within the scope of any of these subtitles, the Commission may, represented by its general counsel, institute litigation in the appropriate equity court of the county or in Baltimore City where the alleged discrimination took place to enforce compliance with any of the provisions of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">\u201cThe court, in hearing said case, shall be governed by the judicial review standards as set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">The Commission\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 12(a) is misplaced for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">First, the Commission filed no pleading which could reasonably be construed as the institution of an enforcement action under \u00a7 12(a). The mere submission of a proposed order to be signed by a judge, in response to the other side\u2019s motion to reconsider the denial of a stay, can hardly be viewed as the \u201cinstitution of] litigation ... to enforce compliance with any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>of the provisions of this article.\u201d The Legislature did not provide in Art. 49B, \u00a7 12(a), that whenever \u201cany respondent\u201d institutes an action for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision, there is automatically an enforcement action before the court, and that the court can order compliance under \u00a7 12(a) without a request by the Commission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Second, and more importantly, \u00a7 12(a) states that, \u201cin hearing\u201d the Commission\u2019s enforcement action, the court shall be governed by the judicial review standards of the Administrative Procedure Act, Code (1984, 1995 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-222(g) of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, it is obvious that Art. 49B, \u00a7 12(a), contemplates that a court decision, mandating compliance with the Commission\u2019s order, be rendered only after the court applies the judicial review standards of the Administrative Procedure Act. A court order under \u00a7 12(a) cannot properly be rendered until the court has performed its judicial review function and determined, in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>of the issues raised by the parties, whether the administrative decision should be upheld under the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act and enforced. Art. 49B, \u00a7 12(a), does not authorize interlocutory compliance pending judicial review in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The only provision of Art. 49B authorizing the commission to seek, and the court to grant, relief of an interlocutory nature is \u00a7 4. Art. 49B, \u00a7 4, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">\u201c\u00a7 4. Power to bring civil actions for temporary injunction; where brought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">\u201cAt any time after a complaint has been filed, if the Commission believes that appropriate civil action is necessary to preserve the status of the parties or to prevent irreparable harm from the time the complaint is filed until the time of its final disposition, the Commission may bring action to obtain a temporary injunction. The action shall be brought in the circuit court for the county where the place of public accommodation which is the subject of the alleged discrimination is located, or where the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have occurred, or where the dwelling which is the subject of the alleged discrimination is located.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4h\">This Court in <em>St. Comm\u2019n On Human Rel. v. Amecom Div., </em>278 Md. 120, 125, 860 A.2d 1, 5 (1976), held that, by enacting Art. 49B, \u00a7 4, \u201cthe Legislature created an action based on what amounts to a new substantive right.\u201d The Court went on to say that \u00a7 4</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">\u201cprovides a remedy based, not upon a preexisting right, in this case the right to be free from acts of discrimination in employment, but upon the mere filing of a complaint alleging discriminatory acts. Such an interlocutory remedy, available without a determination on the merits that a preexisting right exists, cannot, then, constitute simply a new method for enforcement of the undetermined right, but must instead be deemed itself to create in effect a new substantive right.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">The Court in <em>Amecom </em>held that, under circumstances where \u00a7 4 was inapplicable because the alleged discrimination in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>employment occurred prior to the effective date of \u00a7 4, the Commission had no right to obtain interlocutory judicial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Consequently, Art. 49B, \u00a7 4, appears to be the only avenue for the Commission to obtain interlocutory relief from a court. In the instant case, the Commission has eschewed any reliance on \u00a7 4. In addition, the Commission filed no pleading seeking relief under \u00a7 4, and it made no showing that a preliminary injunction was necessary to prevent irreparable injury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, the Commission has invoked \u00a7 12(a), which does not authorize the relief granted in the May 14th, 1996, order. In sum, the injunctive provision of the May 14th order was not authorized by statute and was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\n<em>ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED IN PART, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MARYLAND COMMISSION ON HUMAN RELATIONS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\">.
