We shall hold that the trial court\u2019s failure to advise a defendant who is planning to plead guilty of parole consequences does not render a plea invalid because parole consequences are collateral rather than direct consequences of a guilty plea. We shall further hold that Petitioner failed to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because the prejudice prong of <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985), has not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">David T. Yoswick, Petitioner, was indicted by the Grand Jury for Carroll County on twenty counts of criminal activity. On August 31,1992, pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to attempted first degree murder, Maryland Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>(1957, 1996 RepLVol.) Article 27, \u00a7 407<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and kidnapping, Article 27, \u00a7 337. In exchange for the plea, the State recommended and the court imposed a life sentence with all but forty years suspended on the attempted murder charge, and all but thirty years suspended on the kidnapping charge, to be served concurrently. As part of the plea agreement, the State entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to the remaining eighteen charges, and also agreed to recommend to other Maryland jurisdictions with pending charges stemming from this incident that they drop their charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yoswick could have received up to life plus seventy years in prison on the Carroll County charges, and his exposure on the charges in the other jurisdictions was estimated to be approximately one hundred years.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On April 14, 1994, Yoswick filed a Petition for Post Conviction Relief, and on August 15, 1994, he filed an amended petition. The post conviction court denied relief, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion, and this Court granted certiorari to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEk\">Whether a defendant who pleads guilty and receives a life sentence with a portion suspended must be informed of the parole ramifications of the plea, and is the plea involuntary in any event if the defendant is wrongly informed by counsel about the requirements for parole eligibility?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">We recount the facts surrounding the crimes. On February 25, 1992, Petitioner kidnapped Frank Storch from a Howard County motel, took him to another motel, handcuffed him, and kept him locked in the bathroom overnight. The following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>afternoon Yoswick drove Storch against his -will to Carroll County. Upon arriving at their destination, Yoswick helped Storch out of the car, pulled out a knife, and stabbed Storch in the stomach. Storch managed to escape temporarily, but was caught by Yoswick at a nearby creek, where Yoswick then attempted to drown Storch by holding his head under water. After initially struggling, Storch ceased resisting and went limp in a ploy to convince Yoswick that he was dead. Yoswick released Storch, and left the scene. Storch got up and staggered to a nearby road where a passerby assisted him and took him to the Maryland Shock Trauma Unit, where he was treated for a severe abdominal wound, hand lacerations, and back and knee injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">On February 27, 1992, Yoswick drove to a landfill in Baltimore City and discarded a large plastic bag containing some of Storch\u2019s possessions, including Storch\u2019s driver\u2019s license, private investigator\u2019s license, credit cards, photographs, and a bloody shirt. Shortly thereafter, Yoswick was indicted by the Grand Jury for Carroll County in a twenty-count indictment, including attempted first degree murder, robbery and kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Before the court accepted Yoswick\u2019s guilty plea, he was questioned extensively regarding his understanding of the plea. At that time, neither the court nor Yoswick\u2019s counsel discussed with him the parole consequences of his plea. The colloquy went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May I qualify my client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">THE COURT: Please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: David, first of all, how old are you, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">YOSWICK: Twenty-five years old\u2014of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And how far did you go in school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-14\">YOSWICK: Twelfth grade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Are you able, then, to read and write and understand the English language?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>YOSWICK: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9B\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Are you, today, under the influence of any drugs or alcohol or any other substance that would impair your ability to understand today\u2019s proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5P\">YOSWICK: No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. Yoswick, first of all, you understand that you have an absolute right to have a trial, which includes the right to have a trial by jury. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">YOSWICK: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">1 H* sjs $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you understand that you also have a right to waive a jury trial and to proceed with a court trial, in which case the court would have to be convinced of your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt before you could be convicted. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">YOSWICK: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you understand that whether you elected to have a jury trial or a court trial, in either event, you could force the State to prove its case against you.

Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">YOSWICK: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If you had a trial, you, likewise, would have the right to testify if you elected to. However, no one could force you to testify, and if you made an election not to, neither the court in a court trial nor a jury in a jury trial would be able to use that as evidence of your guilt. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>YOSWICK: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you understand, further, that in exchange for your Plea to the first two counts\u2014first of all, the State will nol-pros Counts Three through Twenty of the Indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">The Court has agreed on Count One to sentence you to a period of Life, suspending all but forty years; and with respect to the Second Count to sentence you to a period of thirty years to run concurrent with the forty-year sentence.

The circuit court (Beck, J.) held an evidentiary hearing on the post conviction petition. Yoswick testified that he spoke with his trial attorney in August 1992, and she told him that if he accepted the State\u2019s plea offer, his sentence would be forty years and he would be eligible for parole after ten years. He further testified that he was never told that with a life sentence, all but forty years suspended, he would not be eligible for parole until after he had served fifteen years, nor was he told that he needed the Governor\u2019s approval to be paroled. He said that had he been advised correctly, he would not have pleaded guilty. His trial counsel also testified at the hearing. She stated that the original plea agreement was for a straight forty-year sentence and that she had called the parole commission and learned that an inmate must serve approximately one-fourth of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole. The plea agreement was later changed to a life sentence with all but forty years suspended. Defense counsel could not remember if she told Yoswick about parole eligibility restrictions imposed by Maryland Code (1957, 1990 RephVol.), Article 41, \u00a7 4-516(b), the statutory provision in effect at the time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The post conviction court rejected Petitioner\u2019s claims, concluding that the plea was knowing and voluntary. The court found that Petitioner had been apprised of the nature of the charges against him and the consequences of the plea. The court concluded that the requirement that an accused be informed of the \u201cconsequences of the plea\u201d means that an accused must be informed only of the \u201cdirect\u201d consequences of pleading guilty. Concluding that parole eligibility was not a direct consequence, the court determined that the defendant need not be informed of parole eligibility. Finally, assuming arguendo that defense counsel had misadvised Yoswick as to his parole eligibility, the post conviction court found that Yoswick was not denied effective assistance of counsel because he failed to satisfy the prejudice prong under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). The court rejected Yoswick\u2019s claim that had he been properly advised, he would not have pleaded guilty. Rather, Judge Beck specifically found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">With regard to the five (5) year discrepancy as to parole eligibility, the Court concludes that the defense was not prejudiced and a different outcome would not have resulted. Simply stated, the Court does not believe Petitioner\u2019s self-serving statement that he would not have pled guilty had he known the actual date for parole eligibility. Without the plea bargain, Petitioner faced a possible maximum sentence of life imprisonment plus seventy years. Additionally, there were charges arising out of this incident pending in Howard and Anne Arundel Counties which carried additional penalties totaling more than one hundred (100) years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel vigorously defended him at a lengthy motions hearing after which she was able to secure what, in the Court\u2019s estimation, was an exceptionally generous plea bargain from the State limiting the period of incarceration to forty (40) years. Further, the pending charges in Howard and Anne Arundel Counties were resolved in such a manner that Petitioner received no additional period of incarceration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">The potential period of incarceration which Petitioner avoided by pleading guilty greatly outweighs the five (5) year differential in parole eligibility. Although Petitioner claims he would not have pled guilty had he known the truth, the Court finds this statement to be self-serving at best. Indeed, after applying the objective standard of review mandated by <em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>[326 Md. 367, 605 A.2d 103 (1992) ] the Court cannot conclude that Petitioner suffered any prejudice as a result of the five (5) year discrepancy. Similarly, the Court cannot conclude that a different result would have been reached had Petitioner known the true parole eligibility date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The Court of Special Appeals granted Yoswick\u2019s application for leave to appeal and held that a defendant must be advised only of direct consequences of a plea of guilty, and not collateral consequences. The intermediate appellate court held that parole eligibility is a collateral consequence of a plea of guilty and, accordingly, the trial court is not required to furnish a defendant with information about parole eligibility in order for a plea to be voluntary. We agree and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Before this Court, Yoswick contends that his guilty plea was not entered voluntarily, \u201cwith understanding of the consequences of the plea\u201d as required by Maryland Rule 4-242(c). In support of this contention, he alleges that he was never informed of two particular consequences of his plea, namely, the fifteen-year period of parole ineligibility and the necessity of first obtaining the Governor\u2019s approval before he could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>paroled. <em>See </em>Art. 41, \u00a7 4-516. Petitioner contends that parole eligibility is a direct consequence of a guilty plea and, as a result, the failure of the court or counsel to provide such information renders his plea involuntary. He claims that his attorney told him that he would be eligible for parole in ten years and that this advice was so deficient that it rose to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, Petitioner argues, he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance because there is a substantial possibility that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known that he would have to serve fifteen years of his sentence before becoming parole eligible. In response, the State argues that parole ineligibility is a collateral rather than a direct consequence of a guilty plea, and therefore, the failure of the circuit court to advise him of any parole ramifications did not render his plea involuntary. The State further contends that even if Yoswiek\u2019s counsel was deficient, Yoswick suffered no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">To be valid, a plea of guilty must be made voluntarily and intelligently, <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711, 23 L.Ed.2d 274, 279 (1969), with knowledge of the direct consequences of the plea. <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1472, 25 L.Ed.2d 747, 760 (1970); <em>Hudson v. State, </em>286 Md. 569, 595, 409 A.2d 692, 705 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 845, 101 S.Ct. 128, 66 L.Ed.2d 53 (1980) . To ensure that a plea is valid, Maryland Rule 4-242 requires either the court or counsel to ask the defendant questions concerning the voluntariness of the plea. Maryland Rule 4-242(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">The court may accept a plea of guilty only after it determines, upon an examination of the defendant on the record in open court conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof, that (1) the defendant is pleading voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea; and (2) there is a factual basis for the plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>A direct consequence of a guilty plea has been defined as one that has \u201ca definite, immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendant\u2019s punishment.\u201d <em>Cuthrell v. Director, Patuxent Inst., </em>475 F.2d 1364, 1366 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1005, 94 S.Ct. 362, 38 L.Ed.2d 241 (1973). The imposition of a sentence may have a number of collateral consequences and a plea of guilty is not rendered involuntary in the constitutional sense if the defendant is not informed of the collateral consequences. <em>Strader v. Garrison, </em>611 F.2d 61, 63 (4th Cir.1979). Due Process does not require that a defendant be advised of the indirect or collateral consequences of a guilty plea, even if the consequences are foreseeable. <em>Parry v. Rosemeyer, </em>64 F.3d 110, 114 (3rd Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 734, 133 L.Ed.2d 684 (1996). Accordingly, under Maryland Rule 4-242, the consequences of the plea include only direct consequences, not collateral or indirect consequences. <em>See Moore v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 524, 526, 531 A.2d 1026, 1027 (1987) (concluding the possibility of an enhanced sentence is a collateral consequence); <em>Daley v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 486, 489, 487 A.2d 320, 322 (1985) (reasoning deportation is a collateral consequence). Numerous other jurisdictions have also made this distinction. <em>See Parry, </em>64 F.3d at 114; <em>United States v. Campusano, </em>947 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1991); <em>United States v.

Action No. J-95-63, </em>183 Ariz. 228, 231, 902 P.2d 834, 837 (App.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Whether parole eligibility is to be considered a direct or collateral consequence of a guilty plea is an issue of first impression for this Court. Parole eligibility typically is considered a collateral consequence and thus, information about parole eligibility is not among those consequences that a defendant must understand at the time a plea is entered. It appears \u201cwell settled that the Constitution does not require that a defendant be provided with information concerning parole eligibility.\u201d <em>Meyers v. Gillis, </em>93 F.3d 1147, 1153 (3rd Cir.1996) (citing <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 56, 106 S.Ct. 366, 369, 88 L.Ed.2d 203, 208 (1985)); <em>see also King v. Dutton, </em>17 F.3d 151, 154 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>512 U.S. 1222, 114 S.Ct. 2712, 129 L.Ed.2d 838 (1994); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>636 F.2d 122, 123 (5th Cir. Unit A Feb.1981) (per curiam); <em>Hunter v. Fogg, </em>616 F.2d 55, 61 (2nd Cir.1980); <em>Strader, </em>611 F.2d at 63. Because parole is a collateral consequence of a guilty plea, the failure of the trial court to advise the defendant concerning parole eligibility does not render a plea involuntary or invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Parole eligibility falls within the province of the Parole Commission and the executive branch, and not within the jurisdiction of the courts. Moreover, parole eligibility lacks the definite, immediate, and largely automatic characteristics that define a direct consequence. Parole depends on many factors beyond the control of the courts, ranging from diminution credits earned to the exercise of discretion by the Parole Commission. Accordingly, we hold today that parole eligibility is not a direct consequence of a plea and thus it follows that a defendant need not be informed of parole ramifications for a guilty plea to be voluntary. This same conclusion has been reached by numerous other courts, and has been implicitly recognized by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 56, 106 S.Ct. at 369, 88 L.Ed.2d at 208 (\u201cWe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>have never held that the United States Constitution requires the State to furnish a defendant with information about parole eligibility in order for the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to be voluntary____\u201d); <em>United States v. Sanclemente-Bejarano, </em>861 F.2d 206, 209 (9th Cir.1988) (holding, consistent with <em>Hill </em>and with \u201cevery other circuit that has addressed the question,\u201d that Fed.R.Crim.P: 11(c) does not require trial courts to inform a defendant of parole eligibility consequences of a guilty plea); <em>Brown v. Perini, </em>718 F.2d 784, 788 (6th Cir.1983) (\u201cThis Circuit has expressly declined to consider parole eligibility a direct consequence of a guilty plea.\u201d); <em>Strader, </em>611 F.2d at 63 (\u201cOrdinarily, parole eligibility is ... an indirect and collateral consequence, of which a defendant need not be specifically advised by the court or counsel before entering a plea of guilty.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Perhaps recognizing that the non-automatic nature of parole eligibility weighs strongly in favor of considering parole ramifications to be collateral consequences of a plea, Petitioner contends that the trial court in essence imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years. He argues that when he received a life sentence of all but forty years suspended he received a mandatory term of incarceration of fifteen years because Article 41, \u00a7 4-516 requires that he serve fifteen years before becoming eligible for parole. A mandatory minimum sentence is a direct consequence of a guilty plea, and a defendant must therefore be advised of a mandatory minimum sentence in order for the plea to be valid. <em>E.g., Hunter, </em>616 F.2d at 61. Thus, Petitioner continues, his plea was invalid because he was not informed of the mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">We disagree and conclude that Petitioner did not receive a mandatory minimum sentence. A mandatory minimum sentence is one where the court has no discretion on whether to impose a particular or automatic sentence. <em>State ex. rel. Sonner v. Shearin, </em>272 Md. 502, 518-19, 325 A.2d 573, 582 (1974); <em>State v. Coban, </em>520 So.2d 40, 42 (Fla.1988); <em>see, e.g., </em>Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 36B, 36H-6, 281A, 643C. In this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>trial court did exercise its discretion and imposed a sentence of life with all but forty years suspended. The provisions of Article 41, \u00a7 4-516 relating to parole eligibility do not convert this sentence into a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years. <em>See Sanclemente-Bejarano, </em>861 F.2d at 208-09 (rejecting similar contention by the defendant in that case). Furthermore, Article 41, \u00a7 4-516 does not change the nature of parole eligibility to make it an automatic, definite, and immediate consequence of pleading guilty. Thus, the failure to advise the defendant of the parole restrictions imposed by Article 41, \u00a7 4-516 does not render his plea invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The case of <em>United States v. Posner, </em>865 F.2d 654 (5th Cir.1989), is strikingly similar to the instant case. Posner argued that his guilty plea to aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute more than one hundred kilograms of marijuana was involuntary because he was not advised that his sentence was controlled by a federal statute which expressly provided that the offense was not parolable. Finding Posner\u2019s contention to be without merit, the Fifth Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">The test for determining whether a guilty plea is voluntary is \u201cwhether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, [56] 106 S.Ct. 366, 369, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). The failure to advise a defendant of collateral consequences of a plea of guilty does not render it involuntary. <em>Holloway v. Lynaugh, 838 F.2d </em>792, 794 (5th Cir.1988). A defendant need not be furnished with information about parole eligibility in order for his guilty plea to be voluntary and the current rules of procedure governing the entry of guilty pleas in the federal courts do not require it. <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 5[6], 106 S.Ct. at 369.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Petitioner argues in the alternative that even if the trial court had no duty to advise him of the parole ramifications of his guilty plea, his counsel\u2019s failure to advise him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>properly renders his plea involuntary. Petitioner relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morales v. State, </em>325 Md. 330, 600 A.2d 851 (1992), but his argument rests on an overbroad reading of that case. In <em>Morales, </em>we held that the defendant did not knowingly waive his constitutional right to testify in his own defense when his decision to remain silent appeared to result from incorrect information provided by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 600 A.2d at 853. Recognizing that the trial judge had no initial duty to advise the defendant, we held that when the judge proceeded to give such advice, a duty was imposed upon the court that the advice not be erroneous. This case is distinguishable from <em>Morales. </em>In this case, the trial judge discharged his duties properly. As we have indicated, the trial court has no duty to inform the defendant of parole ramifications. This is not a case in which the trial court has provided a defendant with misinformation regarding parole, and we leave that issue for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We turn next to Petitioner\u2019s claim that his counsel\u2019s misadvice concerning parole deprived him of effective assistance of counsel. The Sixth Amendment protects a defendant\u2019s right to counsel. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 684, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 691 (1984); <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 345, 83 S.Ct. 792, 797, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, 806 (1963). Moreover, this guarantee of the right to counsel is hollow without \u201cthe right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 686, 104 S.Ct. at 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d at 692 (quoting <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 n. 14, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 1449 n. 14, 25 L.Ed.2d 763, 773 n. 14 (1970)). In order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a guilty plea setting, Petitioner must satisfy the requirements of <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985), and must \u201cprove that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 283, 681 A.2d 30, 43 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 117 S.Ct. 742, 136 L.Ed.2d 681 (1997); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>also Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 369, 113 S.Ct. 838, 842, 122 L.Ed.2d 180, 189 (1993) (concluding that analysis in ineffective assistance of counsel cases that focuses solely on outcome determination, rather than the fundamental fairness or reliability of the proceeding, is deficient). In evaluating the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Supreme Court opined that \u201c[t]he object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel\u2019s performance. If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d at 699; <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 284, 681 A.2d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985), the Supreme Court addressed a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of a guilty plea and held that the <em>Strickland </em>two-prong test applied to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 57, 106 S.Ct. at 370, 88 L.Ed.2d at 209. The Court explained that in order to satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d requirement, the defendant must show that but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>Id. </em>at 59, 106 S.Ct. at 370, 88 L.Ed.2d at 209; <em>see also Armstead v. Scott, </em>37 F.3d 202, 210-11 (5th Cir.1994) (applying <em>Lockhart v. Fretwell </em>analysis, 506 U.S. 364, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993), along with the <em>Hill v. Lockhart </em>analysis, 474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985), holding that a guilty plea was not rendered unreliable or fundamentally unfair when petitioner claimed that he would not have pleaded guilty absent the misadvice from his counsel concerning the benefits of his plea), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1071, 115 S.Ct. 1709, 131 L.Ed.2d 570 (1995). The Supreme Court in <em>Hill </em>also explained that in resolving the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the analysis \u201cshould be made objectively, without regard for the \u2018idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker.\u2019\u201d <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 60, 106 S.Ct. at 371, 88 L.Ed.2d at 211 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698). Accordingly, applying the <em>Strickland </em>test that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Court applied to ineffective assistance claims in <em>Bowers v. State, </em>320 Md. 416, 426-27, 578 A.2d 734, 739 (1990), the defendant must show that there is a \u201csubstantial possibility\u201d that but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted upon going to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We assume without deciding, as did the circuit court, that defense counsel erroneously informed Yoswick that he would be eligible for parole after serving ten years and that she did not inform him of the need to obtain the Governor\u2019s approval. We need not address the question of whether counsel\u2019s advice constituted deficient representation because we find that Yoswick has failed to show that he was prejudiced by the advice. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d at 699; <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 284-85, 681 A.2d at 43-44. Notwithstanding Yoswick\u2019s testimony that he would have proceeded to trial had he known of the parole eligibility consequences of his plea, the trial court simply did not believe him and we cannot say that credibility determination was clearly erroneous. From an objective perspective, we do not believe that a reasonable defendant in Yoswick\u2019s shoes would have insisted on going to trial even with the benefit of parole eligibility information. The post conviction court found Yoswick\u2019s testimony \u201cself-serving.\u201d Likewise, we look askance at his claim that he would have proceeded to trial for the same reasons stated by the post conviction court, and also because Yoswick did not indicate any concern about his parole eligibility until he filed his Amended Petition for Post Conviction Relief on August 15, 1994, almost 2 years after he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Yoswick\u2019s bare allegation that he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial had he received accurate information concerning his parole eligibility, when considered in the context of the extremely lengthy sentences facing him and in light of the self-serving nature of such a statement, is not sufficient to establish prejudice. Yoswick faced the possibility of a life sentence plus seventy years. Furthermore, he faced the possibility of additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>sentences of approximately one hundred years in Howard and Anne Arundel Counties. By pleading guilty, Petitioner received a life sentence with all but forty years suspended and a concurrent sentence of thirty years. Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea resulted in a sentence significantly shorter than the maximum, and the possibility of facing additional charges in other counties was eliminated. The record does not reflect any reluctance on Petitioner\u2019s part to plead guilty and he clearly received the benefit of his bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The potential strength of the State\u2019s case is also relevant in determining whether a defendant would have insisted on going to trial. <em>Ostrander v. Green, </em>46 F.3d 347, 356 (4th Cir.1995) (noting that the potential strength of a state\u2019s case must inform analysis, inasmuch as a reasonable defendant would surely take it into account)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; <em>see Armstead, </em>37 F.3d at 206. Yoswick\u2019s trial counsel recognized that the evidence in the case against Yoswick was overwhelming. The victim, Storch, was alive and available to testify against Yoswick. Two other witnesses saw Yoswick drive to a landfill to dispose of bags containing some of Storch\u2019s personal belongings, and those witnesses could either identify Yoswick or at least describe the car he drove. The child of Karen Sue Pulido, a/k/a Karen Sue Llewelyn, Yoswick\u2019s co-defendant, had identified as belonging to Yoswick a distinctive item found at the location where Yoswick had attempted to drown Storch. Furthermore, the State possessed a document describing plans for a murder, as well as written communication between Yoswick and his co-defendant expressing the belief that \u201cif <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>they be quiet, things will be okay.\u201d In short, the case against Yoswick was, as his counsel testified, \u201coverwhelming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Petitioner received additional benefits from his plea as well. By pleading guilty to the charges, Petitioner received a life sentence with all but forty years suspended and thirty years concurrent. In contrast to a straight life sentence, the Division of Corrections considers the sentence as a fixed term of confinement for purposes of mandatory supervision. Accordingly, Petitioner received a mandatory supervision date.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If Petitioner had received a straight life sentence, he would not have been given a mandatory supervision date.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Petitioner\u2019s final allegation is that he must first serve fifteen years before becoming eligible for parole under Article 41, \u00a7 4-516. The Parole Commission determines parole eligibility for prisoners serving life sentences pursuant to Article 41, \u00a7 4-516, and as a result, Petitioner is correct that Article 41, \u00a7 4-516 applies to a life sentence. <em>See Hanson v. Hughes, </em>52 Md.App. 246, 253, 447 A.2d 892, 895-96, <em>aff'd, </em>294 Md. 599, 451 A.2d 664 (1982). Petitioner is incorrect, however, that he must necessarily serve fifteen years before he becomes eligible for parole. Article 41, \u00a7 4-516(b)(l) provided that Petitioner is eligible for parole consideration after he \u201chas served 15 years or the equal of 15 years when considering the allowances for diminution of period of confinement provided for in Article 27, \u00a7 700 and Article 27, \u00a7 638C of the Code.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Under Article 27, \u00a7 700, the statute governing good conduct diminution credit, a prisoner is awarded good conduct credit at the beginning of his sentence, and thus Petitioner was initially awarded five days of good conduct credit for each month he is to serve. Therefore, in reality, he could become eligible for parole in less than fifteen years.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>further reduced the time period by earning educational, industrial, or special project diminution credits. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 700(e), (f), (h); COMAR 12.02.06.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">While we do not decide whether defense counsel\u2019s performance constitutes deficient representation, we hold that Petitioner\u2019s claim that his guilty plea deprived him of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel fails because Petitioner has not demonstrated that had his counsel properly informed him, he would not have pleaded guilty and instead insisted upon going to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
