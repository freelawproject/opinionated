Hollis, Jr., a member of the bar of this Court. Hollis was charged with violating the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct: Rule 1.15;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rule 8.1;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>8.4(c) and (d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, he was charged with violating three of the Maryland Rules relating to attorney trust accounts <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and with violating Maryland Code (1989, 1995 Repl. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Vol.), \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Pursuant to Rule 16-707, this Court on January 2, 1996, ordered that the charges against Hollis be transmitted to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and we designated Circuit Judge Richard T. Rombro to hear the charges. Our January 2, 1996, order further directed that Hollis respond to the charges within 15 days from the date the charges were served upon him, and that the hearing before Judge Rombro be held not later than 30 days from the filing of Hollis\u2019s response. Subsequently this Court, upon the Commission\u2019s motion and without any objection from Hollis, entered an order extending the time for a hearing until April 22,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Prior to the scheduled hearing on April 22,1996, Hollis filed a \u201cMotion For Recusal of Judge Richard T. Rombro,\u201d asserting a \u201clack of impartiality on the part of Judge Rombro.\u201d The alleged \u201clack of impartiality\u201d appeared to be based upon two specific matters: (1) Judge Rombro\u2019s overruling Hollis\u2019s attorney\u2019s objection to the April 22, 1996, hearing date because it was not convenient for the attorney; (2) the fact that Hollis did not support Judge Rombro\u2019s candidacy, as a sitting judge, for election to the circuit court in 1990. This Court, by an order of March 26, 1996, denied the motion for the recusal of Judge Rombro. Thereafter, Hollis filed a \u201crenewed\u201d motion for the recusal of Judge Rombro which this Court denied on April 8,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The hearing commenced on April 22, 1996. Subsequently, Judge Rombro made the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">\u201cThis Attorney Grievance matter was referred to this court by the Court of Appeals on January 2, 1996, in accordance with Rule BV-9 et seq. to conduct a hearing and to report the findings of fact and conclusions of law to the Court of Appeals. The referral followed the filing of a petition for disciplinary action against the Respondent, Meldon S. Hollis, Jr. by the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\u201cThe Respondent filed a motion asking for recusal of the trial court in the Court of Appeals. This motion was denied. Thereafter, the Respondent filed a second motion requesting the same relief, which was again denied. Following this, hearings were held before this court on April 22nd and April 23rd of 1996. The Respondent appeared with counsel, and at the outset addressed a third motion for recusal to this court. The court declined to rule on Respondent\u2019s motion for the reason that it was within the province of the Court of Appeals, which had twice denied the same motion. The court did explain that even if the motion was proper, there was no basis for recusal. After these preliminaries, the court took testimony from Bar Counsel and the Respondent and herewith submits the following report to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\n<em>\u201cFINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\u201cThe Complainant, Dr. Leroy Amar, testified that he had been represented by the Respondent since sometime in 1987. Dr. Amar had met the Respondent while Respondent was a member of his previous law firm. The doctor testified that the Respondent represented him over a period of years on numerous complex matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">\u201cAmar testified that in 1990 he had borrowed $150,000.00 from one Ramona Cowan, who was a personal friend. He was to repay the loan with interest at an annual rate of eighteen percent. He testified that he had made payments over a period of years, primarily on the interest and had not been able to repay the principal. In 1991 the lender, M\u2019s Cowan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>died in an automobile accident and the loan to Dr. Amar was included as an asset in her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">\u201cOn January 6, 1992, Dr. Amar sold three of his four medical clinics for approximately one million dollars. The doctor took back a mortgage and the buyer was to pay $200,000.00 at the time of the settlement. Most of the $200,-000.00 was used to pay off debts of the clinic so that the sale could be concluded. After the payment of debts, there were net proceeds of $40,000.00 to be paid to Dr. Amar. As part of Amar\u2019s agreement with the buyer, he was also to receive a $50,000.00 loan. At the time of settlement then, based on the proceeds and the loan, Amar was to receive $90,000.00. An additional $3,450.00 was withheld to pay an existing tax lien against the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">\u201cAmar clearly testified that his instructions to the Respondent were that the $90,000.00 was to be forwarded to the Estate of M\u2019s Cowan, to be applied to the balance due her.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\u201cOn January 9, 1992, Respondent wrote to the law firm of Siskind, Burch, Grady &amp; Rosen, who represented the purchaser. The letter set forth the understanding of the distribution of funds. The Respondent requested from the Siskind firm a certified check payable to Hollis &amp; Associates, P.A., in the amount of $40,095.49. He also requested the amount of $3,450.00, which had been withheld to satisfy a tax lien, but which was apparently not necessary. On that same date, January 9, 1992, the Siskind firm issued its Check No. 1015 drawn on the First National Bank in the amount of $40,095.49 payable to Hollis &amp; Associates, and forwarded it to the Respondent. The Respondent received that check and deposited it in his account in the First American Bank of Maryland/First Union National Bank on January 10, 1992. The loan to Dr. Amar was advanced by separate check, No. 1016, drawn on the Escrow Account of the Siskind firm on January 10, 1992, and was forwarded to Respondent. That check was also payable to Hollis <em>&amp; </em>Associates, P.A. It was received on January 13, 1992 by the Respondent and deposited into the same account as the earlier check. Finally, Check No. 1017, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>again drawn on the Escrow Account of the Siskind firm, in the amount of $3,450.00, which had been withheld for the outstanding tax lien, was forwarded to the Respondent. Check No. 1017 was also payable to Hollis &amp; Associates, P.A., and was received by the Respondent on January 13, 1992, who deposited it into the account referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">\u201cThe daughter of Ramona Cowan was employed by Dr. Amar in an office in Washington, D.C. Dr. Amar testified that in a conversation with the daughter he was told that the lawyer for the estate was upset because no monies had been paid to the estate. Dr. Amar thereupon contacted the Respondent and asked why the money had not been paid. The Respondent advised the doctor that he had made the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">\u201cBased on Respondent\u2019s representations, Dr. Amar told M\u2019s Cowan\u2019s daughter that, in fact, the money had been paid to the estate. Dr. Amar testified that he had occasion to speak directly to the Executor of the Estate, who informed him again that no money had been paid. Dr. Amar thereupon contacted the Respondent and asked the Respondent to produce cancelled checks or other proof of payment so that he could show it to the Executor. The court believes from Dr. Amar\u2019s testimony that the request to the Respondent for the proof of payment was not made in a confrontational manner; that the doctor believed that the Executor was mistaken, and wished to show her the proof of payment. The Respondent, according to Dr. Amar, promised to obtain and present such proof to him. The Respondent did not deny Dr. Amar\u2019s testimony in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\u201cSometime later, the Respondent finally acknowledged that he had not made any payments on behalf of Dr. Amar to the Estate of M\u2019s. Cowan. During the course of those discussions Dr. Amar learned for the first time that the $3,450.00 amount which had been withheld for the tax lien was also in the Respondent\u2019s account. The Respondent agreed to send this amount to Dr. Amar with interest, which was done and received by Dr. Amar sometime in August of 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u201cOn May 28, 1993, Dr. Amar filed a complaint against the Respondent with the Attorney Grievance Commission alleging that Respondent had failed to pay the Estate of M\u2019s Cowan as he had been instructed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">\u201cThereafter Bar Counsel began an investigation of the matter and throughout the course of counsel\u2019s investigation the Respondent gave several conflicting reasons for his actions in connection with the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">\u201cBar Counsel\u2019s letter of September 14, 1993 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 9), requested bank records of the Respondent\u2019s Escrow Account to ascertain the status of Dr. Amar\u2019s funds. On September 21, 1993, the Respondent acknowledged receipt of the request (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 11), and thereafter, on November 2, 1993, refused to provide the requested bank records (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 12). In explaining his reasons for non-compliance with the Petitioner\u2019s request, the Respondent made the puzzling statement, \u2018First, the funds that Dr. Amar alleges are owed to him have in no way been connected with my escrow account since January of 1991 ... It is known by Dr. Amar and his attorney, and not disputed by me, that the funds were removed from the account and invested ... The fact that the funds were moved into an investment account to be held pending resolution of the amount due to our firm, was communicated both to Dr. Amar and his counsel.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\u201cThe Commission immediately responded to the November 2nd letter and on November 4, 1993, (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 13), again requested specific bank records and directed that the Respondent reply by November 10th. On that date the Respondent did reply and asked for additional time to provide an accurate accounting of the funds held on behalf of Dr. Amar. The Respondent requested until November 15th to reply. In the November 10th letter the Respondent partially complied with some of the Commission\u2019s requests. As to one item Respondent replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u20184. In addition you have requested a complete accounting of funds \u201cheld, maintained or invested, including an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>accounting of any interest earned on the investment, how the interest was disbursed and to whom\u201d. It is my recollection that the subject funds were held in the escrow account for several months. It is also my recollection that several disbursements were made out of the escrow account to Dr. Amar and to other parties including government agencies. After several months, those funds were removed from the escrow account at the instruction of and with the full knowledge of the client.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Although the response is couched in terms of a \u2018recollection\u2019 rather than simple declarative statement, the court finds that this recounting of events was false. The spreadsheet summary of the Respondent\u2019s bank records and the testimony of the Petitioner\u2019s investigator clearly showed there were no such payments made either to Dr. Amar or on his behalf from this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\u201cThe spreadsheet summary of Respondent\u2019s account was obtained by Bar Counsel by subpoena. These records were reviewed for the period from December 31, 1991 through February 28, 1994. The records show that the account was closed on June 25, 1992, when there was a remaining balance of $8.15. The records also show that no payments had been made out of that account on behalf of Dr. Amar; rather, the records disclose that between January 10, 1992 and June 25, 1995 the Respondent transferred large sums from the escrow account to his own operating account and made direct payments for professional expenses for the benefit of his law office. They also show a transaction of April 15, 1992 in the amount of $82,781.00 withdrawn from the escrow account. These are the funds that the Respondent said he had invested. Finally, the records show that the escrow account was an interest-bearing account and that $1757.28 in interest had been credited to the account, which was not paid to Dr. Amar.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\u201cThe evidence is uneontradicted that by February, 1994, more than two years after the Respondent had received the funds on behalf of his client, no payments had been made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the Estate of Ramona Cowan or to the Complainant or for any other purpose for the Complainant\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">\u201cThe Respondent indicated that the monies withdrawn had been invested in a stock named Pyrocap, which was being held in trust at Tameron Investment Corporation for the benefit of Dr. Amar. The court finds that this statement also was not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\u201cIn Respondent\u2019s letter of March 10, 1992, (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 3) Respondent alleged that there was a fee dispute with Dr. Amar which caused him to withhold funds. The Respondent testified as to the fee dispute in general terms and never identified for the court what amount he claimed was in dispute. This court finds that there was no fee dispute, and that the issue was advanced by the Respondent as an excuse for not having paid the funds to Dr. Amar. In any event, it is clear that the entire amount was not in dispute as a result of a fee controversy; assuming the Respondent would have been able to hold a disputed amount pending resolution, he certainly could not hold the entire $82,781.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\u201cRespondent also testified before the Inquiry Panel. At that hearing for the first time Respondent explained that Dr. Amar had loaned the money to him. Although there is no transcript of those proceedings, both Dr. Amar and bar counsel\u2019s witness, Mr. Fiedler, testified that Respondent advanced that explanation to the Panel. This court accepts their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">\u201cRegretfully, this court can place little credence in the Respondent\u2019s testimony. Prior to the hearing, the Respondent advanced a number of versions of the facts surrounding the withdrawal of the money from his escrow account. Before this court, responding to Bar Counsel\u2019s questions, he either equivocated or professed lack of memory of the events. The court notes that the paper trail of the money ends with the closing of the escrow account. Respondent testified that he closed the account by -withdrawing $82,781.00 payable to Hollis &amp; Associates to move it to Nations Bank to open another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>escrow account. When questioned by the court, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u2018THE WITNESS: (Mr. Hollis) That is all that is. Closing at one bank, and opening at another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u2018THE COURT: And you gave this information to them earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">\u2018THE WITNESS: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u2018THE COURT: Why? They are asking you what happened with money that you\u2014I mean, it is very clear. They are saying that you have taken money that belonged to a client, and you are saying, I moved it to Nations Bank across the street. Why didn\u2019t you tell them that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\u2018THE WITNESS: I really have no answer. I mean, I just have no answer that makes any sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">And again at a later point in the testimony, the court asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aux\">\u2018THE COURT: Knowing that all this is going on, and knowing what you were being questioned about, did you make any effort at all to get copies of your account from Nations Bank, your escrow accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">\u2018A. No, I didn\u2019t, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">\u2018THE COURT: Did you think that was important?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-12\">\u2018THE WITNESS: It did not occur to me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">\n<em>\u201cTHE JEFFREY BILLUPS MATTER:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">\u201cParagraph 17 of Bar Counsel\u2019s petition avers that the financial record of the escrow account indicates that Jeffrey Billups\u2019 funds were \u2018misappropriated by Respondent.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">\u201cThe testimony with regard to this claim showed that Respondent had handled a claim against CMX Corporation for five clients; McNeill, Scott, Wesley, Rogers and W. McNeill. The case was settled for a total of $37,243.81, which was deposited in the escrow account on July 22, 1991. After the settlement money had been disbursed to the clients and for fees, a check was issued to Jeffrey Billups in the amount of $1734.41 on February 18, 1992. A second check in the same amount was issued to Billups on February 25, 1992, marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\u2018settlement-final-CMX.\u2019 It is Bar Counsel\u2019s position that since all of the funds had already been paid out, the payments to Billups must have come from other clients\u2019 money when it was written from the escrow account. Respondent\u2019s testimony was that he lost money on the CMX matter since he had to pay Billups from his fees. Billups\u2019 participation in the CMX matter is problematic. Respondent stated that Billups was not one of the people who was bringing a claim against CMX. This court was at a loss to understand why Respondent would have paid Billups anything since he had no claim against CMX and since the funds had already been distributed. The court finally asked the Respondent whether Billups had brought the other cases in, to which the Respondent replied, \u2018He was very much a part of the group that came in with those guys, and was at most of the meetings that I attended; he was there providing documents and so forth.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\u201cThis court can speculate as to the reason for the payments to Billups, and as to whether the payment invaded other clients\u2019 trust funds in the escrow, but it cannot make such finding by clear and convincing evidence. Rule BV-lO(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\n<em>\u201cCONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">\u201cBased on the foregoing findings of fact in connection with the handling of Dr. Amar\u2019s funds, the court finds that the Respondent violated Rule 1.15 Safekeeping Property; Rule 8.1 Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters in that Respondent knowingly made false statements of material fact; Rule 8.4 Misconduct; Rule BU-4 Trust Accounts; Rule BU-8 Interest on Funds in Attorney Trust Accounts; Rule BU-9 Prohibited Transactions and Rule 10-306 Misuse of Trust Monies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The Commission filed no exceptions to Judge Rombro\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Hollis excepts to Judge Rombro\u2019s failure to recuse himself. In addition, Hollis asserts that Judge Rombro failed to consider \u201cproperly\u201d certain matters. Finally, Hollis makes the bald assertions that Judge Rombro clearly erred in finding various violations of the rules and that there was no clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>convincing evidence that Hollis violated any of the rules which were found to be violated. Hollis\u2019s exceptions contain no reasoning or analysis of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Judge Rombro correctly held that, in this type of proceeding, the matter of his recusal was within the province of the Court of Appeals. This Court twice previously denied Hollis\u2019s contention that Judge Rombro should be recused. The scheduling of the hearing on a date which was assertedly not convenient for Hollis\u2019s attorney clearly did not furnish a ground for recusal of Judge Rombro.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Likewise, the fact that Hollis did not support Judge Rombro in an election several years before is no ground for Judge Rombro\u2019s recusal. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals recently rejected a similar contention, explaining as follows <em>(State v. McBride, </em>187 Wis.2d 409, 417-418, 523 N.W.2d 106, 110-111 (1994)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">\u201cMcBride next contends that Judge Koehn was biased against her because she supported his opponent in the election____ As to McBride\u2019s support of Judge Koehn\u2019s opponent, we note that in states using elections for their judicial selection process the bar will frequently be divided among the various contenders for the judicial position. If those who support the losing candidate are allowed to claim actual bias, a judge would be unnecessarily precluded from hearing a significant number of cases arising within his or her jurisdiction. Furthermore, judges have an ethical obligation to treat attorneys impartially.... This court is unwilling to conclude that Judge Koehn violated this ethical obligation solely because McBride did not support his candidacy. Therefore, we conclude that McBride\u2019s support of Judge Koehn\u2019s opponent, standing alone, is not sufficient evidence to allow this court to conclude that Judge Koehn harbored actual bias against her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-9\"><em>See also, e.g., Ex parte Grayson, </em>665 So.2d 986, 987 (Ala.Crim. App.1995) (\u201cA lawyer who becomes a candidate for the public office of judge accepts the risk that, if he loses, he may have to try cases in the court of his successful opponent\u201d); <em>Paul v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>Nichols, </em>627 So.2d 122, 123 (Fla.App.1993) (\u201cthere is a presumption that a judge will be impartial even when a lawyer has voiced opposition to the election of a judge\u201d); <em>Raybon v. Burnette, </em>135 So.2d 228, 230 (Fla.App.1961); <em>Pierce v. Charity Hospital of Louisiana, </em>550 So.2d 211, 214 (La.App.1989) (\u201cA judge is often in the position of handling matters which involve an attorney who has campaigned or contributed to the judge\u2019s opponent____ [This does] ... not establish any bias or prejudice by [the] Judge\u201d); <em>Valladares v. Second Judicial District Court, </em>112 Nev. 79, 910 P.2d 256 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">With regard to Hollis\u2019s other exceptions, our review of the record discloses that Judge Rombro\u2019s findings were supported by clear and convincing evidence and are not clearly erroneous. \u201cIt is well settled that, in disciplinary proceedings, the factual findings of the hearing judge will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 434, 697 A.2d 446, 453 (1997). Consequently, Hollis\u2019s exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The hearing judge found that Hollis had misappropriated his client\u2019s funds and had repeatedly made misrepresentations when questioned about the money which he was supposed to pay to the estate of Ramona Cowan. The findings show that Hollis acted knowingly and intentionally. No compelling extenuating circumstances were found to exist. Therefore, the appropriate sanction is disbarment. <em>Attorney Griev.
