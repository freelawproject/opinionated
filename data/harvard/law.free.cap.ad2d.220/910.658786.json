Petitioner argues that this determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Since the commencement of this proceeding, respondent has annulled the subject determination and expunged it from petitioner\u2019s records. As the matter is now moot, we need not address the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim. Furthermore, petitioner is not entitled to the recovery of incidental expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Cardona, P. J., Mercure, Casey, Yesawich Jr. and Spain, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the petition is dismissed, as moot, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
