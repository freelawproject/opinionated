Co. v Cuomo, </em>813 F Supp 996, <em>affd in part and revd in part </em>14 F3d 708, <em>cert granted </em>\u2014 US \u2014 , 115 S Ct 305). The decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals was recently reversed by the United States Supreme Court <em>(see, Pataki v Travelers Ins. Co., </em>514 US \u2014, 115 S Ct 1671). Petitioners now move in this Court for reargument based on the reversal by the United States Supreme Court. Petitioners also seek reargument on the remainder of this Court\u2019s decision which rejected petitioners\u2019 arguments that there was not a rational basis for respondents\u2019 denials of their exemption requests. In our view, the motion for reargument should be granted only to the extent of amending the decision so as to eliminate dismissal of the appeals as moot. The additional arguments in support of reargument by petitioners are found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Mikoll, J. P., Mercure, Crew III, White and Yesawich Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the motion is granted, without costs, to the extent that the memorandum and order of this Court dated December 8, 1994, is amended so as to omit the fifth paragraph of this Court\u2019s decision and to substitute for the decretal paragraph of this Court\u2019s memorandum and decision the following: Ordered that the judgments are affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
