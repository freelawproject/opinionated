A claim that real property is a marital asset subject to distribution does not, by itself, establish grounds for a lis pendens <em>(Gross v Gross, </em>114 AD2d 1002).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Plaintiff <em>pro se </em>has also failed to establish that Merrill Lynch had actual knowledge prior to making a mortgage loan to the defendant of any alleged \"on-going fraud\u201d being perpetrated by the defendant in the transfer of the subject property or that Merrill Lynch had acted in bad faith with respect to either the title to the subject property or the notice of pendency.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">We have reviewed plaintiff\u2019s remaining claims and find them to be without merit. Concur\u2014Murphy, P. J., Wallach, Ross, Nardelli and Tom, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
