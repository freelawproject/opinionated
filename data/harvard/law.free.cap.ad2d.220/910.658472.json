Upon review of the record, we find that the misbehavior report and testimony of the correction officers who witnessed the incident provides substantial evidence supporting the administrative determination. In addition, we reject petitioner\u2019s assertion that he was improperly denied access to certain documentary evidence. Finally, we do not find that the Hearing Officer acted in a biased or partial manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">Cardona, P. J., Mikoll, Crew III, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the determination is confirmed, without costs, and petition dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
