Defendant was given a reasonable opportunity to advance his claim that he felt \"confused\u201d at the plea proceeding and was \"almost forced\u201d by his attorney and his family into pleading guilty, but the record, which includes a careful allocution by the court, demonstrates that defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary <em>(see, People v Frederick, </em>45 NY2d 520, 524-525; <em>People v Harris, </em>61 NY2d 9). That counsel may have encouraged defendant to accept a plea offer that very favorably involved no prison time in addition to what defendant was already serving for an unrelated crime, or discussed unspecified aspects of the case with defendant\u2019s family against defendant\u2019s instructions, hardly demonstrates coercion or warranted the assignment of new counsel <em>(see, People v Franklin, </em>211 AD2d 453; <em>People v Braun, </em>167 AD2d 164; see <em>also, People v Byas, </em>211 AD2d 562; <em>People v Brown, </em>177 AD2d 460, 461, <em>Iv denied </em>79 NY2d 944; <em>cf., People v Lewis, </em>46 NY2d 825).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The unpublished Decision and Order of this Court entered herein on October 3, 1995 is hereby recalled and vacated.
