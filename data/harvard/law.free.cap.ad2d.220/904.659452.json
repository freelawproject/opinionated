In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment, the longest of which was 5 to 25 years. On this appeal, defendant\u2019s attorney requests leave to withdraw as counsel on the basis that there are no nonfrivolous issues that may be raised on appeal. Having reviewed the record, defense counsel\u2019s brief and defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>submission, we agree. There is no merit to defendant\u2019s assertion that the sentence imposed was unreasonable. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed and defense counsel\u2019s application for leave to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>Cardona, P.
