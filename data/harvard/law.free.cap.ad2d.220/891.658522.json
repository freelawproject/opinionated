Defendant argues that County Court abused its discretion in considering defendant\u2019s statement in which he denied possessing drugs as a factor in imposing the harshest possible sentence. Upon our review of the sentencing transcript, we do not find that County Court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant. County Court considered the subject statement as indicative of defendant\u2019s lack of remorse for his actions. It also considered defendant\u2019s past criminal history and the nature of the crime. Moreover, insofar as the cases relied upon by defendant involved sentences imposed in connection with plea agreements, we find them distinguishable from the case at hand (see, <em>e.g., People v Carr, </em>135 AD2d 722; <em>People v Daniels, </em>132 AD2d 667).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Cardona, P. J., Crew III, White, Casey and Spain, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
