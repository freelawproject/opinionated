The said justice decided as matter of law that the respondent was entitled to recover, and ordered judgment as aforesaid, which the general term of said court affirmed.</p><p id=\"b161-8\">submitted the following points:</p><p id=\"b161-9\">1. The first section of the ordinance defines a public cart, and any person using such cart without first obtaining license therefor, as thereinafter provided, shall be guilty of a violation of this chapter.</p><p id=\"b161-10\">Section \u201c five\u201d says, no public cart shall be driven or used Avithin said city, except by a duly licensed public cartman.</p><p id=\"b161-11\">Section 48 provides, that all persons who shall violate or fail to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>thereof, shall be punished, &amp;c., or, in lieu thereof, shall forfeit and pay, &amp;c.</p><p id=\"b162-5\">2. The services rendered in this action were performed in violation of this ordinance.</p><p id=\"b162-6\">3. This ordinance will receive the same construction as the one in the case reported in 5 <em>Sand. S. C. R., </em>153.</p><p id=\"b162-7\">4. Every contract made for or about any matter or thing which is prohibited and made unlawful by statute, is a void contract. Though the statute does not mention that it shall be so, but only inflicts a penalty on the offender, because a penalty implies a prohibition, though there are no prohibiting words in the statute. (1 <em>Smith\u2019s L. Cases, </em>502, <em>and cases; </em>5 <em>Johns., 321, </em>335 ; 3 <em>Denio, </em>226, <em>and cases; </em>12 <em>Barb., </em>21, <em>and </em>cases; 5 <em>Sand., </em>153.)</p><p id=\"b162-9\">submitted the following\u2019 points:</p><p id=\"b162-10\">1. The ordinance of the common council no where prohibits carting, or declares that contracts made by unlicensed cartmen shall be void : it only provides that a cartman shall take out a license; if he do not, he is guilty of a violation of the ordinance, and may be punished as therein provided; but he cannot be punished in another and different manner. The ordinance is penal in its provisions, and must be construed strictly. (2 <em>Story on Con., p. </em>60.)</p><p id=\"b162-11\">2. The ordinance is merely directory. There is nothing in the ordinance which looks to the <em>avoiding </em>of <em>contracts, </em>as the <em>means </em>by which <em>prohibition </em>is to be enforced, and cartmen compelled to take out a license. But if so, that remedy should be confined solely to the party wronged\u2014 the corporation. <em>(Brown </em>agt. <em>Duncan, </em>10 <em>B. </em>&amp; <em>C., </em>93.)</p><p id=\"b162-12\">3. The contract in question is not in direct violation of the ordinance; it is only collaterally connected with it, and is therefore valid.</p><p id=\"b163-6\">4. When the object of a statute is for the purpose of raising revenue\u2014as for instance, that persons dealing in a particular kind of goods should take out a <em>license </em>for the <em>sale </em>thereof, and <em>inflicting </em>a <em>penalty </em>on the <em>seller </em>in case he does <em>not\u2014there </em>is no <em>intention </em>of <em>prohibiting </em>a contract for the <em>sale </em>of <em>such goods, </em>and an <em>unlicensed vendor </em>can recover the price thereof. <em>(Chitty on Con., ed. of </em>1848, <em>p. </em>419, 420, <em>and cases there cited; </em>3 Demo, 226.)</p><p id=\"b163-7\">5. The cases relied on by defendant are not in point.</p><p id=\"b163-8\">The case of <em>Hunt </em>agt. <em>Knickerbocker, </em>(5 <em>Johns., </em>326.) was an action brought to recover the price of lottery tickets deposited with defendant as agent for sale, and sold by him. Held that plaintiff could not recover because lotteries are contrary to public policy and unlawful, and the statute delares that \u201c all contracts, agreements, and securities given, made, or executed for or on account of the same (lotteries) shall be utterly void. (2 <em>R. S., 5th ed., p. </em>929, \u00a7 31.)</p><p id=\"b163-10\">The case of <em>Reman </em>agt. <em>Tugnot, </em>(5 <em>Sand., </em>153,) was an action brought to recover the contract price for constructing a roof on, defendant\u2019s house, to be fire proof, and constructed in a manner to be approved by fire department, and in accordance with the fire laws of the city. The roof was not so constructed, but was constructed in direct violation of the fire laws, and defendant was compelled to remove the same in consequence thereof.</p><p id=\"b163-11\">On the above facts, the <em>jury </em>found a verdict for defendant, and the court on appeal, sustained the same.</p><p id=\"b163-12\">The case of <em>Bell </em>agt. <em>Quin, </em>(2 <em>Sand., </em>146,) was an action on a promissory note, payable to Williams <em>&amp; </em>Ferguson, and endorsed by them to plaintiff. Williams, one of the makers, at the time of giving the note, was an alderman of the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>of New York, and interested in a contract for supplying the alms-house with coal. The note in question was given for Williams &amp; Ferguson\u2019s share of the profits growing out of such contract. \u2022</p><p id=\"b164-5\">As the charter of the city provides, \u201c that no member of the common council shall, during the period for which he was elected, be directly or indirectly interested in any contract, the expenses or consideration whereof are to be paid under any ordinance of the common council,\u201d the court properly decided that plaintiff could not recover.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
