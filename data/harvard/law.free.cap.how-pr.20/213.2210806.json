Glover, <em>for the plaintiff,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJR\">insisted that the judgment was to be opened on terms, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>offered an order \u201c vacating the judgment on payment hy the defendants to the plaintiff, of the costs and disbursements therein, after issue joined, as adjusted by the clerk of the court, together with the sheriff\u2019s fees on the execution, and $10 costs of opposing the motion, as also an allowance to be made as the court should direct.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-5\">The counsel cited in support of the above, the case of <em>Milleman </em>agt. <em>The Mayor, </em>(18 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>542,) where he contended a similar order had been make by Judge Hilton.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-6\">Wm. Curtis Notes, <em>in opposition</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-7\">to the entry of the above order maintained:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-8\">I. The rule sought to be enforced by the plaintiff in the settlement of the order in the above cause, should not be applied to cases like the present. 1. The rule itself is clearly an unjust and harsh one, and no longer exists in England where it originated. <em>(Saunders </em>agt. <em>Davies, </em>16 <em>Jurist, </em>481.) 2. Even in this state the costs now are discretionary, and it seems clear to me, that a wise exercise of that power, demands that they should not be given to a party who seeks to avail himself of a fraud. 3. And in cases like the present, where the judgment was obtained <em>mala fide, </em>the practice is to set aside the judgment without costs. <em>(Anderson </em>agt. <em>George, 1 Burr. </em>352; 1 <em>Graham &amp; Waterman on New Trials, </em>598.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-11\">II. The order applied for by the plaintiff virtually annuls the judgment only in part. The costs as taxed form no inconsiderable part of the sum total of the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-12\">III. The effect of granting such an order would be to offer a premium for the obtaining of fraudulent judgments. If in every like case, the judgment would only be opened by the court on payment of costs, an inducement would be offered to continue this fraudulent practice. They would then be in no worse condition than they were at the commencement of their suit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The court, Daly, F.
