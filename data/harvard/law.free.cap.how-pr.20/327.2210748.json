The defendant was proprietor of a boot store. The plaintiff bought a pair of patent leather boots at the defendant\u2019s store, and paid $10 therefor,\u2014the defendant warranting them to be \u201c a fine pair of boots.\u201d The plaintiff, on reaching his home, discovered a slight tear in the leg of the left boot, and on the following day he returned the boots to the same salesman, and reclaimed the price, on the ground of the defect. The salesman refused to refund the money, and thereupon the plaintiff threw down the boots, left them in the store, and went away, and soon thereafter brought a,n action for the price paid. The case was tried before Justice Van Cott and a jury in the fourth district court of the city of New York. It was found that the tear could have been repaired for three cents, and that the defendant offered to have said repairing done free of cost, or to give to the plaintiff a new pair of boots,\u2014both of which offers the plaintiff declined to accept. The jury gave a verdict of $10 for the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-9\">J. S.

But in the present case the defendant, by accepting the return of the boots, without objection, must be regarded as consenting to rescinding the contract, and therefore cannot retain the money paid him on account of it. Upon the evidence the plaintiff was entitled to the verdict which the jury gave, and the charge of the judge cannot operate to deprive him of it. In my opinion the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Brady, J., concurred with Judge Hilton in the view of the case presented by his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Daly, J., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
