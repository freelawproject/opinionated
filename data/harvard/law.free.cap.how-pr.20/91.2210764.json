On the return of the summons, plaintiff complained for work and labor done and performed by his minor son for defendant in 1857, and for which plaintiff claimed judgment. Defendant denied each and every allegation contained in the complaint, and denied specifically that plaintiff\u2019s minor son ever done any work for defendant. Complaint and answer in writing. The issue was tried by the justice on the 23d of October, 1857, and the justice found and rendered judgment against defendant, and in favor of the plaintiff, for $22.53, and costs, $2.08. The defendant appealed to the county court of Albany county, by which court the judgment of the justice was affirmed : Robinson, County Judge, giving the following reasons for his decision, to wit: \u201c The decision in <em>10th Barbour </em>rather surprised me, yet until it is overruled I suppose it is law for this court. But this case has a little more than that in this particular; the son swears plaintiff is his father; the defendant sends word to his father to come or send for the money, and he will pay, &amp;c., admitting an indebtedness, and, as I think, admitting that plaintiff was his father, for when the boy speaks of plaintiff as his father, defendant says, 1 when your father,\u2019 &amp;c., evidently meaning the plaintiff. I am the more inclined to take this view of the case, because I doubt the correctness of that decision.\u201d From the decision and judgment of the county court, the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-5\">L. <em>&amp;.
