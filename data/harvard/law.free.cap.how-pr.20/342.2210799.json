And that there is due and owing to plaintiffs from defendant two hundred and fifty-seven dollars and seventy-four cents, for which with interest and costs, they demand judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-10\">The defendant has demurred to the complaint.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-11\">Phillips <em>&amp; </em>Davis, <em>plaintiffs, in person.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-12\">P.

The husband settles with notice, and it would seem, should take his wife <em>cum </em>onere, and pay the costs of the action. How, otherwise can the attorney get his costs? he cannot sue the wife for them. <em>Non constat </em>had the litigation gone on the husband would have been compelled to pay alimony, which would go to pay the costs of the litigation, and thus the husband be compelled to pay, what he seeks by a settlement to avoid.\u2014Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Bonney, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AZo\">The defendant must have judgment on this demurrer. I can see no possible ground for maintaining the action. Surely a wife cannot be considered (as plaintiffs have attempted to argue,) the agent of her husband, with authority to commence an action against himself, perhaps without cause, and afterwards discontinue it, and thereby make him liable to her attorneys for the costs of the action. While an action for divorce is pending, a wife may, in a proper case, obtain an order that a husband furnish her with means for carrying it on; but when the wife is plaintiff in such an action, and has either discontinued it or been defeated, and judgment been rendered against her, neither she nor her attorneys or counsel can have any claim upon him for the costs or expenses of her fruitless and probably causeless prosecution. <em>(Shelton </em>agt.
