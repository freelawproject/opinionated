Keep, against contingent liability arising out of the following facts.\u201d It is stated that Van Horn and Keep had indorsed for Reynolds certain promissory notes, which are particularly specified, amounting to $3,335 ;\u201d \u201c also, for the purpose of securing the said Silas H. Marks, as trustee in behalf of Augustus Keep and George R. Keep, against contingent liabilities,\u201d &amp;c. It is stated that Keeps\u2019 indorsed for Reynolds a certain note specified, amounting to $560. It is declared in the statement authorizing the judgment, that \u201c the judgment and confession are to be held by Marks in his own right as to the contingent liabilities assumed by him, &amp;c.; and to be further held by Marks in the right and behalf of yan Horn and Keep as to the contingent liabilities assumed by them as indorsers, &amp;c.; and to be further held by Marks in the. right and behalf of Augustus Keep and George R.

By the Code a judgment may be confessed \u201c to secure any person against contingent liability on behalf of the defendant,\u201d in the manner prescribed. There must be a statement in writing, signed by the defendant, and verified. \u201c If it be for the purpose of securing the plaintiff against a contingent liability, it must state concisely the facts constituting the liability, and must show that the sum confessed therefor does not exceed the same.\u201d Sections 382, 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The decision of the question must, I think, depend upon the construction to be given to these provisions of the Code. I am not aware that, prior to the Code, there was anything in our law prohibiting the confession of a judgment to one person, which should be for the benefit of another. Our statute (2 <em>R. S., </em>131, \u00a71) makes void a \u201cdecree or judgment suffered, with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, or other persons of their lawful suits,\u201d &amp;c. This statute does not affect the question. Prior to the Code the action was required to be in the name of the party <em>legally </em>interested. In actions upon contracts, other than commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>cial paper, the action must have been in the name of the party to the contract, though he may have assigned it, and the recovery would be for the benefit of the assignee. Now the action is to be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, except as provided in sections 113, 111. By section 113, executors, administrators and certain trustees, and persons authorized by statute, may sue in their own names; and a person with whom, or in whose name a contract is made, for the benefit of another, is included.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">These principles and provisions do not embrace the case; they relate to parties to an action; but it is proper to consider the state of the general law touching parties to actions, in giving constructions to the provisions relating to the confession of judgments, without action; and in doing so we see that there is nothing in the law, in principle, inconsistent with the confession of a judgment to one person for the benefit of another. The Code authorizes a judgment by confession to be entered, \u201c to secure any person against contingent liability on behalf of the defendant.\u201d This authority is general\u2014to secure \u201c any person.\u201d It does not declare that the judgment shall be confessed to the person to be secured, and not to any other person for his benefit. The third subdivision of the next section, however, declares that \u201c if it (the judgment) be for-the purpose of securing the plaintiff against a contingent liability, it (the statement) must state concisely the facts constituting the liability, and must show that the sum confessed therefor did not exceed the same.\u201d Here the word <em>plaintiff </em>is used \u201c for the purpose of securing the plaintiff against a contingent liability.\u201d If we give this clause a-literal and controlling construction, it will, I think, follow that those parts of the judgment intended to secure Van Horn and Keep, and Keep &amp; Keep against contingent liabilities, cannot be sustained. Regarding Marks as the sole plaintiff, it cannot be said that he had incurred any contingent liability upon the notes not indorsed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>I am inclined to think, in view of the whole statute, that a more liberal construction should be given. In the present case three classes of persons incurred contingent liabili-' ties on behalf of the defendant, and a judgment was confessed to one of them, to secure him against his contingent liabilities, and also to secure each of the other classes of persons for their contingent liabilities, the person to whom the 'judgment was confessed consenting to act as the trustee of the others. The intent and spirit of the statute have been complied with; full information has been given; subsequent judgment creditors have not been injured. If, instead of one judgment, there had been three, no question could be raised. Why, then, under such circumstances, require three judgments instead of one ? It was suggested upon the argument that the word \u201c plaintiff\u201d ought to be construed as meaning the persons, for the purpose of securing whom the judgment was confessed; or, by referring to the previous section, which contains the authority to enter judgment by confession, read the clause in question : <em>\u201c </em>If the judgment be for the purpose of securing <em>any person </em>against a contingent liability,\u201d &amp;c. In other words, that the word <em>plaintiff, </em>as here used, is simply a substitute for \u201c any person,\u201d as used in the previous section; and I am inclined to think that, such construction should be given. It can hardly be claimed that it was intended, by the use of the word <em>plaintiff, </em>to abrogate the law previously existing, which permitted the confession of judgment to one person for the benefit of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">If I am wrong in the views here expressed, it will not follow that the entire judgment is void as to Mrs. Wright. It is valid so far as the contingent liabilities of Marks are concerned. <em>(McKee </em>agt. <em>Tyson, </em>10 <em>Abb., </em>392.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">I have concluded, upon the whole, to deny the motion, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
