The common council then declared by resolution their intention to take and appropriate the property included within the lines of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the proposed street, and published and served the notices as required by the city charter.

The commissioners shall proceed to assess such amount upon the property benefited by such improvement, in a just and equitable manner, as near as may be in proportion to the benefits received. Such assessment shall be made in the same manner as the assessment-for building sewers, except that such commissioners shall direct such part of said expenses to be assessed upon the city, and such part localty, as they shall deem just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">And by \u00a7 6 : \u201c Immediately after the final determination of all proceedings in which any award shall be made, the common council shall cause to be paid or tendered to the respective owners the amount awarded to each respect-.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
