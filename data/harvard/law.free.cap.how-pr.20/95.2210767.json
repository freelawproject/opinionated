He has no interest in the rents and profits, nor to the possession of the premises, and it is, at least, questionable whether his grantee, after assuming the payment of the mortgage, can deny its validity. At all events, as the case is now presented, he does not set up any defence to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Motion granted; and it is referred to William A. Greene, Esq., to appoint such receiver, and take the requisite security. $10 costs of the motion to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The following communication sufficiently explains itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">\u201cN.
