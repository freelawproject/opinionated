To this return the relator demurred. The demurrer was overruled at special term, and that order was affirmed on an appeal, brought by the relator to the general term, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The clerk of Schenectady county, on the adjustment, of costs for judgment, allowed double costs, as was claimed by the counsel for the defendant, on the ground that the defendant was a public officer, and entitled thereto under the provisions of 2d Revised Statutes, 617, \u00a74, (24.) The relator now appeals from this adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The first objection raised by the relator was, that the county clerk, in such a case,, had no power to adjust costs, inasmuch as the costs of such proceedings were not provided for by the Code; but were costs allowable, if at all, under the provisions of the Revised Statutes, which clerks of counties had no power to tax. I think this objection is not well taken. By the 65th section of the judiciary act, chap. 280, Laws of 1847, clerks of counties are, by virtue of their offices, made clerks of this court, and vested with all the powers of the clerks of the supreme court under the former system; and the 311th section of the Code recognizes this power. This was directly so held in the eighth district, at general term, in <em>Wheelock </em>agt. Hotchkiss, (18 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>469.) If the defendant is entitled to double costs, I think the clerk had the power to adjust them. <em>(See also Bortle </em>agt. Gilman, 19 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The court of appeals have also settled the question now, that the Revised Statutes, allowing double costs, are not abrogated by the provisions of the Code, but are in force. <em>(See also Bortle </em>agt. <em>Gilman, supra.) </em>Besides, the 47lst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>section of the Code expressly excepts proceedings by <em>mandamus </em>from being affected by the provisions of the second part of the Code, which, it will be seen, contains the directions as to the manner of commencing actions, and also the provision as to costs in actions commenced under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The next objection raised to the adjustment is, that double costs are only allowed by the Revised Statutes in <em>actions; </em>and it is insisted that a proceeding by <em>mandamus is </em>not an action. To determine this objection it becomes necessary, first: to ascertain what is meant by the use of the word, or term, action, in legal parlance.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Excluding the Code definition, at present, as inapplicable, and finding in the Revised Statutes no definition limiting its use from what it has ordinarily been understood to mean by the profession, by the common law authorities, and by examination of the elementary writers and law lexicons, we may assume that the common law meaning, or definition, remains still unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">One of the oldest of English legal definitions, of \u201c <em>action,\u201d </em>is that given by Lord Coke ; that \u201c it is the form of a suit given by law for the recovery of that which is one\u2019s due, the lawful demand of one\u2019s right.\u201d (Co. <em>Litt., </em>285, 285, a.) Blackstone, traces his definition, back to the civil law; in which Cicero defines an <em>action, </em>to be \u201c the means by which men litigate with each other.\u201d (3 <em>Blackstone Com., </em>117.) Bracton, I think, embodies the whole idea of an action much better, in the Latin expression, \u201c <em>trinus actus, trium </em>personarum,\u201d which seems to include not only the <em>act </em>of a <em>plaintiff, </em>who makes a lawful demand, and the <em>act </em>of a <em>defendant, </em>in opposition; but also, the <em>act </em>of a <em>court </em>in passing judgment between the parties. This is full and comprehensive, and I think, best expresses our notion of a legal <em>action, </em>in the ordinary understanding of the term. This would include the less comprehensive, and less perspicuous definition of an action, given in the Code, (\u00a7 2,) to wit: \u201c An action, is an ordinary proceeding in a court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>justice, by which a party prosecutes another party, for the enforcement or protection of a right, the redress or prevention of a wrong-, or the punishment of a public offence,\u201d as well as the more apt conclusion of Justice Harris, in <em>People </em>agt. <em>County Judge of </em>Rensselaer, (13 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>400,) in which he says, \u201c an)\" judicial proceeding which, if conducted to a termination, will result in a judgment, is an action.\u201d By the rule of construing statutes, we are bound.to assume that the legislature in preparing the language of statutes, employed the terms, in the ordinary sense in which such language is understood by lawyers and courts. The Revised Statutes, have, as we shall see, in frequent instances, used the word \u201c <em>suit,\u201d </em>as synonymous with action; and it was, and is eveiy day\u2019s practice, (certainly before the Code,) among jurists and lawyers, when speaking of a legal proceeding, to use <em>action, </em>and <em>suit, </em>as synonymous terms. Indeed, <em>suit, </em>was the more general term of the two; and much the most comprehensive; in fact suit includes an action. Lord Coke says, the word <em>\u201c suit,\u201d </em>includes the <em>execution, </em>which the -word \u201c <em>action,\u201d </em>does not. \u201c So, (says he,) if the body\" of a man be taken in execution, and the plaintiff releaseth all <em>actions, </em>yet he shall remain in execution;\u201d but \u201c if he release all <em>suits, </em>the execution is gone.\u201d \u201c And so note a diversity'-,\u201d &amp;c. (Co. <em>Litt., </em>291, <em>a.) </em>In <em>Didier </em>agt. <em>Davison, </em>(10 <em>Paige R., </em>516, 517,) Chancellor Walworth says, <em>\u201c </em>The word action when used in the Revised Statutes, is intended to designate a <em>proceeding in a court of law. </em>But when the word \u2018suit\u2019 is used, in reference to legal proceedings by the revisors of the statute, it may apply to a <em>proceeding </em>either at law, or in equity.\u201d In the 2d Revised Statutes, 618, 619, and especially that portion which relates to costs, the word <em>suit, </em>is used as an intended synonym, for <em>action, </em>as follows : Section 38. \u201c In suits against executors and administrators, in which the plaintiff shall recover costs,\u201d &amp;c. Section 39. \u201cIncivil <em>suits </em>and proceedings,by or in the name of the people,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c the people shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>liable for costs,\u201d &amp;c. Section 40. \u201c Where a suit or proceeding shall be instituted in the name of the people of this state on the <em>relation </em>of any citizen, such relator shall be liable for costs, in the same cases, and to the same extent, as if such suit or proceeding had been commenced in his own name.\u201d Section 41. \u201c In all <em>suits </em>which may be commenced in the name of the people of this state, when the debt,\u201d &amp;c. Section 42. \u201c In <em>suits </em>and <em>proceedings </em>upon writs of <em>mandamus, </em>the supreme court may, in its discretion, award or refuse costs to any party therein.\u201d Whenever the court so award costs, it means the costs allowed by statute, unless it is otherwise expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">It is obvious from the very character of the proceedings intended, by the language, \u201c <em>suits\u201d and </em>\u201c <em>proceedings,\u201d </em>in the sections above quoted, that <em>actions, </em>according to the definitions we have above given, were intended. I am, therefore, clear in my view of its meaning, that the proceeding now in question, was an action; though I do not regard that conclusion as even necessary for the purpose of determining the right to costs in this case. For that purpose, we need not distinguish it from \u201c a proceeding upon mandamus.\u201d Either would entitle to costs, if the court so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The next objection taken to the adjustment, is, that the proceeding is not brought against the defendant \u201c for or concerning the omission to do anything which it was his official duty to perform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">I think the <em>facts </em>are against this objection. The defendant, as county treasurer, was charged in the alternative <em>mandamus, </em>that it was his duty as such officer, in the accounts kept by him with the several towns in his county, respectively, to charge them, respectively, with certain portions of money paid by the superintendent of the poor of said county for the support of the poor of such towns; as required by statute; and the said writ also charged the said defendant, as such officer, among other things, as follows : \u201c and whereas, you, in disregard and neglect of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>in such case made and provided, have charged, &amp;c.\u201d (setting. forth how otherwise such charges were made.) \u201c Now we therefore,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c do command you that immediately after the receipt of this writ, you charge,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c or, that you show cause,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The defendant, in compliance with this mandate, made a return to the writ, showing cause. The relator demurred to the return; the demurrer was overruled, and, in effect, the return was held good ; or, in other words, it was held that, as such officer, he had not omitted his duty. The result was a judgment in favor of the defendant, upon demurrer, in an <em>action </em>by <em>mandamus </em>against him as county treasurer, which is a public office, on a charge made for and concerning his omission to charge the several towns of his county in the manner required by statute, and which act of disregard, neglect and omission he was so charged with by the said <em>mandamus. </em>This act, the relator claimed, it was his official duty as such officer to have performed. The effect of the judgment is that he had performed his duty. This, it seems to me, is a charge, making an issue against a public officer for omitting to do his duty, and is clearly within the spirit, as well as the letter of the statute made for their protection, as now extended by the Revised Statutes of 1830. (See <em>revisor's notes, vol. </em>3, <em>2d ed., p. </em>798.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The various decisions of the courts, that the statute allowing double costs to public officers did not apply to acts of nonfeasance, but only to malfeasance, were cases before the Revised Statutes extended the former provision. Such were the cases in 2 <em>Cow. R., </em>527 ; 5 <em>John. R., </em>,182 ; 1 <em>Wend., </em>24.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The disbursement for verifying the return of the defendant I do not think was technically necessary; but it was a disbursement at the legal rate, incurred in good faith, and it doubtless <em>appeared to the clerk to he necessary. </em>(2 <em>R. S., </em>653, \u00a77.) This authorized its allowance. The motion must be denied, and the taxation affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
