On this question of fact, the plaintiff swore one way, and Mr. Sargeant, the agent of the defendant, another. The jury had a right to credit the plaintiff, and not Sargeant. We ought not to grant a new trial because they did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">But I do not see how the jury could disregard the plaintiff\u2019s letter, produced and read in evidence by the defendant on the trial. In that letter the plaintiff expressly admits that he had been in the defendant\u2019s employ for two years, at $1000 (meaning, evidently, at the rate of, or salary of $1000 per year,) and these two years must include the period of his services in London up to the date of his letter, or to the 1st of January, 1854.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">It appears to me, that this letter, unexplained, was conclusive against the plaintiff, and that the jury were bound to disregard his oath, when flatly contradicted by his own letter, written long before the action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">I think the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
