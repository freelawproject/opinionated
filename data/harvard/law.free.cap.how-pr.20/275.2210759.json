Selleek, except this action, and that he had not been served with process in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The plaintiffs duly excepted to the conclusion or finding as matter of law, that the law of Illinois governed the contract of indorsement, and that the liability of George Selle ck as indorser was to be determined and enforced according to that law; and the question is, whether this conclusion or finding was or was not erroneous; I think it was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The general rule or principle is, that the construction, force and effect of a contract, and the rights of the parties to a contract under it, as distinguished from their remedies on it, are to be determined by the law of the place of. the contract, unless the parties contemplated another place for performance ; and if they did, then the law of \"the place so contemplated as the place of performance is to prevail. <em>(Hyde </em>agt. <em>Goodnow, </em>3 Comstock, 267 ; <em>Everett </em>agt. <em>Vendryes, </em>19 <em>N. Y. Rep., </em>436; <em>Aymar </em>agt. <em>Sheldon, </em>12 <em>Wend., </em>439 ; <em>Smith </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>2 <em>John., </em>235; <em>Williams </em>agt. <em>Wade, </em>1 <em>Metcalf, </em>82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">If the contract is in writing, and the place of performance appears from the contract or writing itself, then, of course, the contract or writing itself is conclusive as to the law of the place which shall determine its construction, force and effect. <em>(Thompson </em>agt <em>Ketcham, </em>8 <em>John., </em>190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The note made by Benjamin Selleek, and the contract created by the indorsement of George Selleek, were independent contracts; the first was. to be performed in Illinois; that is, the note was payable at Morris, in that.state; but where was the contract of indorsement to be performed ? Can there be a doubt on the facts found by the leakned justice, that the parties contemplated that the latter contract was to be performed in New York ? What was the contract created by the indorsement ? By indorsing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>note, George Selleck undertook that if, when duly presented, it was not paid by the maker, he, the indorser, would upon being- properly notified of the non-payment, pay the same to the indorsers, or other holder. Where ? Can there be \u00bb a doubt, that the indorser and indorsees contemplated, if the indorsees retained the note, that in default of payment by the maker, the indorser was to pay to the indorsees in New York ? The maker by the note promised to pay at Morris, Illinois, but the indorser by his indorsement promised to pay to the indorsers in New York, if the maker did not pay at Morris, Illinois. The contract of indorsement was not only to be performed in New York, but, on the facts found by the justice, the note and the contract of indorsement were both made in New York. Neither had any force or effect until they were delivered ; and the note, with George Selleck\u2019s name on it, was delivered to the plaintiffs in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">This delivery, and the acceptance by the plaintiffs, made both the note and the contract of indorsement effective instruments or things; and therefore it can be said with propriety and truthfulness of language, that both the note and the indorsement were made in New York. <em>(Hyde </em>agt. <em>Goodnow, </em>3 <em>Comstock, </em>267, above cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">It follows that the question of George Selleck\u2019s liability as indorser was to be determined by the law of New York, and not by the law of Illinois; and that there should be a new trial of this action, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
