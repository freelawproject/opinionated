INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">This putative class action is brought on behalf of certain purchasers of common stock in eSpeed, Inc. (\u201ceSpeed\u201d), a publicly-traded market leader in electronic bond trading. Plaintiffs allege violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All defendants now move to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the following reasons, defendants\u2019 motion is granted with leave to replead.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-18\">However, I grant leave to replead with some reluctance. After reviewing the pleadings in this case, I harbor grave doubts as to whether plaintiffs can ever allege facts sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. The fact that eSpeed introduced a new product that ultimately failed, despite cautious optimism from defendants and apparent initial success in raising eS-peed\u2019s revenues, does not entitle eSpeed\u2019s investors to use the federal securities laws as a \u201cscheme of investor\u2019s insurance.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light of this, plaintiffs should not file an amended Complaint unless they reasonably believe that the deficiencies identified in this Opinion can be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-19\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AVG\">A. The Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b325-20\">Plaintiffs are a group of investors who bought eSpeed stock during the putative class period, which is \u201cpurchasers of eS-peed securities from November 20, 2002 through July 1, 2004.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant eS-peed \u201coperates multiple-buyer, multiple-seller, real-time electronic marketplaces for the global capital markets, including government bond markets and other fixed income and equities marketplaces.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> eS-peed is a subsidiary of the bond trading firm Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, Inc. (\u201cCantor\u201d), which \u201chas long been a domi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>nant player in the field of government bond trading.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Plaintiffs also name four individual defendants. Howard W. Lutnick is eSpeed\u2019s Chairman and CEO, and also serves as President and CEO of Cantor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lee M. Amaitis is Vice Chairman, Global Chief Operating Officer and a director of eS-peed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Jeffrey M. Chertoff was Senior Vice President and CFO of eSpeed from May 2002 to May 2004.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Joseph Noviello has been eSpeed\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer since September 2001.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">B. The Founding of eSpeed</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">According to plaintiffs, while Cantor trades in other forms of fixed income securities, its \u201cbread and butter has remained U.S. treasury securities.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Until relatively recently, the modalities of treasury securities trading were quite antiquated, relying largely on voice trades and centralized trading pits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently \u201c[fin-formation regarding prices was difficult to obtain, and execution of trades often proved to be a slow process.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Beginning in the early 1990s, Cantor strove to develop fully automated electronic trading systems which would provide more rapid and less expensive trades.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The result of this effort was eSpeed, which officially commenced operations in March 1999 and completed an initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in December of that year.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The IPO prospectus mentioned that among eS-peed\u2019s possible competitors was a then-proposed electronic trading network called BrokerTec.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-18\">eSpeed\u2019s first full year as a public company was a success \u2014 its $118.9 million of revenue for the year 2000 \u201cfar exceeded earlier projections.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> eSpeed\u2019s impressive growth continued throughout 2001, even after 658 Cantor employees (including 180 who worked for eSpeed) died in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Despite this catastrophe, eSpeed achieved profitability for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2001.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although eSpeed continued to be profitable in 2002, the market began to grow disenchanted with its performance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> At the same time, BrokerTec emerged as a dangerous competitor for eSpeed\u2019s core government securities trading business. After struggling throughout 2000 and 2001, BrokerTec merged in Au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>gust 2002 with the London-based ICAP.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The merger gained approval from the U.S. Department of Justice in May 2003, and the two companies\u2019 operations were fully integrated by the end of 2003.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">C. The Alleged Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">I. Price Improvement</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In mid to late 2002, with its stock price languishing, eSpeed sought to \u201creinvigorate its growth rate.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> To this end, eS-peed developed Price Improvement (\u201cPI\u201d), \u201ca new trading option ... purportedly designed to help bidders get better trade executions in exchange for payment of considerably higher commissions.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations is that throughout the putative class period, defendants described PI in a falsely positive light, despite their knowledge <em>first, </em>that their customers\u2019 response to PI was uniformly hostile, and <em>second, </em>that PI was a failure that would (and did) cause customers to defect <em>en masse </em>to BrokerTec as soon as it became a viable alternative.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The putative class period begins on November 20, 2002, soon after \u201ceSpeed began to advise its customers about the general contours of [PI], due to be put in place in early 2003.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Plaintiffs assert that the impressions of eSpeed\u2019s seven hundred customers were accurately portrayed by a November 20, 2002 article in <em>Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, </em>entitled \u201cTraders Cry Foul Over eSpeed\u2019s New Bond Broking Service\u201d (\u201cTraders Cry Foul Article\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This article, based on interviews with some of eSpeed\u2019s customers, reported that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-16\">[eSpeed] is facing harsh criticism from some of its biggest Wall Street customers over a new feature that allows traders to trump the bids and offers of other market participants in return for a higher commission. The controversial feature, named \u2018Price Improvement,\u2019 is part of eSpeed\u2019s new software release [which] allows traders to leapfrog \u2014 as many as three times \u2014 past competing traders in a lineup of bids and offers. The trader who does so pays an incrementally higher commission with each jump if the trade is completed.... Though [PI] promises bigger per-trade commissions for eSpeed on those trades where it is used, the strategy could ultimately backfire .... <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-18\">The article also reported that \u201ctraders and managers at several large Wall Street bond desks say the new feature has made them less apt to trade on eSpeed because of the higher cost of accessing the best prices.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Similarly, a Columbia Universi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>ty professor interviewed for the story asserted that \u201c[a]s an economist, I don\u2019t see why the rest of the players should agree to incentive pricing like this, and I guess they don\u2019t want to, based on the complaining.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In response, Lutnick (in the words of the article) \u201cattributed [customer] criticism to a natural resistance to change that he believes will pass once traders discover how the new feature improves their access to prices.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The company also equated complaints about PI to \u201cthe initial distaste shown for electronic trading when it emerged in the late 1990s.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Price [improvement, by its definition, will create better opportunities for traders to get a better price than they initially put into the system,\u2019 \u201d said Lutnick. \u201c \u2018In time, traders will wonder how they ever lived without this.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u201cIn the three trading days after Lut-nick\u2019s statements were published in <em>Dow Jones Capital Markets Report </em>(and [ ] repeated in the <em>Wall Street Journal), </em>eS-peed\u2019s stock price rose approximately 15%.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Several other articles from late 2002 and early 2003 also discuss customer doubts regarding PI, as well as eSpeed\u2019s assurances that such doubts would fade once Pi\u2019s benefits became manifest.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">PI was \u201cformally put into use\u201d in January 2003.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Plaintiffs assert that after the launch, \u201cdefendants [] embarked upon a sustained scheme of misrepresentation,\u201d the goal of which was to mislead the market into believing that PI was winning over customers and adding value to eSpeed\u2019s services.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Plaintiffs proffer two confidential witnesses to establish that defendants had information to the contrary. The first witness (\u201cCW-1\u201d) was employed as a customer account executive throughout the class period.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> His job was to explain PI to approximately forty customers and solicit feedback.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u201cCW-1 reports that customer reaction was uniformly negative from the beginning, and that this did not change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>later on.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The complaints heard by CW-1, in sum, revealed that customers \u201cviewed [PI] as a nearly useless system that was merely a subterfuge for raising commissions.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> CW-1 was in a position to report these findings directly to Lutnick, and he did so.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Lutnick continued to \u201cmisrepresent[ ] the benefits of [PI] and the level of customer acceptance on public conference calls.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> \u201cLutnick also misrepresented throughout the Class Period that customers were opting to use [PI] of their own volition, when, in fact, they were often coerced into using it through the threat of disadvantageous [trade] executions.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATo\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second confidential witness (\u201cCW-2\u201d) was employed throughout the class period in eSpeed\u2019s Desktop Support and as a field technician, where he fielded complaints about PI on a daily basis.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> CW-2 asserts that PI was an \u201cunmitigated disaster from day one.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Specifically, CW-2 relays that he received up to one hundred complaints regarding trade executions \u201con an average bad day,\u201d and that customers believed they were essentially forced to use PI.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Moreover, eSpeed did not provide CW-2 with the necessary information to adequately explain PI to complaining customers, and this \u201cfueled customer anger.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Finally, CW-2 asserts that, during client visits, he personally observed clients installing the necessary hardware to use BrokerTec instead of eS-peed.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">Plaintiffs also assert that BrokerTec emerged as a formidable competitor for the first time in late 2003.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> According to plaintiffs, BrokerTec\u2019s rise \u201crendered eS-peed increasingly vulnerable to competitive forces because eSpeed had adopted the odious [PI] system to artificially boost revenues, while BrokerTec simply set reasonable prices for trades.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">2. Materially False Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">In light of the foregoing, plaintiffs allege that all defendants\u2019 statements regarding PI were materially false and misleading for several reasons. <em>First, </em>defendants knew that their customers hated PI because it \u201chiked commissions considerably, provided little or nothing in the way of price improvement, did not work well ... and was tantamount to ... blackmail since those who did not opt for [PI] saw their trades fall behind in priority.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>eSpeed aimed to produce short-term unsustainable revenue increases because any increase in revenues attributable to PI was simply the result of forcing customers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>use a product they hated.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> <em>Third, </em>PI generated a \u201cnever-ending barrage\u201d of complaints, fielded by inadequately-trained employees who could not resolve customer concerns.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> <em>Finally, </em>defendants concealed from the market the fact \u201cthat PI could be imposed on unwilling customers only for so long as no other trading firm had sufficient depth to draw these customers away.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Plaintiffs allege that the campaign of misrepresentation began with Lutnick\u2019s comments quoted in the Traders Cry Foul Article. According to plaintiffs, he \u201chad no reasonable basis to believe that customers would \u2018wonder how they lived without\u2019 [PI], as it was (i) adverse to their interests; (ii) increased their costs; (iii) did not provide ... \u2018price improvement\u2019 (iv) complicated and slowed trades; and (v) was viewed as an extortionate method of raising commissions without providing a concomitant benefit.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">During a February 11, 2003 conference call to discuss eSpeed\u2019s fiscal year 2002 results, Amaitis stated that PI \u201cis new technology ... out for just over a month, and the marketplace is growing accustomed to it. All the traders are learning ... how to improve their business on using the new software. We\u2019re excited about the prospects. So far, so good. Everybody has been anxiously using it and learning how to use the technology.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Chertoff echoed these comments: \u201c[PI] should not only increase revenue on transactions that are utilized, but should over time be a competitive benefit in that it shows we have better prices on our screen than alternative marketplaces.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Chertoff also expressed optimism as to Pi\u2019s future: \u201cIt is fair to say the feature is [already] being actively used ... we think that [PI] will become over time, a natural ... part of the treasury trading business, but with only one month under our belt ... so far, so good.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Lutnick was similarly upbeat on a May 13, 2003 conference call: \u201c[w]e have hundreds of traders enjoying the benefits of PI and dozens of traders using PI literally for every single trade they do... .We released our PI software in January of 2003 and it continues to gain great traction.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> In an August 12, 2003 company press release, Lutnick boasted that the \u201ctremendous growth in the U.S.. Treasury market\u201d and the \u201csuccess of our [PI] software\u201d combined to produce a fifteen percent increase in both eSpeed\u2019s revenues and fully-electronic trading volume from the first quarter 2003 to the second quarter.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The next day, Lutnick stated on a conference call that PI has become \u201csuccessful,\u201d that it \u201ccontinues to gain traction,\u201d and that \u201cit is obvious that eSpeed [benefited] from ... successful introduction of our [PI] software.\u201d <footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>On November 13, 2003, Lutnick told analysts that PI was a \u201cgrowth driver,\u201d which in the third quarter of 2003 \u201ccontinued to gain traction with both the number of users and amount of usage per trader.\u201d <footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Lutnick also asserted that \u201cPI is already an integral part of the way traders trade.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> He also agreed with an analyst\u2019s comment that PI was the sole reason for eSpeed\u2019s increasing revenues and market share in the third quarter of 2003.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The upbeat statements about PI continued into 2004. Lutnick reiterated on a February 10, 2004 conference call that he expected PI to \u201ccontinue to grow.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> On May 3, 2004, Amaitis was quoted in a company press release as attributing eS-peed\u2019s revenue growth for the first quarter 2004, in part, to the \u201ccontinued success of our [PI] product enhancement.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> When analysts expressed concern about eSpeed\u2019s deteriorating market position on May 4, 2004, Lutnick insisted that BrokerTec was gaining market share merely because of a temporary incentive promotion.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">3. The End of Price Improvement</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">On July 1, 2004, the last day of the putative class period, eSpeed shares closed at $17.46 per share.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> After the markets closed that day, eSpeed issued a press release \u201cupdate\u201d of financial expectations for the second quarter which ended on June 30, 2004.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> This release disclosed that eSpeed expected to report net income from $0.15 to $0.16 per share for the second quarter of 2004, and revenue between $42 and 43 million.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> These results disappointed the market; eSpeed shares plunged twenty-five percent, to $13.01 per share on July 2, 2004, and to $11.39 per share on July 3.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The July 1 release quoted Lutnick as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-14\">Our weaker than expected performance during the second quarter was due to erosion of our market position from competitive pricing pressure and lower than expected market volumes in Europe. We are proactively addressing our market position, by offering tailored and flexible solutions that have the effect of driving down the marginal costs of trading on eSpeed. We are focusing on a revenue growth strategy that offers our customers the combination of variable and fixed commissions and value-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>added trading tools.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfP\">During a July 2, 2004 conference call, Lutnick denied an analyst\u2019s suggestion that eSpeed\u2019s loss of market share was caused by customer \u201canimosity\u201d towards PI.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> According to <em>CBS Marketwatch, </em>\u201cLutnick frustrated some analysts in [the July 2 conference call], saying he failed to lay out a feasible plan to aggressively compete with [BrokerTec] on pricing and product offerings.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> On August 6, 2004, eS-peed announced that it was \u201crevamping its pricing structure to a mostly fixed pricing model, from the prior structure consisting of a low fixed price component and a higher variable pricing component.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">eSpeed announced the end of PI on January 4, 2005. Paul Saltzman, eSpeed\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, stated that the elimination of PI was \u201ca result of extensive discussions and feedback from our clients.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> A January 17, 2005 article in <em>Securities Industry News </em>noted that \u201cusers have complained that the system, initiated in 2002, was expensive, provided little benefit, and slowed down execution.\u201d <footnotemark>77</footnotemark> According to Saltzman, \u201cBy making the system simpler and faster, it will draw liquidity to the system.... Over time, we expect our market share to increase.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> eSpeed\u2019s new CFO Jay Ryan stated on March 1, 2005, \u201c[r]emoval of [PI] has been very well-received by customers.\u201d <footnotemark>79</footnotemark> And eSpeed President Kevin Foley stated on May 10, 2005 that eSpeed\u2019s trading volume \u201cgrew because of our new customer pricing and the removal of [PI].\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">A \u201cdetailed analysis of eSpeed\u2019s business\u201d in the August 15, 2005 edition of <em>Forbes </em>magazine asserted that \u201c[clients hated [PI]. In the 18 months after introducing the gimmick, eSpeed lost an estimated 20 percentage points of market share.... Traders credit Saltzman with persuading Lutnick (after seven months of pleading) to drop [PI]. \u2018When we had the time and the resources to listen to our customers, we removed it,\u2019 Saltzman says.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">4. Scienter Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">Plaintiffs assert that \u201c[t]he ongoing fraudulent scheme described in this Complaint could not have been perpetrated ... without the knowledge and complicity of the personnel at the highest level of the Company, including the Individual Defendants.\u201d <footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also allege that defendants Amaitis and Noviello completed three \u201cunusual\u201d stock sales between them during the class period. Amaitis sold a total of 98,750 shares of eSpeed stock on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>December 12 and December 15 of 2003, for gross proceeds of $2,207,000.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> After selling these shares, Amaitis still held 103,512 shares.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Noviello received $593,000 from a sale of 25,000 shares of eSpeed stock on December 20, 2003, leaving him with only 2,331 shares.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Neither defendant had bought or sold any eSpeed stock during the prior two years.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">III. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"Au0\">A.

Prima Facie Case</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">To state a prima facie case for securities fraud under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must allege that \u201c \u2018the defendant, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, made a materially false statement or omitted a material fact, with scienter, and that plaintiffs reliance on defendant\u2019s action caused injury to the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> The requisite state of mind, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>or scienter, in a securities fraud action is \u201c \u2018an intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Securities fraud actions are subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b),<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d).<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> To plead a material misrepresentation or omission under the PSLRA \u201cthe complaint [must] specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information or belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Rule 9(b)\u2018 requires, among other things, \u201cthat the pleading \u2018explain why the statements were fraudulent.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">2. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Section 804(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 provides that a securities fraud action \u201cmay be brought not later than the earlier of (1) two years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation; or (2) five years after such violation.\u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> For statute of limitations purposes, discovery of the relevant facts includes inquiry notice as well as actual notice:<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXU\">A plaintiff in a federal securities case will be deemed to have discovered fraud for purposes of triggering the statute of limitations when a reasonable investor of ordinary intelligence would have discovered the existence of the fraud.... Moreover, when the circumstances would suggest to an investor of ordinary intelligence the probability that she has been defrauded, a duty of inquiry arises, and knowledge will be imputed to the investor who does not make such an inquiry.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">To be placed on such a duty of inquiry, or \u201cinquiry notice,\u201d plaintiffs \u201cneed not be able to learn the precise details of the fraud, but they must be capable of perceiving the general fraudulent scheme based on the information available to them.\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> That said, available information must establish \u201ca probability, not a possibility\u201d of fraud to trigger inqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>ry notice.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> Moreover, on a motion to dismiss, \u201c[u]nless Defendants can produce \u2018uncontroverted evidence [that] irrefutably demonstrates when plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the fraudulent scheme, they cannot satisfy the heavy burden of establishing inquiry notice as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> The Second Circuit is \u201cdecidedly reluctant to foreclose [ ] claims as untimely absent a manifest indication that plaintiffs could have learned the facts underpinning their allegations\u201d prior to the statutory limitations period.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Facts triggering a duty to inquire are frequently termed \u201cstorm warnings.\u201d <footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Once sufficient storm warnings appear, \u201cplaintiffs must exhibit \u2018reasonable diligence\u2019 in investigating the possibility that they have been defrauded. If they fail to meet this obligation, plaintiffs will be held to have had \u2018constructive knowledge\u2019 of the fraud against them.\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> A plaintiffs duty of inquiry is mitigated when \u201cthe warning signs are accompanied by reliable words of comfort from management.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> \u201cHowever, reassuring statements will prevent the emergence of a duty to inquire or dissipate such a duty only if an investor of ordinary intelligence would reasonably rely on the statements to allay the investor\u2019s concern.\u201d<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> \u201cWhether reassuring statements justify reasonable reliance that apparent storm warnings have dissipated will depend in large part on [1] how significant the company\u2019s disclosed problems are, [2] how likely they are of a recurring nature, and [3] how substantial are the \u2018reassuring\u2019 steps announced to avoid their recurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">3. Materiality</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">An alleged misstatement must be material \u2014 \u201c[i]t is not enough that a statement is false or incomplete, if the misrepresented fact is otherwise insignificant.\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> A fact is considered material if there is a \u201csubstantial likelihood that a reasonable person would consider it important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares\u201d of the stock.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> Similarly, a plaintiff must show that there was a \u201csubstantial likelihood that the disclosure of [an] omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information available,\u201d<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> and that at the time of the investment, a reasonable investor would have considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the omitted information as significant.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Although the materiality question is not often amenable to disposition as a matter of law,<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> there are a few situations where it might be appropriate to dismiss a complaint on such grounds. <em>First, </em>\u201ccourts have demonstrated a willingness to find immaterial as a matter of law a certain kind of rosy affirmation ... numbingly familiar to the marketplace \u2014 loosely optimistic statements that are so vague, so lacking in specificity, or so clearly constituting the opinions of the speaker, that no reasonable investor could find them important to the total mix of information available.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\"><em>Second, </em>optimistic company statements can also be rendered immaterial by the \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine. This doctrine provides that \u201ccertain alleged misrepresentations made in connection with the purchase or sale of a security are deemed immaterial as a matter of law because it cannot be said that a reasonable investor would consider them important in light of adequate cautionary language that is set forth in the applicable disclosure documents.\u201d<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> When, as here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">[PJlaintiffs proceed on a fraud-on-the-market theory ... the defendants\u2019 cautionary statements must be treated as if attached to every one of its oral and written statements. Under this reasoning, the Court must consider whether any cautionary language provided by the defendants at any time sufficiently warned of the risk of which plaintiffs complain.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">But the scope of the doctrine is limited to \u201cprospective representations,\u201d as opposed to representations concerning \u201cpresent or historical facts,\u201d which \u201ccannot be cured by cautionary language.\u201d<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> \u201cAdditionally, the cautionary language must be examined in the context of the representations to determine whether the language warns of the specific contingency that lies at the heart of the alleged misrepresentation.\u201d <footnotemark>118</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\"><em>Finally, </em>a corollary to the fraud on the market presumption, known as the \u201ctruth-on-the-market\u201d doctrine, provides that an alleged misstatement cannot defraud the market, and is thus immaterial, when the truth of the matter is already known to the market.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> \u201cHowever, the corrective information must be conveyed to the public with a degree of intensity and credibility sufficient to counter-balance ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>fectively any misleading information created by the alleged misstatements.\u201d<footnotemark>120</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">4. Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The PSLRA requires that a securities fraud complaint \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough speculation and conclusory allegations will not suffice, neither do we require \u2018great specificity\u2019 provided the plaintiff alleges enough facts to support \u2018a strong inference of fraudulent intent.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> Facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter can be alleged by one of two methods: the plaintiff may plead \u201cmotive and opportunity to commit fraud\u201d or \u201cstrong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\u201d <footnotemark>123</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">i. Motive and Opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">\u201cMotive [entails] concrete benefits that could be realized by one or more of the false statements and wrongful nondisclo-sures alleged,\u201d while \u201c[opportunity [entails] the ... likely prospect of achieving concrete benefits by the-means alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> \u201cMotives ... generally possessed by most corporate directors and officers do not suffice; instead, plaintiffs must assert a concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants resulting from the fraud.\u201d<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> The desire \u201cto inflate stock prices while [defendants] sold their own shares\u201d may support a viable claim,<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> if a plaintiff can allege that any such sales were in some way \u201cunusual.\u201d<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> Extensive sales can be unusual, and the amount of profit and the percentage of a defendant\u2019s holdings that were sold are also relevant.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">Regarding the \u201copportunity\u201d prong, courts often assume that corporations, corporate officers and corporate directors would have the opportunity to commit fraud if they so desired.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> However, opportunity to commit fraud may not exist if the alleged scheme had no chance of succeeding.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-20\">ii. Conscious Misbehavior or Recklessness</p>\n<p id=\"b337-21\">When plaintiffs have failed to plead motive and opportunity, \u201cit is still possible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>plead scienter by identifying circumstances indicating conscious behavior [or recklessness] by defendant, though the strength of the circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly greater.\u201d<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> Conscious misconduct is relatively easy to identify, \u201csince it encompasses deliberate illegal behavior, such as securities trading by insiders privy to undisclosed and material information ... or knowing sale of a company\u2019s stock at an unwarranted discount.\u201d<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u201cRecklessness is harder to identify with ... precision and consistency.\u201d<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> To allege recklessness, plaintiff must allege facts showing that the defendants\u2019 conduct was \u201chighly unreasonable, representing an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u201d<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> Recklessness is adequately alleged when, inter alia, a plaintiff \u201cspecifically alleges defendants\u2019 knowledge of facts or access to information contradicting their public statements.\u201d <footnotemark>135</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">5. Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">A securities fraud plaintiff must also plead both (1) that it relied upon defendant\u2019s allegedly fraudulent conduct in purchasing or selling securities, and (2) that defendant\u2019s conduct caused plaintiffs loss at least in part.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> These two elements are known, respectively, as \u201ctransaction causation\u201d and \u201closs causation.\u201d<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> Loss causation refers to the requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate that the fraudulent scheme caused her loss.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> In the case of a 10b-5 action alleging a material misstatement or omission, loss causation generally requires a plaintiff to show that her investments would not have lost value if the facts that defendants misrepresented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>or omitted had been known.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In <em>Dura, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s permissive pleading standard for loss causation, which required only that a plaintiff allege that she bought a security at an artificially inflated price. The Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">[I]t should not prove burdensome for a plaintiff who has suffered an economic loss to provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind. At the same time, allowing a plaintiff to forgo giving any indication of the economic loss and proximate cause that the plaintiff has in mind would bring about harm of the very sort the statutes seek to avoid.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Put simply, a plaintiff must allege that \u201cthe loss [was] foreseeable and [ ] the loss [was] caused by the materialization of the concealed risk.\u201d<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> The Second Circuit\u2019s loss causation standard was recently summarized by this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">Where the alleged misstatement conceals a condition or event which then occurs and causes the plaintiffs loss, it is the materialization of the undisclosed condition or event that causes the loss. By contrast, where the alleged misstatement is an intentionally false opinion, the market will not respond to the truth until the falsity is revealed \u2014 i.e. a corrective disclosure.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Defendants urge dismissal for a plethora of reasons: (1) this action is time-barred because plaintiffs were on inquiry notice of the alleged fraud by November 2002; (2) plaintiffs have failed to allege loss causation; (3) defendants\u2019 alleged misstatements were nothing more than non-actionable puffery; (4) the alleged misstatements were immaterial pursuant to the truth-on-the-market doctrine; (5) the statements were protected by the \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine; (6) scienter cannot be inferred because the alleged scheme defies economic reason; (7) plaintiffs have failed to allege motive as to any defendant; and (8) plaintiffs have failed to allege conscious misbehavior or recklessness as to any defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">Although this action is not time-barred, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are insufficient in at least two respects. <em>First, </em>most of the alleged misstatements are immaterial because they are (1) puffery; and/or (2) protected by the bespeaks caution doctrine. <em>Second, </em>plaintiffs fail to adequately allege scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">A. Plaintiffs Claims Are Not Time-Barred</p>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs were placed on inquiry notice by the press accounts detailing customer dissatisfaction with PI that began appearing on November 20, 2002, the first day of the putative class period and more than two years prior to the filing of the first complaint in this action. As the first Complaint in this consolidated action was filed on February 15, 2005, February 15, 2003 is the key date for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>statute of limitations purposes \u2014 if plaintiffs\u2019 duty of inquiry arose before that date, this action is time-barred.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> Although defendants submit several articles published prior to February 15, 2003 that discuss PI,<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> they particularly point to the Traders Cry Foul Article featured prominently in the Complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-3\">[The Traders Cry Foul Article] not only trumpets the fact that PI \u2018is facing harsh criticism from some of [eSpeed\u2019s] biggest Wall Street customers,\u2019 it serves as a blueprint for the Complaint. Every allegation of fraud in the Complaint is contained in the Traders Cry Foul Article ... it is so comprehensive that plaintiffs <em>could have drafted all of the allegations of wrongdoing in the Complaint after the publication of the article on November 20, 2002.</em><footnotemark><em>145</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Defendants\u2019 argument is not persuasive for two reasons. <em>First, </em>the argument that plaintiffs could have drafted the complaint based on an article published in November 2002, before PI was even launched, is absurd, as the Complaint alleges specific misrepresentations made on the following dates: (1) 2/11/03 (conference call); (2) 5/13/03 (conference call); (3) 8/12/03 (press release); (4) 11/13/03 (statement to analysts); (5) 2/10/04 (conference call); and (6) 5/3/04 (press release). Moreover, these early articles give no indication of fraud or misrepresentations \u2014 they only convey the message that PI was a controversial new product.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> Cases on which defendants rely involved far more specific warnings of fraud.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\"><em>Second, </em>even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the press articles constituted storm warnings, investors also heard contemporaneous statements from eSpeed management, asserting that the criticisms aired in the articles were merely the doubts normally expressed when confronted with revolutionary products such as PI. These statements went beyond mere expressions of hope but instead were designed to specifically address the concerns raised in the Traders Cry Foul Article and the other articles cited by defendants.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>In particular, Lutnick was quoted in the Traders Cry Foul Article as attributing customer unease to simply their lack of understanding of a revolutionary product, saying that, once customers grew to understand PI, \u201ctraders will wonder how they ever lived without [it].\u201d<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> This message was reinforced in the early days of PI by other defendants.<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> As plaintiffs note, \u201c[t]hese positive statements ... were meant to \u2014 and did \u2014 temper any warning signs that may have arisen from the media coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> Courts often decline to find that plaintiffs were on inquiry notice in the face of such \u201creliable words of comfort\u201d designed to counter information that might otherwise give rise to inquiry notice.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In fact, defendants even now assert that PI was in the tradition of \u201ceSpeed\u2019s past innovations, such as electronic trading itself,\u201d where initial customer skepticism quickly melted away.<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> Especially given this prior experience, investors in 2002 could have reasonably relied on eSpeed\u2019s assurances that customer skepticism of PI would eventually fade, thus precluding a finding as a matter of law that the press articles gave rise to a duty of inquiry.<footnotemark>154</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">B. Materiality</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">Defendants argue that, for three reasons, any misstatements or omissions made by defendants were immaterial as a matter of law. <em>First, </em>defendants contend that statements regarding PI were non-actionable puffery. <em>Second, </em>defendants invoke the bespeaks caution doctrine, noting that eSpeed repeatedly warned that (1) PI was new technology that may not catch on with the market; and (2) eSpeed would face stiff competition from a variety of competitors including BrokerTec. <em>Third, </em>defendants advance a \u201ctruth-on-the-mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>ket\u201d defense: \u201ccustomer criticism of PI\u2014 rather than being a \u2018secret\u2019 known only by defendants and kept from potential investors \u2014 was instead widely reported and plainly set forth in a series of articles and news releases in reputable media outlets.\u201d <footnotemark>155</footnotemark> For the following reasons, most (but not all) of the alleged misstatements are immaterial as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">1. Puffery</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">I reject defendants\u2019 assertion that <em>none </em>of the alleged misstatements were anything more than generalized expressions of corporate optimism. Nonetheless, three of the alleged misstatements constitute mere puffery upon which no investor could have reasonably relied. Liability cannot be based on a vaguely positive statement that \u201c[wje\u2019re excited about [Pi\u2019s] prospects. So far, so good. Everybody has been anxiously using it and learning how to use the technology.\u201d<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> Similarly, Amaitis\u2019 statement that he was \u201cextremely encouraged\u201d by Pi\u2019s introduction, and that he \u201clook[s] forward to growing this business as more and more users recognize Pi\u2019s tremendous benefit\u201d is non-actionable puffery.<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> Finally, the 10b-5 claim against Noviello is dismissed on this independent ground, as his non-actionable statements regarding Pi\u2019s \u201cwidespread adoption,\u201d and PI as an example of the \u201cinnovative solutions [produced by] the collaboration between our product development teams and our software engineering teams,\u201d are the only statements plaintiffs ascribe to him.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">2. Bespeaks Caution Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">Defendants are also correct in their assertion that many of the remaining alleged misstatements are protected by the bespeaks caution doctrine, as defendants\u2019 expressed optimism regarding Pi\u2019s performance was adequately tempered by cautionary language. For example, eS-peed\u2019s December 1999 prospectus stated that eSpeed \u201cwould face competition from a variety of competitors, including a proposed electronic trading network known as BrokerTee.\u201d<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Warnings about challenges posed by eSpeed\u2019s competitors, including BrokerTee, also appeared in eS-peed\u2019s 2002 and 2003 Form 10-Ks.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">As for PI specifically, while defendants were consistently optimistic about its prospects throughout the putative class period, their statements were tinged with caution. eSpeed\u2019s Form 10-Ks from 2001-2003 all noted, inter alia, that \u201cwe cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies.\u201d<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> More concretely, defendants\u2019 press releases and oral statements during the class period repeatedly cautioned investors that PI was not a sure thing.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark> As late as May 4, 2004, Amaitis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>noted that \u201cno single [new] product has yet reached traction.\u201d<footnotemark>163</footnotemark> Thus, investors were adequately warned that PI may not achieve the success envisioned by defendants.<footnotemark>164</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">3. Truth-on-the-Market</p>\n<p id=\"A5q\">The foregoing analysis does not completely foreclose plaintiffs\u2019 claims, as some of defendants\u2019 statements are statements of present or historical fact.<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> For their \u201ctruth-on-the-market\u201d defense, which can apply to statements of present or historical fact, defendants rely on <em>White v. H&amp;R Block, Inc., </em>where the information supposedly concealed from the market (the pendency of numerous class-action lawsuits against defendant) had already been fully disclosed by court documents, press coverage, and SEC filings.<footnotemark>166</footnotemark> Thus, \u201cthe truth was all over the market,\u201d and any misstatements or omissions concerning the lawsuits made by defendants were immaterial as a matter of law.<footnotemark>167</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Although it is difficult to believe that investors could have been blind to the possibility that PI might fail and thereby damage the company, I cannot find the alleged misstatements immaterial as a matter of law.<footnotemark>168</footnotemark> In <em>White, </em>the allegedly concealed information involved objective facts about pending litigation, readily available to anyone who could access public records. The market\u2019s knowledge about the litigation, notwithstanding any representations or omissions by defendants, could not reasonably be disputed.<footnotemark>169</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Here, by contrast, plaintiffs point to the same collection of news articles that I addressed earlier in my discussion of inquiry notice. As already noted, the bad publicity surrounding PI during its introduction to the market was counteracted by authoritative statements from defendants, assuring the market that PI would catch on once customers were educated about its benefits.<footnotemark>170</footnotemark> Thus, I cannot conclude <em>at this time </em>that the corrective information, here the press articles, was \u201cconveyed to the public with a degree of intensity and credibility sufficient to counter-balance effectively any misleading information created by the alleged misstatements.\u201d<footnotemark>171</footnotemark> If defendants eventually discover additional disclosures counteracting defendants\u2019 statements regarding PI, summary judgment on this ground might be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">C. Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">1. The Alleged Scheme Does Not Defy Economic Reason</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Defendants first argue that there can be no possible inference of scienter here because plaintiffs\u2019 allegations presume that defendants\u2019 behavior was irrational. \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 theory is that defendants repeatedly described PI in a \u2018falsely positive\u2019 light even though they supposedly knew it was detested by customers, provided no benefits and was doomed to fail.... To take such a substantial risk for almost no benefit defies economic sense.\u201d <footnotemark>172</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">It is occasionally appropriate for a court to refuse to infer scienter, even on a recklessness theory, when plaintiffs\u2019 allegations presume economically irrational behavior from defendants or are otherwise illogical.<footnotemark>173</footnotemark> But it should go without saying that, at the motion to dismiss stage, it is rarely proper for a court to decide that a plaintiffs allegations make no sense. And here, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are not completely irrational.<footnotemark>174</footnotemark> This is not a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>where defendants allegedly attempted to \u201cconceal\u201d information already available to the public;<footnotemark>175</footnotemark> or where crediting plaintiffs\u2019 allegations would mean believing that defendants went out of their way to lose vast sums of money.<footnotemark>176</footnotemark> Rather, the gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations is that eSpeed and its officers misrepresented the true state of PI over a two-year period. Whether plaintiffs have stated' a valid <em>motive </em>for scienter purposes is a separate question, but they have certainly alleged a campaign of misrepresentation that could, in the abstract, rationally be expected to indefinitely inflate eSpeed\u2019s share price.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">2. Motive and Opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motive and opportunity allegations are confined to the stock sales of Amaitis and Noviello during the putative class period.<footnotemark>177</footnotemark> But the biggest problem with these allegations is that neither Chertoff nor Lutnick (who owned <em>thirty million </em>eSpeed shares during the putative class period) completed any stock sales. \u201cAs [CJhairman and CEO of [eSpeed], and as the individual who actually made most of the alleged misstatements during the class period, defendant [Lutnick], if anyone, was surely well-positioned to reap profits from insider knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>178</footnotemark> For this reason, the fact that neither Chertoff nor Lutnick sold stock during the putative class period undermines plaintiffs\u2019 motive allegations against defendants.<footnotemark>179</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 motive allegations against Amaitis and Noviello are insufficient even when considered separately. It does not suffice to point in isolation to the combined proceeds of defendants (here, $2.8 million) and claim that this \u201cpatently significant\u201d dollar amount alone establishes scienter.<footnotemark>180</footnotemark> The Complaint also omits necessary information concerning (1) the percentage increase in each defendants\u2019 holdings during the class period; and (2) the profit from defendants\u2019 sales.<footnotemark>181</footnotemark> In particular, plaintiffs plead that Amaitis and Noviello realized \u201cgross proceeds\u201d of $2.8 million, but the Complaint does not disclose whether either made any <em>'profit </em>from the sales.<footnotemark>182</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Whether either defendant sold a significant percentage of his stock holdings is a closer issue. Plaintiffs allege that Amaitis sold 48% percent, and Noviello 88% percent, of their stock holdings during the putative class period.<footnotemark>183</footnotemark> These percentages, however, are inaccurate because they do not account for the stock options held by Amaitis and Noviello, which must be considered along with shares actually held in determining whether insider sales are significant.<footnotemark>184</footnotemark> Wfhen defendants\u2019 stock options are included in the calculations, not only are the relevant percentages 8.08% (Amaitis) and 4.98% (Noviello), but in fact \u201ceach of the Individual Defendants' \u2014 Amai-tis and Noviello included \u2014 actually <em>increased </em>their beneficial ownership of eS-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>peed stock during that time.\u201d<footnotemark>185</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">At the same time, all stock options are not created equal. Many courts draw a distinction between options that are vested (and thus immediately exercisable) and those that are not. This rationale for this distinction was explained by the Ninth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">When evaluating stock sales ... the proportion of shares actually sold by an insider to the volume of shares he <em>could have sold </em>is probative of whether the sale was unusual or suspicious.... In this case, we see no reason to distinguish vested stock options from shares because vested stock options can be converted easily to shares and sold immediately. Actual stock shares plus <em>exercisable </em>stock options represent the owner\u2019s trading potential more accurately than the stock shares alone. Therefore, a sale involving a significant portion of an insider\u2019s actual shares, but only a small portion of his shares and options combined, is less suspicious than were the insider to hold no options.<footnotemark>186</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The Second Circuit\u2019s view on this issue is not crystal clear. The <em>Acito </em>court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 contention that defendant\u2019s sale of 30,000 shares represented an unusual sale because this sale \u201crepresented less than 11% of [defendant\u2019s] holdings; after the sale, [defendant] owned approximately 259,000 shares and/or options of IMCERA stock,\u201d a figure that included 93,000 <em>unexercisable </em>options.<footnotemark>187</footnotemark> However, five years later in <em>Rothman, </em>the Second Circuit approvingly noted that the lower court opinion it was reviewing only considered exercisable options.<footnotemark>188</footnotemark> And district courts in this Circuit, even when relying upon <em>Acito, </em>often decline to consider a defendant\u2019s unexercisable options.<footnotemark>189</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">When only shares and <em>exercisable </em>options are considered, Amaitis sold 17.4% percent of his holdings,<footnotemark>190</footnotemark> and Noviello sold 10.9% of his holdings.<footnotemark>191</footnotemark> Nevertheless, to the extent that I am not constrained by <em>Acito </em>(which would clearly lead to a finding that these sales are <em>de </em>minimis), I still find these sales insufficient to establish motive as to Amaitis and Noviello. Again, the dispositive factor is that other insiders, including the other two individual defendants, did not sell during the putative class period. Given this, it is difficult to conclude that sales by two of the four defendants of less than twenty percent of their individual holdings represent such unusual selling activity as to give rise to an inference that either defendant intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>defraud investors.<footnotemark>192</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiffs have failed to allege motive and opportunity as to any defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">3. Conscious Misbehavior or Recklessness</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In order to plead conscious misbehavior or recklessness, plaintiffs must \u201cspecifically allege[ ] defendants\u2019 knowledge of facts or access to information contradicting their public statements.\u201d<footnotemark>193</footnotemark> When such a contradiction is pled, and when the requirements of Rule 9(b) are otherwise satisfied, \u201cthe falsity and scienter [pleading] requirements are essentially combined.\u201d<footnotemark>194</footnotemark> \u201cThat is, if [the Complaint has] sufficiently pled facts to support scienter, [it has] also met the pleading requirements for falsity.\u201d<footnotemark>195</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Plaintiffs fail to point to specific reports contradicting defendants\u2019 public state-merits. Such lack of specificity is ordinarily fatal to a plaintiffs effort to plead scien-ter based on conscious misbehavior or recklessness.<footnotemark>196</footnotemark> But here, plaintiffs rely on <em>first, </em>the information relayed by CW-1 and CW-2;<footnotemark>197</footnotemark> and <em>second, </em>an assertion that \u201cthe sheer significance of PI as a business model for eSpeed \u2014 including market share, trading volume, etc. \u2014 -substantiate defendants\u2019 knowledge, or recklessness in not knowing, of the customer complaints and defections to competing trading companies.\u201d<footnotemark>198</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">Even assuming that their statements are otherwise reliable, plaintiffs\u2019 confidential witnesses can establish scienter only as to Lutnick and eSpeed itself. CW-1 only reported his findings to Lutnick, and CW-2 did not (as far as the Complaint alleges) report his findings to anyone.<footnotemark>199</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>over, the information relayed by CW-1 is simply insufficient to establish that eSpeed or Lutnick made knowingly false statements about PI. Defendants\u2019 points are well taken that <em>first, </em>plaintiffs fail to allege <em>when, </em>or by direct quote <em>what, </em>CW-1 actually told Lutnick; and <em>second, </em>that the negative feedback CW-1 received was from only forty customers, \u201ca tiny fraction (6%) of eSpeed\u2019s customer base (alleged to be 700).\u201d <footnotemark>200</footnotemark> The fact that six percent of customers disliked PI does not necessarily mean that Lutnick lacked a reasonable basis for expressing optimism about Pi\u2019s prospects.<footnotemark>201</footnotemark> Finally, it is unclear whether CW-1 ever spoke to a customer who actually used PI; his information was gathered \u201cin late 2002 or early 2003,\u201d <footnotemark>202</footnotemark> but PI was not introduced to the marketplace until January 2003.<footnotemark>203</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 alternative argument that defendants should be charged with knowledge of an allegedly \u201cvital portion\u201d of eS-peed\u2019s business such as PI is potentially meritorious. In <em>Cosmas v. Hassett, </em>plaintiffs alleged that defendant directors falsely claimed that \u201c[s]ales to the People\u2019s Republic of China ... are also an important new source of revenue for [defendant] Inflight.\u201d <footnotemark>204</footnotemark> To plead conscious misbehavior or recklessness, plaintiffs alleged that, at the time this statement was made, defendants were aware that China had recently adopted \u25a0 new import restrictions that would essentially preclude new sales to China.<footnotemark>205</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The Second Circuit held that plaintiffs had successfully pled scienter, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">[T]he [] complaint alleges facts from which one can reasonably infer that sales to [China] were to represent a significant part of Inflight\u2019s business. These facts [in turn] give rise to a strong inference that the defendants, who [were allegedly] directors of Inflight, had knowledge of [China\u2019s] import restrictions, since the restrictions apparently eliminated a potentially significant source of income for the company.<footnotemark>206</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">Thus, if the subject-matter of the alleged misstatements is sufficiently \u201csignificant\u201d to a defendant company, it may be possible for knowledge of contradictory information (and thus, scienter) to be imputed to individual defendants even in the absence of specific information contradicting their public statements.<footnotemark>207</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Nonetheless, the Complaint is inadequate in this respect because it does not allege that PI was so vital to eSpeed that its top officers must have known of the extent of Pi\u2019s failure.<footnotemark>208</footnotemark> To the extent that this \u201ccore operations\u201d method of pleading conscious misbehavior or recklessness is viable after the PSLRA,<footnotemark>209</footnotemark> plaintiffs must provide more facts to support a strong inference that any misstatements by defendants regarding PI must have been made with scienter.<footnotemark>210</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Moreover, even if PI was sufficiently significant that knowledge of its true prospects can be imputed to the individual defendants, plaintiffs must still adequately allege that defendants lacked a reasonable basis for optimism about PI. Such optimism was seemingly justified for at least part of the putative class period. For example, Lutnick announced on August 12, 2003 that \u201cthe success of our [PI] software in the second quarter\u201d contributed to a fifteen percent increase in eSpeed\u2019s revenues and electronic trading volume, and that he expected PI to contribute to higher earnings in succeeding quarters.<footnotemark>211</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Plaintiffs allege that this and similar statements were actionable because, inter alia, the revenue growth generated by PI was merely \u201cartificial[ ] and temporary! ]\u201d and achieved at the cost of \u201calienating eSpeed\u2019s customers.\u201d<footnotemark>212</footnotemark> But even so, many of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations boil down to the proposition that defendants should have <em>anticipated </em>that PI would eventually damage the company, even at a time that the company was enjoying growing revenues. Such \u201cfraud by hindsight\u201d allegations have long been rejected.<footnotemark>213</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>D. Loss Causation<footnotemark>214</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The parties dispute whether the pleading of loss causation is governed by Rule 8(a) or Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This is an issue left open by <em>Dura </em>and not squarely addressed by the Second Circuit. In light of the other deficiencies of the Complaint, I need not resolve this dispute now. Instead, like the Supreme Court in <em>Dura, </em>I assume <em>arguen-do </em>that Rule 8(a) applies.<footnotemark>215</footnotemark> Under that standard, plaintiffs\u2019 loss causation allegations just barely suffice.<footnotemark>216</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Defendants contend that plaintiffs\u2019 loss causation allegations are inadequate because the twenty-five percent stock drop on July 2, 2004 was a full six months <em>before </em>the January 4, 2005 announcement that eSpeed would discontinue PI.<footnotemark>217</footnotemark> Accordingly, defendants assert that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations here are \u201cstrikingly similar\u201d to the allegations deemed insufficient in <em>Dura.</em><footnotemark><em>218</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In <em>Dura, </em>defendant allegedly made two distinct false statements: (1) defendant falsely represented the extent of its profits from drug sales; and (2) it also claimed that it expected the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) to approve its new spray device to treat asthma.<footnotemark>219</footnotemark> On the last day of the putative class period, defendant announced disappointing earnings, which it specifically attributed to low drug sales.<footnotemark>220</footnotemark> The next day, defendant\u2019s shares plummeted.<footnotemark>221</footnotemark> Eight months <em>after </em>that loss, defendant announced that the FDA would not approve defendant\u2019s spray device after all<footnotemark>222</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">Because there was no corrective disclosure <em>regarding the spray device </em>before the economic loss occurred, the alleged deception <em>regarding the spray device </em>could not possibly have caused the economic loss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-13\">[T]he plaintiffs\u2019 lengthy complaint contains only one statement that we can fairly read as describing the loss caused by the defendants\u2019 \u2018spray device\u2019 misrepresentations. That statement says that the plaintiffs \u2018paid artificially inflated prices\u2019 for Dura\u2019s securities\u2019 and suffered \u2018damage\u2019 ... however, the \u2018artificially inflated purchase price\u2019 is not itself a relevant economic loss. And the complaint nowhere else provides the defendants with notice of what the relevant economic-loss might be or of what the causal connection might be between that loss and the misrepresentation concerning Dura\u2019s \u2018spray device.\u2019<footnotemark>223</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>As <em>Dura </em>reaffirms, it is axiomatic that \u201c[a] concealed fact cannot cause a decrease in the value of a stock before the concealment is made public.\u201d <footnotemark>224</footnotemark> But the Complaint gives rise to an inference, albeit a weak one, that by the end of the class period, investors connected eSpeed\u2019s loss of market share and financial decline to the rejection of PI by eSpeed\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Under the heading \u201cThe Truth Is Disclosed,\u201d plaintiffs allege that on July 1, 2004, eSpeed \u201cissued a press release in which it finally disclosed that [its] business was not progressing as previously anticipated.\u201d<footnotemark>225</footnotemark> Specifically, this press release disclosed disappointing results for the second quarter of 2004<footnotemark>226</footnotemark> eSpeed\u2019s stated reasons for these results were competitive pricing pressure and lower than expected market volumes in Europe.<footnotemark>227</footnotemark> A twenty-five percent drop in eSpeed\u2019s stock price ensued on July 2.<footnotemark>228</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">To plead loss causation based on these facts, plaintiffs first quote an analyst\u2019s query to Lutnick on the July 2 conference call, regarding \u201cwhether \u2018on the market share issue,\u2019 the losses were due to \u2018animosity\u2019 customers had toward Price Improvement.\u201d <footnotemark>229</footnotemark> But plaintiffs then state that \u201c[w]hile Lutnick denied this, the market now understood the truth: eSpeed\u2019s slavish adherence to a system detested by its customers might have produced artificial short-term gains, but had finally resulted in a material decline in eSpeed\u2019s financial performance.\u201d<footnotemark>230</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">This conclusory assertion, without more, cannot substitute for specific allegations that disclosure regarding PI was a proximate cause of the economic loss.<footnotemark>231</footnotemark> But plaintiffs provide some support for the proposition that the market understood the truth about PI by the end of the putative class period, in the form of a <em>CBS Marketwatch </em>article discussing the July 2 conference call.<footnotemark>232</footnotemark> The article discussed several reasons for the \u201calarming rate\u201d of decline of eSpeed\u2019s market share, which it chiefly ascribed to a \u201cprice war\u201d with BrokerTec \u2014 a war that, according to the article, eSpeed was losing due to Broker-Tec\u2019s incentive program, and Lutnick\u2019s failure to \u201clay out a feasible plan to aggressively compete with [BrokerTec] on pricing and product offerings.\u201d <footnotemark>233</footnotemark> Most importantly, the article also asserts that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWB\">eSpeed has initiated new fees in the last year to pay for added value for customers, but its far from clear these are as \u25a0 attractive as the company expected. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>[BrokerTee\u2019s] pricing, with its fee caps, may be attracting high volume customers, while eSpeed\u2019s new charges may be hurting the company\u2019s volumes. \u201cThe magnitude of the market share deterioration was more than expected. There\u2019s been more clarity surrounding the issue of fee caps, and [on] the need to address that issue and possibly adopt similar pricing structures,\u201d [an analyst] said.<footnotemark>234</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs\u2019 favor at this stage of the proceedings, the <em>CBS Marketwatch </em>article could establish that, despite Lutnick\u2019s specific denial, the market understood by the end of the putative class period what it did not before \u2014 that the \u201cnew fees\u201d or \u201cnew charges\u201d entailed by PI were damaging eSpeed\u2019s market share and financial performance.<footnotemark>235</footnotemark> Although the article discusses other possible causes for the stock decline aside from PI, a plaintiff is not required to plead that her economic loss was caused <em>solely </em>by the alleged fraudulent scheme.<footnotemark>236</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>Dura </em>imposed no requirement that corrective disclosures emanate from the company itself, so long as the truth is disclosed in some fashion.<footnotemark>237</footnotemark> For these reasons, plaintiffs have given \u201csome indication of the ... causal connection [they have] in mind.\u201d<footnotemark>238</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">E.
