INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In this consolidated multi-district litigation, plaintiffs seek relief from defendants\u2019 alleged contamination, or threatened contamination, of groundwater with the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d). The parties have already engaged in extensive motion practice, and familiarity with the Court\u2019s previous opinions is assumed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This opinion relates only to <em>Hope Koch, et al. v. John R. Hicks, et al., </em>05 Civ. 5Y45.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Hope and Frank Koch, Robert and Gail Kurtz, Alora and Drake M. Roche, Jennifer and Timothy Stevens, residents of Fall-ston Maryland, bring this putative class action in Maryland against John R. Hicks<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Exxon Mobil Corporation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u201cExxon\u201d) alleging state law claims of (1) public nuisance, (2) private nuisance, (3) trespass to property, (4) negligence, (5) strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity, and (6) medical monitoring that would require defendants to conduct monitoring and testing of plaintiffs for early detection and treatment of potential diseases caused by exposure to MTBE.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The claims arise from the alleged contamination of plaintiffs\u2019 water supply due to unsafe storage and leakage from defendants\u2019 underground storage tanks at the Crossroads Exxon gasoline station (\u201cCrossroads Exxon\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Exxon and Hicks have moved to dismiss this action. For the following reasons, those motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">II. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"A1j\">A. Prediction of State Law</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">Plaintiffs bring state law claims under the law of Maryland. \u201cExcept in matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the state.... There is no federal general common law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AoP\">In the absence of a definitive ruling on a particular issue by the highest court of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>state, however, this Court must predict what that court would decide. States have the primary responsibility to construe their own laws.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In making a prediction of state law a court must determine what the state\u2019s highest court would find if presented with the same issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This Court previously explained that a plaintiff is entitled to the same treatment it would receive in state court \u2014 no more, and no less.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">B. Rule 12(b)(6)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) should be granted only if \u201c \u2018it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [its] claim which would entitle [it] to relief.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the motion to dismiss stage, the issue \u201c \u2018is not whether a plaintiff is likely to prevail ultimately, but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The task of the court in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is \u201cmerely to assess the legal feasibility of the complaint, not to assay the weight of the evidence which might be offered in support thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When deciding a motion to dismiss, courts must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the plaintiffs allegations are taken as true, the claim may still fail as a matter of law if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of its claim which would entitle it to relief, or if the claim is not legally feasible.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, a claim can only be dismissed if \u201c \u2018no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">C. Rules 8 and 12(e)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that the plaintiff must provide \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Rule 8(a) does not require \u201ca plaintiff to plead the legal theory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>facts, or elements underlying his claim.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cTo comply with Rule 8, plaintiffs need not provide anything more than sufficient notice to permit defendant to file an answer.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The only requirement is that a complaint allege the \u201cbare minimum facts necessary to put the defendant on notice of the claim so that [it] can file an answer.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Fair notice is \u201c \u2018that which will enable the adverse party to answer and prepare for trial, allow the application of res judicata, and identify the nature of the case so that it may be assigned the proper form of trial.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This notice pleading standard \u201crelies on liberal discovery rules and summary judgment motions to define disputed facts and issues and to dispose of unmeri-torious claims.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> If a party contends that a pleading nonetheless \u201cis so vague or ambiguous that [it] cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading\u201d the party is not left without a remedy, as the party \u201cmay move for a more definite statement\u201d before responding to the pleading.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">D. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Constitutional standing \u201cis the threshold question in every federal case, determining the power of the court to entertain the suit.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> There are three constitutional requirements that plaintiffs must satisfy in order to establish standing: (1) injury-in-fact \u2014 an injury that is \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and is \u201cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,\u201d (2) an injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and (3) an injury that will likely be redressed by a favorable ruling of the court.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">Mere \u201cAllegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Article] III.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, an allegation of a threatened injury in the form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>an increased risk of future injury that is \u201ccertainly impending\u201d is sufficient to establish an injury-in-fact.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Second Circuit has further explained that in enhanced risk cases, a plaintiff must allege a \u201ccredible threat of harm.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The \u201cprobability of harm which a plaintiff must demonstrate in order to allege a cognizable injury-in-faet logically varies with the severity of the probable harm.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Distinguishing between a threatened injury satisfying the injury-in-fact requirement and a speculative or hypothetical injury is a matter of degree and each case must be considered on an individual basis.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Although the plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing these elements, the determination of whether Article III standing exists must comport with the \u201cmanner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Thus, when standing is challenged on the basis of the pleadings, a court is required to \u201c \u2018accept as true all material allegations of the complaint, and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> At the pleading stage, an \u201cAllegation of a credible risk may be sufficient\u201d without \u201cfurther factual confirmation or quantification of the precise risk\u201d to establish standing.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">A. Exxon\u2019s Motion to Dismiss<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">1. Standing for Alora and Drake Roche</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">Alora and Drake Roche alleged that although the water on their property \u201chas not tested positive for MTBE, the adjacent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>properties to the east and west have detections of MTBE.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Exxon argues that the Roches lack standing because they do not have any MTBE in their wells. Exxon claims that plaintiffs have not alleged that MTBE \u201cwould be detected at actionable levels sufficient to impair their interests, as opposed to non-actionable levels below federal and state law.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Exxon claims plaintiffs cannot allege that the harm they face is \u201cdeath, deadly disease, or any disease at all.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Exxon argues that there is only a \u201cmere possibility that MTBE may be carcinogenic\u201d and that this \u201crisk of harm fails to \u2018rise above mere conjecture.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Plaintiffs counter that they have alleged threatened harm in the form of an increased risk of future injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">This Court characterized the standing issue in a similar MTBE case as a question of whether plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient to show that plaintiffs are faced with a present threat of imminent harm.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In that case, some plaintiffs had tested their wells but had not found any MTBE, and other plaintiffs had not tested their wells for the presence of MTBE. There, the \u201cgeneral allegations concerning the chemical characteristics of MTBE and the widespread MTBE contamination of groundwater throughout the country\u201d were found insufficient to establish a \u201cpresent threat of imminent harm\u201d as to both groups of plaintiffs.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This Court noted that the first group of plaintiffs, from Madison County, Illinois, had not presented statistics of MTBE detection rates for private wells in the county or even state; that Madison County was not a participant in the reformulated gas program (a congressional program whereby gasoline companies were required to sell oxygenated gasoline); and that ethanol was the \u201cprimary oxygenate used in the Midwest.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The other group of plaintiffs, from Dutchess County, New York, did not allege that they were \u201cproximately located to, or had a direct connection to, an alleged area of contamination on or near and identified release site.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Unlike plaintiffs in <em>MTBE </em>/, the allegations of the Roches are sufficient to present a threat of imminent harm. The Roches lodged specific allegations demonstrating that they face an increased risk of future injury. For example, the Roches, whose property is located at 2307 Franklins Chance Drive in Fallston, Maryland, alleged that the neighboring properties have tested positive for MTBE.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Moreover, the Kochs live near the Roches at 2310 Franklins Chance Court and have alleged actual contamination.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">The allegations from all plaintiffs also demonstrate that the Roches face an impending threat. Plaintiffs alleged that \u201cresidents surrounding the Crossroads Exxon relied on groundwater wells drawing from the same aquifer as the Crossroads Exxon\u2019s supply well for all their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>water needs\u201d and that this aquifer is contaminated.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> \u201cAs of October 28, 2005, at least 360 private wells within a two-mile radius of the Crossroads Exxon have been tested monthly and/or quarterly\u201d and these tests have revealed the presence of MTBE.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged that MTBE is \u201chighly soluble and travels faster and farther in water than other gasoline components.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also alleged that MTBE\u2019s \u201cchemical makeup ... allows it to persist in underground aquifers for decades at a time.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Given the Roches\u2019 proximity to property known to be contaminated, these allegations present a threat of contamination that is certainly impending.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In addition, despite Exxon\u2019s attempt to deprecate the risk that MTBE poses to plaintiffs, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient to establish a credible threat of harm. Plaintiffs alleged that (1) \u201c[a]t a certain point in contamination, MTBE\u2019s foul taste and odor render water unusable and unfit for human consumption\u201d and (2) \u201cMTBE is a known animal carcinogen that has been linked to many potential human health problems.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Plaintiffs noted that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classified MTBE as a possible human carcinogen and is reevaluating \u201cwhether to upgrade its carcinogenic classification to a probable human carcinogen.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiffs alleged that MTBE poses a risk to their health. The Roches have made an allegation of a credible risk and that is all that is required at the pleading stage to establish Article III standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">2. Public Nuisance</p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">Maryland courts rely on the definition of a public nuisance set forth in the Second Restatement of Torts, which states that \u201c[a] public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> An individual plaintiff can file a claim for a public nuisance if she alleges a special damage, such as physical harm to her land.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 public nuisance claim states that the contamination of the bedrock aquifer by defendant has made the aquifer \u201cunfit for use by all members of the community\u201d for years.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged that defendants\u2019 conduct \u201cunreasonably interferes with the rights of the community at large to use the bedrock aquifer as a drinking water supply.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Each plaintiff also alleged that he or she \u201csuffered specific harm different from the public at large.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-17\">Exxon attempts to defeat this claim by arguing that a public nuisance in Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>is a criminal offense, and noting that plain-: tiffs reference no law that criminalizes Exxon\u2019s alleged conduct.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Plaintiffs respond that under Maryland law criminal conduct is not a required element of a public nuisance; but even assuming it is, plaintiffs have alleged that MTBE contamination is \u201cproscribed by state and federal law.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">At common law, every public nuisance was a crime.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Many states enacted statutes criminalizing conduct creating public nuisances.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> But, the terms public nuisance and crime have never been interchangeable.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> As the Restatement notes, \u201cinterference with a public right is unreasonable\u201d when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">(a) the conduct involves a <em>significant interference with the public health, </em>the public safety, the public peace, the public comfort or the public convenience, or (b) ... the conduct is proscribed by a statute, ordinance or administrative regulation, <em>or </em>(c) ... the conduct is of a continuing nature or has produced a permanent or long-lasting effect, and, as the actor knows or has reason to know, has a significant effect upon the public right.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">Comment d to this section explicitly states that \u201cthere is clear recognition that a defendant need not be subject to criminal responsibility\u201d to be liable in tort for creation of a public nuisance.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">Maryland has long recognized that conduct may constitute a per se public nuisance where the conduct is proscribed by statute, or it may be a public nuisance \u201cin fact\u201d where the conduct is unreasonable in the specific locality and under the circumstances of the situation.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Maryland courts classify public nuisances in three categories: \u201cfirst, those which are nuisances per se or by statute; second, those which prejudice public health or comfort ...; third, those which are not nuisances, but may become so by reason of their locality, surroundings, or the manner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>which they may be maintained.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Where the circumstances of a particular locality or the manner in which the activities are carried out creates a public nuisance, no statute criminalizing the activity is necessary for plaintiffs to proceed with their claim.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations here are sufficient to allege public nuisance under any one of the three prongs in the Restatement.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged that MTBE contamination in the aquifer \u201csignificantly and unreasonably interferes with [plaintiffs\u2019] public health, safety, comfort, and convenience.\u201d <footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also alleged that the contamination is \u201cproscribed by state and federal law.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> And, finally, plaintiffs alleged that MTBE contamination produced a long-lasting effect,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> and that defendants knew (or had reason to know) that MTBE would have a significant effect upon the public right to a groundwater resource.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Exxon also claims that plaintiffs fail to identify a \u201cpublic right affected by the conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Exxon argues that the right to use the aquifer is an individual landowner\u2019s right and that the community at large has no right to use the bedrock aquifer as a drinking water supply.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Plaintiffs counter that the presence of MTBE in the aquifer \u201caffects the basic right of the community at large to appropriate groundwater for use by the public in the future.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argue that this right \u201caffects the interest of the community at large.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> In addition, plaintiffs assert that because adjacent landowners may only use the groundwater as long as the use does not interfere unreasonably with the rights of neighboring landowners, this right is shared by the public.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">A public nuisance must involve \u201csome interference with a public right.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>However, a public nuisance need not affect the entire community \u201cso long as the nuisance will interfere with those who come in contact with it in the exercise of a public right or it otherwise affects the interests of the community at large.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABb\">In any case in which a private nuisance affects a large number of persons in their use and enjoyment of land it will normally be accompanied by some interference with the rights of the public as well. Thus the spread of smoke, dust or fumes over a considerable area filled with private residences may interfere also with the use of the public streets or affect the health of so many persons as to involve the interests of the public at large.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">One public interest that is central to this case is the use of the state\u2019s groundwater.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Maryland courts have favored the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d governing an individual\u2019s right to use the water in an aquifer beneath their land.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> \u201cThe American Rule is based upon the concept that the surface owner\u2019s right to obstruct, divert or remove the percolating waters under the surface of his land shall be exercised in such a way that will not unreasonably injure the exercise of a similar right by the owner of neighboring land.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The water rights of an individual under the American Rule are sometimes termed usufructuary rights to the groundwater.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Exxon argues that under the American Rule, use of the aquifer is a shared individual right rather than a public right. Exxon is mistaken. Though a plaintiff may have usufructuary rights to the groundwater, this does not eliminate the public quality of the state\u2019s water resources.

[T]he mere diminution of property value, absent such tortious interference\u201d is not a sufficient basis for recovery.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Exxon relies on two cases where, after trial, plaintiffs were denied recovery for diminution of property value.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Both cases are readily distinguishable. <em>First, </em>in <em>McCaw, </em>plaintiffs sought to stop the construction of a new cemetery and, after trial, the lower court found in favor of defendant.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> In affirming the lower court, the Maryland Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[a] cemetery does not constitute a nuisance merely because it is a constant reminder of death and has a depressing influence on the minds of persons who observe it, or because it tends to depreciate the value of property in the neighborhood, or is offensive to the aesthetic sense of the adjoining proprietor\u201d and disallowed recovery.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> The court noted, however, that \u201cif the location or maintenance of a cemetery endangers the public health, either by corrupting the surrounding atmosphere, or water of wells or springs, it constitutes a nuisance.\u201d <footnotemark>99</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><em>Second, </em>in <em>Gray, </em>plaintiffs sued for damages after gasoline was pumped into a river and caught fire.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> The trial court granted an involuntary nonsuit.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> The appellate court affirmed because the plaintiff could not show any damages beyond those \u201cpredicated upon an asserted diminution in market value resulting, not from any physical injury, but from a psychological factor, in that prospective buyers allegedly would be reluctant to purchase the property due to fear of a similar occurrence in the future.\u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">These cases are inapposite because plaintiffs here have alleged far more than diminution in property value. Moreover, whether plaintiffs have suffered a substantial and unreasonable interference with their property is a question of fact, and at this stage plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing to proceed with their private nuisance claim.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> This case is at the pleading stage unlike those cited by Exxon. In fact, this case more closely resembles the hypothetical case of a cemetery that polluted the well water in <em>McCaw, </em>where a claim of private nuisance would have been appropriate. Plaintiffs have satisfied the Rule 12(b)(6) standard for pleading a private nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">4. Trespass to Property</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">A trespass is an invasion of one\u2019s interest in the exclusive possession of land.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim that \u201cdefendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>entered (or infringed) upon and/or caused gasoline and its constituent parts to enter and/or continue to enter (or infringe) upon property (including real property) owned (or controlled) by [p]laintiffs ... in an unlawful manner.\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Exxon argues that plaintiffs\u2019 trespass claim fails because plaintiffs have not alleged an interference with the \u201cexclusive possession\u201d of their land.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Exxon claims that under the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d of water rights a landowner does not have an exclusive possessory interest in the groundwater underneath her lands.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Exxon also argues that the claim of trespass requires a tangible invasion and that Maryland has not recognized \u201cpenetration by smoke, dust, soot, or other micro-particles\u201d as a tangible invasion of property.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Plaintiffs counter that they have exclusive possession of the wells on their properties, which are fed by the aquifer, and that the presence of MTBE in their well water constitutes a trespass.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> In addition, plaintiffs claim that Maryland recognizes a cause of action for trespass for material that leaked underground into the plaintiffs\u2019 property, including invisible MTBE particles.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGk\">As noted, the American 'Rule of water rights limits a landowner \u201cto the reasonable exercise of the owner\u2019s proprietary right in the water, i.e., such an exercise as may be reasonably necessary for some useful or beneficial purpose, before obstructing, diverting, or removing percolating water to the injury of a neighbor.\u201d <footnotemark>111</footnotemark> Thus, under the American Rule, use of the water is limited to reasonable beneficial use. But, this does not mean that plaintiffs do not have a property right to the water.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> The right is merely <em>limited </em>by the reasonable use doctrine.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> In Maryland, a plaintiff has ownership rights to the groundwater beneath her land.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> Thus, a plaintiff has a right to sue a neighboring, landowner for breach of her duty \u201cnot to impair [plaintiff\u2019s] ownership rights through water contamination\u201d in the groundwater.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">The next question is whether invasion by invisible particles of MTBE beneath the earth may constitute a trespass. Maryland courts have not definitively settled this question. Plaintiffs argue that the Maryland Court of Appeals has already recognized a claim for trespass where gasoline seeped through the earth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>and contaminated plaintiffs water.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> In <em>JBG/Twinbrook Metro, </em>the Maryland Court of Appeals reviewed a finding that assumption of the risk was an absolute defense to trespass by gasoline that seeped from defendant\u2019s underground gasoline tanks.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> At trial, the jury was instructed that: \u201c[a] trespass occurs when a person without authority, privilege or permission enters into the land of another or permits a <em>substance under the person\u2019s control to enter the land </em>of another without authority, privilege, or permission.\u201d<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> In addition, the trial court instructed the jury that there was no difference between an invasion that occurred above or beneath the surface of the land.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> After the jury found that the plaintiff assumed the risk, the Court of Appeals reversed on that issue. At the same time, the court noted that the trespass instruction was given without objection from the defendants.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> The court specifically mentioned that it would not reach the issue of whether the instruction that an invasion by a substance in a defendant\u2019s groundwater could constitute a trespass was a \u201ccorrect instruction\u201d under Maryland law.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> Thus, it is still unclear whether an invasion by a substance through groundwater constitutes a trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">Historically, an invasion by smoke, dust or invisible particles was not considered trespass because this type of invasion was not considered a \u201cphysical\u201d invasion \u201cin the primitive society where trespass had its roots.\u201d<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> Invasions of particulates or smoke were typically seen to infringe on a plaintiffs use and enjoyment of the land and thus were heard as nuisances, rather than trespasses. Modern scientific advances have caused many courts to abandon the notion that an invasion by smoke, dust, or particles is not \u201cphysical.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Courts have instead allowed plaintiffs to claim trespass by invisible contaminants; while at the same time limiting such claims, for example, by requiring proof of substantial damage.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> Thus, nuisance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>trespass law have slowly begun to \u201ccoalesce.\u201d <footnotemark>125</footnotemark> A modern explanation of the difference between nuisance law and trespass is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">[I]f the smoke or polluting substance emitting from a defendant\u2019s operation causes discomfort and annoyance to the plaintiff in his use and enjoyment of the property, then the plaintiffs remedy is for nuisance; but if, as a result of the defendant\u2019s operation, the polluting substance is deposited upon the plaintiffs property, thus interfering with his exclusive possessory interest by causing substantial damage to the res, then the plaintiff may seek his remedy in trespass, though his alternative remedy in nuisance may co-exist.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">According to the Restatement, \u201c[a] trespass may be committed on or beneath the surface of the earth.\u201d <footnotemark>127</footnotemark> Maryland courts have noted that tunneling under another\u2019s property is a trespass,<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> and that particles may constitute a trespass when they travel to plaintiffs land in water on the surface of the land.-<footnotemark>129</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">It makes no sense to say that particles beneath the surface that are transported through the groundwater to plaintiffs\u2019 well cannot constitute a trespass. Imagine a situation where a defendant walked onto a plaintiffs property and poured a bucket of poisonous chemicals into her well. Now imagine that the defendant deposited the poisonous chemicals onto the ground next to the well. These two cases would both constitute trespass. The only difference in this case is that Exxon allegedly deposited the contaminants in the well without walking onto the property. Maryland allows claims for trespass where a defendant caused an invading substance to enter plaintiffs property without actually entering himself.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> As alleged, this is a case where a polluting substance was allegedly deposited in plaintiffs\u2019 wells, thus interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive possessory interests by causing substantial damage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 drinking water.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> For these reasons, I predict that Maryland courts confronted with Exxon\u2019s argument would reject it as \u201chyper-technical\u201d<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> and rely on the Restatement and modern tort law to allow plaintiffs\u2019 trespass claim to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">5. Negligence and Strict Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">To state a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff must allege: \u201c(1) that the defendant was under a duty to protect the plaintiff from injury, (2) that the defendant breached that duty, (3) that the plaintiff suffered actual injury or loss, and (4) that the loss or injury proximately resulted from the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty.\u201d<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> The \u201coccupier of land owes a duty to occupants of neighboring land to use care when conducting activities on the land so as to avoid causing harm to the neighboring land.\u201d<footnotemark>134</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Maryland has adopted the standard for strict liability for abnormally dangerous activity set forth in section 519 of the Second Restatement of Torts: \u201c \u2018[0]ne who carries on an abnormally dangerous activity is subject to liability for harm to the person, land or chattels of another resulting from the activity, although he has exercised the utmost care to prevent the harm.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>135</footnotemark> The cause of action is available for \u201cclaims by an occupier of land harmed by an activity abnormally dangerous in relation to the area, which is carried on by a contemporaneous occupier of neighboring land.\u201d<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> Maryland courts allow strict liability claims for abnormally dangerous activities such as the pollution of percolating groundwater by gasoline and similar substance. These \u201cactivities are not entered into by the great mass of mankind, and they do result in extensive injury to percolating groundwater supplies if their waste products are uncontrollable.\u201d<footnotemark>137</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">Plaintiffs alleged that defendants breached their duty to plaintiffs \u201cby failing: to properly design, install, maintain, and/or monitor the buildings, facilities, underground storage tanks, and associated systems at the Crossroads Exxon; to notify [p]laintiffs ... of the contamination; and to adequately mitigate the harm to [plaintiffs\u2019 water supply.\u201d<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged strict liability claiming that defendants\u2019 sale and storage of MTBE-contain-ing gasoline caused contaminants to be released into the environment, injuring plaintiffs.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged injuries that include \u201cactual present harm to [plaintiffs\u2019 persons, property, and economic interests, and potential future harm ... due to the threat of future contamination.\u201d<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged that these \u201cinjuries constitute the type that make the activities abnormal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ly dangerous.\u201d<footnotemark>141</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Exxon argues that under Maryland\u2019s \u201ceconomic loss rule\u201d there is no cause of action for negligence or strict liability if a plaintiff only alleges economic harm. \u201cEconomic losses include such things as the loss of value or use of the product itself, the cost to repair or replace the product, or the lost profits resulting from the loss of use of the product.\u201d<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> Under the economic loss rule, where \u201cthe failure to exercise due care creates a risk of economic loss only, courts have generally required an intimate nexus between the parties as a condition to the imposition of tort liability.\u201d<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> Exxon argues that plaintiffs\u2019 negligence and strict liability claims fail because they allege only economic damages.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">The economic loss rule typically bars recovery in tort for intangible economic losses between parties to a contract or where the plaintiff is asserting a products liability claim.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> The economic loss rule, however, does not always bar the recovery of economic losses in a negligence case. For example, where the plaintiff suffers both physical injury and economic loss, economic losses resulting from personal injury are recoverable.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> In Maryland, \u201cthe determination of whether a duty in tort will be imposed in an economic loss case should depend upon the risk generated by the negligent conduct, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>upon the fortuitous circumstance of the nature of the resultant damage ... where the risk is of death or personal injury the tort action will lie for recovery of the reasonable cost of correcting the dangerous condition.\u201d<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> Similarly, damage to property is distinct from economic loss and is recoverable.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The economic loss rule does not bar plaintiffs\u2019 negligence or strict liability claims because plaintiffs have also alleged personal injury and property damage.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged that defendants\u2019 \u201creckless, negligent, and illegal conduct resulted in the actual dangerous releases of hazardous and toxic substances into the Plaintiffs\u2019 water supply.\u201d <footnotemark>150</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also explained that the value of their property has diminished and that they will continue to \u201cincur actual damages as a result of the contamination including the costs of obtaining alternate water, maintenance of water systems, and remediation.\u201d <footnotemark>151</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Similarly, plaintiffs\u2019 strict liability claim is not barred by the economic loss rule because plaintiffs alleged far more than economic losses. Plaintiffs alleged injuries which included \u201cactual present harm to [plaintiffs\u2019 persons, property, and economic interests, and potential future harm to [plaintiffs due to the threat of future contamination.\u201d <footnotemark>152</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">6. Medical Monitoring</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Medical monitoring is \u201c \u2018one of a growing number of non-traditional torts that have developed in the common law to compensate plaintiffs who have been exposed to various toxic substances.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> This cause of action has been recognized in federal and state courts around the country as a mechanism for allowing the plaintiff to recover \u201cquantifiable costs of periodic medical examinations necessary to monitor plaintiffs\u2019 health and to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of disease(s) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>caused by exposure to chemicals.\u201d <footnotemark>154</footnotemark> The theory behind the claim is that the risk of disease and injuries from many toxic substances is often latent and current injury cannot be demonstrated under traditional tort theories.<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> Under this theory, plaintiffs are entitled to recover the \u201ccosts of periodic medical examinations necessary to detect the onset of physical harm.\u201d<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> Some courts have allowed medical monitoring to be pled as a separate cause of action, while some see it as merely a separate remedy.<footnotemark>157</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In their medical monitoring claim, plaintiffs requested a \u201cmonitoring program\u201d that would allow early detection of any illnesses caused by exposure to MTBE.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> Plaintiffs noted that defendants have installed equipment to monitor and treat the groundwater beneath the Crossroads Exxon and that \u201cno lesser degree of care should be given to humans contaminated by prolonged, repeated exposure to MTBE.\u201d<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also alleged that the \u201cMonitoring Sub-Class\u201d has no adequate remedy at law.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">Exxon contends that Maryland does not recognize a medical monitoring claim and that even if such a claim were recognized under Maryland law, plaintiffs must be exposed to a known cause of cancer or disease before monitoring would be appropriate.<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> Plaintiffs counter that Maryland courts had the opportunity to reject the medical monitoring cause of action and declined to do so.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Maryland courts have not definitively ruled on whether medical monitoring is a valid cause of action in Maryland, or on whether plaintiffs must show that they were exposed to a known cause of cancer or disease before making a claim of medical monitoring. In a recent case involving the tobacco industry, the Maryland Court of Appeals addressed the question of whether a medical monitoring class, certified at the trial level under section 2-231(b)(2) of Maryland\u2019s class action rule,<footnotemark>163</footnotemark> was a cognizable claim.<footnotemark>164</footnotemark> The court, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ever, refused to decide that question, because the \u201cequitable relief class action should never have been certified on the basis of such a claim under the circumstances of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> The court found that section 2-231 (b)(2) is only appropriate for injunctive relief claims where the class exhibited \u201ccohesiveness.\u201d<footnotemark>166</footnotemark> Because the purported class in that case alleged claims for money damages and lacked cohesiveness, the court vacated the class certification.<footnotemark>167</footnotemark> In conclusion, the court noted that it was \u201cclear that notwithstanding the possibility that a medical monitoring claim might legitimately be framed as one seeking equitable relief ... that possibility [could not] be realized through the instant lawsuit.\u201d<footnotemark>168</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In any case, Maryland\u2019s highest court had the opportunity to bar a medical monitoring claim, but refrained from doing so. Thus, I find that Maryland is likely to permit claims for medical monitoring, either as a distinct cause of action or as a remedy depending on the circumstances of a particular case. For example, where the latent nature of a particular risk would bar plaintiffs from recovering \u201cquantifiable costs for medical examinations\u201d Maryland courts are likely to allow a medical monitoring claim in order to facilitate early detection of disease due to exposure to chemicals. Here, plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support a medical monitoring claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">B. Hicks\u2019 Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Hicks moved to dismiss this action without filing a supporting memorandum of law, in violation of Local Rule 7.1. Nonetheless, a reading of Hicks\u2019 Motion to Dismiss together with Hicks\u2019 Reply to Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition to Hicks\u2019 Motion to Dismiss<footnotemark>169</footnotemark> reveals that Hicks is arguing that he is immune from any claims of property damage and personal injury caused by a defective product design, pursuant to Section 5^405 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland. This provision gives sellers of a product from a receptacle <footnotemark>170</footnotemark> a \u201cdefense to an action ... for property damage or personal injury allegedly caused by the defective design or manufacture of a product\u201d (the \u201csealed container defense\u201d).<footnotemark>171</footnotemark> Hicks claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>he is a seller of gasoline and that plaintiffs\u2019 case is a product defect case.<footnotemark>172</footnotemark> Hicks argues that the case against him should be dismissed because the sealed container defense protects a salesperson \u201cwho had no duty or opportunity to alter the design or manufacture of the product.\u201d <footnotemark>173</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Hicks also invites this court to treat his motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment.<footnotemark>174</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate if the record \u201cshow[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>175</footnotemark> An issue of fact is genuine if \u201cthe evidence is such that a jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d<footnotemark>176</footnotemark> A fact is material when it \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d<footnotemark>177</footnotemark> The movant has the burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists.<footnotemark>178</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">In turn, to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must raise a genuine issue of material fact that does \u201c \u2018not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>179</footnotemark> To do so, it must do more than show that there is a \u201c \u2018metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>180</footnotemark> In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all justifiable inferences in that party\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>181</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">Hicks did not file a supporting Rule 56.1 statement presenting the \u201cmaterial facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue to be tried\u201d pursuant to Local Rule 56.1. Instead, in support of his request for summary judgment, Hicks stated that he \u201cadopted in its entirety\u201d a \u201cVerification\u201d that \u201cappeared in the earlier filed Motion to Dismiss/Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>182</footnotemark> Other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>this cryptic statement, Hicks\u2019 Motion to Dismiss does not specify what the \u201cVerification\u201d is, or where to find it. In Hicks\u2019 Reply Memorandum he argues that summary judgment is appropriate because plaintiffs did not oppose Hicks\u2019 \u201caffidavit\u201d in the case of <em>Wagner, et al. v. Hicks, et al. (\u2018Wagner v. Hicks\u201d) </em>where Hicks claimed that he did not alter or mishandle the gasoline and that he had no knowledge of \u201cdefects in the gasoline product.\u201d<footnotemark>183</footnotemark> Hicks\u2019 citation to his Motion to Dismiss/Motion for Summary Judgment, filed in the case of <em>Wagner v. Hicks </em>led plaintiffs to believe that Hicks\u2019 \u201cVerification\u201d was the motion to dismiss that he filed in <em>Wagner v. Hicks.</em><footnotemark><em>184</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Hicks\u2019 \u201cVerification\u201d is insufficient to support a claim for summary judgment. Because there is no evidence to the contrary, I shall assume that Hicks meant to incorporate as his \u201cVerification\u201d his motion to dismiss in <em>Wagner v. Hicks. </em>That case was voluntarily dismissed on October 23, 2004 by plaintiffs pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The fact that plaintiffs did not oppose a statement made in Hicks\u2019 motion to dismiss is irrelevant to the pending case. In addition, statements in a memorandum of law are insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.<footnotemark>185</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Nonetheless, I need not decide whether to treat Hicks\u2019 pending motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment, because either motion must be denied. Hicks\u2019 motion for summary judgment fails because Hicks has not established all five elements of the sealed container defense.<footnotemark>186</footnotemark> <em>First, </em>Hicks has not shown that he lacked knowledge of the alleged defect. State and federal regulations regarding the use of underground storage tanks have been in place since the Crossroads Exxon was opened. These regulations required Hicks to meet stringent requirements regarding the storage of gasoline.<footnotemark>187</footnotemark> As plaintiffs argue, Hicks \u201chad the opportunity and competence as a dealer in petroleum products not only to discover the peculiar dangers of gasoline containing MTBE but also the duty to prevent and mitigate any harm from the handling, storing, dispensing and/or use of petroleum products.\u201d<footnotemark>188</footnotemark> Second, Hicks has not shown that he could not have discovered the defect. Plaintiffs alleged that Hicks had a duty as a gasoline station owner to monitor the underground storage tanks for leaks and \u201cperform regular integrity testing\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>tanks.<footnotemark>189</footnotemark> In addition, according to the Complaint, Hicks knew as early as 1990 that leaks from the Crossroads Exxon had contaminated the well water supply with MTBE.<footnotemark>190</footnotemark> Thus, Hicks cannot show that he lacked knowledge of the dangers posed by MTBE-containing gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Third, Hicks cannot show that he did not \u201calter, modify, assemble or mishandle the product\u201d while it was in his possession \u201cin a manner which was the proximate and substantial cause of the claimant\u2019s injury.\u201d<footnotemark>191</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have alleged that Hicks mishandled the gasoline stored at the Crossroads Exxon.<footnotemark>192</footnotemark> For example, plaintiffs alleged that between October 1991 and May of 2004, water samples taken at the Crossroads Exxon showed levels of MTBE that grew from 9.5 parts per billion (\u201cppb\u201d) to 26,000 ppb.<footnotemark>193</footnotemark> Nothing submitted by Hicks refutes these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Similarly, Hicks\u2019 motion to dismiss fails because the defense he raises is only available to sellers in product defect claims, and plaintiffs did not bring such a claim. Hicks argues that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201centire theory is that somehow the operator of the gasoline station knew or should have known that the gasoline he sold was not designed or manufactured properly for sale from the station he operated\u201d and that it \u201csounds like a product defect claim.\u201d<footnotemark>194</footnotemark> Though Hicks attempts to re-cast plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as a claim of product defect, there is nothing in the Complaint to this effect. Plaintiffs alleged that \u201creckless, negligent, and illegal conduct resulted in the actual dangerous releases of hazardous and toxic substances into the Plaintiffs\u2019 water supply.\u201d <footnotemark>195</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged that \u201cuse and storage of gasoline containing MTBE is abnormally dangerous.\u201d<footnotemark>196</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also alleged that defendants \u201cknew of the environmental and health hazards associated with the release of gasoline constituents.\u201d <footnotemark>197</footnotemark> Plaintiffs did not claim that defendants are liable for placing a defective product in the stream of commerce, nor did plaintiffs rely on the fact that defendants placed MTBE in the gasoline. Plaintiffs rely on <em>Rosenblatt </em>for the proposition that \u201cif a gasoline station owner has faulty tanks which leak gasoline into the underground water supply, that might be abnormally dangerous if the land in which the tanks are buried is located in a well populated area.\u201d<footnotemark>198</footnotemark> Plaintiffs explain that \u201c[a]ny allegations regarding the knowledge of MTBE\u2019s particular properties [were] included in the Amended Complaint to establish a basis for punitive damages, as well as for a claim for strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity.\u201d<footnotemark>199</footnotemark> For these additional reasons, the sealed container defense cannot defeat plaint s\u2019 claims against Hicks.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">IV.
