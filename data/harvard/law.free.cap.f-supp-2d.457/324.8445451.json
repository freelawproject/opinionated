INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-18\">In this consolidated multi-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d), plaintiffs seek relief from contamination, or threatened contamination, of groundwater from various defendants\u2019 use of the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d) and/or tertiary butyl alcohol (\u201cTBA\u201d), a product that is formed by the natural degradation of MTBE in water. Defendants now move for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are conflict preempted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) because <em>first, </em>\u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility;\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or <em>second, </em>plaintiffs\u2019 state tort claims \u201cstand[ ] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After hearing oral argument on May 9, 2006 and conducting a thorough review of the facts presented, defendants\u2019 motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The parties have already engaged in extensive motion practice, and familiarity with the Court\u2019s previous opinions is assumed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The facts underlying this case are comprehensively set out in those opinions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">A. The 1990 CAA Amendments</p>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">The purpose of the CAA is \u201cto protect and enhance the quality of the Nation\u2019s air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The CAA gives the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) the authority to set national ambient air quality standards for various air pollutants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Individual states must devise plans to meet the standards.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">In 1990, amendments to the CAA created the Reformulated Gasoline Program (\u201cRFG Program\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to help reduce ozone-causing car emissions, such as volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOCs\u201d) and toxic air pollutants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In order to accomplish this, section 211(k)(2)(B) of the amendments required that reformulated gasoline have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>minimum oxygen content of two percent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To achieve this minimum oxygen content, gasoline manufacturers add oxygenated fuel to the gasoline. The RFG Program required the use of reformulated gasoline in the nine largest metropolitan areas with the most severe summertime ozone levels.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Other areas that did not attain the national ambient air quality standards could opt into the program.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, the amendments enacted an Oxygenated Fuels (\u201cOxyfuel\u201d) Program, which required that gasoline contain 2.7 percent oxygen by weight during the wintertime in areas that did not attain the national ambient air quality standard for carbon monoxide.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The EPA certified various blends of gasoline for use in the RFG Program, including gasoline with MTBE, however, it did not mandate the use of any one oxygenate.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Two of the most widely used oxygenates are MTBE and ethanol.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Section 211(k)(l) of the amendments authorizes the EPA to issue regulations for reformulated gasoline to require \u201cthe greatest reduction\u201d in emissions of ozone-forming VOCs during the summer and toxic air pollutants throughout the year \u201cachievable through the reformulation of conventional gasoline, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, any nonair-quality and other air-quality related health and environmental impacts and energy requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In 2005, Congress removed the oxygen requirement for reformulated gasoline contained in the CAA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Energy Policy Act of 2005 now requires the EPA to promulgate regulations to require gasoline \u201csold or introduced into commerce in the United States\u201d to contain an annual average volume of four billion gallons of renewable fuel starting in 2006 and increasing to seven and a half billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2012.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">B. Brief Summary of Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">MTBE is highly soluble in water and does not readily biodegrade. Because of its high solubility, MTBE races through the underground water supply, eventually contaminating wells and underground aquifers. MTBE can persist in underground aquifers for many decades, far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>longer than other components of gasoline. Even in very small quantities, MTBE imparts a foul taste and odor to water and renders it unusable and unfit for human consumption. MTBE is carcinogenic in animals and may be carcinogenic in humans.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Sometime after 1979, defendants started manufacturing, distributing, and/or selling MTBE-containing gasoline.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> By the 1990s, defendants added MTBE to gasoline in concentrations varying between eleven and fifteen percent.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that defendants chose to add MTBE to gasoline despite their awareness of specific incidents of MTBE contamination and the dangers posed by MTBE.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Defendants misled the EPA and the public about the dangers of MTBE during the process leading up to the 1990 CAA amendments and conspired to convince the EPA and the public that MTBE was harmless and that increased concentrations of MTBE were desirable.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> According to plaintiffs, had the public been warned of the hazards of MTBE, plaintiffs and the public would have sought and demanded alternative oxygenates.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Plaintiffs assert that defendants have a duty \u201cnot to market any product which is unreasonably dangerous for its intended and foreseeable uses.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And plaintiffs claim MTBE is \u201cdefective and unreasonably dangerous for its intended and foreseeable transportation, storage, handling and uses.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">III. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">Summary judgment is appropriate if the record \u201cshow[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> An issue of fact is genuine if \u201cthe evidence is such that a jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> A fact is material when it \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The movant has the burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">In turn, to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must raise a genuine issue of material fact that does \u201c \u2018not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> To do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>so, it must do more than show that there is a \u201c \u2018metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all justifiable inferences in that party\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">IY. APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Regulation and control of matters related to public health and safety, such as abatement of water pollution, are within the police powers of the states.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> However, Congress may preempt state law under the Supremacy Clause of Article YI of the Constitution.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In the absence of explicit statutory language signaling an intent to preempt state law in traditional state areas of regulation, there is a strong \u201cbasic assumption\u201d that Congress did not intend to displace state law.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> \u201cOrdinarily, the mere existence of a federal regulatory or enforcement scheme ... does not by itself imply pre-emption of state remedies.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> \u201cUndoubtedly, every subject that merits congressional legislation is, by definition, a subject of national concern. That cannot mean, however, that every federal statute ousts all related state law.... Instead, we must look for \u2018special features warranting pre-emption.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, \u201cwhere Congress has not completely displaced state regulation, federal law may nonetheless preempt state law to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has warned against \u201cseeking out conflicts between state and federal regulations where none clearly exists.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> \u201cWhile Congress may preempt or regulate particular branches of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>tort law, particularly as part of a larger regulatory scheme that seeks to redress the injuries previously covered by state law, the Court has made clear the importance of respecting the role of the states as independent sovereigns.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">A. Impossibility</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u201cConflict preemption\u201d occurs \u201cwhere it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Though defendants have failed to identify a single case where this doctrine was applied,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> it is a potentially powerful doctrine that has been consistently referred to in the Supreme Court\u2019s preemption cases.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The doctrine focuses on whether the federal requirement, on its face, precludes the possibility of the state requirement and is derived from the Court\u2019s Commerce Clause cases.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Thus, where one standard precludes the other there is no need to question whether Congress intended to preempt state law. As the court in <em>Florida Lime </em>explained, a situation of impossible dual compliance would be presented if, for example, a federal law \u201cforbade the picking and marketing of any avocado testing more than 7% oil\u201d while a state law \u201cexcluded from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>State any avocado measuring less than 8% oil content.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Though the \u201ccategories of preemption are not \u2018rigidly distinct\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> the question of whether it is impossible to comply with two conflicting provisions is conceptually different from the question of whether state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congressional purpose. For conflict preemption based on impossibility, the question is whether plaintiffs\u2019 tort duty is explicitly inconsistent with the federal law, not whether state law interferes with some purpose of the federal law.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">B. Obstacle Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In the absence of impossibility, a finding of conflict preemption may nonetheless be appropriate when state law \u201c \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The state law must interfere <em>directly </em>with the federal purpose. For example, in <em>Free v. Bland, </em>the Supreme Court held that Texas\u2019s community property law conflicted with federal Treasury Regulations. The federal regulation decreed that when a co-owner of a United States Savings Bond dies, \u201cthe survivor will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> By contrast, the state\u2019s community property law gave the decedent co-owner\u2019s heirs fifty percent of the bond, \u201cinterfer[ing] directly\u201d with the right of survivorship determined by the federal regulations.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">The Second Circuit has noted the importance of clear evidence of interference.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> <em>Clean Air Markets Group v. Pataki </em>addressed a \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system set up by the CAA that allots each electricity-generating utility a certain number of sulfur dioxide emission allowances per year.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> If the utility emits less sulfur dioxide than allowed by the program, it can transfer its surplus allowance to another utility with higher emissions. A New York State statute restricted the transfer of sulfur dioxide emission credits to states upwind of New York State in order to cut back on the sulfur dioxide emissions that reached New York. The court found that the CAA provisions evidenced a clear goal to set up a nationwide allocation and transfer system for reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The New York statute was preempted because it restricted the nationwide quality of the system and \u201cclearly interfere[d]\u201d with the federal program.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Evidence that may tend to show preemption may also include proof that the agency authorized to implement the federal statute has found that the state law would interfere with federal purpose. In <em>Geier v. American Honda Motor Company, </em><footnotemark>55</footnotemark> as this Court earlier explained,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> a tort action that asserted a \u201cduty to install an airbag\u201d was preempted because it would have presented an obstacle to the \u201cmeans-related objectives\u201d found in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Geier </em>Court relied on the fact that the Department of Transportation believed the plaintiffs\u2019 tort suit would frustrate its regulatory objectives.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In the absence of evidence that the administrative agency tasked with imple-meriting the federal law believes state law to be preempted, a finding of preemption is less likely. In <em>Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, </em>the Supreme Court addressed a claim that local ordinances that imposed a more stringent restriction on plasma donations than the federal regulations were a \u201cserious obstacle to the federal goal of ensuring an \u2018adequate supply of plasma.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The Court upheld the district court\u2019s ruling that the local ordinances\u2019 threat to the national plasma supply was speculative, noting that there were no facts to support the conclusion that the number of plasma vendors would decrease as a result of the local ordinance. Noting the lack of any indication from the FDA that the local ordinances conflicted with the federal regulations, the Court concluded that in the absence of \u201cstrong evidence\u201d it could not find \u201ca threat to the federal goal of ensuring sufficient plasma.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>A court must also look at whether Congress has struck a balance between safety (the state\u2019s domain) and the federal purpose. For example, in <em>Hillsborough, </em>the Court denied preemption, finding that even if the local regulations restricted the national plasma supply, neither Congress nor the FDA had \u201cstruck a particular balance between safety and quantity.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Finally, where a state regulation is challenged as presenting an obstacle to a federal purpose, defendants\u2019 compliance with the regulation is presumed.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Thus, there is no need to predict whether or not a defendant will comply with a regulation \u2014 either the regulation conflicts with the federal purpose or it does not. On the other hand, when a tort law claim is the basis for a preemption argument, the question of whether a successful claim would necessarily cause defendants to change their behavior may be relevant. If, for example, defendants would rather pay damages than modify their behavior, then the tort claim presents no obstacle to the federal purpose.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> As a result, tort claims are treated differently from state regulations. As Justice Blackmun explained in <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>\u201c[t]he effect of tort law on a manufacturer\u2019s behavior is necessarily indirect.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Although an award of damages attaches consequences to continued unlawful conduct, the award does not mandate a particular change in behavior. A manufacturer has a number of options for responding to a finding of liability and one option for a manufacturer is to \u201caccept damages awards as a cost of doing business and not alter its behavior in any way.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> In addition, \u201ctort law has an entirely separate function \u2014 compensating victims \u2014 that sets it apart from direct forms of regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">In <em>Bates v. Dow, </em>the Supreme Court recently cautioned against finding that a tort duty is tantamount to a state regulation.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> In <em>Bates, </em>the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (\u201cFIFRA\u201d) expressly preempted \u201cany [state] requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required\u201d by the Act.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The Court noted, however, that a tort claim which \u201cmotivates an optional decision does not qualify as a requirement\u201d for express preemption purposes under FIFRA.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The possibility that a jury verdict could induce a pesticide manufacturer to change its label did not amount to a state requirement.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Even where plaintiffs assert a tort duty that creates a substantial obstacle, preemption should not \u201cordinarily [] be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>implied absent an \u2018actual conflict.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Thus, while the Court in <em>Geier </em>ultimately declined to decide whether compliance with an alleged tort duty could be assumed for purposes of preemption, it found that the alleged tort duty conflicted with federal law as there was strong evidence of clear interference with a Congressional purpose, as well as evidence that the Department of Transportation believed the claims to be preempted.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">V. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AMm\">A. Impossibility</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Defendants argue that in each year from 1995 to 2003, the amount of ethanol produced in the United States was lower than the amount needed to meet the demand for oxygenated fuel.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Defendants argue that this shortfall in \u201cactual installed ethanol capacity\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> would have made it impossible for them to comply with the RFG Program requirements without using MTBE. Thus complying with the plaintiffs\u2019 demand would be physically impossible. Plaintiffs agree, for the purposes of this motion, that there was not enough ethanol produced in the United States to satisfy the demand for oxygenated fuel between 1995 and 2003.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> They also note, however, that domestic production of MTBE was insufficient during that time to meet the demand causing defendants to import a third of the MTBE used.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Plaintiffs believe that the dispositive question is how much ethanol <em>could have </em>been made available to meet the RFG requirements in light of the \u201cproduction capacities of overseas ethanol manufacturers\u201d and the \u201cability of the United States and foreign ethanol producers alike to increase their production capacities\u201d during a four-year period before the RFG requirements went into effect.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The question of whether defendants could have used an oxygenate other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>than MTBE is beyond the scope of this motion.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Nonetheless, for the impossibility analysis, whether ethanol could have been imported or whether domestic production of ethanol could have increased is irrelevant. Impossibility does not depend on whether events in the physical world would have made it difficult to comply with both standards, but on whether the two standards are expressly incompatible.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> It was not physically impossible for defendant to comply with both standards because, even if state tort law demands that defendants not use MTBE, the federal law did not <em>require </em>the use of MTBE.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> As defendants admit, the CAA amendments only set minimum oxygenate requirements.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Depending on the law of each state, plaintiffs may eventually need to prove that a viable alternative to MTBE existed to succeed in their design defect claims.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Evidence presented by defendants shows only that the actual domestic installed ca-pacify was not sufficient to satisfy market demand. This does not amount to undisputed evidence that ethanol was not a reasonable alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">B. Obstacle Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">Defendants\u2019 argument that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are conflict preempted rests on the assumption that plaintiffs\u2019 defective design claims are the equivalent of a duty not to use MTBE.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Defendants argue that plaintiffs effectively seek a ban on MTBE and that a ban would present an impermissible obstacle to accomplishing the goals of the CAA.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Plaintiffs assert that they do not seek an injunction banning MTBE, and that civil liability for the use (and misuse) of MTBE is not the equivalent of a ban.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">Plaintiffs alleged that defendants have a duty \u201cnot to market\u201d MTBE because it is \u201cdefective and unreasonably dangerous for its intended and foreseeable transporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>tion, storage, handling and uses.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Even if this alleged duty would induce a change in defendants\u2019 behavior, that is not tantamount to a state regulation <em>requiring </em>certain behavior.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Finally, even if the tort duty is characterized as a duty not to use MTBE and defendants comply with that duty, for the reasons set forth below, that would not present an obstacle to a federal purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Defendants point to four alleged features of the Clean Air Act and its legislative history in support of their argument that plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims present an obstacle to a federal purpose: (1) Congress intended that defendants could choose which oxygenate to use to meet the requirements of the CAA; (2) Congress wanted to increase the amount of oxygenates available and thus maximize the improvement in air quality achievable under the RFG Program; (3) the EPA expected MTBE to be the most heavily used oxygenate; and (4) plaintiffs\u2019 theories would impose strict tort liability for compliance with federal law.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> As discussed below, none of these alleged features prove that a duty not to use MTBE would present an obstacle to compliance with the CAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">1. Choice and Flexibility</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Defendants argue that Congress intended refiners to have a choice among oxygenates and that the \u201cmarket should decide which oxygenate would be used.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> In support of their argument, defendants place heavy reliance on the legislative history of the CAA amendments. Plaintiffs respond that even if Congress intended that market forces would decide which oxygenates would be used, the definition of market necessarily includes the liabilities created by an oxygenate that contaminates groundwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">As an initial matter, because the text of the CAA is clear and unambiguous, the legislative history is irrelevant.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>CAA itself contains no language mandating that defendants have a choice among oxygenates. Congress intended the states to have flexibility in setting emissions standards as long as the state met the minimum threshold set by the RFG Program.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> The most that can be shown from the text of the Act is that Congress intended to create a fuel neutral program.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Nonetheless, defendants have combed the legislative history in an attempt to prove that \u201cgiving refiners a choice of oxygenates was essential to furthering Congress\u2019s goals that the RFG Program be cost efficient and maintain a stable supply of reasonably priced gasoline.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> Defendants place the greatest weight on a debate over a proposed 3.1 percent oxygen standard, which would have effectively mandated the use of ethanol.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Defendants claim that the. failure of the 3.1 percent oxygen standard evinces a Congressional intent to create a cost-efficient program. This argument is premised on the idea that a program limited to ethanol would have been more expensive and would have caused supply problems in the gasoline industry. But, the debate over the 3.1 percent requirement shows only that Congress did not mandate the use of any one oxygenate. Thus, in arguing against the 3.1 percent oxygen requirement as an effective ethanol mandate, Senator Lautenberg stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A74\">But the question is, should we, as a Federal initiative, provide an advantage to one of these fuels over another? I do not think so. So my amendment would set an oxygen content level of 2.7 percent for fuels within carbon monoxide nonattainment areas. This would allow for open and free competition among the various fuels and provide State and local officials with the <em>flexibility to decide what fuels they need in their areas. It also ivould help to keep us from going too far in addressing one problem so as to create </em>another.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Defendants also rely on statements by individual Senators during the debate over the CAA amendments.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> For example, defendants cite a 1993 statement from Senator Grassley of Iowa to prove that Congress intended the market to decide which oxygenate would be used so that the use of oxygenates could expand quickly.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> In his statement, Senator Grassley warned that certain regulations under the Act would create an \u201ceffective mandate for the use of MTBE.\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> Seeking support for ethanol, he explained that the original intent was to create a program that was \u201cfuel neutral.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Senator Grassley then criticized the President for not doing enough to encourage the use of ethanol in the order to aid Midwestern state economies and reduce this nation\u2019s dependance on foreign petroleum.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> At most, these statements demonstrate that Congress intended to allow a role for ethanol. They do nothing to support defendants\u2019 conclusion that Congress intended the use of oxygenates to \u201cexpand as quickly as capacity allowed.\u201d<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Defendants also cite a 1992 statement of the EPA in which it noted that \u201cthe legislative history reflects Congress\u2019 intent to preserve a role for the two major oxygenates \u2014 MTBE and ethanol \u2014 in the oxygenated gasoline program.\u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Read in context, however, the EPA statement merely explained why a certain proposed regulation, which would have discouraged ethanol use, was inappropriate. The statement does not prove that Congress intended anything more than a fuel neutral program. While it may show that Congress understood that both MTBE and ethanol would be used to fulfill the RFG Program requirements, the legislative history cited by defendants does not address whether Congress intended that the RFG Program would be cost efficient and would maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>a stable supply of reasonably priced gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The 1990 amendments to the CAA gave the states the flexibility to set emissions standards.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> They were not intended to give unfettered discretion to defendants to use any oxygenate, regardless of its safety. Every other court to grapple with state regulations banning MTBE or tort claims based on defendants\u2019 use of MTBE has found that the RFG program does not result in federal preemption.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> As the Ninth Circuit has noted, the legislative history of the CAA \u201cdoes not support a conclusion that Congress meant to give gasoline producers an unconstrained choice of oxygenates.\u201d <footnotemark>105</footnotemark> In short, defendants have presented no evidence to show that Congress or the EPA intended to protect the \u201cmarket share of MTBE even if it proves to be inferior to other oxygenates due to environmental considerations other than motor vehicle emissions.\u201d<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">2. Maximizing the RFG Program</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">Defendants also contend that Congress intended to maximize the improvement in the air quality achievable under the RFG Program, and that a duty not to use MTBE would be an obstacle to this goal.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Defendants rely primarily on section 211(k)(l), which states that regulations should be established for reformulated gasoline that \u201crequire the greatest reduction in emissions of ozone.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> Plaintiffs respond that defendants have failed to demonstrate that the use of ethanol in lieu of MTBE would have reduced the number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>of localities in the RFG Program.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> . In addition, plaintiffs argue that Congress never intended to allow expansion of the RFG Program regardless of the impact on the environment.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Defendants have presented no facts demonstrating that eliminating MTBE would have prevented the program from growing. The facts presented merely show that the actual installed capacity of ethanol in 1995 would not have been sufficient to satisfy market demand.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> Viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether eliminating MTBE would have prevented the growth of the RFG Program.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Nor is there any indication that Congress or the EPA \u201cstruck a particular balance\u201d between water pollution and the ability of the program to expand.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> Defendants argue that Congress made the choice to prioritize clean air over clean water. Section 211(k)(l)(A) provides that the EPA may not promulgate standards that advance \u201cthe use of renewable oxygenates\u201d where that use may be detrimental to a reduction in emissions.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> However, the consideration of \u201cany nonair-quality and other air-quality related health and environmental impacts and energy requirements\u201d <footnotemark>115</footnotemark> in that section ensured that any emission control measures did not have \u201cinordinate economic, environmental, or energy effects.\u201d <footnotemark>116</footnotemark> The CAA amendments thus provided for the possibility that emissions reductions would cause unexpected or inordinate environmental effects. Plaintiffs have alleged that the use of MTBE caused inordinate environmental effects<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> and thus their tort claims do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>conflict with this provision of the CAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">By the same token, the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Clean Air Markets Group v. Pataki </em>does not mandate a finding of preemption, as there is no evidence here that these tort claims would have prevented the EPA from implementing the RFG requirements or enforcing them.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> Unlike the state regulation in <em>Clean Air Markets </em>that would have restricted the transfer of pollution credits to states upwind of New York, plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims present no such clear restriction on the implementation of the CAA amendments. The Supreme Court has continually cautioned against inferring that Congress intended to preempt tort remedies, and defendants have offered no evidence to permit this Court to draw such an inference.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In support of their argument, defendants point to a Senate Conference Report on the CAA amendments for the proposition that the EPA, \u201cmay not discriminate among [ ] different oxygenates, and should encourage fair competition among them.\u201d<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Once again, I note that a Conference Report, though more reliable than individual statements by Senators, is legislative history and therefore irrelevant in the absence of an ambiguity in the plain language of the statute. But, it is also worth noting that the Report itself goes on to caution the EPA to \u201cconsider the different handling and transportation needs of different oxygenates, and the problems that can result if they are commingled.\u201d<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> Thus, at best, the Report demonstrates that Congress encouraged the EPA to take into account known problems when writing its regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">3. EPA Expectations</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Defendants also argue that the EPA expected MTBE to be the most heavily used oxygenate and thus any restriction on MTBE use would frustrate EPA\u2019s expectations.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> To support this argument, defendants claim that the EPA specifically allowed MTBE to be used and it included it, for example, in its \u201csimple emissions model\u201d for reformulated gasoline.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Defendants also point to the fact that the EPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>used MTBE as part of the calculations for a reformulated gasoline formula because of \u201cthe likelihood that MTBE will be the most heavily used oxygenate.\u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Defendants\u2019 evidence does not support the conclusion that the EPA intended to preempt plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims. This Court has previously held that the \u201cEPA did not intend to preempt the field of fuel content regulation for all purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> Nor does the EPA \u201chave authority to preempt the field of fuel content for all purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> <em>Geier </em>teaches that in order to support a claim of conflict preemption, defendants must make a showing that some special provision of the EPA regulations would be frustrated by these tort claims.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> The EPA\u2019s use of MTBE as an example oxygenate in its formula does not establish that Congress or the EPA intended to mandate any specific percentages of MTBE for the gasoline or a phase in program for ethanol or MTBE.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> As this Court has already held, the fact that the EPA expected MTBE to be used does not amount to a means-related objective or a mandate that defendants use MTBE.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Defendants have also failed to present any evidence that the EPA considers plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims to be an obstacle to federal objectives. In contrast to the explicit agency statement of federal preemption in the regulations at issue in <em>Fidelity Federal Savings, </em>the EPA here has never expressed its intent to preempt state tort claims.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> In addition, unlike in <em>Geier, </em>the EPA has not argued that plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims would frustrate its regulatory objectives. In fact, the EPA expressed an opinion that a state ban on MTBE is not preempted by the CAA. In approving a plan submitted by Clark County, Nevada to require a minimum oxygen content of wintertime gasoline of 8.5 percent oxygen by weight (a requirement which would essentially eliminate the use of MTBE), the EPA found that Clark County\u2019s provisions were not conflict preempted by the CAA.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> Nothing in the legislative history or EPA\u2019s regulations rebuts the assumption that Congress did not intend to displace state law.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>4. Punishment for Compliance with Federal Law</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Defendants finally argue that plaintiffs\u2019 claims should be dismissed because a finding of liability would be tantamount to punishing compliance with a federal program. Defendants claim that a \u201ccreative plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer\u201d could argue that all EPA-approved oxygenates are defective; thus denying defendants any chance to follow the law and simultaneously avoid tort liability.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> Defendants also argue that certain of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints allege that any approved oxygenate was defective.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Speculation about future tort suits is no basis for finding the current claims preempted by federal law. In addition, defendants have misinterpreted plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. Defendants cite the following paragraph in five complaints: \u201c \u2018[whenever referred to in this Complaint, MTBE means not only MTBE, but also the contaminants in commercial grade MTBE, as well as other oxygenates and ethers, including but not limited to TAME, DIPE, and ETBE.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> Plaintiffs do not allege that all oxygenates are defective. The paragraph must be read in conjunction with plaintiffs\u2019 other allegations. It clearly refers only to the oxygenates and ethers found in commercial grade MTBE.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Just as the many other courts that have addressed the issue of preemption and MTBE, this Court finds that plaintiffs\u2019 tort law claims are not preempted. For the foregoing reasons, defendants\u2019 motion is denied. The Clerk of the Court is directed to close this motion (docket # 923).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\">. <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v.

Defendants submitted an affidavit arguing, inter alia, that had refiners been forced to use ethanol only they would have been required to modify their gasoline and make capital investments, thus raising the cost of production for reformulated gasoline. <em>See </em>Stavins Deck \u00cd 5. Because this evidence was submitted in reply and plaintiffs did not have a chance to respond to it, the Court need not consider those arguments. <em>See Cantor Fitzgerald Inc. </em>v. <em>Lutnick, </em>313 F.3d 704, 711 n. 3 (2d Cir.2002).

If defendants wish to move for summary judgment on the grounds that an ethanol-only mandate would have undermined the goals of the CAA because of the hypothetical costs of using ethanol and modifying gasoline refining facilities, that is a separate motion. However, it is highly unlikely that defendants will be able to present undisputed facts about a hypothetical ethanol world, as the nature of a hypothetical world is that its facts are easily disputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"113\">\n<p id=\"b396-12\">. <em>See Hillsborough County, </em>471 U.S. at 716, 105 S.Ct. 2371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"114\">\n<p id=\"b396-13\">. <em>American Petroleum Inst. v.
