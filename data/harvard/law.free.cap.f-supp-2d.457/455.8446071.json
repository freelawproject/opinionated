INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In this consolidated multi-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d), plaintiffs seek relief from contamination, or threatened contamination, of groundwater from various defendants\u2019 use of the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d) and/or tertiary butyl alcohol (\u201cTBA\u201d), which is a product formed by the natural degradation of MTBE in water. The parties have already engaged in extensive motion practice, and familiarity with the Court\u2019s previous opinions is assumed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The facts underlying this case are comprehensively set out in those opinions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">Defendants now move for summary judgment on plaintiff Orange County Water District\u2019s (\u201cOCWD\u201d) claims based on its \u201clack of a cognizable interest.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, defendants argue that because any alleged groundwater contamination has not injured OCWD\u2019s property, any damages it sustained are purely economic and cannot be recovered under either product liability or negligence theories.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similarly, defendants argue that OCWD\u2019s trespass claim fails because it has not identified any \u201cpossessory interest in land\u201d that has been invaded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, defendants argue that OCWD\u2019s public nuisance claim should be dismissed because it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>merely a products liability action in the guise of a nuisance action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, defendants assert that OCWD\u2019s claim for declaratory relief should be denied because it is duplicative of the other claims in the action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, defendants\u2019 motion is denied in part, and granted in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">II. APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">A. Summary Judgement</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Summary judgment is only appropriate where the record \u201cshow[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An issue of fact is genuine if \u201c \u2018the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> while a fact will be deemed material where it \u201c \u2018might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, even though plaintiffs allegations are taken as true, the claim may still fail as a matter of law if it appears beyond doubt that plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of its claim which would entitle it to relief, or if the claim is not legally feasible.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The moving party bears this burden of demonstrating that there exists no genuine issue of material fact.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In turn, to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must raise a genuine issue of material fact that does \u201cnot rely on conclu-sory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To do so, it must do more than show that there is \u201c \u2018some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all justifiable inferences in that party\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-16\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b515-17\">A. Negligence and Products Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b515-18\">Defendants argue that OCWD seeks damages solely for economic losses which, in the absence of property damage, cannot be recovered under theories of either negligence or products liability.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Essentially, defendants argue that because OCWD does not complain of any MTBE contamination of its own wells, and because OCWD does not own the groundwater which it alleges has been or is threatened with MTBE contamination, it has no viable property interest capable of being damaged.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> OCWD, in turn, contends that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>has valid property interests arising from its usufructuary and statutory rights, and that contamination of the groundwater by MTBE directly injures those rights.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Further, OCWD disputes defendants\u2019 application of the economic loss doctrine, which OCWD argues does not bar recovery for the costs it has incurred as a result of the alleged contamination.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">1. Property Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Whether OCWD has a valid property interest in the groundwater is a threshold question. In California, the groundwater is not owned by any individual or governmental entity but rather by \u201cthe people of the State\u201d for whom the \u201cState as an entity is the holder of the legal title as trustee for the benefit of the people of the state.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, a usu-fructuary interest may be acquired and this interest will be deemed to be a \u201cpos-sessory property right.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Unlike a water provider, OCWD does not own or operate a network of wells used to provide water to the public.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Rather, OCWD\u2019s functions are, among other things, \u201cmanaging, replenishing, regulating, and protecting\u201d the groundwater within its geographic area of responsibility.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, unlike other plaintiffs in this MDL, the thrust of OCWD\u2019s allegations is not linked to contamination of its own wells or other real property, but rather to its legal interests in the groundwater arising from its statutory authority and usu-fructuary rights.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, while OCWD does not specifically allege that MTBE contamination of the groundwater is a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>tamination of <em>its property, </em>it argues that it nevertheless has sufficient legal interests in the groundwater to seek damages allegedly sustained from contamination of the groundwater.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> These interests \u2014 which are independent of land or well ownership \u2014 are \u201charmed, or threatened with harm, by defendants\u2019 conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Usufructuary rights generally arise from \u201csome physical act with respect to the water by the appropriator to manifest the possessory right.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The appropriative right, however, may also \u201cbe based on conservation of groundwater through substitution of, or replenishment from, an alternative supply.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> OCWD argues that through its replenishment of the groundwater basin it has acquired a corollary \u201clegal right to withdraw an equivalent amount of water from the basin.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Thus OCWD asserts that it has usufructuary rights arising from its replenishment activities. Defendants suggest that such rights arise only when a well is drilled, not through recharge activities.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Defendants are simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">OCWD\u2019s enabling Act specifically charges it with the power to \u201c[a]ppropriate and acquire water and water rights within or outside of the district.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In accordance with this mandate, OCWD has acquired a usufructuary right through its replenishment activities under California law.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Because OCWD has a \u201cpossessory property right\u201d that it alleges has been damaged by defendants\u2019 conduct, neither its negligence nor products liability claims are barred for lack of a cognizable interest.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">2. The Economic Loss Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">Defendants cite a line of California cases beginning with <em>Seely v. White Motor Co.</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for the proposition that until a defec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>tive product physically damages a plaintiffs property, any losses are merely economic and are not recoverable through negligence or products liability claims.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Defendants urge this Court to dismiss these claims because all of OCWD\u2019s damages are economic, and therefore \u201ceven if proven, would not constitute \u2018property damage\u2019 or present physical injury.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Defendants correctly state the economic loss doctrine: In the <em>absence of physical injury to property, </em>a plaintiffs economic losses cannot support a claim for negligence or products liability. However, where the defective product causes physical damage to property courts have also allowed recovery for economic loss.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Here, OCWD has alleged present, physical MTBE contamination of the groundwater, in which it asserts a possessory right. To the extent that such contamination is actually present in the groundwater and has caused OCWD to expend resources in testing and remediating groundwater, or otherwise injured OCWD, such claims are not barred as mere economic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">B. Trespass</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">Defendants next argue that OCWD\u2019s claims for trespass must fail because it has no \u201cpossessory interest in real property\u201d with which the alleged MTBE contamination has interfered.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> However, usufructuary interests are possessory property rights and the interference with those rights may give rise to liability for trespass. Groundwater contamination can constitute a trespass, where there is a \u201cphysical invasion\u201d that results in the \u201cpresence of contamination on [the] property.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Although OCWD\u2019s \u201cpossessory interest\u201d in the groundwater is not the equivalent of owning land, its property right has nevertheless suffered an invasion from the alleged MTBE contamination. As noted earlier, the OCWD Act gives OCWD the authority to acquire usufructuary rights, and it has done so through its recharge activities.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> As a result, OCWD has stated a valid claim for trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">C. Public Nuisance</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">This Court has previously held that OCWD is statutorily authorized to pursue a claim of public nuisance.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>now argue that California law generally prohibits nuisance claims against a manufacturer or distributor of an allegedly defective product, as such claims properly sound in products liability rather than nuisance.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Further, in public nuisance suits, where a plaintiff seeks to recover damages rather than simply abatement of the nuisance, it must show that it has suffered an injury distinct from that suffered by the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">1. Creating or Assisting in the Nuisance</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">While it is true that \u201cthe law of nuisance is not intended to serve as a surrogate for ordinary products liability,\u201d California courts have allowed nuisance claims to proceed where the manufacturer\u2019s or distributor\u2019s actions have \u201ccreated or assisted in the creation of the nuisance.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Such actions, however, must amount to more than simply the manufacture or distribution of the defective product \u2014 rather, a defendant must take other \u201caffirmative acts\u201d that contribute \u201cdirectly\u201d to the nuisance.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Importantly, a failure to warn regarding the dangers of a product, without more \u201cactivity directly connected\u201d to the creation of the nuisance, is an insufficient basis for nuisance liability.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> But where a defendant engages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>more substantial conduct contributing to the nuisance, liability may well be appropriate.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The question here is whether the evidence presented at this stage shows that \u201cdefendants assisted in the creation of a nuisance, or only that they produced or supplied the defective products.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Defendants contend that there is no evidence that they assisted in the creation of the nuisance because they took no \u201caffirmative steps\u201d which contributed to the nuisance nor \u201cspecifically instructed\u201d improper use.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">OCWD argues that defendants did more than merely manufacture or distribute gasoline containing MTBE without warning of the danger posed. OCWD contends that defendants \u201crepresented, asserted, claimed and warranted\u201d that gasoline containing MTBE \u201ccould be used in the same manner as gasoline [without MTBE]\u201d and that it \u201cdid not require any different or special handling instructions.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Further, OCWD states that defendants \u201cmarketed and promoted MTBE knowing that underground storage tanks ... could not safely contain MTBE.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> At the same time, according to OCWD, defendants knew that such claims were false and that MTBE posed \u201cunique dangers\u201d to groundwater.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">These allegations are remarkably similar to those in <em>Santa Clara, </em>and a key sentence from that decision bears repeating: \u201c[Liability is premised on defendants\u2019 promotion of lead paint for interior use with knowledge of the hazard that such use would create.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> If the allegations made by OCWD are true, such allegations would be sufficient to sustain a nuisance claim against the defendants.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">But neither side offers sufficient evidence to support their competing arguments regarding summary judgment. Defendants concede that California law permits nuisance claims against manufacturers of defective products in some circumstances, but do no more than assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>that those circumstances are absent. Likewise, the bulk of OCWD\u2019s memorandum cites to the allegations made in its Complaint rather than \u201cspecific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <footnotemark>54</footnotemark> OCWD provides no support (other than its own pleadings) regarding defendants\u2019 knowledge or their alleged representations as to the safety of MTBE and instructions to downstream handlers of gasoline containing MTBE as to \u201chow to store and dispose of the product.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> And while OCWD does note that some defendants owned and leased stations that may have leaked gasoline in the district, it offers little or no evidence that this conduct contributed directly to the alleged nuisance in the manner that courts have found sufficient to sustain nuisance liability.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Because neither party has come forward with sufficient evidence for this Court to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, summary judgment is not warranted at this time. Given that discovery is still ongoing, it is likely that the parties will be able to develop the record sufficiently to allow further consideration of summary judgment on this issue at the appropriate time.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">2. Distinct Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">[12, IB] While a nuisance action may be brought against the manufacturer of a defective product, the remedy for a public nuisance will generally be limited to abatement. Damages cannot be recovered unless a plaintiff can show it has been injured in a manner distinct from that suffered by the general public.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">In <em>Santa Clara, </em>for example, the plaintiffs brought two public nuisance actions: the first was brought as a representative of the people, and sought abatement; the second was brought on behalf of a class of plaintiffs whose property had been injured, and sought damages. The court allowed plaintiffs\u2019 first nuisance claim, finding that representative actions seeking abatement did not present the same concerns articulated in <em>Modesto </em>over holding manufacturers of defective products liable for damages in nuisance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">A <em>representative </em>public nuisance cause of action seeking <em>abatement </em>of a hazard created by affirmative and knowing promotion of a product for hazardous use is <em>not </em>\u201cessentially\u201d a products liability action \u201cin the guise of a nuisance action\u201d and does not threaten to permit public nuisance to \u201cbecome a monster that would devour in one gulp the entire law of tort.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">On the other hand, the <em>Santa Clara </em>court held that the plaintiffs could not bring damages claims <em>on their own behalf </em>under a theory of public nuisance: \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 [second] public nuisance cause of action is much more like a products liability cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>of action because, it is, at its core, an action for <em>damages for injuries caused to plaintiffs\u2019 property by a product, </em>while the core of a representative cause of action is an action for remediation of a public health hazard.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">As in <em>Santa Clara, </em>OCWD may seek abatement in its representative capacity. But the remaining question is whether OCWD can recover for damages on its public nuisance claim. In <em>New Mexico v. General Electric, </em>for example, the court noted that in order to recover for property damage, the State would have to show that it \u201csuffered some discrete physical harm or pecuniary loss apart from the more generalized injury to the public\u2019s interest\u201d resulting from the groundwater contamination.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The court stated that \u201cpecuniary losses arising from existing and future response and remediation costs ... may be recoverable as damages reflecting a \u2018special injury\u2019 to the State\u2019s property interests,\u201d but that because the State had not established its usufructuary interests, it was barred from recovering damages.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Here, OCWD alleges that it \u201cis specially and adversely affected by the nuisance\u201d and that its \u201cinjury is separate and distinct from that of the public.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> OCWD has established a valid usufructuary interest which is independent of the State or the People\u2019s general interest in groundwater.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Accordingly, OCWD may seek damages on its public nuisance claim to the extent that the alleged nuisance has interfered with that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">D. Declaratory Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">Finally, OCWD seeks an order declaring defendants liable for the \u201ccosts of all remedial and other actions necessary to abate or remove MTBE ... which is contaminating and threatening OCWD\u2019s property,\u201d declaring that certain defendants\u2019 \u201cgasoline delivery systems constitute a nuisance,\u201d and compelling defendants \u201cto abate the public nuisance proximately caused by their conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">Defendants argue that OCWD\u2019s claim for declaratory relief should be denied because it is duplicative of the other relief sought in this action.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 point is well taken. Such relief is identical to that sought under OCWD\u2019s common law claims for products liability, negligence, trespass, and nuisance. Declaratory relief is generally inappropriate where duplicative of other claims in the action as the \u201cobject of the statute is to afford a new form of relief where needed and not to furnish a litigant with a second cause of action for the determination of identical issues.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Accordingly, defendants\u2019 mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>tion to dismiss plaintiffs claims for declaratory relief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">For the reasons set forth above, defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgement is denied in part, and granted in part. The Clerk of the Court is directed to close this motion (docket # 1015).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\"><em>.See In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (\"MTBE\u201d) Prods.
