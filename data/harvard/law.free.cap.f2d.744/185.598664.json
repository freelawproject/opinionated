In the order under review, the Commission dismissed PEP-CO\u2019s complaint challenging the rates as unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b256-19\">A. <em>The Prior Proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-20\">The history of the prior Commission and court proceedings is set forth in our most recent opinion involving the matter. <em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v. I.C.C., </em>702 F.2d 1026, 1028-30 (1983). We restate only as much of that history as is necessary to understand the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-21\">PEPCO filed its complaint with the Commission against the Penn Central Transportation Co. (to which intervenor-respondent Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) is the successor) in December 1974. The complaint challenged as unjust and unreasonable the rates Penn Central charged PEPCO for transporting coal from mines in Pennsylvania to three of PEPCO\u2019s electric generating plants in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-22\">In 1977, the Commission held the rates unreasonable on shipments to one of the three plants, but not unreasonable on shipments to the other two. <em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Penn Central Transportation Co., </em>356 I.C.C. 815 (1977). PEPCO filed with us a petition to review, challenging portions of the decision adverse to it. We vacated the part of the decision that upheld the rates to the two plants, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion. <em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v. United States, </em>584 F.2d 1058 (CADC 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Following the remand, the Commission reopened the record, held a new hearing, and then used a series of superseding methodologies for determining the reasonableness of coal rates. <em>See Potomac Electric Power Co. v. I.C.C., </em>702 F.2d at 1029-30. In February 1981, the administrative law judge, applying then current methodology, filed a decision holding the rates to be unreasonably high. <em>Id. </em>at 1030. Both PEPCO and Conrail appealed the decision to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The Commission reopened the record for new evidence because it had decided not to adopt the methodology upon which the administrative law judge based his decision. The Commission did not propose any new methodology, and stated that maximum coal rate determinations would involve \u201ccase-by-case adjudication at least until remaining issues are resolved.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">PEPCO then filed with us a petition challenging the Commission\u2019s decision to reopen the proceedings. On March 1, 1983, we held that \u201cthe Commission has unreasonably delayed disposition of PEPCO\u2019s complaint.\u201d 702 F.2d at 1028. We ordered the Commission to \u201creach a final decision in PEPCO\u2019s and Conrail\u2019s appeal within sixty days of the effective date of our order.\u201d Id. at 1035. In so directing, we stated that \u201c[sjufficient time has elapsed that the Commission has now enunciated broad policy considerations affecting coal rate proceedings,\u201d which \u201ccan guide the Commission on a \u2018case-by-case\u2019 basis, alleviating the effect of the lack of an overall methodology to govern coal rate cases.\u201d We added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">Consequently, the lack of a final methodology should pose no problem to proceeding to a final disposition of PEPCO\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">We further stated that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abg\">this order respects the Commission\u2019s discretion to have the final say regarding the rate methodology to be applied to PEPCO\u2019s complaint, and thus avoids any undue displacement of the Commission\u2019s role in deciding the reasonableness of the contested rates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">Five days before that order, the Commission had proposed a new set of guidelines for determining the reasonableness of coal rates (the <em>1983 Guidelines, </em>discussed below). On March 10, 1983, the Commission set a deadline of April 6, 1983, for the submission of additional evidence directed to two parts of the new guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1036. PEPCO then filed with us a motion for a stay of that order and an order directing the Commission to decide the appeal from the administrative law judge\u2019s decision on the evidence then before it, using the former methodology that the administrative law judge had applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">We denied PEPCO\u2019s request that the Commission be required to decide the appeal on the existing record. In a supplemental opinion we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-14\">This request, however, overlooks the doctrine of primary jurisdiction and the limitations upon this court\u2019s power to control matters statutorily relegated to the Commission\u2019s discretion. The Commission\u2019s primary jurisdiction over rates includes the power to develop methods for determining the reasonableness of rates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 1037 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">We concluded that in the circumstances, we should \u201cextend the time limit [we] imposed on the Commission, even though PEPCO specifically disavows any interest in this relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-17\">We subsequently approved the parties\u2019 agreement to submit to the Commission \u201csimultaneous filings of further evidence and arguments directed to the new coal rate guidelines\u201d by April 18, 1983 and to file rebuttal evidence by May 2, 1983 \u201cwhen the evidentiary record in this appeal will be closed.\u201d <em>Potomac Electric Power Company v. I.C.C., </em>705 F.2d 1343, 1343-44 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The parties disagreed over the time the Commission should have to decide the case. PEPCO urged that the Commission should be required to act by June 1, 1983, Conrail proposed either no deadline or 90 days, and the Commission proposed no deadline. We ordered the Commission to decide the appeal by August 1, 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">B. <em>The Pertinent Legislation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The Commission formulated its <em>1983 Guidelines </em>against the background of two recent statutes governing the regulation of railroad rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">1. In the first of the two statutes, the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act (the 4-R Act), Pub.L. No. 94-210, 90 Stat. 31 (1976), Congress significantly deregulated rates for rail transportation by eliminating Commission jurisdiction over rates on traffic for which the railroad had effective competition. It did this by restricting the Commission\u2019s authority to prescribe maximum reasonable rates to traffic on which the carrier had \u201cmarket dominance,\u201d which it defined as \u201can absence of effective competition from other carriers or modes of transportation for the transportation to which a rate applies.\u201d 90 Stat. at 35, 36, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10709(a), (b) (1982). \u201cThe effect of this provision was to end for most rail service decades of ICC control over maximum rates and to permit carriers not having market dominance to set rates in response to their perception of market conditions.\u201d <em>Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad Co. v. I.C.C., </em>691 F.2d 1104, 1108 (3d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">2. In 1980, Congress enacted the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (Staggers Act), Pub.L. No. 96-448, 94 Stat. 1895. The conference report on that Act stated that the \u201cover-all purpose is to provide, through financial assistance and freedom from unnecessary regulation, the opportunity for railroads to obtain adequate earnings to restore, maintain and improve their physical facilities while achieving the financial stability of the national rail system.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 96-1430, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 80 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3978, 4110, 4111. One of the congressional findings (section 2(9) of the Act) was that \u201cmodernization of economic regulation for the railroad industry with a greater reliance on the market-place is essential in order to achieve maximum utilization of railroads to save energy and combat inflation.\u201d 94 Stat. at 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The congressional declaration of rail transportation policy included: \u201c(1) to allow, to the maximum extent possible, competition and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail\u201d and \u201c(3) to promote a safe and efficient rail transportation system by allowing rail carriers to earn adequate revenues, as determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\u201d Section 101(a), 94 Stat. at 1897, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101a (1982). In a section headed \u201cStandards for rates for rail carriers,\u201d Congress provided that \u201c[i]n determining whether a rate established by a rail carrier is reasonable for purposes of this section, the Commission shall recognize the policy of this title that rail carriers shall earn adequate revenues, as established by the Commission ____\u201d Section 201(a), 94 Stat. at 1899, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10701a(b)(3) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">In the so-called Long-Cannon amendment in the Act, Congress required the Commission, in determining whether a rate is reasonable, to consider evidence of the following three factors: (i) the amount of traffic transported at revenues that do not contribute to going concern value, and efforts to maximize such traffic; (ii) the amount of traffic that contributes only marginally to fixed costs, and the extent to which rates on that traffic can be changed to maximize revenues from it; and (iii) the carrier\u2019s mix of rail traffic to determine whether one commodity is paying an unreasonable share of the carrier\u2019s overall revenue. Section 203(a), 94 Stat. at 1904, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10707a(e)(2)(C) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">C. <em>The 1983 Guidelines.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">The Commission described its <em>1983 Guidelines </em>as \u201cculminatpng] our efforts to arrive at a formula for prescribing maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>mum reasonable coal rates in instances where railroads exercise market dominance over this traffic.\u201d Interstate Commerce Commission, Ex Parte No. 347 (Sub. No. 1), <em>Coal Rate Guidelines </em>\u2014 Nationwide 2 (February 8, 1983) (footnote omitted) [hereinafter cited as the <em>1983 Guidelines </em>], <em>summarized in </em>48 Fed.Reg. 8362 (February 28, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The Guidelines grew out of an earlier Commission proceeding, begun in 1978, that involved coal rates from the West, which the agency expanded in 1980 to cover all coal rates. In promulgating the <em>1983 Guidelines, </em>the Commission considered, in addition to the 4-R Act and the Staggers Act, its former criteria for determining the reasonableness of coal rates, its experience with those criteria, and the extensive comments it had received on the problem from rail carriers and shippers (including PEP-CO).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The key element in the Guidelines was the Commission\u2019s adaptation of the principle of \u201cconstrained market pricing\u201d as the touchstone for determining the reasonableness of rates on market dominated coal traffic. The Commission stressed that because a railroad has little ability to increase rates on traffic for which it has competition, it may be required to carry such traffic at rates that do not cover its fully distributed costs and therefore that it must make up the difference by charging higher rates on traffic for which it has no competition. The Commission pointed out that in the Staggers Act Congress recognized the need for this system of rates, known as \u201cdifferential\u201d or \u201cdemand based\u201d pricing, if railroads are to achieve the revenue adequacy that Congress intended them to accomplish. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">Our regulatory task is to determine the reasonableness of only those rates which are set in an essentially non-competitive market environment. We must develop a means to assure that the rate assessed on this traffic properly reflects the high demand for the service, but is not set at an unreasonably high or \u201cmonopoly\u201d level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\"><em>1983 Guidelines </em>at 9 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">The method the Commission selected to accomplish these objectives was to permit carriers to use \u201cmarket demand as the basis for their rate-making,\u201d subject to the following</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">four upward constraints: (1) the cost of serving that traffic without regard to any other traffic (\u201cstand-alone cost\u201d); (2) certain checks on obviously inefficient management; (3) achievement of revenue adequacy; and (4) phasing of any substantial rate increases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">(Since Conrail is not revenue-adequate and this case involves not rate increases but a challenge to existing rates, constraints (3) and (4) are inapplicable here.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">The Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-15\">With these constraints in place, carriers would have the necessary incentive to maximize their net revenue contribution from competitive traffic. They would also be effectively limited in the rates they could charge on captive traffic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A15\"><em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">The Commission explained \u201cStand-Alone Cost\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-17\">The \u201cstand-alone cost\u201d to any given shipper (or shipper group) is the cost of serving that shipper alone, as if it were isolated from the railroads\u2019 other customers. It represents that level at which the shipper could provide the service itself.No shipper would reasonably agree to pay more to a railroad for transportation than it would cost to produce in isolation itself, or more than it would cost a competitor of the railroad to provide the service to it. Thus, the stand-alone cost serves as a surrogate for competition; it enforces a competitive standard on rail rates in the absence of any real competitive alternative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-18\"><em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-19\">With respect to constraint (2), \u201cchecks on obviously inefficient management,\u201d the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>[W]e must consider: (1) the amount of the carrier's traffic that fails to contribute to going concern value and the carrier\u2019s efforts to minimize such traffic; (2) the amount of traffic that contributes only marginally to fixed costs and the extent to which rates on such traffic can be raised; and (3) the impact of the proposed rate increase on national energy and the rail transportation policy. 49 U.S.C. 10707a(e)(2)(B). In judging rate reasonableness, we must consider the first two factors listed above and a third factor \u2014 the carrier\u2019s mix of rail traffic to determine whether one commodity is paying an unreasonable share of the carrier\u2019s overall revenues. 49 U.S.C. 10707a(e)(2)(C)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">* * * * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">If we should determine that in a particular instance any of the foregoing factors have contributed to produce an artifically [sic] high and unreasonable rate, we will act to ensure that captive shippers pay no more than necessary under an efficient market pricing system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 13-14 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">D. <em>The Commission Decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">In compliance with our order approving the parties\u2019 agreement to file by April 18, 1983 \u201cfurther evidence and arguments directed to the new coal rate guidelines,\u201d Conrail on that date filed a lengthy standalone cost study, which concluded that the challenged rates were below the cost to PEPCO of itself providing the service. PEPCO filed no stand-alone cost study of its own, but instead argued against the application of the <em>1983 Guidelines </em>and presented updated revenue and cost data directed to the methodology the administrative law judge had applied in his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">In its rebuttal case, however, PEPCO submitted a stand-alone cost analysis based upon Conrail\u2019s presentation, with a single change. Conrail\u2019s analysis assumed that the new theoretical railroad that PEPCO would create could acquire from Amtrak trackage rights over a 71-mile portion of the required route at a rate of 21 cents per mile, the same rate Conrail paid Amtrak for use of that track. In its analysis PEP-CO further assumed that it could obtain trackage rights from Conrail and Amtrak for 21 cents per mile over the entire route between Pennsylvania and Maryland. This resulted in a lower cost than Conrail\u2019s estimate of building and maintaining a separate railroad line.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">In its rebuttal case PEPCO also contended that Conrail was inefficiently managed. It relied on two items of evidence: (1) the administrative law judge\u2019s finding in his decision that Conrail\u2019s deficit from noncompensatory traffic increased between 1977 and 1978, and (2) the testimony on cross-examination in another proceeding by a Conrail vice president of marketing indicating that he was unaware of the exact impact on revenues of certain pricing practices of Conrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">In a lengthy opinion, the Commission concluded that PEPCO had not met its burden of proof that the challenged rates were unreasonable and dismissed the complaint. <em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>367 I.C.C. 532 (1983). The Commission held that PEPCO had not met its burden of proof with respect to either \u201cthe stand-alone cost of providing [the] service\u201d or \u201cthe Long-Cannon factors, including whether defendant, Conrail, is inefficiently managed and whether (and to what extent) such alleged inefficiencies led to revenue inadequacy. In short, PEPCO has not met its burden of proof in spite of clear notice as to what was required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">The Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-14\">In this proceeding, we have decided to rely on our proposed <em>1983 Guidelines, </em>which, as here pertinent, are based on the stand-alone cost methodology and the Long-Cannon factors. These guidelines represent our best and most recent thinking, and reflect several years of experience and consideration of the issue and the wide-ranging comments received on our several proposals, as well as on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>changes that have occurred in the rail industry and its pricing mechanisms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">After explaining the <em>1983 Guidelines </em>and their background, the Commission discussed at length and rejected PEPCO\u2019s objection to the use of the Guidelines, PEP-CO\u2019s own stand-alone cost analysis, and PEPCO\u2019s argument that under the Long-Cannon factors the challenged rates were unreasonable because Conrail was inefficiently managed. We discuss these arguments in detail in the remainder of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">In addition to its substantive challenges to the Commission\u2019s decision, which we discuss in parts III and IY below, PEPCO argues that the Commission improperly applied the <em>1983 Guidelines </em>because (A) the Guidelines are not final; (B) the Commission singled out PEPCO for disparate treatment by applying the Guidelines only in PEPCO\u2019s case but not in any other pending coal rate case; (C) it was unfair to PEPCO for the Commission to change its methodology during the case; (D) PEPCO did not have sufficient time to prepare its own stand-alone cost study; and (E) PEPCO was denied the information it needed to show that Conrail was inefficiently operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">A. The fact that the Guidelines were not final did not preclude the Commission from applying them in this case. As the Commission explained, it relied on the Guidelines because they \u201crepresent our best and most recent thinking\u201d and reflected the Commission\u2019s \u201cseveral years of experience and consideration of the issues\u201d and the \u201cwide-ranging comments\u201d the agency had received on its \u201cseveral proposals.\u201d 367 I.C.C. at 535. The Commission cannot be faulted for deciding the case upon the most persuasive analysis then available to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Moreover, in our March 1, 1983 decision, we recognized that \u201cthe lack of a final methodology should pose no problem to proceeding to a final disposition of PEP-CO\u2019s complaint.\u201d 702 F.2d at 1035. In our supplemental opinion in that case, we approved the parties\u2019 agreement to submit by specified dates \u201cfurther evidence and arguments directed to the new coal rate guidelines.\u201d 705 F.2d at 1343. We understood and anticipated that, despite the nonfinal character of the new Guidelines, the Commission would apply them in deciding this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">B. The Commission did not improperly single out PEPCO\u2019s case as the only one in which to apply the proposed Guidelines. PEPCO relies upon <em>San Antonio, Texas v. Burlington Northern Railroad Co., </em>I.C.C. Docket No. 36180, et al., order of Oct. 11, 1983, in which the Commission granted requests to hold certain coal rate proceedings in abeyance until the final guidelines had been adopted. In that decision, however, the Commission explained that it was taking that action because in those cases, unlike the present case, the Commission was not under any court-imposed time deadlines for decision. In its brief in this court, the government has stated, and PEPCO has not denied, that following that decision the Commission \u201chas decided to proceed in several of the cases without waiting for final guidelines ... where parties have urged the Commission to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">Since, as explained above, it was PEPCO that insisted upon expediting the Commission\u2019s decision, PEPCO cannot now complain that because of the court-imposed deadlines it obtained, the Commission could not suspend PEPCO\u2019s case until the Guidelines became final. If PEPCO wanted such suspension, it could have requested us to extend or terminate the Commission\u2019s deadline for a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">C. The Commission was warranted in changing its methodology while these proceedings were pending. The history of the Commission\u2019s attempts to devise an appropriate methodology for determining the reasonableness of coal rates has been a process of trial and error in which the Commission changed its standards in the light of accumulating knowledge and expe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>rience. Nothing in the Interstate Commerce Act or general principles of administrative law required the Commission to adhere to standards that had proven unsound or unreasonable or barred the agency from applying its \u201cbest and most recent thinking, reflecting several years of experience and consideration of the issue\u201d in deciding this particular case at this particular time. 367 I.C.C. at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Such flexibility in rate-making reflects an appropriate exercise of the Commission\u2019s broad discretion to \u201calter its past interpretation and overturn past administrative rulings and practice\u201d in response to \u201cchanging needs and patterns of transportation.\u201d <em>American Trucking Association v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co., </em>387 U.S. 397, 416, 87 S.Ct. 1608, 1618, 18 L.Ed.2d 847 (1967). Moreover, in our March 1, 1983 decision, we noted the shift in the Commission\u2019s methodology, but nevertheless approved the Commission\u2019s proposed application of the <em>1983 Guidelines </em>in deciding this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Contrary to PEPCO\u2019s contention, we do not read the legislative history of the Staggers Act as requiring the Commission to apply in rate cases the \u201cexisting law\u201d in effect when that Act was enacted. As we have recognized, the Commission has substantial discretion to select the method and basis by which it will determine the reasonableness of coal rates. The Staggers Act did not limit the Commission\u2019s discretion so as to bar the agency from considering different methodologies than those it was using when that Act became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">D. PEPCO has not shown that it was denied sufficient time to prepare a stand-alone cost analysis. As the Commission pointed out, Conrail prepared an extensive stand-alone cost analysis in 6 weeks, the time period for submitting such a study to which the parties had agreed. 367 I.C.C. at 548-49. If PEPCO had required more time to prepare such a study, it could have requested it. PEPCO made no attempt to submit such a study, as it had been told and had undertaken to do. On the day on which its submission of \u201cfurther evidence and arguments directed to the new coal rate guidelines\u201d was due, PEPCO\u2019s submission merely repeated its contention that its case should be decided not under those guidelines but under the superseded earlier standards the administrative law judge had applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">E. PEPCO\u2019s contention that it was denied the information it needed to show that Conrail was inefficiently operated does not withstand analysis. The argument rests upon PEPCO\u2019s unsuccessful attempt in another Commission proceeding to obtain information from Conrail. PEPCO asserts that because in that proceeding the Commission refused to compel discovery, it would have been \u201cfutile\u201d for PEPCO to have made a similar request here.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The short answer is that PEPCO did not seek discovery here. If it had done so, we cannot say what the result would have been. <em>Cf. United States v. Tucker Truck Lines, </em>344 U.S. 33, 37, 73 S.Ct. 67, 69, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952). PEPCO cannot properly complain because it did not receive information it did not attempt to obtain through the procedures available to it. Moreover, as the Commission pointed out, \u201cPEPCO cannot be heard to complain of time constraints in light of its repeated efforts to expedite the proceeding with full knowledge of what its burden would be.\u201d 367 I.C.C. at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">A. PEPCO and the intervenor Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia contend that the Commission\u2019s use of the stand-alone cost concept in deciding PEPCO\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of Conrail\u2019s coal rates was an impermissible rate-making methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">PEPCO argues that the Commission\u2019s use of stand-alone cost is inconsistent with the Staggers Act and other provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act that require the Commission to determine whether rates are reasonable. PEPCO contends that the Commission gave undue and improper weight to the congressional policy reflected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>in the 4-R and Staggers Acts that railroad rates must produce sufficient revenue to make the carriers self-sufficient. According to PEPCO, in those statutes Congress intended the Commission to base its decision on the reasonableness of Conrail\u2019s coal rate upon an analysis of Conrail\u2019s fully allocated cost of providing the particular service and left no room for the methodology the Commission used.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">This court has recognized that the 4-R Act permitted differential pricing under which \u201csome rates [are] set at a level exceeding fully allocated costs in order to compensate for those rates which must be set at less than fully allocated costs to meet competition from other transportation modes,\u201d since this method of rate-making \u201cis pertinent to the objective of providing an adequate over-all level of earnings.\u201d <em>Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co. v. United States, </em>606 F.2d 1131, 1148 (1979); <em>San Antonio, Texas v. United States, </em>631 F.2d 831, 852 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In enacting the Staggers Act, Congress \u201cunderstood] the necessity of such differential pricing,\u201d since \u201c[b]eeause of the existence of competition, all rates cannot pay an equal percentage of \u2018fixed costs.\u2019 \u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1035, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 39, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 3978, 3984. \u201c[N]ot all traffic can be transported at fully allocated cost level due to competitive considerations____\u201d S.Rep. No. 96-470, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">We conclude that the Commission\u2019s use of stand-alone cost in determining the reasonableness of the rates of a railroad with inadequate revenues (as Conrail was) for noncompetitive traffic is an appropriate implementation of differential pricing. Congress enacted the Staggers Act because of concern that the 4-R Act \u201chas not provided the flexibility that the industry needs to earn revenues sufficient to maintain and improve the rail system.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1035 at 38,1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 3983. In the words of the conference committee, the \u201coverall purpose\u201d of the Staggers Act was \u201cto provide, through financial assistance and freedom from unnecessary regulation, the opportunity for railroads to obtain adequate earnings ____\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1430 at 80, 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4111.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Since under differential pricing a railroad must be able to charge enough on the traffic for which it has no competition to compensate it for its inability to earn its fully allocated costs on traffic where it has competition, the problem is to determine the point at which the rates on the noncompetitive traffic are unreasonably high. These rates necessarily must exceed fully allocated costs if the carrier is to earn adequate revenue. As the Commission explained in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-13\">[T]he stand-alone cost to a given shipper, is the cost of serving that shipper (or possibly group of captive shippers) as if the railroad had no other customers using the subject facilities. In the absence of competitive alternatives, so long as the railroad\u2019s rate is less than the cost to the shipper of providing the service for itself, it is economically advantageous to the shipper to use the carrier\u2019s service. Moreover, a rate below stand-alone cost ensures the shipper that it is not cross-subsidizing the rate of other shippers. In other words, the shipper is not paying for facilities or services that it does not use. In fact, if the shipper is paying less than the full stand-alone cost of the service, it is benefitting from certain economies of scale or other cost-sharing activities that allow the carrier to charge a lower rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">367 I.C.C. at 541-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">In other words, as long as the challenged rate has not been shown to exceed what it would cost the shipper itself to provide the service, the rate is reasonable because it (1) enables the carrier to maximize its earnings, while at the same time (2) protects the shipper from monopoly pricing in which the carrier sets its rates without regard to competition. Although stand-alone pricing deals with hypothetical and not actual transportation situations, it provides an appropriate analytical tool for determining whether a return on noncompetitive traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cproperly reflects the high demand for the service, but is not set at an unreasonably high or \u2018monopoly\u2019 level.\u201d <em>1983 Guidelines </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">PEPCO and the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia argue that since stand-alone cost applies only in situations where the railroad has no competition for the traffic, it enables the carrier to maximize \u201cmonopoly profits.\u201d The concept of differential pricing, however, necessarily contemplates that the carrier will maximize its profits on traffic for which it has no competition so as to offset its lower earnings on competitive traffic. It does not aid analysis to describe a carrier\u2019s rate on noncompetitive traffic pejoratively as producing \u201cmonopoly profits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The question is whether these rates, although noncompetitive, are reasonable. As the Commission pointed out in its Guidelines \u201cthe stand-alone costs serve as a surrogate for competition; it enforces a competitive standard on rail rates in the absence of any real competitive alternative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Furthermore, stand-alone cost is not the only ceiling on rates. In addition, a rate that exceeds stand-alone cost may be held unreasonable if the carrier is not efficiently operated, or if either of the two other constraints (not applicable in this case, see p. 189, <em>supra) </em>come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">B. Alternatively, PEPCO argues that if a stand-alone cost approach is permissible, the Commission erred in rejecting PEPCO\u2019s stand-alone cost analysis. As noted, that analysis did not provide any data that PEPCO itself developed. Instead, as PEPCO explained in its brief, it merely took Conrail\u2019s study and changed it \u201conly in extending the traffic rights operations over the entire route of movement of the hypothetical railroad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">PEPCO\u2019s stand-alone cost study assumed that the hypothetical railroad could obtain, at the same rate of 21 cents per mile that Conrail pays Amtrak, not only the right from Amtrak to move its cars over the 71 miles of Amtrak line that Conrail now uses in moving the PEPCO shipments, but also similar rights from Conrail over all other portions of the hypothetical route. Under PEPCO\u2019s analysis the stand-alone cost was less than the existing Conrail rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Assuming that PEPCO\u2019s submission complied with each party\u2019s agreement initially to submit evidence relating to the stand-alone cost theory in the <em>1983 Guidelines, </em>the Commission justifiably rejected it as fatally flawed. As the Commission explained, there was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">[no] reason to expect Conrail to make PEPCO such an offer or any offer for trackage rights that is more favorable to PEPCO than the rate itself.... In addition, the 21 cents per mile figure is based on the \u201cavoidable cost\u201d to Amtrak of allowing Conrail to use that particular section of track.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">:)s sji :)\u00ed sfc jjs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">PEPCO\u2019s stand-alone costs represents the minimum compensation to prevent out-of-pocket losses to Conrail. A rate based on such a computation is not even fully compensatory and is wholly inconsistent with differential pricing and our policy of placing greater reliance on the market in setting rates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">367 I.C.C. at 552-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">Although PEPCO criticized Conrad\u2019s stand-alone cost study, the Commission found it unnecessary to evaluate that study because PEPCO \u201cfailed to produce its <em>own </em>estimate of stand-alone cost to counter Conrad\u2019s estimates.\u201d The Commission concluded on this aspect of the case: \u201cSince PEPCO has failed to show that Conrail\u2019s rates exceed the stand-alone cost of service, under <em>any </em>definition of stand-alone cost, we cannot find Conrad\u2019s rates unreasonable <em>per se.\" Id. </em>at 553 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">In our earlier opinion in this case, we recognized \u201cthe Commission\u2019s discretion to have the final say regarding the rate methodology to be applied to PEPCO\u2019s complaint____\u201d 702 F.2d at 1035. We cannot say that, in applying the stand-alone cost analysis to conclude that PEPCO had failed to carry its admitted burden of proof that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Conrail\u2019s coal rates were unreasonable, the Commission abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The Long-Cannon amendment of the Staggers Act provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">(C) In determining whether a rate is reasonable, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, evidence of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">(i) the amount of traffic which is transported at revenues which do not contribute to going concern value and efforts made to minimize such traffic;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">(ii) the amount of traffic which contributes only marginally to fixed costs and the extent to which, if any, rates on such traffic can be changed to maximize the revenues from such traffic; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">(iii) the carrier\u2019s mix of rail traffic to determine whether one commodity is paying an unreasonable share of the carrier\u2019s overall revenues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Section 203(a), 94 Stat. 1904, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10707a(e)(2)(C) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">In its <em>1983 Guidelines, </em>the Commission described these criteria as \u201ccertain cheeks on obviously inefficient management.\u201d In its decision in this case, the Commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">In considering management efficiency, we look both at a carrier's operating practices and its pricing structure. We stated [in the Guidelines] that we would examine the carrier\u2019s mix of traffic and would not permit one shipper or commodity to bear an undue portion of the carrier\u2019s revenue need.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">367 I.C.C. at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">In this case the Commission followed its ruling in <em>Arkansas Power &amp; Light Co., </em>365 I.C.C. 983, 999 (1982), <em>affirmed on other issues, Arkansas Power &amp; Light Co. v. I.C.C., </em>725 F.2d 716 (D.C.Cir.1984), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Air\">[t]he complainant bears the burden of proof in a complaint proceeding. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the complainant initially come forward with evidence of the Long-Cannon factors. When the complainant produces relevant evidence, the carrier will have the opportunity to rebut. We will then weigh and discuss the evidence in our decision. If complainant fails to introduce relevant evidence, we will not require the carrier to make up for the deficiency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-17\">365 I.C.C. at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-18\">Upon reviewing the evidence relating to the Long-Cannon factors upon which PEP-CO relied, the Commission concluded that \u201cPEPCO presented no persuasive evidence that Conrail is inefficiently managed, and has not met its burden of proof on this issue.\u201d 367 I.C.C. at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-19\">A. PEPCO\u2019s argument that Conrail was inefficiently managed, so that under the Long-Cannon factors the coal rates were unreasonable, rested upon two items: (1) the finding of the administrative law judge that \u201c[e]ven granting the fact that Conrail\u2019s management has spared no effort to maximize gross revenues, ... Conrail experienced an increase in deficit below variable costs from noncompensatory traffic of from approximately $117 million in 1977 to $277 million in 1978\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 555); and (2) the fact that in his testimony in another case, Conrail\u2019s vice president in charge of marketing was unable to state whether a past reduction in certain rates improved Conrail\u2019s revenues or on cross-examination to recall the net revenue contribution of Conrail traffic that moved under contract rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-20\">We agree with the Commission that this evidence did not indicate that Conrail was inefficiently managed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-21\">The Commission properly held that the administrative law judge\u2019s finding was not probative of Conrail\u2019s efficiency because that finding \u201cwas based on the mistaken assumption that any traffic contribution less than 100% of all variable costs is non-compensatory.\u201d 367 I.C.C. at 556. The Commission pointed out that under the Staggers Act (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10701a(c)(2)), a rate that \u201cequals or exceeds the variable cost of providing the transportation is conclusively presumed to contribute to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>[railroad\u2019s] going concern value\u201d; that the Commission had adopted the term \u201c \u2018directly variable costs\u2019 (DVC),\u201d which it \u201cdefined to include only those, cost elements that vary directly with the level of service provided under the rate\u201d; and that \u201c[s]ince DVC is not equal to Rail Form A variable costs [upon which the administrative law judge based his conclusion], which always include many more cost elements, traffic which moves at a rate less than Rail Form A variable costs can still contribute to the carrier\u2019s going concern value and be compensatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">PEPCO\u2019s reliance upon the two instances in another case in which, while testifying, Conrad\u2019s vice president was unable to recall information about the effect upon Conrail\u2019s revenues of certain rates did not show or even suggest that Conrail was inefficiently managed. Although those instances might have had some relevance in determining the weight to be given his testimony in that case, they shed no light on the broader issue here involved whether Conrail was efficiently managed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In point II-E, <em>supra, </em>we considered and rejected PEPCO\u2019s further argument that it was denied the opportunity to obtain additional information relating to Conrad\u2019s alleged inefficient management. The present case thus does not present the situation that concerned us in <em>Arkansas Power &amp; Light Co., </em>725 F.2d at 724, of a complainant who was unable to present evidence on the Long-Cannon factors because of the limited discovery the Commission permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">B. PEPCO also contends that the Commission committed reversible error because it failed to discuss specifically each of the three Long-Cannon factors. The Long-Cannon amendment, however, does not require the Commission to consider those factors, but only to consider \u201cevidence\u201d of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Under the Staggers Act, PEPCO, as the shipper in this complaint proceeding, had the \u201cburden of proving\u201d that the challenged \u201crate is not reasonable.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10701a(b)(2). As the Commission held and PEPCO conceded, that burden covered evidence relating to the Long-Cannon factors as well as stand-alone costs, since under the <em>1983 Guidelines </em>those standards provide alternative grounds upon which a rate may be held unreasonable. 367 I.C.C. at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">In the present case, the evidence upon which PEPCO relies under the Long-Cannon factors did not address any of those factors but only the broader question whether Conrail was efficiently operated. The latter question is the ultimate issue to which, under the Commission\u2019s <em>1983 Guidelines, </em>the Long-Cannon factors relate. As we have noted, this evidence fell far short of sustaining PEPCO\u2019s burden of proving that Conrail is inefficiently operated. To the extent that this evidence is viewed as relating to the Long-Cannon factors themselves, the Commission \u201cconsidered\u201d it but found it unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">In the absence of any evidence in a complaint proceeding directly relating to the Long-Cannon factors, the Commission was not required itself to seek out or obtain such evidence. In a complaint proceeding, the Commission acts as a quasi-judicial tribunal and must decide the case on the basis of the evidence presented to it. In this case PEPCO was the complainant, but it failed to introduce any significant evidence under the Long-Cannon factors. The Commission did not improperly ignore those factors in dismissing PEPCO\u2019s complaint for failure to carry the burden of proof that the challenged Conrail coal rates were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">The order of the Interstate Commerce Commission dismissing PEPCO\u2019s complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
