Raymond A. Stancill was injured and John William Kefauver was killed when an aluminum ladder they were handling came into contact with an uninsulated high-voltage distribution line owned and maintained by Pepeo. The District Court ruled that they assumed the risk by failing to comply with Maryland\u2019s High Voltage Line Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and thus foreclosed any recovery. We affirm, likewise, on the basis of assumption of risk, but for a somewhat different reason from that stated by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-26\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b896-27\">Stancill and Kefauver were skilled in the roofing and guttering trade,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and experienced in the use of aluminum ladders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1980, they were hired by Charles and Lisa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Itte to install gutters and downspouts at their home in Takoma Park, Maryland.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither Stancill nor Kefauver notified Pepeo that at some point they would be working on a gutter within ten feet of the distribution line.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The two men arrived at the Itte home on May 24, 1980, and unloaded two 40-foot aluminum extension ladders from their truck. They then commenced the process of measuring and installation. As they began to maneuver one of the ladders<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> against the house, Stancill checked for overhead power lines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He saw the distribution line strung diagonally across the front lawn,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and noticed that it had a different appearance from the service lines extending from a utility pole to the house.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Kefauver, holding the ladder, began to position it, and in the process the ladder either touched the distribution wire or came within arcing distance of it. Stancill suffered third-degree burns and Kefauver was electrocuted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-19\">Appellants<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> brought suit in the District Court. Jurisdiction was invoked solely on diversity of citizenship.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellants charged gross negligence on Pepco\u2019s part, and sought compensatory and punitive damages. After extensive discovery, Pep-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>co moved for summary judgment, and the court granted the motion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court concluded that the failure of Stancill and Kefauver to abide by Maryland\u2019s High Voltage Line Act<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> constituted an assumption of the risk and barred recovery.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The substantive law applicable to this diversity action is that of Maryland.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">The law of that state recognizes potential liability for harm caused by negligence, whether simple<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or gross<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in character. Appellants alleged that Pepeo was grossly negligent in maintaining the uninsulated high-voltage distribution line.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> An action based on either type of negligence is defeated by proof that the plaintiff assumed the risk<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or, perhaps, that he was contributorily negligent.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Accepting as true, for the time being, appellants\u2019 allegation that Pepeo was grossly negligent, Pepeo asserts that Stancill and Kefauver assumed the risk as a matter of Maryland law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Since the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>trict Court upheld Pepeo in that regard,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> our task is to determine whether, in the circumstances here, Maryland law sustains that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The Maryland courts have identified three elements to be established before a risk will be deemed legally assumed. The defendant must show that the plaintiff (1) had knowledge of the risk of danger, (2) appreciated that risk and (3) voluntarily exposed himself to it.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Appellants argue that the evidence at trial did not measure up to these requirements.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">A careful reading of the record discloses beyond doubt that both Stancill and Kefauver, within the contemplation of Maryland law, knew of the existence and location of the distribution line. Kefauver had visited the Itte home for the purpose of estimating a price for installation of new gutters and downspouts.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Surely, in conducting this survey, he had abundant opportunity to observe the unobstructed distribution line.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Moreover, Stancill testified that when he and Kefauver moved the ladder to the front of the house, Kefauver saw the line. Stancill further testified that he, too, saw the overhead power lines,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> noticed the distance between the top of the ladder and the distribution line,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and even realized that the wire was uninsulated.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> These undisputed facts dispel any notion that either man was unaware of this source of potential danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">The record makes equally plain that both Stancill and Kefauver appreciated the risk posed by an aluminum ladder in close proximity to an energized high-voltage line. Maryland\u2019s standard on this score is objective: the risk is appreciated if \u201c \u2018any person of normal intelligence in [the plaintiff\u2019s] position must have understood the danger.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> And the Maryland high court has long considered electricity a generally-known and well-understood potential peril that anyone of adult age must be taken to comprehend.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Maryland law thus compels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>the conclusion that both men must be charged with appreciation of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">It follows that Stancill and Kefauver voluntarily assumed the risk within the meaning of the applicable Maryland law. \u201cWhen a person undertakes work which exposes him to obvious dangers which he knew or had the opportunity to know, he must\u201d under the law of that state \u201cbe considered as having assumed such risks, and he cannot recover for any injuries resulting therefrom.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The case before us presents exactly that situation,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> though certainly it need not have. Simply by complying with procedure specified in Maryland\u2019s High Voltage Line Act,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the risk presented by the distribution line could have been completely eliminated. In declining to pursue that alternative, Stancill and Kefauver, in the words of the Maryland court, \u201cpreferred convenience to safety and knowingly took the chance.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The District Court did not err when it held that appellants\u2019 action was barred by the Maryland doctrine of assumption of risk.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The judgment appealed from is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-15\">.

See also note 3 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b896-17\">. Stancill had worked with aluminum ladders for at least seven years prior to the date of the accident. A house painter for two years, he had used them in the exterior painting of more than 50 homes. Ae.App. 47, 48-49. Knowing that as conductors of electricity they could become hazardous, Ae.App. 49, 51, he customarily took precautions against potential shock from overhead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>power lines. Ae.App. 52-54. Later, Stancill took jobs successively with two companies engaged in the roofing and guttering business, Ae.App. 55, 58, in which metal ladders were used routinely. Ae.App. 56. He worked on more than 100 jobs with aluminum ladders which, at least two-thirds of the time, were 32 feet or longer. Ae.App. 59-61. On each job he would locate the electric service lines and was careful to keep ladders away from them, Ae. App. 56, 61; \u201c[w]e always need to be careful of them,\u201d he said, \"it was just where they were positioned as to the house as to where to move the ladder \u2014 not to come in contact with them.\u201d Ae.App. 56. He would also look for the pole-to-pole distribution lines to make sure that they were a safe distance from where he was working. Ae.App. 57, 62. Stancill enjoys perfect vision. Ae.App. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Similarly, Kefauver\u2019s \"main line of business for seven years was with roofing and guttering.\" Ae.App. 39. There was no indication that Kefauver had any visual impairment on the date of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">. The Itte\u2019s hired Capitol Roofing Company, Inc., to perform the work. Capitol subcontracted the job to Kefauver, who employed Stancill to assist him.

WATCH FOR WIRES \u2014 THIS LADDER CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY.\" Ae.App. 37, 42, 85. Bracketing the words \"THIS LADDER CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY\u201d were orange depictions of lightning bolts. Ae.App. 85. A second decal on the ladder, flagged by the word \u201cCAUTION,\u201d provided a guide for positioning the ladder and, at the bottom in bold letters, the admonition \"READ ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS ON LADDER.\u201d Ae.App. 86-87.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b897-20\">.

Suspended 25 feet above the ground, it was unobscured by structures or foliage, and plainly visible from the area below. Ae.App. 22, 24-25, 26-28. At its closest point to the house, the line had a 7-foot, 5-inch clearance from the left front corner of the roof overhang. Ae.App. 21. After 40 years without apparent mishap, one Wesley Howard brought an aluminum ladder into contact with the distribution line and sustained an electrical shock and injuries. Howard sued Pepeo, alleging negligence as the cause of his injuries. The court found that, assuming that Pepeo was primarily negligent, Howard was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, and entered summary judgment against him. <em>Howard v. Sylvester, </em>Civ. No. R-78-1851 (D.Md. Dec. 5, 1980), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>688 F.2d 832 (4th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b897-22\">. Ae.App. 83.

Because of the fatality, the City of Takoma Park Police Department and the Maryland Public Service Commission investigated. The police found two \"fray marks\" on the distribution wire at 9 feet, 2 inches from the closest edge of the roof overhang, and 25 feet, 3 inches vertically from the ground. Ae.App. 15, 19. The Commission found no violation of its regulations by Pepeo. Ae.App. 92-96. The distribution line, in terms of location and condition, met the Commission's standards, which incorporate those set forth in the National Electrical Safety Code.

In diversity cases, federal courts in the District of Columbia apply the substantive law of the forum with respect to those issues that are outcome-determinative. <em>Lee v. Flintkote Co., </em>193 U.S.App.D.C. 121, 124 n. 14, 593 F.2d 1275, 1278 n. 14 (1979) (explicitly adopting analogously the principles of <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), for federal courts in the District of Columbia). The forum's choice-of-law rules are substantive for <em>Erie </em>purposes, <em>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 496, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 1021, 85 L.Ed. 1477, 1480 (1941); <em>Steorts v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>207 U.S.App.D.C. 369, 372, 647 F.2d 194, 197 (1981); consequently, the District of Columbia rules determine whether Maryland or District of Columbia law governs the instant case. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has adopted the approach of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 145 (1971) in negligence cases. <em>Myers v. Gaither, </em>232 A.2d 577, 583 (D.C.App.1967). Under that section of the Restatement, the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-10\">considers as important contacts, <em>inter alia, </em>the place of the injury, the place where the contact occurred, the domicile of the parties, and the place where the relationship between the parties, and the place where the relationship between the parties is centered. In determining the relative importance of the contacts, the forum will consider the issues, the character of the tort, and the relative purposes of the tort rules of the interested states.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">See also <em>Carr v.

Potomac Elec. Power Co., supra </em>note 13, at 2-3, A.App. 187-188, that the District of Columbia courts would look to Maryland law in this action. Maryland is the place where the accident and the injuries occurred, the domicile of appellants, and the place where the relationship of the parties was centered. Maryland obviously has a strong interest in compliance with its statute, see note 35 <em>infra, </em>and caselaw, see notes 21, 32 <em>infra, </em>concerning conduct relative to electric power lines. No countervailing interest whatsoever of the District of Columbia is apparent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b898-15\">. See, <em>e.g., Myers v.

They argue, Brief for Appellant at 4, that contributory negligence is not a bar to an action, such as this one, which is predicated upon gross negligence. Neither party, however, has directed us to any Maryland case expressly so holding, and our own review of Maryland caselaw might lead us to the conclusion that contributory negligence defeats claims based upon gross negligence, as well as those based upon simple negligence. Indeed, the Court of Appeals of Maryland recently observed that it is \"the well-established law of this State that a plaintiff who fails to observe ordinary care for his own safety is contributorily negligent and is barred from all recovery, <em>regardless of the quantum of a defendant\u2019s primary negligence.\u201d Harrison v. Montgomery County Bd. of Educ., supra </em>note 21, 295 Md. at 451, 456 A.2d at 898. See also <em>Ladnier v.

Although <em>Harrison </em>indicates that the defense of contributory negligence would be available to Pepeo even had it conducted itself in a grossly negligent manner, we need not undertake to resolve the point, or to decide whether Stancill and Kefauver were in fact contributorily negligent. As we now discuss, we find that the record upholds the District Court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 action on the basis of assumption of risk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b899-11\">.

While the efficacy of the defense of contributory negligence to gross-negligence charges may be open to some doubt, see note 21 <em>supra, </em>assumption of the risk under Maryland law indubitably defeats a claim resting upon gross negligence. Once it has been established that the plaintiff assumed the risk, the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct, whether characterized as simple or gross, becomes irrelevant. \u2018\"In its primary and proper sense, [assumption of the risk] means that the plaintiff has consented to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him, and to take his chance of injury from a known risk____ The legal position is then that the defendant is under <em>no duty </em>to protect the plaintiff.\u2019\" <em>Bull S.S.

Appellants assert that because Kefauver could not testify, his knowledge of the location of the distribution line is unclear. Brief for Appellants at 11. While our reading of the record dispels any question of Kefauver's actual knowledge, Maryland law imputes that knowledge to one who claims that he did not see an object which, under the circumstances involved, he would have seen had he but used his senses.

The mere fact that Stancill and Kefauver were pursuing their livelihood is immaterial to the question whether they assumed the risk. In <em>Burke v.

It is even clearer that the assumption of risk by Stancill and Kefauver was voluntary, for they could have avoided all danger from the distribution line by the simple expedient of taking statutorily-prescribed precautions.
