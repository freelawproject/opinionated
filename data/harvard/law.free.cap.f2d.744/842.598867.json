The Authority has cross-petitioned for enforcement. For the reasons stated below, we enforce the Authority\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"AU8\">A. <em>Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"A37\">Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (the Act), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7135 (1982), substantially revised labor-management relations in the federal sector. The Act was designed to balance the right of federal employees to engage in concerted activity with the need of federal managers to achieve an \u201ceffective and efficient [federal] Government.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101(b). To administer the Act and establish labor-management relations policy, Congress created the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The Authority\u2019s responsibilities include resolving issues relating to the duty to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The Act established a system of collective bargaining that requires federal agencies and employee unions to bargain in good faith \u201cwith respect to ... conditions of employment.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(12). The term \u201cconditions of employment\u201d is expansively defined in the Act as \u201cpersonnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">This broad duty to bargain is subject to certain limitations. Specifically, the Act contains a management rights clause that reserves certain prerogatives to management. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a). Most important, for this case, the management rights clause reserves to management the authority \u201cto make determinations with respect to contracting out.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(B). The procedures used in exercising these reserved management rights are subject to negotiation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">B. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">The facts in this case are undisputed. During contract negotiations with the EEOC, the union<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> advanced the following proposal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-19\">\u201cThe EMPLOYER agrees to comply with OMB Circular A-76 and other applicable laws and regulations concerning contracting-out.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-20\">Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 2. EEOC declared the proposal nonnegotiable and refused to bargain over it. To resolve the dispute, the union filed a petition for review with the Authority. J.A. at l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>EEOC argued before the Authority that the union proposal was nonnegotiable primarily for two reasons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, it contended that the proposal conflicted with the Act\u2019s express reservation to management of the right \u201cto make determinations with respect to contracting out.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(B). Second, the EEOC argued that OMB Circular A-76 (the Circular) itself prohibited negotiation over the proposal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> J.A. at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">On September 2, 1982, the Authority issued a decision holding that the union proposal was a mandatory subject of bargaining. <em>American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO National Council of EEOC Locals and Equal Employment Commission, </em>10 FLRA 3 (1982). The Authority concluded that the proposal did not impair EEOC\u2019s statutory right to make contracting-out decisions because it recognized only existing limitations on EEOC\u2019s power. By its terms, ruled the Authority, the proposal established no substantive limitations on management discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">The Authority further concluded that the proposal was not rendered nonnegotiable by the terms of the Circular. EEOC apparently asserted that adoption of the proposal would result in subjecting all contracting-out disputes to the negotiated grievance procedure, thus conflicting with the Circular\u2019s intent to allow EEOC to resolve such disputes internally.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Authority rejected EEOC\u2019s underlying assumption that contracting-out disputes are not grievable in the absence of the proposed contract language. 10 FLRA at 4-5. Rather, the Authority found that such disputes were already grievable under section 7121 of the Act and that the Circular alone could not limit the <em>statutorily </em>prescribed scope of the grievance procedure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 10 FLRA at 4-5. Concluding that the contract proposal was not prohibited by either the Act or the Circular, the Authority ordered EEOC to bargain. <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>EEOC filed a timely petition for review in this court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The FLRA filed a cross-petition for enforcement. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AJD\">The Act provides that the Authority\u2019s rulings are reviewable in accordance with section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1982). <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(c) (1982). The Authority\u2019s determinations will thus be upheld \u201cif they are supported by substantial evidence^] ... are not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion^] and are otherwise in accordance with law.\u201d National <em>Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, </em>721 F.2d 1402, 1405 (D.C.Cir.1983). Review is further circumscribed where, as here, the Authority has construed its enabling legislation. Indeed, the Authority is entitled to \u201cconsiderable deference\u201d when interpreting and applying the Act\u2019s provisions to specific situations. <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 439, 444, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983). Accordingly, we will uphold the Authority\u2019s interpretation of the Act if it is \u201creasonably defensible,\u201d <em>Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d 1140, 1162 n. 121 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 945, 102 S.Ct. 1443, 71 L.Ed.2d 658 (1982); <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA, </em>104 S.Ct. at 444 (1983), and not inconsistent with any congressional mandate or policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">EEOC asserts that the Authority improperly construed the terms of the management rights clause, as well as the probable effect of the disputed proposal. EEOC suggests first that the plain text of the management rights clause insulates from collective bargaining <em>all </em>proposals regarding contracting-out. Second, EEOC contends that the proposal is nonnegotiable because its adoption would subject contracting-out decisions to the statutorily prescribed grievance procedure, thus infringing on EEOC\u2019s reserved authority to make contracting-out decisions. Finally, EEOC argues that the proposal is inconsistent with the Circular.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">EEOC asserts that the management rights clause gives management unfettered authority to make contracting-out determinations. Apparently assuming that any proposal regarding contracting-out will restrict this authority, EEOC suggests that the management rights clause renders nonnegotiable <em>all </em>proposals regarding contracting-out.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">EEOC\u2019s argument is untenable in light of the plain text of the clause. The management rights clause provides that \u201cnothing in [Title VII] shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency \u2014 ... in accordance with applicable laws \u2014 ... to make determinations with respect to contracting out.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(B). This language plainly restricts the authority reserved to management by requiring that it be exercised \u201cin accordance with applicable laws.\u201d In addition, section 7106(b) provides that procedures used to exercise rights are negotiable. <em>See supra </em>note 1. Because the Act does not grant to management unqualified authority to contract-out, union proposals touching upon that authority are not automatically rendered nonnegotiable. Rather, management may refuse to bargain over only those proposals that would expand upon the restrictions contained in the Act. <em>See infra </em>note 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The union proposal here suggests contract language that essentially echoes the statutory requirement that contracting-out determinations be made in accordance with applicable laws. Any restriction imposed by the proposal on management\u2019s contracting-out authority thus stems from the Act\u2019s mandate. EEOC, of course, must comply with these requirements regardless of whether the proposal is adopted as part of the collective agreement. The union proposal at issue here thus does not of itself establish any substantive criteria guiding management\u2019s contracting-out determinations. We therefore agree with the Authority\u2019s conclusion that the proposal does not affect management\u2019s reserved authority, within the meaning of the statutory language, to make contracting-out decisions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">EEOC points to no expression of intent in the legislative history that contradicts this conclusion. Though far from conclusive, the legislative history indicates that the management rights clause should not be interpreted to negate the Act\u2019s broad duty to bargain. In adopting the management rights clause, Congress sought to reserve to management the authority necessary to achieve an effective and efficient government. At the same time, however, Congress intended to broaden the scope of bargaining beyond that sanctioned under the previous labor-management relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>system.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, as one member explained, the clause was designed to protect \u201cgenuine managerial prerogatives.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, Congress directed that the clause was to \u201cbe read to favor collective bargaining whenever there is doubt as to the negotiability of a subject or a proposal.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">In sum, neither the text nor the legislative history mandates a conclusion other than that reached by the Authority. We cannot say, therefore, that the Authority acted arbitrarily in concluding that the proposal does not affect EEOC\u2019s reserved rights. We reject EEOC\u2019s argument that the management rights clause renders the proposal nonnegotiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">EEOC argues next that even if the text of the proposal does not impose additional restrictions, its adoption would effectively hinder EEOC\u2019s ability to make contracting-out decisions. Specifically, EEOC contends that the proposal would invade its reserved management rights by making compliance with the Circular a contractual prerequisite of any decision regarding contracting-out. The union could then challenge EEOC\u2019s decisions to contract-out by alleging that EEOC violated the collective agreement in failing to comply with appropriate procedures. Any contracting-out decision would then be subject to grievance procedures and ultimately to arbitral review. According to EEOC, contracting-out decisions could thus become the prerogative not of management but of the arbitrator. In this way, EEOC implies, the union would be able to achieve precisely what the management rights clause was intended to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">EEOC\u2019s argument assumes that a complaint asserting that a contracting-out determination was not made in accordance with applicable laws, including the Circular, would not be grievable in the absence of the contract proposal. This assumption, however, is contrary to the text of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">The Act expansively defines the subjects covered under the statutory grievance procedure. Grievances include complaints concerning \u201cany claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment\u201d as well as complaints \u201cconcerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(9).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Only five subjects, not including the subject of contracting-out, are expressly ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>eluded from coverage under the grievance mechanism.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> An allegation that the EEOC failed to comply with the OMB Circular, or with any other law or rule governing contracting-out, plainly falls within this expansive definition.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">EEOC maintains, however, that in addition to the five subjects expressly designated in section 7121 of the Act, all prerogatives reserved to management under the management rights clause are excluded from the scope of matters grievable. EEOC asserts that because the management rights clause provides that <em>\u201cnothing in this chapter </em>shall affect\u201d management\u2019s authority to contract-out, such decisions are removed from grievance procedures. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a) (emphasis added). A grievance alleging noncompliance with the Circular, however, does not affect management\u2019s substantive authority, within the meaning of the statutory language, to contract-out. Rather, it provides a procedure for enforcing the Act\u2019s requirement that contracting-out decisions be made in accordance with applicable laws.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Any substantive limitation on management\u2019s au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>thority stems from the externally established criteria contained in the Circular. <em>See supra </em>text accompanying note 12. We therefore find that a grievance asserting that management failed to comply with its statutory or regulatory parameters in making a contracting-out decision is not precluded by the management rights clause.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">The statutorily defined grievance procedure therefore encompasses a claim that a contracting-out determination was not made in accordance with law. EEOC\u2019s initial assumption that including the proposal in the collective bargaining agreement would expose for the first time EEOC\u2019s contracting-out determinations to employee grievance challenges, and arbitral review, is contradicted by the plain text of the Act. We thus conclude that adoption of the proposal in no way expands an employee\u2019s right to challenge management\u2019s contracting-out decisions under the grievance procedure.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject EEOC\u2019s contention that the proposal will impair its management rights by making compliance with the Circular a contractual prerequisite of contracting-out decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Finally, EEOC argues that the language of the OMB Circular renders the proposal nonnegotiable. As noted, the Circular states that its provisions \u201cshall not be construed to create\u201d any right of appeal except as provided in the Circular itself. J.A. at 37. EEOC maintains that the Authority\u2019s ruling that the proposal is negotiable conflicts with the Circular\u2019s limiting language because it allows alternative enforcement actions through the grievance mechanism. Two considerations compel us to reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">First, the proposal is not inconsistent with the Circular\u2019s limiting language. The proposal does not \u201ccreate\u201d any new right of appeal. Rather, as we have already determined, the right to file grievances regarding contracting-out decisions is created by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">Second, and more important, the Circular\u2019s restrictive language cannot be construed to limit the statutory right to file grievances asserting a violation of contraeting-out regulations. There is no indication in the Act or elsewhere of a congressional intent to allow agencies to limit by regulation the statutorily defined grievance procedure. To allow the text of the Circular to restrict the scope of grievances would place \u201climitations in the statute not placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>there by Congress.\u201d <em>Colgate-Palmolive Peet Co. v. NLRB, </em>338 U.S. 355, 363, 70 S.Ct. 166, 171, 94 L.Ed. 161 (1949). Accordingly, we reject EEOC\u2019s argument that the Circular bars negotiation over the proposal.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">For the reasons stated herein, we conclude that the Authority\u2019s interpretation should be upheld and that its order should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-7\">.

OMB Circular A-76 (the Circular) prescribes guidelines for determining whether the goods and services needed by the federal government should be acquired from the private sector or obtained \"in-house\" with government facilities and personnel. Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 37. The Circular specifies that the government generally should acquire its goods and services from private enterprise if it is cost-effective. The Circular contains a Cost Comparison Handbook outlining procedures to be followed in determining whether contracting-out is most cost-effective. Since the petition in this case was filed, OMB Circular A-76 has been revised. The revision in no way affects the issues before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b879-23\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(a)(2)(E) provides that the Authority shall \u201cresolve[ ] issues relating to the duty to bargain.\" The Act further provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>\"if an agency involved in collective bargaining ... alleges that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to any matter, the [union] may appeal the allegation to the Authority.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7117(c)(1). The Authority is required to issue a written decision containing reasons for its determination. If the Authority concludes that the disputed issue is within the scope of the duty to bargain, it orders the agency to bargain in good faith. The Authority does not, however, address the merits of the proposal. See <em>Library of Congress v. FLRA, </em>699 F.2d 1280, 1284 (D.C.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">If a proposal is determined to be within the duty to bargain, the parties must negotiate, although they may adhere to a particular position to the point of impasse.

In addition to the two arguments noted here, the agency also asserted that the proposal fell outside the scope of the duty to bargain because it involved matters that do not directly affect conditions of employment. The FLRA's decision did not address this contention.

The dissent contends that the Act\u2019s reservation to management of the right to contract-out is a limitation on the Authority\u2019s power to direct labor-management relations. Consequently, argues the dissent, the Authority\u2019s interpretation of the scope of management\u2019s reserved rights is not entitled to great deference. The dissent ignores the fact that the dispute here concerns the negotiability of a specific proposal. Congress has expressly entrusted to the Authority the power and the obligation to resolve all such disputes. <em>See supra </em>note 4. Decisions in this circuit have uniformly recognized that the Authority, and not the court, must exercise the judgment necessary to determine whether a proposal that allegedly violates management's rights is bargainable. \u201d[T]he distinction between proposals encroaching on management\u2019s non-negotiable substantive authority and those concerning properly negotiable procedural matters [is] primarily to be made by the Authority in an exertion of its expertise ____\u201d <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, </em>691 F.2d 553, 561 (D.C.Cir.1982) (footnote omitted) (citing <em>Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d 1140, 1161 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 945, 102 S.Ct. 1443, 71 L.Ed.2d 658 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\">The dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>Vanguard Interstate Tours, Inc. v. ICC, 735 </em>F.2d 591 (D.C.Cir.1984), is misplaced. In the statute at issue in <em>Vanguard, </em>Congress expressly limited the discretion previously granted to the ICC and set out the precise criteria governing the issue in the case. Here, in contrast, Congress has expressly delegated to the Authority the task of resolving issues relating to the duty to bargain. We therefore conclude that even if the management rights clause acts as a limitation on the power of the Authority, the Authority\u2019s exercise of its expertise primarily to determine whether an issue in a particular case is negotiable is entitled to deference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b882-6\">. The precise scope of management\u2019s reserved authority is difficult to define. In previous rulings, the Authority has effectively defined the protection accorded management by classifying proposals as either negotiable procedures under section 7106(b) or nonnegotiable substantive rights. To distinguish between the two, the Authority has developed a \"direct interference\u201d test. Under this test, a proposal involves a nonnegotiable substantive right if it would \"directly interfere\u201d with management\u2019s ability to make the relevant determination. We have repeatedly affirmed the Authority\u2019s use of this test. <em>See Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d 1140, 1159 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 945, 102 S.Ct. 1443, 71 L.Ed.2d 658 (1982). Although in the present case the Authority did not expressly classify the proposal as procedural and did not explicitly apply the direct interference test, the analysis used was quite similar. In concluding that the proposal was negotiable, the Authority focused on the agency\u2019s retention of the full degree of discretion that exists in the absence of the proposal. We find this analysis fully acceptable as a guideline to determine the scope of substantive rights reserved to management.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">The dissent misconstrues both the direct interference test and the import of our conclusion here. The direct interference test is essentially definitional. It determines whether a particular proposal is in fact substantive and therefore nonnegotiable. Although the Authority did not expressly apply this test here, it did use the same functional analysis: only proposals that limit substantively management\u2019s contracting-out determinations involve nonnegotiable rights. Implicit in the Authority\u2019s opinion is the conclusion that the disputed proposal represents more of a procedural than a substantive limitation on management\u2019s right to contract-out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b883-8\">.

The dissent contends that a complaint asserting a failure to comply with the Circular does not fall within the statutory definition of grievance. Because the Act defines grievance to include claims alleging violations of regulations \"affecting conditions of employment,\" and because \"conditions of employment\" is in turn defined as \"matters affecting working conditions,\u201d the dissent maintains that grievances are restricted to claims involving surroundings and hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">The dissent's narrow definition of \"working conditions\u201d does not apply in the context of this Act. The definition of working conditions as hazards and surroundings derives from <em>Corning Glass Works </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>417 U.S. 188, 201-03, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 2231-2232, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974), a case construing the language of the Equal Pay Act. The Court in <em>Corning Glass Works </em>based its definition of the term \u201cworking conditions\u201d on Congress\u2019s intent as expressed in an extensive discussion of the term in the legislative history of the Equal Pay Act. The Court noted that \"working conditions\u201d has a generally accepted meaning in the \"specialized language of job evaluation systems.\u201d 417 U.S. at 202, 94 S.Ct. at 2232. A definition adopted in the context of a specific statute and in light of a detailed legislative history, however, is not immediately transferable to this case. <em>See Copper Valley Machine Works, Inc. v. Andrus, </em>653 F.2d 595, 600 n. 7 (D.C.Cir.1981). The legislative history of Title VII nowhere indicates that Congress intended such a restriction on the rights granted employees. Indeed, the Authority has consistently adopted, with this court's sanction, a <em>broad interpretation </em>of the phrase \"conditions of employment.\u201d <em>See Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>685 F.2d 641, 647-48 &amp; n. 3 (D.C.Cir.1982); National Treasury Employees Union and Internal Revenue Service, 3 FLRA No. 112 at 693, 695 (1980) (conditions of employment concerns working situation and employment relations of bargaining unit employee). Moreover, as the dissent itself notes, the term \"conditions of employment\u201d includes personnel policies and practices as well as matters affecting working conditions. <em>See </em>Dissent at n. 12. Even if the phrase \"matters affecting working conditions\u201d comprises only hazards and surroundings, contracting-out decisions, which ultimately may result in a layoff, undoubtedly fall under the umbrella of personnel policies or practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">In addition, we note that the dissent\u2019s restrictive definition applies only to grievances defined in section 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) as violations of regulations affecting conditions of employment. The dissent's analysis, of course, does not apply to grievances defined in sections 7103(a)(9)(A) or (B) as any matter relating to the employment of an employee. A claim that work was improperly contracted out surely falls within this definition of grievance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b884-17\">. The dissent maintains that grievances alleging a failure to comply with applicable laws regarding contracting-out will affect management by delaying implementation of a decision. Of course, any review of an agency decision, whether conducted by the courts or through a contractual grievance mechanism, may cause some delay. This court has previously recognized that a proposal that may result in delay, including delay created by the arbitral process, need not infringe management\u2019s reserved authority, and may thus be negotiable. <em>See Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d at 1153\u201458.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. Our reading of the text of the Act is supported by the legislative history. Congress unambiguously stated that the management rights clause, at least in one instance, does not affect an employee\u2019s right to enforce the Act\u2019s requirement that management exercise its reserved right in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-8\">[Management has the reserved right to make the final decision to \"remove\" an employee, but that decision must be made in accordance with applicable laws and procedures, and the provisions of any applicable collective bargaining agreement. The reserved management rights to \u201cremove\" would in no way affect the employee\u2019s right to appeal the decision through statutory procedures or, if applicable, through the procedures set forth in a collective bargaining agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">124 Cong.Rec. 29,183 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History at 924. Similarly, we believe that EEOC\u2019s reserved right to make determinations regarding contracting-out does not insulate EEOC from challenges, through the grievance mechanism, asserting violations of applicable laws or regulations. <em>Cf. National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, </em>691 F.2d 553, 564-65 (D.C.Cir.1982) (noting that although establishment of performance standards is encompassed within management\u2019s reserved rights, employees may challenge those standards in grievance proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">The dissent suggests that this conclusion requires us to construe the statutory grievance mechanism as an applicable law with which management must comply. This construction, suggests the dissent, does not comport with the statutory language which states that \"nothing in Title VII shall affect\u201d management's authority to make determinations regarding contracting-out. We do not determine here whether the section 7121 grievance mechanism is an \"applicable law.\u201d Rather, we conclude only that a grievance alleging that management has not complied with externally established criteria does not affect management\u2019s reserved substantive authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b885-15\">. The scope of the grievance procedure can of course be limited in negotiation. We address here only the <em>statutorily </em>defined grievance procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b886-9\">. EEOC also argues that section 7117(a)(1) of the Act, which prohibits bargaining over matters that are inconsistent with other laws, limits the matters subject to grievance procedures. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7117(a)(1). EEOC asserts that bargaining over contracting-out is inconsistent with the management rights clause and therefore contracting-out determinations are excluded from the grievance mechanism. Reply Brief for Petitioner at 5. EEOC\u2019s assertion that the proposal at issue in this case is inconsistent with other law is derivative in nature. EEOC contends the proposal is inconsistent with the management rights clause. We have already stated, however, that the management rights clause does not, on its face, render this proposal nonnegotiable. The proposal cannot be \u201cinconsistent with other law\u201d if it is not inconsistent with the management rights clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b886-7\">MacKINNON, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A1R\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Because I believe that the majority opinion seriously misreads the statute which controls this case, I consider it my duty to dissent. The opinion of the majority holds that the EEOC must bargain over a proposal which, under the Federal Labor Relations Authority\u2019s (FLRA\u2019s) interpretation of the statute, is a total nullity. The majority holds that incorporation into the collective bargaining agreement of a promise to comply with applicable regulations, including OMB Circular A-76, does require that all \u201ccontracting-out\u201d decisions be subject to grievance determinations, but that such a provision affects neither management\u2019s authority to contract out nor the existing union remedies for violations of that regulation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">The FLRA essentially held that (1) management has a right to make determinations regarding contracting-out; (2) such determinations must be made in accordance with applicable regulations; (3) violations of such regulations are <em>already grievable </em>under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 without regard to the necessity of making them grievable in a collective bargaining agreement; and thus (4) a provision in a collective bargaining agreement requiring adherence to such regulations does not infringe the agency\u2019s specific, existing right to \u201ccontract out\u201d because it does not make nongrievable matters grievable. The essential flaw in the FLRA\u2019s reasoning \u2014 and the one adopted by the majority \u2014 is that, contrary to its assertion, violations of Circular A-76 and other regulations regarding <em>substantive </em>contracting-out decisions are <em>not </em>statutorily grievable. Hence, inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement of a promise to comply with the Circular\u2019s terms would permit the union to seek arbitration on issues that are <em>not </em>now grievable, and would create arbitral review of determinations specifically entrusted by Congress to the EEOC and all other federal agencies. This far-reaching decision potentially affects <em>every </em>non-exempt federal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">The union plainly recognizes this; why else does it seek so strenuously to impose a collective bargaining provision that \u2014 the majority implicitly asserts \u2014 gives it nothing it did not already possess? Far from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>being a nullity, the decision of the majority seriously infringes on the authority, specifically reserved to the EEOC and all other agencies by Congress, \u201cto make determinations with respect to contracting out.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"AbB\">The majority recognizes that \u201c[rjeview of the Authority\u2019s order shall be on the record in accordance with [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706].\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(c). Section 706 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The reviewing court shall\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-7\">(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-8\">(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or <em>otherwise not in accordance with law; </em>[or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-9\">(C) <em>in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory </em>right____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the standard of review for FLRA decisions was spelled out recently by Justice Brennan in <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 439, 444, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-14\">Like the National Labor Relations Board, ... the FLRA was intended to develop specialized expertise in its field of labor relations and to use that expertise to give content to the principles and goals set forth in the Act____ Consequently, the Authority is entitled to considerable deference when it exercises its \u201cspecial function of applying the general provisions of the Act to the complexities\u201d of federal labor relations____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-19\">On the other hand, the \u201cdeference owed to an expert tribunal cannot be allowed to slip into a judicial inertia which results in the unauthorized assumption by an agency of major policy decisions properly made by Congress.\u201d Accordingly, <em>while reviewing courts should uphold reasonable and defensible constructions of an agency\u2019s enabling Act, </em>... <em>they must not \u201crubber stamp ... administrative decisions that they deem inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-22\">(Emphasis added.) Applying this standard, the Court unanimously reversed the FLRA\u2019s own construction of its enabling statute. The same principle calls for reversal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-23\">Courts should be especially cautious about giving undue deference to agency construction of enabling legislation when the particular provision being construed is one designed to act as a <em>limitation </em>on the agency. As this court recently pointed out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnF\">When Congress\u2019 intent is to delegate to the agency the task of supplying the meaning of the statutory standard in question, we are bound to accept the agency view if it is not arbitrary or capricious or inconsistent with underlying congressional intent. <em>When Congress has not delegated this function to the agency, we must undertake full interpretive responsibility ourselves, and we look to the agency view as a relevant, but not controlling, principle. </em>It remains for this court initially to exercise its responsibility to interpret the statute to determine whether Congress delegated the definitional function to the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-24\"><em>Vanguard Interstate Tours v. ICC, </em>735 F.2d 591, 596 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>Trailways, Inc. v. ICC, </em>727 F.2d 1284, 1288 (D.C.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-25\">If Congress intended a particular provision to <em>limit </em>the authority of an agency, deferring to an agency decision which eviscerated that provision would foil that legislative intent. When Congress limits the discretion of an agency, a court is remiss if it permits the agency to circumvent that limitation through construction of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is doubly remiss if in doing so it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>violates a clear grant of specific management discretion to another agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">In Chapter 71 of Title 5 (\u201cLabor-Management Relations\u201d), which creates the FLRA, Congress specifically provided that \u201cnothing in [Chapter 71] shall <em>affect </em>the authority of any management official of any agency ... in accordance with applicable laws ... to make determinations with respect to contracting out.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(B) (emphasis added). This specific recognition of authority in all federal agencies affirmatively denies to the FLRA any authority to \u201caffect\u201d the authority of an agency to \u201ccontract out.\u201d An FLRA decision which encroached on this specifically recognized power would thus violate the plain intent of Congress. Since Congress cannot have intended to give the FLRA discretion to erode the limitations it specifically placed on that Authority by statute, it cannot have intended that courts give great deference to the FLRA\u2019s construction of such limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To the extent, then, that the FLRA\u2019s decision exceeds its \u201cstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations,\u201d 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(C), it is not entitled to deference. This court \u201cmust undertake full interpretive responsibility [itself], and ... look to the agency view as a relevant, but not controlling, principle.\u201d <em>Vanguard Interstate, supra, </em>735 F.2d at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Although the majority asserts that the plain language of the relevant statutory provisions supports <em>its </em>construction, <em>see </em>Maj. at 848, 851, the relevant language points plainly to exactly the opposite interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Section 7106 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, <em>nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any management official of any </em>agency\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-12\">(1) to determine the mission, budget, organization, <em>number of employees, </em>and internal security practices of the agency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-13\">(2) in accordance with applicable laws\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-14\">(B) to assign work, <em>to make determinations with respect to contracting out, </em>and to determine the personnel by which agency operations shall be conducted____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">(b) Nothing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization -from negotiating\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-16\">(1) <em>at the election of the agency, </em>on the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, <em>work project, </em>or tour of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means of performing work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-17\">(2) <em>procedures </em>which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-18\">(3) appropriate <em>arrangements </em>for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-19\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106 (emphasis added). In other words, this section of the Act on its face specifically provides that <em>nothing </em>in Chap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>ter 71 can circumscribe management\u2019s authority to make decisions regarding contracting-out, <em>except </em>for the limitations in \u00a7 7106(b). Subsection 7106(b) provides that management may negotiate (1) <em>\u201cprocedures </em>which ... the agency will observe in exercising [its reserved] authority,\u201d (2) \u201cappropriate <em>arrangements </em>for employees adversely affected by the exercise of [such] authority\u201d (emphasis added), and (3) at its election, assignment of employees to particular work projects and the means of carrying out such projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Significantly, the FLRA did <em>not </em>attempt to construe the contract proposal at issue as relating to \u201cprocedures ... the agency will observe\u201d in implementing its contracting-out decisions, a fact which the majority recognizes. <em>See </em>Maj. at 848 n. 12. Indeed, it is difficult to comprehend how OMB Circular A-76 <em>could </em>fit under the provisions of \u00a7 7106(b). The purpose and scope of that Circular are spelled out in its first paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-6\"><em>Purpose. </em>This Circular establishes Federal policy regarding the performance of commercial activities. The Supplement to the Circular sets forth procedures <em>for determining whether commercial activities should be performed under contract with commercial sources or in-house using Government facilities and personnel.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">OMB Circular No. A-76 (rev. Aug. 4, 1983) (emphasis added). In other words, the Circular and its accompanying Supplement are designed to offer guidance to agencies in making the decision to contract <em>out </em>\u2014 i.e., to provide <em>substantive policy-making criteria </em>\u2014not procedures for carrying out decisions already made. If (1) the Circular provides substantive criteria for contracting out, and (2) bargaining over substantive criteria for contracting out is prohibited by law, then (3) a collective bargaining proposal which purports to <em>require </em>an agency to meet substantive criteria is <em>not </em>negotiable. It therefore does not appear that the FLRA <em>could </em>rationally have based its decision on the \u201cprocedures\u201d provision of \u00a7 7106(b). In any event \u2014 even assuming that the language could be twisted into supporting that position \u2014 the FLRA did not do so, and this court is prohibited from relying on a ground not advanced by the agency. <em>See SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 462, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943) (\u201cadministrative order cannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained\u201d); <em>NLRB v. Enterprise Association of Pipefitters, </em>429 U.S. 507, 522 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 891, 900 n. 9, 51 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977) <em>(Chenery </em>rule \u201chas not been disturbed\u201d by subsequent decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">The majority attempts to escape this problem by arguing that, while the FLRA did not specifically find that this provision was procedural, it nevertheless used \u201csimilar\u201d analysis to that used in cases involving procedures, <em>i.e., </em>its \u201cdirect interference\u201d test. Maj. at 848 n. 12. The simple answer to this is that a test for determining the validity of <em>procedural </em>provisions is entirely irrelevant to the validity of <em>substantive </em>restrictions. Under \u00a7 7106, restrictions on <em>procedures </em>which indirectly affect contracting-out by management may well be proper because they fall within \u00a7 7106, but <em>non-procedural </em>restrictions which affect that <em>right </em>\u2014 whether directly <em>or </em>indirectly \u2014 are clearly not.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Moreover, the limited scope of the term \u201cprocedures\u201d in subsection (b)(2) is emphasized by subsection (b)(1), in which Congress provided for bargaining over \u201cthe employees or positions assigned to any ... work project, ... or on the ... methods, and means of performing work,\u201d but <em>only </em>\u201cat the election of the agency.\u201d Congress recognized the right of any agency to elect to bargain on some subjects that are not mandatory. Congress\u2019 specific treatment of <em>work projects </em>belies the majority\u2019s construction of the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It makes little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>sense to suggest that \u201ccontracting] out\u201d any specific work project is a mandatory subject of negotiation when this subsection clearly provides that negotiation on \u201cany work project\u201d is \u201cat the election of the agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">It may be that the key to the majority\u2019s opinion is its footnote 12. Although the Authority itself did not hold that the proposal at issue was only \u201ca procedure\u201d under \u00a7 7106(b), the majority finds in that footnote that the proposal really <em>is </em>merely procedural, and hence the management rights provisions do not apply at all.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But neither the Authority\u2019s opinion \u2014 despite the majority\u2019s divination of what that agency meant but did not say \u2014 nor the language and history of the statute lends any support to the notion that requiring compliance with substantive decision-making criteria, and subjecting such substantive decisions to arbitral review, is nothing more than a \u201cprocedure\u201d for exercising authority to contract out.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The majority, however, does not attempt to rely solely on a <em>sua sponte </em>finding that the provision at issue is procedural. Instead, it rests heavily on another limitation it finds in \u00a7 7106: the requirement that decisions regarding contracting-out be made \u201cin accordance with applicable laws.\u201d The majority perforce construes this to mean \u201cin accordance with the other provisions of Chapter 71.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">It should first be pointed out that the FLRA in its opinion did not offer this interpretation of the statute as a basis for its decision, and thus the majority is not only speculating in relying on this as a ground, but is also ignoring the principles of <em>Chenery, supra. </em>The FLRA, in fact, heretofore has recognized that substantive decisions regarding management rights are <em>not </em>reviewable under the grievance procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA-\">Under the plain language of section 7106(a), of course, \u201cnothing\u201d in the Statute shall \u201caffect the authority\u201d of an agency to exercise the rights enumerated therein. Hence, no matter could be grieved under a procedure negotiated pursuant to section 7121 of the Statute which would deny the authority of an agency to exercise its statutory rights under section 7106.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-13\"><em>AFGE Local 2782, </em>6 F.L.R.A. 314, 319-21 (1981) (footnote omitted). There is no suggestion in <em>Local 2782 </em>that the phrase \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d can be used to permit grievance review of non-negotiable <em>substantive </em>decisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">But even assuming that the FLRA had proffered this interpretation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>withstand scrutiny. Congress provided that, except for \u00a7 7106(b), <em>nothing </em>in Chapter 71 shall affect management\u2019s authority, \u201cin accordance with applicable laws,\u201d to make determinations with respect to contracting-out. To reach its conclusion that the whole grievance procedure is somehow excluded from that sweep, the majority must read the phrase \u201capplicable laws\u201d to include <em>the remainder of Chapter 71. </em>Thus, it in effect reads the statute as follows: \u201cNothing in this chapter [71], <em>EXCEPT ALL THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER 71, INCLUDING \u00a7 7121 (PRESCRIBING GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES), </em>shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency ... to make determinations with respect to contracting out ...\u201d (italicized matter supplied). It is absurd to construe the act to say that <em>\u201cnothing\" </em>in the rest of Chapter 71 affects management\u2019s right, but that the rest of Chapter 71 <em>does </em>affect that right. This construction is at variance with any reasonable interpretation of the statute. The majority points to nothing in the legislative history which indicates that specifically denominated, non-negotiable rights conferred on \u201cmanagement officials\u201d were nevertheless to be subjected to grievance and arbitral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">It may be that the majority is not reading the statute that broadly, that not <em>all </em>of the remainder of Chapter 71 falls under \u201capplicable laws.\u201d It may, perhaps, be suggesting simply that Congress\u2019 (unarticulated) intent in \u00a7 7106(a) was to shield the decision-making process from <em>negotiation, </em>but not from <em>subsequent review </em>by labor arbitrators and the FLRA. Again, there is no shred of legislative history which indicates that Congress intended contracting-out decisions to be grievable. But the intent of Congress can be inferred from what it wrote. It did <em>not </em>say that contracting-out decisions (and the other management rights) are \u201cnon-negotiable.\u201d Had it done so, grievance review arguably would still remain. Instead, it said that, except for \u00a7 7106(b), <em>nothing in Chapter 71 can affect the right of the agency to make contracting-out decisions. </em>The latter phrase would be singularly inept if what Congress meant was the former, and at least in the absence of clear Congressional intent or a manifestly unsound result this court should refrain from directly violating the express language adopted by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Next, even if we assume that (1) the term \u201capplicable laws\u201d <em>does </em>include all the rest of Chapter 71, and (2) the exercise of a non-negotiable management right <em>is </em>subject to the grievance provisions, it is far from clear that a failure to comply with Circular A-76 would meet the definition of a \u201cgrievance\u201d for purposes of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">The term \u201cgrievance\u201d is defined <em>restrictively </em>by Congress in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii), as here relevant, to mean<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cany claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation <em>affecting conditions of employment\u201d </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The term \u201cconditions of employment\u201d is also restrie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>tively defined to <em>mean </em>\u201cpersonnel policies, practices, and matters ... affecting <em>working conditions. </em>\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(14) (emphasis added). Thus, even under the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute, a violation of agency regulations is a \u201cgrievance\u201d under \u00a7 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) <em>only </em>to the extent that such violation involves personnel policies and practices or the <em>working conditions </em>of the employees. These are plainly words of <em>limitation </em>\u2014 i.e., not <em>all </em>violations are grievable \u2014 and there is <em>no </em>indication that such limitation was inserted inadvertently.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The majority\u2019s footnote suggestion that Circular A-76 may have something to do with personnel policies or practices is insubstantial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It must, then, be fitted (if anywhere) under the phrase \u201cmatters ... affecting working conditions.\u201d But a contracting-out decision, even when it results in a loss of jobs, is not necessarily a decision affecting the <em>working conditions </em>of the employees. While ordinarily the term \u201cworking conditions\u201d is to be broadly interpreted, <em>see Independent Federation of Flight Attendants v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>655 F.2d 155, 157 (8th Cir.1981), it nevertheless \u201chas a ... specific meaning in the language of industrial relations,\u201d <em>Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, </em>417 U.S. 188, 202, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 2232, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974), and clearly means \u201csomething less than the employment relationship in its entirety.\u201d <em>Southern Railway Co. v. OSHRC, </em>539 F.2d 335, 339 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 999, 97 S.Ct. 525, 50 L.Ed.2d 609 (1976). In interpreting the same term in another statute, the Supreme Court explained that \u201cthe element of working conditions encompasses two subfactors: \u2018surroundings\u2019 and \u2018hazards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coming Glass, supra, </em>417 U.S. at 202, 94 S.Ct. at 2232 (interpreting the Equal Pay Act). This court subsequently noted that <em>only </em>\u201csurroundings\u201d and \u201chazards\u201d fall within the labor relations meaning of \u201cworking conditions,\u201d <em>Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 429, 452 n. 153 (D.C.Cir.1976), and in the FLRA we are dealing with a \u201clabor relations\u201d act. With reference to the term \u201cworking conditions\u201d in yet another act, other circuits have held that the term refers to the \u201cenvironmental area in which an employee customarily goes about his daily tasks.\u201d <em>Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. v. Marshall, </em>636 F.2d 913, 916 (3d Cir.1980); <em>Southern Railway, supra, </em>539 F.2d at 339. There is no indication that the term \u201cworking conditions\u201d in the statute at issue here (which was used by Congress several years after the <em>Coming Glass </em>decision, presumably with knowledge of the meaning assigned to those words by the Court) was intended to have a different, much broader meaning than it enjoys in other labor relations statutes passed by Congress.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>It might be argued, on analogy to the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), that contracting-out decisions <em>do </em>fall within the term \u201cconditions of employment.\u201d In one NLRA case, <em>Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 210, 85 S.Ct. 398, 402, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964), the Supreme Court interpreted the term \u2014 which is <em>not </em>defined in the NLRA \u2014 to include contracting-out. However, in the Federal Labor Relations Act, unlike the NLRA, Congress \u2014 which presumably was aware of both <em>Fibreboard Paper </em>and <em>Corning Glass </em>\u2014chose to define the term <em>strictly </em>in a much narrower fashion: it means <em>only </em>personnel policies and practices and matters affecting \u201cworking conditions.\u201d The meaning attached to a term in one statute, where Congress has not defined it, is irrelevant to its meaning in another statute where Congress <em>has </em>defined it. It is the phrase <em>working conditions, </em>not <em>conditions of employment, </em>which acts to narrow the scope of grievances under the FLRA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Since a violation of the regulation involved in this case would be grievable only to the extent it affected the environmental conditions under which employees work, it is difficult to see what sort of violation of Circular A-76 could have any effect on the <em>working conditions </em>\u2014 as opposed to the continued employment \u2014 of the bargaining unit employees. The Circular governs decisions regarding <em>when </em>agencies should contract out; it does not specify the internal agency personnel policies which would implement such decisions. It conceivably could result in the termination of an employee, but would have little or no effect on <em>conditions </em>in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">The FLRA itself apparently recognizes that some claimed violations of the Circular will turn out to be non-grievable, but insists that <em>each claimed violation </em>must in the first instance go to an arbitrator.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under that approach, the arbitrator would decide whether or not the violation is grievable, subject to FLRA review.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The FLRA has flatly refused to supply any guidance as to which parts (if any) of the Circular it thinks might be grievable. The EEOC sought such guidance in its petition for reconsideration,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but the FLRA, finding that the request presented no \u201cextraordina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>ry circumstances,\u201d curtly denied it.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Hence, under the FLRA\u2019s construction, <em>every alleged violation of the Circular, the basic purpose of which is to provide SUBSTANTIVE guidance for management decisions regarding contracting-out, must go to an arbitrator.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The FLRA\u2019s cavalier, conclusory treatment of the EEOC\u2019s legitimate request can be seen as an implicit admission that disclosure of the parts it considers <em>might </em>be grievable would amount to such an extreme denial of elementary managerial authority as to make it perfectly obvious that its construction is a plain violation of the intent expressed by Congress. The same conclusion can be reached with respect to the construction adopted by the majority here. The majority\u2019s construction assures that <em>every </em>managerial decision with respect to \u201ccontracting-out,\u201d if questioned, will ultimately be made, not by the agency, but by an arbitrator, subject to very limited review. This results in a complete negation of the intent expressed by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">This interpretation of the grievance procedure offers the union a fertile source of weapons for obstructing or delaying contracting-out decisions, a situation Congress specifically sought to prevent. It is not difficult to visualize what will happen. The union can file a grievance, claiming that one of the technical standards of the Circular (wholly unrelated to working conditions) was not complied with. The claim as to that particular project must go to an arbitrator, who on a case-by-case basis will evaluate it. Assuming that the arbitrator correctly follows the law, the grievance will be denied. The union then will file exceptions to the award with the FLRA, and months \u2014 or, drawing on the experience of the National Labor Relations Board, even <em>years </em>\u2014 later, the FLRA may deny the exceptions. Review in the court of appeals may follow.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">Even if the grievance is eventually denied, and that denial is affirmed, the prolonged litigation will have cast a cloud over the agency\u2019s contracting-out decision, subjected the decision to considerable delay, and wasted valuable agency assets on an essentially frivolous claim. This extraordinary potential for vexatious litigation will significantly infringe upon management\u2019s specifically designated right to make contracting-out decisions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>construction thus fails to comply with Congress\u2019 admonition that Chapter 71 \u201cbe interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient government.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">All of the above was recognized by the union; its apparent goal was to incorporate <em>substantive </em>contracting-out criteria (over which neither it nor management may bargain), into the collective bargaining agreement, which would make them grievable and hence would subject them to arbitral review. The union\u2019s pursuit of this case is utterly inexplicable on any other basis.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Yet the FLRA and the majority hold that contracting out and the other reserved rights <em>already </em>are covered by the grievance mechanism, and that the processes and criteria used by an agency in making contracting-out determinations must be reviewed by arbitrators and the FLRA through that mechanism. For the reasons set forth above, it is my view that such holding is completely contrary to the language of the applicable statutes, drastically undercuts the specific statutory right of management to contract out, and effectively guts the specific reserved limitations that Congress placed on the agency's duty to bargain and the authority of the FLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">I accordingly dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-12\">. The FLRA has previously held that a proposal which purported to bind an agency to the specific terms of Circular A-76 as of the date of the proposal \u2014 thus, in effect, prohibiting the government from subsequently changing the regulation \u2014 was non-negotiable. <em>See </em>National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1167, 6 F.L.R.A. 574, 577 (1981). In the instant case, the language at issue (\"The [agency] agrees to comply with OMB Circular A-76\u201d) can also be read, like that in <em>Local 1167, </em>to require compliance with the <em>present </em>terms of the Circular. The FLRA, however, apparently has interpreted the proposal only to require the agency to comply with the Circular as it is amended from time to time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-20\">. In <em>Department of Justice v.

FLRA, </em>730 F.2d 1534, 1547-48 (D.C.Cir.1984), we affirmed the agency\u2019s decision that a proposal requiring National Guard units to ignore military efficiency when implementing reductions-in-force was <em>non </em>-bargainable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b888-8\">.

FLRA, </em>691 F.2d 553 (D.C.Cir.1982), in which the Authority, with scrupulous concern for the limitations imposed on it by Congress, held that it could <em>not </em>order bargaining over a particular proposal without infringing on management rights. This court deferred to the Authority's interpretation. But that decision does <em>not </em>require us to uphold the Authority\u2019s use of its interpretative power to emasculate specific Congressional restrictions on its authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b889-11\">. Congress did not define the term, \"work project\" in the Act. By analogy to the term \"project works,\u201d however, a \"work project\u201d may be considered to be a project that constitutes a <em>part </em>of the agency\u2019s complete work load. <em>See Ontario Land Dev't &amp; Beach Protection Ass\u2019n v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>FPC, 212 </em>F.2d 227, 232 (D.C.Cir.1954); <em>cf.

If this is, in fact, what the majority is holding, then footnote 12 probably renders the remainder of the majority's opinion \u2014 particularly its discussion of the phrase \"in accordance with applicable laws\u201d \u2014 mere verbiage, because it is crystal clear that \"procedures\u201d for carrying out decisions are not within the management rights clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b890-9\">. The FLRA\u2019s decision in <em>Local 2782 </em>dealt with a proposal for repromoting individuals who had been reduced in grade due to management cutbacks. It was not a case where substantive regulations were involved; the FLRA carefully pointed out, 6 F.L.R.A. at 321, that it involved simply \u201cappropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by management\u2019s exercise of its authority under section 7106(a),\u201d which are negotiable under the explicit provisions of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b890-16\">. This interpretation arguably was advanced by the FLRA in National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1497, 9 F.L.R.A. 151 (1982). In that case, the union proposed that \"[w]ork assignments shall not be in violation of prohibited personnel practices nor any relevant law, rule, or regulation.\" The right to assign work is one of the management rights reserved under \u00a7 7106(a). The FLRA held that since the agency was required to exercise its management rights \"in accordance with applicable law,\u201d a contract provision binding it to do so did not interfere with its rights. 9 F.L.R.A. at 156. Implicit in this determination is the assumption that a violation of the work assignment regulations would fall within the grievance procedure of \u00a7 7121, the same argument relied on in this case; as demonstrated here, this view is at odds with the statutory scheme of the Act. But even assuming that the result in <em>Local 1497 </em>is correct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>it does not control this case. The assignment of work to employees in that case \u2014 unlike the decision to contract out in <em>this </em>case \u2014 arguably <em>does </em>have an impact on \"working conditions,\u201d and hence might fall under the specific definition of \"grievance\u201d in \u00a7 7103(a)(9). <em>See </em>pages 857-858 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">. A statute that defines a term with the phrase \"to mean\u201d is generally restrictive; \"to include\" is generally expansive. The majority's description of the term \"conditions of employment\u201d as \"expansive,\u201d <em>see </em>Maj. at 845, is thus incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">. The majority also notes that the definition of \"grievance\" also includes \"any matter relating to the employment of any employee,\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(9)(B), and then asserts that a violation of substantive contracting-out criteria \"surely falls within this definition.\u201d Maj. at n. 18. But there is nothing \"sure\u201d about it. Again, the Authority has not made this claim and the majority offers no support. I note that under the majority\u2019s apparent reasoning, the <em>very decision to adopt a particular economic formula itself would be grievable, </em>because it might at some time in the future, if implemented, have some effect on employment. There is no indication that Congress intended such decisions to be subject to arbitral review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\">. The majority asserts that even if the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \"working conditions\u201d <em>(see infra </em>) applies, failure to comply with the Circular\u2019s substantive economic guidelines for making contracting-out decisions would nevertheless \"undoubtedly fall under the umbrella of personnel policies or practices.\u201d Not even the Authority in this case has suggested that substantive contracting-out criteria are transmuted into \u201cpersonnel policies or practices\u201d by virtue of the fact that they may at some point have some sort of impact on the continued employment of particular employees. Not surprisingly, the majority offers no support whatever for this extraordinarily broad reading. Had Congress intended the term \"conditions of employment\" to include \"anything which has or may at some time in the future have an impact on the employment of an employee,\" it could easily have said so. It did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b892-8\">. The majority relies on <em>Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>685 F.2d 641 (D.C.Cir.1982), as sanctioning a \u201cbroad\u201d construction of the phrase \"conditions of employment\u201d in the Act. That case, however, involved union proposals relating to (1) registration of employee automobiles, and (2) provision of certain consumer goods to employees in overseas post exchanges. Both provisions fall clearly within the scope of personnel practices and procedures, and neither even remotely interferes with any reserved management right.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">I am unpersuaded by the majority's flat assertion \u2014 it is nothing more \u2014 that Congress' definition of \"working conditions\u201d in one statute simply \"does not apply\" in another statute. Noting that Congress did not elaborate on its definition in the statute\u2019s legislative history, the majority just presumes that it must have meant something different in this statute than it meant when it used the identical phrase in other stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>utes. But the most plausible explanation for the lack of discussion in the legislative materials is that Congress assumed that its use of the words \"working conditions\u201d \u2014 words that it had used previously and which the Supreme Court recognized have a definite, specialized meaning in the labor relations field \u2014 made it unnecessary to waste additional pages of its committee reports illuminating the obvious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\">. I must note that, contrary to the majority's assertion, I do <em>not </em>\"maintain! ] that grievances are restricted to claims involving surroundings and hazards.\u201d <em>See </em>Maj. at n. 18.

Review in the court of appeals is governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(a), which grants review to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-9\">[a]ny person aggrieved by any final order of the Authority <em>other than an order under </em>\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQk\">(1) <em>section 7122 of this title (involving an award by an arbitrator), </em>unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under section 7118 of this title____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, Congress specifically has removed FLRA actions approving or disapprdving most arbitral awards from direct judicial review. (Judicial review may still be available if the FLRA seeks judicial enforcement under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(b).) Without doubting the good faith of the FLRA, I note that should it later attempt to thwart the will of Congress by whittling away specifically reserved management rights through the use of case-by-case arbitration, there may be little the courts can do to correct it. The FLRA\u2019s policy of forcing all alleged violations \u2014 whether ultimately found grievable or not \u2014 to go to an arbitrator in the first instance may effectively shield future decisions plainly inconsistent with the will of Congress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b894-14\">. The EEOC in its brief explains the possible consequences of this kind of substantive review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apu\">[A]n EEOC employee could challenge the agency\u2019s contracting-out decision by arguing that the underlying comparative cost analysis [one of the standards set forth in the Circular] was flawed. If the issue went to arbitration, an arbitrator could decide that the analysis was inadequate under the [Circular\u2019s] guidelines ... and therefore did not justify the Agency\u2019s conclusion that the commercial activity in question could be performed most inexpensively by a private source. The ultimate result could be a ruling sustaining the employee's claim, and requiring the EEOC to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>reconsider its contracting-out determinations after conducting another comparative cost analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Reply Brief for Petitioner at 3-4. Under the majority\u2019s construction of the statute, avoidance of this scenario depends greatly on the good faith of the FLRA in subsequently holding such direct review of substantive decisions to be nongrievable. There is, however, nothing in the decision under review which rules out the possibility that the FLRA may wind up reviewing all such determinations in grievance proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b895-10\">. If, as the majority claims, it is entirely obvious from the statute that violations of the Circular are already grievable as a matter of law, why would the union waste its time, effort, and money in pursuing first the contract proposal and now this action? Even if the EEOC eventually agrees to the proposal \u2014 which would contradict the intent of Congress and which, even under the majority\u2019s construction, the agency obviously is not required to do \u2014 the union\u2019s remedies for violations of the Circular are, under the majority\u2019s construction, exactly the same. It seems absurd to talk of \"bargaining\" over a proposal which the majority believes will impose no cost on the agency and confer no benefit on the employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
