Notably, the Legislature in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20La.%20Acts%20251\">\n    2013 La.

Relator's claims have now been fully litigated in accord with La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.6, and this denial is final. Hereafter, unless he can show that one of the narrow exceptions authorizing the filing of a successive application applies, relator has exhausted his right to state collateral review. The district court is ordered to record a minute entry consistent with this per curiam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Weimer, J., recused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hughes, J., dissents and assigns reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Relator offers five affidavits, three from the victim's family, which recant or call into question trial testimony. Relator argues actual innocence. Without reaching the merits, these affidavits are \"new evidence\" as contemplated by La. C. Cr.
