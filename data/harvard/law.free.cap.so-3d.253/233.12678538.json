Brown\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal involves a tort action between the plaintiff, Jo Schernbeck Hoddinott (\"Plaintiff\"), and the defendant, Reginald Kenning Hoddinott, III (\"Defendant\"). Plaintiff and Defendant were married. Following the finality of their divorce, Plaintiff filed a Petition for Damages against Defendant. Defendant filed a peremptory exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . The district court granted Defendant's exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and dismissed, with prejudice, Plaintiff's tort\n   suit. For the reasons set forth herein, the district court's judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 3, 2013, Defendant filed a Petition for Divorce Pursuant to La. Civ. Code Art. 102 (\"Petition for Divorce\"). In response to the Petition for Divorce, Plaintiff filed, on January 16, 2014, an Answer and Reconventional Demand for 102 Divorce with No Minor Children, Incidental Matter and Injunctive Relief. On August 7, 2014, Plaintiff filed a Supplemental and Amended Answer and Reconventional Demand (\"Amended Reconventional Demand\"). In the Amended Reconventional Demand, Plaintiff sought a divorce from Defendant pursuant to La. C.C. art. 103(4), alleging specific instances of domestic abuse by Defendant during the marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 3, 2014, a Judgment of Divorce was granted on Defendant's Petition for Divorce under Article 102. That same day, a Consent Judgment was entered by the parties and signed by the district court. The Consent Judgment provided for Defendant to pay rehabilitative spousal support in the amount of $4,000.00 per month to Plaintiff for a period of thirty-six months with the stipulation that the rehabilitative spousal support not be terminated, increased, and/or decreased by either party \"for any reason whatsoever.\" Additionally, the Consent Judgment provided in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED\n   </strong>\n   that any claims made pursuant to Art. 103(4) for a divorce based on physical violence and/or Art. 113 for interim support based upon an Art. 103(4) divorce based on physical violence are hereby dismissed with prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED\n   </strong>\n   that any claims made pursuant to Art. 112 and La. R.S. 9:327 for final periodic spousal support based upon domestic abuse are hereby dismissed with prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 27, 2015, Plaintiff filed a petition seeking damages under La. C.C. art. 2315 (\"the Petition\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Petition set forth specific instances of domestic abuse during the marriage including those set forth in the Plaintiff's Amended Reconventional Demand. Plaintiff asserted that because of Defendant's actions, she suffered intentional infliction of emotional distress. Specifically, Plaintiff alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [S]he has suffered severe emotional mental distress and numerous physical injuries as a result of the acts of domestic abuse and violence, controlling behavior and intimidation ... including but not limited to bruises to her neck, back and arms, open wounds to her arms and legs, severe migraine headaches, depression, anxiety and PTSD and is entitled to recover special and general damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff prayed for damages including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 past, present, and future psychological and medical treatment and expenses;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 general and compensatory damages for physical pain and suffering;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 damages for emotional, financial, and sexual abuse; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 damages for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 18, 2016, Defendant filed a peremptory exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , and a hearing was held on July 22, 2016\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   On July\n   28, 2016, the district court rendered judgment in favor of Defendant, granting the exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and dismissing the Petition with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff timely appealed, and this Court, in a prior opinion, held that Defendant failed to properly introduce the record of the lawsuit and the underlying judgment on the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <em>\n    Hoddinott v.

As a result, this Court vacated the judgment granting the exception and remanded the matter to the district court. On remand, a hearing was held on June 2, 2017. At the hearing, the entire record of the divorce proceedings was introduced by Defendant and admitted into evidence by the district court. Following the hearing, the district court granted the exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , and rendered judgment on June 6, 2017. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, Plaintiff essentially makes two arguments-the district court erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing, and the district court erred in granting the exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    APPLICABLE LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The standard of review of an exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   requires an appellate court to determine if the trial court's decision is legally correct or incorrect.\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Sup'rs of Louisiana State Univ. v.

At the time of this suit, La. C.C art. 103, as amended in 2014, allowed, except in the case of a covenant marriage, a divorce to be granted on the petition of a spouse upon proof that the other spouse \"physically or sexually abused the spouse seeking divorce or a child of one of the spouses, regardless of whether the other spouse was prosecuted for the act of abuse.\" Additionally, La. C.C. art. 112(B) allowed a spouse, who had not been at fault prior to the filing of a petition for divorce and had been the victim of domestic abuse committed during the marriage, to be awarded final periodic support or a lump sum award, at the discretion of the court, in accordance with Subpart C of Article 112.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subpart C(9) of Article 112 provided that one of the factors to be considered by the trial court to determine the amount and duration of final support was \"the existence, effect, and duration of any act of domestic abuse committed by the other spouse upon the claimant, regardless of whether the other spouse was prosecuted for the act of domestic violence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Spousal Immunity- La.

La. R.S. 13:4231, amended in 1990 and effective January 1, 1991, codified the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   principle:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Except as otherwise provided by law, a valid and final judgment is conclusive between the same parties, except on appeal or other direct review, to the following extent:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (1) If the judgment is in favor of the plaintiff, all causes of action existing at the time of final judgment arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the litigation are extinguished and merged in the judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (2) If the judgment is in favor of the defendant, all causes of action existing at the time of final judgment arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the litigation are extinguished and the judgment bars a subsequent action on those causes of action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (3) A judgment in favor of either the plaintiff or the defendant is conclusive, in any subsequent action between them, with respect to any issue actually litigated and determined if its determination was essential to that judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   There are two aspects of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   embraced by La. R.S. 13:4231 which this Court has explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Louisiana Revised Statute 13:4231 embraces the broad usage of the phrase \"res judicata\" to include both claim preclusion (res judicata) and issue preclusion (collateral estoppel). Under claim preclusion, a res judicata judgment on the merits precludes the parties from relitigating matters that were or could have been raised in that action. Under issue preclusion or collateral estoppel, however, once a court decides an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision precludes relitigation of the same issue in a different cause of action between the same parties. Thus, res judicata used in the broad sense has two different aspects: 1) foreclosure of relitigating matters that have never been litigated but should have been advanced in the earlier suit; and 2) foreclosure of relitigating matters that have been previously litigated and decided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Maschek v.

C.C.P. art. 425, which also now requires that a party \"shall assert all causes of action arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the litigation.\" The Comments to Article 425 explain that Article 425 was amended at the same time as the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   statute and \"expands the scope\" of the Article to reflect those changes made to the\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   statute and to put \"the parties on notice that all causes of action arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the litigation must be raised.\" Similarly, La. C.C.P. art. 891 was also amended to include the same \"transaction or occurrence\" language, requiring that a petition \"shall contain a short, clear, and concise statement of all causes of action arising out of, and of the same material facts of, the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the litigation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   , 14-0329, 14-330, pp. 20-21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892681\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/156/596/\">\n    156 So.3d at 611-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Louisiana Revised Statute 13:4232 sets forth exceptions to\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   :\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A.

After twelve years of marriage, Mr. Hoddinott filed for divorce. In response, Mrs. Hoddinott filed an amended reconventional demand for a divorce pursuant to La. Civ. Code art. 103(4) and final spousal support pursuant to La. Civ. Code art. 112(B), alleging thirteen incidents of domestic abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As referenced by the majority, a specific and comprehensive statutory scheme has been enacted by the state legislature to address domestic abuse during marriage. Thus, a victim of spousal abuse shall be awarded either final periodic support or a lump sum award based on relevant factors,\n   including \"[t]he existence, effect, and duration of any act of domestic abuse committed by the other spouse upon the claimant, regardless of whether the other spouse was prosecuted for the act of domestic violence. La. Civ. Code art. 112(C)(9). In the absence of a criminal conviction evidencing domestic abuse, the district court makes a determination regarding the existence and nature of domestic abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. Rev. Stat. 9:327(B). In this case, rather than litigating the issue of spousal abuse, the parties chose to enter into a consent judgment wherein Mrs. Hoddinott dismissed with prejudice any claims made for a divorce based on physical violence and domestic abuse and Mr. Hoddinott agreed to pay $4000 per month in rehabilitative spousal support for thirty-six months. The consent judgment provided in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED\n   </strong>\n   that\n   <strong>\n    REGINALD K.

A consent judgment was reached wherein the spousal abuse claims were dismissed with prejudice, without a reservation of rights to bring another action. After the divorce was finalized, the Plaintiff filed a petition for damages alleging the same instances of abuse set out in the Art. 103(4) divorce petition and four\n   additional incidents that occurred prior to the signing of the consent judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \"Res judicata is an issue and claim preclusion device found both in federal law and state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Terrebonne Fuel &amp; Lube, Inc. v.

Moreover, despite the interspousal immunity doctrine, the cause of action in tort existed at the time of the signing of the consent judgment and involves the same claims asserted in the Art. 103(4) divorce petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, without the application of an exception to\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , the subsequent suit was barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under these circumstances, the trial court was not manifestly erroneous in granting the defendant's exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, I dissent from the majority and would affirm the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   I concur in the conclusion that the trial court erred in granting the peremptory exception of res judicata. In my opinion, however, the majority's focus on there being an exceptional circumstance under La. R.S. 13:4232A(1), barring the exception of res judicata, is misplaced. In my opinion, we need only look to our jurisprudence on the elements of res judicata to determine that all elements are not present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court, in\n   <em>\n    Schiff v. Pollard\n   </em>\n   , 16-0801, pp. 9-10 (La.

R.S. 13:4231, \"a second action is precluded by res judicata when all of the following elements are satisfied: (1) the judgment is valid; (2) the judgment is final; (3) the parties are the same; (4) the cause or causes of action asserted in the second suit existed at the time of the final judgment in the first litigation; and (5) the cause or causes of action asserted in the second suit arose out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the first litigation.\" (Citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Here, all elements of res judicata are not present; more specifically, absent is a\n   showing that the cause of action in the second suit arose out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject of the first litigation. There can be no question that the first suit was strictly a suit for divorce and matters related to the divorce (spousal support). It commenced with the September 3, 2013 filing by Mr. Hoddinott of a Petition for Divorce pursuant to La. C.C. art. 102, which provides for a divorce based on the parties' having lived separate and apart for the requisite time period. Ms. Hoddinott responded by filing a Reconventional Demand by which she, too, sought a divorce on Article 102 grounds, but also under La. C.C. art. 103(4), which provides for a divorce when,\" [d]uring the marriage, the other spouse physically or sexually abused the spouse seeking divorce or a child of one of the spouses, regardless of whether the other spouse was prosecuted for the act of abuse.\" It is clear that the Reconventional Demand sought one goal - to obtain a divorce from the defendant. The specific allegations of abuse cited in the Reconventional Demand did nothing more than set forth the grounds upon which the plaintiff sought a fault-based divorce. Nothing in the Reconventional Demand suggests that the plaintiff was asserting a cause of action sounding in tort or a demand for damages based on her alleged injuries (mental and physical).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   When the parties entered into the Consent Judgment, it is clear that they were resolving their claims strictly with respect to the divorce and for the plaintiff's claims for support. In fact, as the first matter was filed and pending in the Domestic Relations Section of the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans pursuant to La. R.S. 13:1138, there was no jurisdiction for the trial court to hear a tort claim (or for there to be a jury trial). Moreover, there is nothing in the Consent Judgment which even mentions tort damages resulting from the alleged abuse which took place during the marriage. Accordingly, in my opinion, the cause of action in the second suit, sounding in tort, was not \"the subject matter of the first litigation\" (for divorce). On this basis, the trial court erred in granting the exception of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Although I agree the trial court's judgment should be reversed, I would reach that result by finding the September 3, 2014, Consent Judgment does not encompass the tort claim asserted by Jo Schernbeck Hoddinott against her former husband, Reginald Hoddinott, III.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the trial court's ruling, granting Mr. Hoddinott's peremptory exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , is based on the finding that the Consent Judgment includes the tort claim because there was no reservation of rights to bring the tort claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The governing principle here is that \"[a] compromise precludes the parties from bringing a subsequent action based upon the matter that was compromised.\" La. C.C. art. 3080. A peremptory exception of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   is the proper procedural mechanism to assert the defense that a suit is barred by a compromise agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

The trial court, agreeing with Mr. Hoddinott, cited Ms. Hoddinott's failure to include in the Consent Judgment an express reservation of her right to file a tort claim.

He emphasized that, under the terms of the Consent Judgment, he agreed to pay Ms. Hoddinott $4,000.00 per month in rehabilitative spousal support for a period of thirty-six months ($144,000.00 payable over three-years), which could not be terminated, increased, or decreased by either party for any reason whatsoever, in exchange for Ms. Hoddinott's dismissal of her claims based on physical violence and domestic abuse with prejudice. Mr. Hoddinott contended that he would receive no benefit from the Consent Judgment if the parties had intended to allow Ms. Hoddinott to assert a tort claim seeking damages for the exact same alleged injuries. Thus, he contended that a review of the terms of the Consent Judgment established that the parties intended to preclude any future litigation of the abuse allegations.
