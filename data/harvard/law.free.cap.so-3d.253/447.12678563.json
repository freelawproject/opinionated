On March 4, 2015, the Court of Criminal Appeals remanded this case to the circuit court, by order, for that court \"to appoint a different court reporter to transcribe the guilt-phase jury instructions and to transcribe a supplemental/corrected transcript of the Court.\"\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   WINDOM, Presiding Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Court's opinion of June 13, 2014, is withdrawn, and the following opinion is substituted therefor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Tawuan Townes appeals his conviction for capital murder and his sentence of death. Townes was convicted of murder made capital for intentionally killing Christopher Woods during the course of a burglary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(4), Ala.Code 1975. The jury, by a vote of 10-2, recommended that Townes be sentenced to death. The Houston Circuit Court accepted the jury's recommendation and sentenced Townes to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Townes had plans to rob Woods, a known drug dealer. Woods lived in a house in Dothan with his girlfriend, India Starks. On November 13, 2008, Townes and Cornelius Benton drove to Woods's house. Townes was armed with a .22 caliber rifle, and Benton was armed with a .380 caliber pistol that belonged to Townes's brother. Townes and Benton wore dark clothing and obscured their faces to conceal their identities. Townes also wore a toboggan cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Around 2 p.m., Starks heard Townes and Benton bang on the door, and, as Woods looked outside, they kicked open\n   the door and entered the house. Woods said, \"Please don't do this.... Man, don't do this. Please don't do this.\" (R. 437.) Woods backed away and sat in a chair, at which point the men \"told him to shut up and just tell [us] where it's at.\" (R. 437.) As Woods begged for his life and Starks's life, Benton repeatedly hit him in the face to force Woods to give them money. Townes shot Woods in the chest with the .22 caliber rifle and Benton continued to hit Woods. Benton then shot Woods in the leg, after which he resumed hitting Woods in the face and demanding money. Starks heard Woods screaming and begging, \"Man, don't do this.\" (R. 450.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Woods was shot the second time, Starks ran to a neighbor's house to telephone emergency 911. As Starks was escaping, one of the men asked, \"Where you going, bitch?\" (R. 451.) While Starks was on the telephone with emergency 911, she saw the two men leave. Starks went back to Woods's house to attend to Woods. According to Starks, the room where the attack occurred was ransacked, Woods was slumped over in the chair, and her cellular telephone was missing. Woods died as a result of the bullet wound to the chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Townes was arrested, he was in possession of the SIM card from Starks's cellular telephone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Townes was arrested, he gave a statement to police officers. In his statement, Townes admitted that he and Benton went to Woods's house to rob Woods because Townes needed money. Townes, however, adamantly denied intending to kill Woods. Townes stated that he intended to scare Woods when he shot the .22 caliber rifle and that the rifle used only \"little bullets.\" (C. 500.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After hearing closing arguments of counsel and being instructed on the law by the circuit court, the jury convicted Townes of murder made capital because it was committed during the course of a burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \" 'When evidence is presented ore tenus to the trial court, the court's findings of fact based on that evidence are presumed to be correct,'\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Perkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7439236\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/646/46/#p47\">\n    646 So.2d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (Ala.1994) ; '[w]e indulge a presumption that the trial court properly ruled on the weight and probative force of the evidence,'\n   <em>\n    Bradley v.

Specifically, Townes argues that the circuit court erroneously instructed the jury that \" 'intent must be inferred if the act was done deliberately and death was reasonably to be apprehended or expected as a natural and probable consequence of the act.' \" (Townes's brief, at 12 (quoting R. 824).) According to Townes, the circuit court's instruction created a mandatory presumption on the issue of specific intent, relieved the State of its burden to prove intent, and violated Townes's right to due process. Townes did not raise this argument below; therefore, this issue will be reviewed for plain error only. Rule 45A, Ala.

Specifically, Townes argues that the State improperly admitted .45 caliber bullets, a magazine for a .45 caliber pistol, and handwritten rap lyrics. According to Townes, the .45 caliber bullets, magazine, and lyrics were not connected to Woods's murder; therefore, they were irrelevant. Townes also argues that the items were admitted to show his bad character in violation of Rule 404, Ala. R. Evid. Townes further argues that, during the guilt phase, the prosecutor improperly commented on the .45 caliber bullets to show Townes's bad character. He argues that, during the penalty phase, the prosecutor improperly used the rap lyrics to show Townes's bad character. Townes did not object to the introduction of the contents of his backpack at trial or to the prosecutor's comments; therefore, these issues will be reviewed for plain error only. Rule 45A, Ala. R.App. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   During the guilt phase of the trial, the State admitted a backpack and its contents that were seized from property Townes had been storing at Beverly Harris's house. Townes had lived at Harris's house. The contents of the backpack were described as, among other things, a fully loaded magazine for a .45 caliber pistol, loose .45 caliber bullets, and a writing. During the guilt phase, the writing was never mentioned again. The magazine and bullets, however, were mentioned. During closing argument, the prosecutor stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"How many 18-year-olds do you know they've got .45 caliber clips with bullets this size in their bag where they're staying? But no gun. What happened to the gun? Draw your own inference.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (R. 749.) Later, the prosecutor stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"[D]id you ever hear [the trial attorney] talk about the .45 caliber bullets that were in his backpack? He didn't touch those, did he? He didn't touch those because that does away with that little story that he's poor, poor pitiful little me, had no place to live.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (R. 785.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   During the penalty phase, the prosecutor asked a number of questions about the .45 caliber bullets, such as: \"Would you agree ....45 caliber bullets ... are not the type of bullets, in other words, weapons that a normal 18-year-old would have?\" (Supp. R. 75.) Also, during the penalty phase, Harris stated that she did not recognize the writing as Townes's writing and that Townes never listened to rap music when he was with her. During rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor stated: \"To think, that walks your streets, that has those kind of bullets. You look and read the rap crap that's in here about what's written in his bag.\" (R. 980.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The contents of Townes's backpack do not appear to have been relevant in the guilt or penalty phases of Townes's trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 401, Ala. R. Evid. (\" 'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"); \u00a7 13A-5-45(d), Ala.Code 1975 (\"Any evidence which has probative value and is relevant to sentence shall be received at the sentence hearing regardless of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence, provided that the defendant is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut any hearsay statements.\"). Nothing in the record indicates that the .45 caliber bullets and magazine or the rap lyrics were connected in any manner to Woods's murder. Thus, Townes's possession of those items did not have a \"tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Rule 401, Ala. R. Evid. Because evidence indicating that Townes possessed .45 caliber bullets, a magazine for those bullets, and rap lyrics was not relevant, it was inadmissible and should not have been the subject of comment by the State. Rule 402, Ala. R. Evid.; \u00a7 13A-5-45(d), Ala.Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although evidence relating to Townes's possession of the items in his backpack was irrelevant, any error in its admission was harmless and did not rise to the level of plain error. Rule 45A, Ala. R.App. P. Townes argues that evidence relating to his possession of the items showed bad character and a criminal propensity. However, the jury was well aware of Townes's bad character and propensity for violent crime without considering the items seized from the backpack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In his statement, Townes admitted that he was the mastermind who planned the robbery and burglary. Townes admitted that he had obtained one of the guns used during the commission of the crime. He admitted to the violent torture of Woods in an attempt to compel Woods to reveal where he had hidden his property. Starks also testified to Townes's participation in the violent acts against Woods. Townes fully admitted his use of a firearm during the commission of a violent felony. During his statement, Townes also informed the police officers of his willingness to kill during a robbery. While attempting to explain that he did not receive any proceeds from the crime and did not intend to kill Woods at the particular moment at which he was killed, the following occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"[Townes]: ... We didn't get nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"[Officer]: Why, you couldn't find it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"[Townes]: Yea, because ... when [Benton] had already shot [Woods], that when [Woods] just stopped saying some'em. And I already know so I was like man, You ain't supposed to shot or anything. If you gonna rob somebody, you supposed to rob 'em and\n   <em>\n    then [kill] 'em.\n   </em>\n   When they tell you where it's at\n   <em>\n    you can decide to kill 'em or not kill 'em.\n   </em>\n   But he shot before we even could get anything.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (C. 501.) Thus, the jury was well aware of Townes's propensity toward violent and deadly criminal acts. The only question before the jury was whether Townes intended to kill Woods when he shot Woods in the chest or whether, at that time, he merely intended to scare Woods and would decide whether to kill him later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

The lack of a date on the photograph coupled with the manner in which the photograph was introduced suggested that it was taken when McNabb was arrested for the present crimes and it did not imply that McNabb had a prior criminal record.

Rather, the mug shot appeared on its face to have been taken when Townes was arrested for the current charge. The prosecutor stated that the mug-shot photograph depicted \"how Tawuan Townes looked on the day of the burglary and the capital murder.\" (R. 367.) Further, the State presented evidence indicating that the mug-shot photograph was taken the morning Townes was arrested for Woods's murder. (R. 666.) Thus, the manner in which the mug-shot photograph was introduced \"did not draw attention to its source or implications\" but, rather, \"tended to rebut any inference the jury may have gleaned from the photograph that [Townes] had a prior criminal history.\"\n   <em>\n    McNabb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9172537\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/887/929/#p972\">\n    887 So.2d at 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rule 45A, Ala. R.App. P. Consequently, this issue does not entitle Townes to any relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Within this section of his brief, Townes also argues that, during the guilt-phase closing, the State improperly commented on his appearance during the crime, thus, showing his bad character. Townes did not raise this argument at trial; therefore, this Court's review is restricted to plain error only. Rule 45A, Ala. R.App. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   During its guilt-phase closing argument, the State said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \"They robbed him. And robbery is using force against a person, and they beat him. And he begged for his life. That's the testimony. He begged and he begged and he begged. And what did they do?

Hey, bitch, where you going. That's the kind of cowards they are. Big, tough men with weapons against a man who's defenseless and a woman. He ain't so tough in this courtroom today. And he sure looks a lot different, whole-heartedly.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (R. 764-65.) Later, during the State's closing argument, it highlighted evidence indicating that Townes set out to scare and rob Woods and that he intentionally killed Woods. During that argument, the State said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \"[Townes said to Stark,] where you going, bitch? That's what he said. That's what he said.

Townes, however, has not directed this Court to any law prohibiting the State from commenting on a defendant's attempt to intimidate his victim by his appearance and actions during the crime. Nor has he cited any law prohibiting the State from contrasting a defendant's calm, docile appearance at trial to his violent behavior and intimidating appearance during the commission of the offense. Further, the jury was well aware of the difference between Townes's appearance during the commission of the offense and during the trial. At trial, the jury could see Townes. The State admitted the video of Townes's statement at the time of his arrest that showed his appearance shortly after the commission of the offense. Additionally, Townes's statement and Stark's testimony painted a vivid picture of Townes's appearance during the commission of the crime, i.e., his hair, his clothes, his bandanna, and his weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Thus, the jury was well aware, without the State's comments, that Townes did not appear at trial as he did during the commission of the crime. Here, the prosecutor's comments contrasting Townes's behavior and appearance in court with his behavior and appearance during the crime were harmless. \"[T]he jury us[ing] its common sense,\"\n   <em>\n    Sattari v.

Specifically, Townes argues that the State presented evidence establishing that he had gotten a haircut before his trial and improperly commented on the change in Townes's appearance. According to Townes, evidence and comments relating to his haircut amounted to comments on his decision not to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   At trial, the State presented evidence that Townes had gotten a haircut during the time between the commission of the offense and the trial. During closing argument, the prosecutor stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \"I want you to remember when you deliberate this case that-who is the one in this courtroom that changed his appearance, how he looked on November the 13th, 2008, what he was wearing, and what he had planned to do before Cornelius Benton ever entered the picture?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   (R. 747-48.) The prosecutor also made the following comment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"So as you see him sitting in the courtroom today, that's not how he was that day.

Specifically, Townes argues that the State \"used [its] peremptory strikes to remove all but one of the qualified African Americans from the venire.\" (Townes's brief, at 43.) He further argues that the State targeted African-American veniremembers for questioning and that the African-Americans struck by the State shared only this one characteristic-their race-and in all other respects they were as heterogeneous as the community as a whole. Finally, Townes asserts that the Houston County District Attorney's Office has a history of racial discrimination.

Initially, this Court notes that both Townes and Woods were African-American. After the veniremembers were struck for cause or excused, eight African-Americans were qualified to serve on the jury. The State used 5 of its 20 peremptory challenges to remove African-Americans, leaving 3 on the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel struck two African-Americans. The State's use of 5 of its 20 peremptory challenges to remove 5 of 8 African-Americans from the venire, did not, without more, establish an inference of racial discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

For instance, D.S., an African-American struck by the State, equivocated regarding his feelings on the death penalty, possibly knew the victim, and had been arrested for theft. J.S., another African-American struck by the State, had a brother who had been arrested on drug charges. J.S. and B.W. both knew witnesses in the case. Further, T.T. indicated that she had an appointment with a doctor that conflicted with the trial. When asked after striking the jury whether he wanted to raise a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   objection, defense counsel stated: \"With regard to race, there was something in the record for every one ... of them.\" (R. 341.) The following day, defense counsel again stated that the defense did not want to raise a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   objection. The court asked defense counsel if they agreed \"there were legitimate reasons for any strikes,\" and defense counsel agreed. (R. 360.) Defense counsel, who observed the jurors throughout voir dire, then stated: \"As far as the African-American strikes, we believe there's a record of-I mean there is a reason on the record from the voir dire for each strike.\" (R. 361.) Consequently,\n   the record does not establish that the African-Americans struck by the State \"share[d] only this one characteristic-their [race]-and [were] in all other respects ... as heterogeneous as the community as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Branch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7556043\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/526/609/#p622\">\n    526 So.2d at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Further, the record does not support Townes's argument that the State targeted African-Americans for questioning during voir dire. The State asked questions of African-Americans and other races alike. Many of the jurors to whom the State directed questions are identified only as potential jurors. The State questioned African-Americans and other races regarding their feelings on the death penalty. The questions asked by the prosecutor were not designed to provoke responses from American-Americans and not other races. And the questions asked by the prosecutor were not designed to elicit disqualifying responses from African-Americans but not other races. There is no indication in the record that the State treated African-Americans differently than it treated other races during voir dire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Further, Townes does not argue and the record does not indicate that there was any \"[d]isparate treatment of members of the jury venire with the same characteristics, or who answer a question in the same or similar manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Branch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7556043\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/526/609/#p622\">\n    526 So.2d at 622-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no indication that the State struck African-Americans for a reason but left an individual of another race to whom that reason applied on the jury. Additionally, there does not appear to be a pattern to the State's use of its peremptory challenges against African-Americans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Finally, Townes asserts that the Houston County District Attorney's Office has a history of using its peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner. This factor, however, does not establish an inference of discrimination in this case. As this Court stated in\n   <em>\n    McCray v.

Accordingly, although the Houston County District Attorney's Office has a history of using its peremptory strikes in an improper manner, this factor, based on the passage of time, does not establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    McCray,\n   </em>\n   the Houston County District Attorney's Office's distant history of using peremptory challenges improperly to remove African-Americans does not, 17 years later, establish an inference that it currently discriminates based on race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In sum, the State's number of peremptory strikes against African-Americans does not raise an inference of discrimination. And nothing in the record-from the type and manner of questions asked to the State's use of its strikes-indicates that the State treated African-Americans disparately. Further, defense counsel assured the circuit court that the State had not used its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. Based on the record and defense counsel's assurance, this Court cannot say that plain error resulted from the circuit court's failure\n   to sua sponte require the State to give its reasons for striking African-American veniremembers. Therefore, this issue does not entitle Townes to any relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Townes next argues that the circuit court improperly granted the State's for-cause challenge to prospective juror J.P. based on J.P.'s opposition to the death penalty. Townes concedes that, during \"the judge's general voir dire, J.P. initially indicated that he could not impose the death penalty\" and that J.P. informed the circuit court that he could not put his personal opinions aside and recommend a sentence of death. (Townes's brief, at 52-53.) Townes, however, argues that, when questioned individually, J.P. indicated that he could recommend a sentence of death in some circumstances. Therefore, the circuit court erroneously granted the State's challenge to J.P. Townes did not object to the removal of J.P.; therefore, this issue will be reviewed for plain error only.

Although\n   the State mentioned Townes's decision to plead not guilty, it appears that the State did so in an attempt to convey the message that the State had proved Townes's guilt, not to have the jury penalize Townes for pleading not guilty or to consider Townes's plea as a sentencing factor. Thus, the State was not, as Townes argues, asking the jury to recommend a harsher penalty because he pleaded not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Further, the circuit court properly instructed the jury on the factors it could consider during the penalty phase and the process of weighing those factors. The circuit court's instructions allowed the jury to consider only three aggravating circumstances and did not permit the jury to consider Townes's decision to plead not guilty in deciding whether to recommend a sentence of death.\n   <em>\n    Hyde v.

In support of his argument, Townes asserts that the State improperly admitted testimony from Martha Rawls, Woods's mother, indicating: 1) that she last spoke with Woods on the Monday before he was murdered and, during their last conversation, Woods and his mother both had said, \"I love[ ] you,\" ( R. 401 ); and 2) that she had to bury her son. Townes also argues that the State improperly had Rawls identify Woods from his autopsy photograph. Finally, Townes argues that, during the guilt-phase opening statements and closing statements, the State improperly commented on the fact that Woods and his mother told each other that they loved one another. According to Townes, Rawls's testimony and the State's comments constituted improper victim-impact testimony and should not have been admitted in the guilt phase of the trial. Thus, Townes asserts that he is entitled to a new trial. Townes did not object to Rawls's testimony or the State's comments at trial; therefore, this issue will be reviewed for plain error only.

Our review of the record indicates that Rieber's attorneys did not object to Mr. Craig's brief references to Ms. Craig's children or ask him any questions on cross-examination. The trial court clearly instructed the jury that it had to determine, based on all of the evidence, whether Rieber had robbed and killed Ms. Craig. The jury was instructed that it could not find Rieber guilty unless the prosecutor had established his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury was also instructed not to let sympathy or prejudice affect its verdict. We caution prosecutors that the introduction of victim impact evidence during the guilt phase of a capital murder trial can result in reversible error if the record indicates that it probably distracted the jury and kept it from performing its duty of determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant based on the admissible evidence and the applicable law. However, after examining the record in its entirety, we conclude that the aforementioned portions of Mr. Craig's testimony, although they should not have been permitted, did not operate to deny Rieber a fair trial. It is presumed that jurors do not leave their common sense at the courthouse door. It would elevate form over\n   substance for us to hold, based on the record before us, that Rieber did not receive a fair trial simply because the jurors were told what they probably had already suspected-that Ms. Craig was not a 'human island,' but a unique individual whose murder had inevitably had a profound impact on her children, spouse, parents, friends, or dependents (paraphrasing a portion of Justice Souter's opinion concurring in the judgment in\n   <em>\n    Payne v.

To support his argument, Townes points to the following portion of the circuit court's jury instructions: \"And what's the difference between capital murder and felony murder? An intentional killing.\" (R. 832.) According to Townes, instructing the jury that an intentional killing distinguishes capital murder from felony murder failed to inform the jury that Townes had to have the specific intent to kill and allowed the jury to convict him of capital murder based on his accomplice's intent.

R.App. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Townes's argument that the circuit court's jury instructions allowed the jury to find him guilty of capital murder without finding that he had the specific intent to kill is refuted by the record and is without merit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

During its instructions on the elements of capital murder, the circuit court informed the jury that to find Townes guilty of capital murder, it had to find that he \"intended to kill [Woods].\" (R. 820.) The circuit court instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   \"[A] person acts intentionally when it is his purpose to cause that death-cause the death of another person. The intent to kill must be real and specific.... [So the State must prove] that in committing the act which caused the death of Christopher Woods, the defendant intended to kill the deceased.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   (R. 821.) The circuit court later detailed specific intent, again instructing the jury that \"capital murder requires a specific intent, a specific intent to kill.\" (R. 823.) The circuit court then instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   \"Intention in regard to murder should mean that a person acted intentionally with respect to a particular result, that is, death. The defendant must intentionally, as opposed to negligently or accidentally or recklessly, cause the death of the deceased in order to invoke the capital murder statute. The fact that someone dies or is killed during the course of a burglary does not automatically prove the intent. The intent to kill must be real and specific in order to invoke the capital murder statute.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   (R. 823-24.) The circuit court informed the jury that it may infer intent from the facts surrounding the crime \"[b]ut the facts upon which such inference is drawn must be proved so clearly as to leave\n   <em>\n    no reasonable doubt\n   </em>\n   in the minds of the jury that on the occasion complained of,\n   <em>\n    the defendant intended to kill Christopher Woods\n   </em>\n   .\" (R. 824.)

Because the circuit court repeatedly instructed the jury that it could not find Townes guilty of capital murder unless the State proved that Townes had the specific intent to kill, this issue is refuted by the record and does not rise to the level of plain error.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6929381\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/142/732/#p751\">\n    142 So.3d at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to Townes, the fact that he had a bag of marijuana in his pocket when he was arrested 14 hours after Woods's murder was irrelevant to the crime for which he was being tried. Therefore, the State admitted evidence regarding\n   his possession of marijuana to show that he had bad character in violation of Rule 404(b), Ala. R. Evid. Townes further argues that the circuit court failed to give a limiting instruction regarding how the jury should consider the fact that he possessed marijuana; therefore, he is entitled to a new trial. The State, on the other hand, argues that Townes admitted that he went to rob Woods because Woods was a drug dealer; therefore, evidence that Townes possessed marijuana shortly after Woods's murder was relevant to show motive. The State also argues that the circuit court did not err by failing to give the jury a limiting instruction because the collateral-bad-act evidence did not involve a conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   At trial, the State presented evidence indicating that Woods had marijuana in his house. (R. 792.) Because the bag of marijuana was found in a pocket of the same pair of Townes's pants in which the SIM card from Starks's cellular telephone was found, the State and the circuit court believed that the bag of marijuana was proceeds of the burglary. The State presented evidence relating to the marijuana as if it was proceeds of the burglary. (R. 769.) Townes, however, argues that the bag of marijuana was not proceeds of the burglary; therefore, its admission was improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   This Court need not decide whether the State proved that the bag of marijuana was proceeds of the burglary, rendering it admissible, or whether the failure to give a limiting instruction was error because, even if they were errors, those \"error[s] did not affect the outcome of the proceeding and, thus, w[ere] harmless.\"\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   During the penalty phase, Townes presented testimony from Harris. The State sought to cross-examine Harris regarding conversations she had with Townes while he was incarcerated. While questioning Harris about her conversations with Townes, the State, on multiple occasions, sought to use recordings of those conversations. On each occasion, Townes objected to the State's use of the recordings on the ground that the recordings had not been provided in discovery. The circuit court sustained each of Townes's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   After the State again sought to use the recording of one of the conversations, the circuit court ordered the parties to approach the bench. It then questioned the State regarding why it had not provided the recordings to the defense. The State asserted that it had not disclosed the recordings because Harris was not a State's witness and the recordings were to be used only to impeach her. The Court then ordered the State to turn the recordings over to defense counsel. Defense counsel asked for and was given a recess to listen to the recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   After listening to the recordings, defense counsel objected to the State's use of recordings, arguing that the State sought to use what Townes said on the recording in support of nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. The State argued that it sought to use the recordings for, among other reasons, impeaching Harris with what she had said to Townes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   After considering the arguments, the circuit court ruled that the State could not play the recordings in front of the jury and could not ask Harris about statements Townes had made to her. It further ruled that the State could ask Harris about her prior statements-those statements contained in the recording-if the statements she made showed bias or could be used to impeach her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   This Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-314\">\n   \"[W]e view any failure to comply with the discovery rule, Ala.

Similarly, no error occurred when the circuit court sustained defense counsel's objection to the State's attempt to solicit testimony that Townes said he wanted to receive the death penalty if he was found guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   Further, even if the prosecutor's question regarding Townes's statement was improper, it resulted in no prejudice. The prosecutor asked Harris if she remembered Townes saying that he would rather receive a death sentence than life in prison, and she replied, \"No. No.\" (Supp. R. 46.) Thus, there was no evidence presented indicating that Townes said he wanted to receive a death sentence. Rather, the inference from Harris's testimony was that Townes did not say that he wanted a death sentence. Accordingly, any error in the State's question was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reeves v.

Specifically, Townes argues that the following statement by the prosecutor was improper:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-358\">\n   \"I'll tell you the Judge will poll you, but he won't ask your names. He will just ask is that the vote of the jury. Okay?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   (R. 992.) According to Townes, \"the prosecutor's comments impermissibly undermined the jury's sense of responsibility for imposing a death sentence.\" (Townes's brief, at 91.)

In other words, Townes argues that the circuit court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that it may ignore the circuit court's sentencing instructions and the sentencing procedure established in \u00a7 13A-5-46, Ala.Code 1975, and return a verdict recommending\n   life in prison without the possibility of parole for any reason. That is not the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   Section 13A-5-46(a), Ala.Code 1975, establishes that a defendant convicted of a capital offense is entitled to a sentencing hearing before the jury. Section 13A-5-46(d), Ala.Code 1975, provides, in relevant part, \"[a]fter hearing the evidence and the arguments of both parties at the sentence hearing, the jury shall be instructed on its function and on the relevant law by the trial judge.\" Section 13A-5-46(e), Ala.Code 1975, establishes the following weighing process and direction as to how the jury must vote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-371\">\n   \"After deliberation, the jury shall return an advisory verdict as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-372\">\n   \"(1) If the jury determines that no aggravating circumstances as defined in Section 13A-5-49 exist, it shall return an advisory verdict recommending to the trial court that the penalty be life imprisonment without parole;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-373\">\n   \"(2) If the jury determines that one or more aggravating circumstances as defined in Section 13A-5-49 exist but do not outweigh the mitigating circumstances, it shall return an advisory verdict recommending to the trial court that the penalty be life imprisonment without parole;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-374\">\n   \"(3) If the jury determines that one or more aggravating circumstances as defined in Section 13A-5-49 exist and that they outweigh the mitigating circumstances, if any, it shall return an advisory verdict recommending to the trial court that the penalty be death.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   Thus, the legislature has established how the jury must vote depending on the balance of the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004105\" index=\"407\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/96/131/#p210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, under \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-46(d) and 13A-5-46(e), Ala.Code 1975, the circuit court must instruct the jury on the weighing process and how to vote after that process has been completed. The jury is not, as Townes argues, permitted to ignore the law and to reject a sentence of death for any reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   13A-5-46(e), Ala.Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   Because the jury is not free to reject a sentence of death for any reason but must follow the law and recommend a sentence accordingly, the circuit court did not err by refusing to instruct the jury that \"the death penalty is never a required punishment.\" (Townes's brief, at 92.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Therefore, this issue does not entitle Townes to any relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   XXIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   Townes next argues that the circuit court erred by failing to suppress the statement he gave to law-enforcement officers. Specifically, Townes argues that his statement was not voluntarily given because he was 18 years old, he had failed 2 grades in high school, he had to have the term \"education level\" explained to him, he lacked experience with the criminal-justice system, he was lied to regarding his accomplice's confession, and he was offered help if he confessed. According to Townes, each of these factors establishes that his confession was not voluntary. This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   Before admitting Townes's statement, the State presented evidence that Investigator Doug Magill of the Dothan Police Department was assigned to investigate Woods's murder. Investigator Magill and Officer Chris Barbaree interviewed Townes after he was arrested. Before interviewing him, Investigator Magill asked Townes, who was 18 years old and had attended the 10th grade, if he could\n   read, and Townes indicated that he could read.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   After determining that Townes could read, Investigator Magill read Townes his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights from a rights-waiver form. Investigator Magill then gave the rights-waiver form to Townes to read himself. Townes read the rights-waiver form and asked for clarification regarding what was meant by the term \"education\" or \"education level.\" Investigator Magill explained that \"education\" was meant to inquire about the level of school Townes had completed. Investigator Magill then told Townes to sign the rights-waiver form if Townes wanted to speak with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   At that point, Townes signed the rights-waiver form indicating the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-382\">\n   \"[He had] read this statement of [his] rights and [he] underst[oo]d what [his] rights [were]. [He was] willing to make a statement and answer questions. [He did] not want a lawyer at th[at] time. [He] underst[oo]d and kn[e]w what [he was] doing. No promises or threats [were] made to [him] and no pressure of any kind ha[d] been used against [him] to get [him] to make a statement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   (C. 490.) Investigator Magill testified that Townes did not appear to be under the influence of any drugs or alcohol. According to Investigator Magill, no one offered Townes any \"hopes of remuneration, probation, or reward if he would make a statement.\" (R. 639-40.) Investigator Magill stated that no threats, inducements, or promises were made to Townes to get him to give a statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   The State also admitted the video of Townes's statement, which corroborated Investigator Magill's testimony. On the video, Townes appears to be a young, articulate man who answered the police officers' questions appropriately. Townes does not appear to be under undue stress or pressure. The police officers did not threaten Townes or offer him any reward of leniency if he confessed. The video depicts the officers falsely informing Townes that his accomplice, Benton, was in custody and had confessed. Investigator Magill offered \"the help that [he could] offer\" to enable Townes \"to air [his] side of the story ... instead of listening to one side of [the] story where somebody is just trying to throw everything on [Townes].\" (C. 494-95.) However, the police officers did not offer Townes a lesser sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   \"It has long been the law that a confession is\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   involuntary and inadmissible, and that before a confession may be admitted into evidence, the burden is upon the State to establish voluntariness and a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   predicate.\"\n   <em>\n    Waldrop v.

Townes has not offered this Court any basis upon which to hold that lethal injection is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   Because Townes's claim has been rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States, the Alabama Supreme Court, and this Court and because he has not offered this Court any reason to revisit the issue, this issue does not entitle him to any relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   XXIX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 13A-5-53, Ala.Code 1975, this Court is required to address the propriety of Townes's conviction and his sentence of death. Townes was indicted for, and convicted of, one count of capital murder for taking the life of Woods during the course of a burglary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(4), Ala.Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   The record does not reflect that Townes's sentence of death was imposed as the result of the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-53(b)(1), Ala.Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-438\">\n   The circuit court correctly found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. In making this determination, the circuit court found that the State proved the existence of the following two aggravating circumstances: 1) that the capital offense was committed while Townes was engaged in the commission of a burglary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-49(4), Ala.Code 1975; and 2) that the capital offense was committed while Townes was engaged in the commission of a robbery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-49(4), Ala.Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   Regarding mitigating circumstances, the circuit court found and considered the following statutory mitigating circumstances: 1) that Townes had no significant history of prior criminal activity,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-51(1), Ala.Code 1975; and 2) that Townes was a young adult-18 years old-at the time of the offense,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-51(7), Ala.Code 1975. The circuit court also considered the following evidence as mitigating circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-440\">\n   \"Tawuan Townes would have pled guilty to the crime if offered life [in prison] without parole as the sentence. He claims to be remorseful and cooperated with the police. He gave a statement and identified the co-defendant from a police photograph. He states that he asked the co-defendant not to shoot the victim and caused no harm to the girlfriend, India Sparks. He also\n   showed a lack of sophistication. He wanted to go to Mississippi to get his GED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-441\">\n   \"[The] imposition of a death sentence would have a harsh effect on innocent family members. Additionally, he will receive emotional support in prison with a hope of rehabilitation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-442\">\n   \"Defendant's mother was not there for him during much of his life. Tawuan's father left when Tawuan was about 4 years old. His early life was characterized by poverty as the family moved repeatedly, often to run out on the rent. Tawuan suffers from a conduct disorder that began when he was 5 years old. There was a lack of guidance as a youth. He had not seen his mother since he was 15 as she was in prison. Defendant was exposed to domestic violence. At the time of the murder[,] he had no stable place to live. He may also be a father.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-443\">\n   \"Defendant did not have a significant history of problems in jail for the past years and has not been a threat to jail security officers. His behavior was appropriate during trial and he will spend the rest of his life in prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-444\">\n   \"Since the [D]epartment of [C]orrections started keeping records of executions, 75% of all executions were African Americans. Houston County sentences a disproportionate number of African Americans to death. Of those on death row from Houston County, 59% are African American when African Americans make up only 25% of Houston County's population.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-445\">\n   \"It should be noted that there was some evidence of many of these non-statutory mitigators but not all. Additionally, some mitigators require speculation, (e.g., 'hope of rehabilitation' [and] 'may be a father'). The Court considers these non-statutory mitigating circumstances and gives them varying weight. Also, the percentage of African Americans sentenced to death is more of a legal argument than mitigator. This Court has sentenced two black males and one black female to death and two black males to life without paroles. On the other hand, three white males have been sentenced to death and one white male to life without parole.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   (C. 324-25.) The sentencing order shows that the circuit court properly weighed the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances and correctly sentenced Townes to death. The record supports the circuit court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   Section 13A-5-53(b)(2), Ala.Code 1975, requires this Court to reweigh the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances to determine whether Townes's sentence of death is proper. After independently weighing the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances, this Court finds that Townes's death sentence is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-448\">\n   As required by \u00a7 13A-5-53(b)(3), Ala.Code 1975, this Court must now determine whether Townes's sentence is excessive or disproportionate when compared to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Townes was convicted of one count of murder committed during the course of a burglary. Further, the circuit court found as aggravating circumstances that the murder was committed during the course of a burglary and during a robbery. A sentence of death has been imposed for similar crimes throughout this State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.
