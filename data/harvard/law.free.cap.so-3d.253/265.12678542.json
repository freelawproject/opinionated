In 2011, the Mississippi Legislature amended Mississippi Code Section 97-37-7, granting enhanced concealed-carry licensees the privilege of carrying a concealed firearm in the courthouses of this state, save for courtrooms, which the Legislature left within the province of judges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Litigants, witnesses, and family members who do not have enhanced concealed-carry licenses are subject to the general ban found in Mississippi Code Section 97-37-1 (Rev. 2014), which makes carrying a concealed weapon illegal for persons without enhanced concealed-carry licenses. Nonetheless, the three chancellors of the Fourteenth Chancery District, on their own motion, issued a court order prohibiting enhanced concealed-carry licensees from possessing a firearm in and around courthouse buildings of the Fourteenth District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Thereafter, Ricky Ward, an enhanced concealed-carry licensee, filed a petition to modify or dismiss the order. The chancellors issued another order denying Ward's petition and reiterated that enhanced concealed-carry licensees would be prohibited from possessing a firearm in all Fourteenth District courthouses. Ward then filed an Extraordinary Writ of Prohibition in this Court, seeking to have the orders vacated as unconstitutional and in direct conflict with state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. This Court ordered additional briefing, requesting the parties to address the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) What is the authority of judges to exercise control over security issues beyond the four walls of the courtroom itself?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) Whether the judiciary has the inherent authority to exercise control of security extending beyond the four walls of a courtroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (3) Whether Mississippi Code Section 97-37-7(2) prohibits judges from controlling courthouse security. Specifically, what is the definition of \"courtrooms during a judicial proceeding,\" and does that definition either allow or prohibit judges from exercising control of security\n   beyond the four walls of a specific courtroom while court is in session?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (4) If Mississippi Code Section 97-37-7(2) does prohibit judges from exercising control over courthouse security, whether it violates the separation of powers doctrine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4. The Attorney General, National Rifle Association, Attorney Virgil Gillespie, and Chancellor James Persons\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   also filed briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5. Having considered the law and arguments offered by the aforementioned, the Court finds that the orders are facially unconstitutional. Furthermore, the orders defy existing Mississippi statutory and caselaw. Accordingly, the orders are vacated. They are\n   <em>\n    nullius juris\n   </em>\n   -of no legal force.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The orders defy the Mississippi Constitution\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6. Article 1, Sections 1 and 2 of the Mississippi Constitution establish clear lines of demarcation among the three branches of government. Section 1 establishes that the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of our state government are separate and co-equal: \"The powers of the government of the State of Mississippi shall be divided into three distinct departments, and each of them confided to a separate magistracy, to-wit: those which are legislative to one, those which are judicial to another, and those which are executive to another.\" Section 2 provides that no person belonging to one of those departments \"shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others.\" In other words, when the executive branch or legislative branch has been properly delegated a power, the judiciary is without authority to assume that power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7. One of the clearest delegations of legislative power in our Constitution is found in Article 3, Section 12. It provides: \"The right of every citizen to keep and bear arms in defense of his home, person, or property, or in aid of the civil power when thereto legally summoned, shall not be called in question, but the\n   <em>\n    Legislature\n   </em>\n   may regulate or forbid carrying concealed weapons.\" (Emphasis added.) Without equivocation, the Legislature is the branch of government that the citizens of Mississippi chose to regulate or forbid concealed weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8. A plain reading of these provisions in our Constitution renders the orders unconstitutional on their face, for \"no set of circumstances exists under which the [orders] would be valid.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Salerno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    481 U.S. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 745,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2100,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105,1148012\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/95/697/\">\n    95 L.Ed. 2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). \"[T]he key to a successful facial challenge ... is whether [the orders], as [they are] currently written,\n   <em>\n    could never\n   </em>\n   be constitutionally applied and valid.\"\n   <em>\n    Crook v. City of Madison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868033\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/168/930/#p942\">\n    168 So.3d 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 942 (Miss. 2015) (Coleman, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). Applying this standard to the present case, the chancellors' orders, as they currently are written, could never be constitutional. The Mississippi Constitution vests only the Legislature with the authority to regulate or forbid carrying concealed weapons. The orders at issue usurp that power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9. Notwithstanding the clarity of our Constitution and the statute, the chancellors urge this Court to approve their actions as an \"inherent power,\" despite the orders reaching beyond the Constitution. The chancellors cite\n   <em>\n    Newell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9607802\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/308/71/#p72\">\n    308 So.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72 (Miss. 1975), and\n   <em>\n    Hosford v.

While\n   <em>\n    Newell\n   </em>\n   establishes Mississippi courts' \"inherent power,\" it clearly holds such power is limited by the Constitution and separation-of-powers doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9607802\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/308/71/#p72\">\n    308 So.2d at 76-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding the Court's inherent powers emanate from the separation-of-powers doctrine in the Constitution, but also holding that \"[t]he phrase 'judicial power' in [S]ection 144 of the Constitution includes the power to make rules of practice and procedure,\n   <em>\n    not inconsistent with the Constitution\n   </em>\n   ....\") (emphasis added). A review of the Mississippi Constitution, the Code, and caselaw reveals that judges do not have \"inherent power\" to control security beyond their courtrooms or to regulate concealed weapons outside their courtrooms. These powers are nonexistent, for there simply is no language in our Constitution that grants courts such power, and \"this Court must declare the Mississippi Constitution as it is written ....\"\n   <em>\n    In Re Hooker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7012787\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/87/401/#p423\">\n    87 So.3d 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 (Miss. 2012) (Randolph, P.J., dissenting). Turning to the separation-of-powers doctrine, the Constitution specifically vests the Legislature with authority to regulate concealed weapons. The judicial branch therefore is without constitutional authority to exercise that power, for it properly belongs to the Legislature, as mandated by our Constitution. Miss. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11. The chancellors next argue that\n   <em>\n    Hosford\n   </em>\n   provides validity to the orders.\n   <em>\n    Hosford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7560432\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/525/789/\">\n    525 So.2d at 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , this Court was presented with a dispute between the Hinds County Sheriff and the Hinds County Circuit Court that arose from another local court order, which attempted to prescribe several requirements on the sheriff, sheriff's deputies, and bailiffs by which to abide in carrying out their statutory duties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890473\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/158/1117/#p1119\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890473\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/158/1117/#p1119\">\n    at 1125-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Applying the aforementioned constitutional separation-of-powers principles, this Court held that, under Article 5, Section 135 of the Mississippi Constitution, \"[t]he sheriff is a member of the executive branch of government,\" and is \" 'the executive officer of the circuit and chancery court of his county.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890473\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/158/1117/#p1119\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1124 (citing multiple authorities).

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17. The chancellors may have good and noble intentions, and their concerns are well-founded. However, their personal fears and opinions do not trump, and cannot negate, constitutional guarantees. The ultimate outcome of today's issue is reserved for the Legislature, not to be commandeered by unilateral local judicial proclamations. Courts must give more than lip service to the rule of law; they must insist upon its lawful application. Judges cannot allow their sense of superior knowledge, perceptions, or understandings to justify open defiance of the very laws that they are called upon to uphold. Indeed, we have held repeatedly that courts are guardians of the Constitution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   not guardians of the courthouse. Without question, the orders defy existing law and seek to exercise a power that plainly is reserved for the other branches of government. The orders contain no authority to suggest otherwise. The law of Mississippi is clear: enhanced-carry licensees are permitted to possess a firearm in courthouses. No matter how well-intentioned, judges are without the power to limit enhanced concealed-carry licensees' right to carry a firearm beyond courtrooms in the State of Mississippi. The orders are vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18.\n   <strong>\n    VACATED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   COLEMAN, MAXWELL, CHAMBERLIN AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.

I agree with the majority that, while certainly well-meaning, the chancellors' orders prohibiting enhanced concealed-carry licensees from possessing firearms in courthouses of the Fourteenth District are overly broad and facially unconstitutional as applied. Thus, we have no option but to vacate them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20. Article 3, Section 12 of Mississippi's Constitution is crystal clear. Its text expressly delegates to the Legislature the authority to regulate concealed weapons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The right of every citizen to keep and bear arms in defense of his home, person, or property, or in aid of the civil power when thereto legally summoned, shall not be called in question,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     but the Legislature may regulate or forbid carrying concealed weapons.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Miss. Const. art. 3, \u00a7 12 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21. Whether by wisdom or folly, Mississippi's Legislature has exercised its express constitutional power to authorize a small class of concealed-carry licensees to possess firearms in non-courtroom areas of courthouses. While I understand and share some of the chancellors' concerns, neither my own personal observations or experiences, nor those of others, trump\n   <em>\n    express\n   </em>\n   constitutional authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22. I do, however, emphasize that our judiciary has inherent constitutional authority to secure its courtrooms. But the orders here broadly apply to non-judicial hallways, rooms, and offices located within the District's courthouses-areas that by no definition qualify as courtrooms. Further, to the extent the dissenting justices rely on inherent-authority cases from other jurisdictions, they fail to acknowledge a glaring difference between the constitutions of those states and Mississippi's. That prominent distinction is that not one of the cited states has a constitutional provision like Mississippi's-a constitutional provision that expressly authorizes the Legislature to regulate the concealed carry of firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   RANDOLPH, P.J., COLEMAN, CHAMBERLIN AND ISHEE, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23. I agree with the analysis of the majority and its ultimate holding that the Mississippi Constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers require nullification of the orders in question. However, as the Legislature clearly recognized, judges are in control of their courtrooms. Courtrooms (while in session) are specifically excluded from the legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24. A courtroom is not always an easily defined structure. Judges must have discretion in defining the courtroom (i.e., judges' chambers, witness rooms, jury rooms, etc.). Further, the design of some courthouses may still require jurors to exit\n   the main courtroom and travel through a public hallway to the jury room. The same applies to witness rooms. A judge certainly has the right to deem these areas to be part of the courtroom while court is in session.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 25. Though not specifically before us, as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Hosford\n   </em>\n   , judges may have the authority to step outside of the courtroom limitation where the facts of a specific case so warrant.\n   <em>\n    Hosford v.

This is allowed only upon specific findings of such exigent circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26. However, the orders at issue today are merely blanket orders that overstep the authority of the judges and attempt to negate the constitutionally backed legislation. Remote hallways and nonjudicial offices certainly are not courtrooms under any definition of the word. I, therefore, specially concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   RANDOLPH, P.J., MAXWELL AND ISHEE, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.

I do not view a trial court's inherent authority to secure the courtroom expansively.

Factors to be reviewed may include, for example, the number of doors in the courthouse and courtroom, how the public enters the courtroom and courthouse, how the judge's chambers are accessed, how prisoners with court appearances are admitted into the courtroom and where they are held prior to and after court appearances, where witness rooms and jury-deliberation rooms are located in relation to the courtroom, and, finally, whether security resources exist to provide the required physical and electronic security in view of the number of doors and physical layout of the courthouse.

[T]he carrying of a concealed weapon in any Courthouse by any party other than a law enforcement officer in carrying out his/her official business is an unreasonable danger to the public, courthouse and court personnel, and Judges. Courthouses are often places where the business of the public is conducted on a day to day basis and those activities are not inherently more dangerous than other locations. However, courthouses are frequently places where, during court sessions, emotions of family members and litigants are extremely high, whether they are families of victims and/or the accused, in Circuit court or those facing divorce, financial pressures or loss of a child or children in Chancery Court. The possibility of violence or harm at that time is therefore much more likely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The order acknowledged that the law allows a trial judge to restrict the carrying of firearms in a courtroom, but it went on to make specific findings regarding the security of the courthouses of the Fourteenth District:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   ... [A]ll of the six courthouses served by the 14th Chancery District were built and designed many years ago, when one of the main purposes was to make them accessible by many doors and corridors for the convenience of the general public and safety was not the foremost concern. All of those Courthouses have two or more doors and numerous accesses to courtrooms and Judge's chambers within the buildings. It is not cost effective or would it be to secure to the extent necessary for the respective counties to provide security that would be adequate to deter any person intent on doing harm to any other person including Court and Courthouse personnel within the buildings themselves. Many of the doors leading to the courtrooms are mere feet from the Bench, the clerk's table and the witness stand. To allow a person legally to carry a concealed weapon to the courtroom door poses a threat that can not [sic] be deterred before great bodily harm or death could be inflicted inside the courtroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 38. Ricky Ward filed a Petition to Modify or Dismiss Order of the Court in the Fourteenth District, alleging that a court has no jurisdiction to establish security protocols for the courthouses, that as an enhanced license holder he is \"directly\n   impacted\" by the court's order, and that a substantial change in circumstance occurred, and requesting that the court amend or dismiss its November 2011 order in order to conform with the laws of Mississippi. The court dismissed the petition, finding that it simply defined \"courtroom\" and that judges \"have the authority to enter such administrative orders as may be necessary in their estimation for the proper administration of justice, to further the efficiency of the Courts, and to make sure that the legal system is fair and just.\" It noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The seven courthouses of this District were all built many years ago and not designed to properly secure Courtrooms. The litigants, witnesses and families, more often than not, are in the hallways outside of the Courtrooms during most of a trial. These trials include divorces, child custodies, domestic violence and other very emotional and inflammatory issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The court also opined that Ward lacked standing to challenge the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 39. Ward then filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   with this Court, asking this Court to find the order unconstitutional and in direct conflict with statutory law. This Court ordered the chancellors of the Fourteenth District to file an answer to the petition. In their response, the chancellors argue that the courtroom and the courthouse corridors \"must be considered as one common unit, both necessary to meet the ends of justice.

The majority suggests that the phrase \"the Legislature may regulate or forbid carrying concealed weapons\" is a separation of powers provision vesting the Legislature with the sole power to\n   <em>\n    allow\n   </em>\n   concealed weapons in courthouses. Such an interpretation ignores the original intent of this provision, which was to allow the Legislature to restrict and prohibit concealed carry, not to expand it.

Our Constitution protects property rights. Miss. Const. art. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 17. A private citizen may prohibit weapons from his private property.

Yet, as discussed, the original intent of the provision allowing the Legislature to regulate or forbid concealed carry was to restrict and/or prohibit concealed carry of weapons. The majority inexplicably determines that this provisions delegated to the Legislative branch of our government the power to control security of the entire courthouse. Such an interpretation finds no basis in either the plain language of the Constitution or the original meaning of the provision.

Ward does not even attempt to articulate why he needed to carry a weapon into the courthouse to defend his person or property. Thus, Ward does not even provide facts for this Court to determine whether any alleged right has been infringed. Moreover, he does not articulate any prejudice or injustice he suffered by not being allowed to carry a weapon in the courthouse. Constitutional rights are often restricted. For example, when it comes to interpreting the Fourth Amendment's explicit statement that the right to be free against unreasonable searches and seizures \"shall not be violated,\" the majority's interpretation is puzzlingly divergent. This Court has held that constitutional rights, including Fourth Amendment rights, need not be strictly enforced where the person whose rights are violated does not articulate sufficient prejudice or injustice suffered, nor must they be strictly enforced when compelling social interests indicate that they should not be.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Delker v.
