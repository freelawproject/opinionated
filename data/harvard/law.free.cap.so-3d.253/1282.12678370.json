Relator fails to show that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations under the standard of\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). In addition, relator's sentencing claim is not cognizable on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.3 ;\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Melinie v. State\n   </em>\n   , 93-1380 (La. 1/12/96),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441032\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/665/1172/\">\n    665 So.2d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Similar to federal habeas relief,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Louisiana post-conviction procedure envisions the filing of a second or successive application only under the narrow circumstances provided in La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.4 and within the limitations period as set out in La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.8. Notably, the legislature in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20La.%20Acts%20251\">\n    2013 La. Acts 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   amended that article to make the procedural bars against successive filings mandatory. Relator's claims have now been fully litigated in accord with La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.6, and this denial is final. Hereafter, unless he can show that one of the narrow exceptions authorizing the filing of a successive application applies, relator has exhausted his right to state collateral review. The district court is ordered to record a minute entry consistent with this per curiam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Hughes, J., would grant and assigns reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Hughes, J., would grant to order an evidentiary hearing.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
