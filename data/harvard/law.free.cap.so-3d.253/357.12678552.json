After finding that Tammy English was in contempt for failing to pay Richard Davenport lump-sum alimony, the Warren County Chancery Court ordered her to satisfy the arrearage in installments. The chancellor held that English would be incarcerated if she failed to do so. English appeals and claims the chancellor erred by (1) finding her in willful and contumacious contempt of her alimony obligation; and (2) ordering that she would be incarcerated. But it was within the chancellor's discretion to find that English failed to prove that she was unable to satisfy her lump-sum alimony obligation. And English's inability to pay as a defense to incarceration is not properly before us. Thus, we affirm the chancellor's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2.

English was held in contempt after she failed to make the September through November 2012 alimony payments, among other things.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She apparently satisfied that contempt judgment, but she was later found in contempt again after she did not pay alimony from December 2012 through March 2013. She satisfied that judgment after she sold her home to her father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. Next, English failed to pay alimony from September through December 2013. English sold her lake house and became current through January 2014. However, she did not pay any alimony from January to May 2014. On May 13, 2014, the chancellor entered a judgment in Davenport's favor for more than $42,000. The chancellor held that English would be incarcerated if she did not become current on her alimony by May 30, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. In November 2014, the supreme court affirmed the chancellor's divorce judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889162\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/156/231/#p235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889162\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/156/231/#p235\">\n    at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 36).

In March 2015, Davenport filed another contempt petition. At that time, English had not satisfied the previous contempt judgment, and she had failed to pay alimony from June 2014 through February 2015. English responded with an emergency motion to stay an arrest warrant and to modify her alimony obligation. She claimed she was unable to make the lump-sum alimony payments, so she should not be held in contempt. After hearing evidence over the course of three days, the chancellor found no merit to English's request to modify her alimony obligation. The chancellor also found that English was again in contempt. Consequently, the chancellor awarded Davenport a judgment for approximately $114,000. The chancellor held that English had to pay Davenport $50,000 by March 1, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   She then had to pay him another $50,000 on June 1, 2016. The remaining balance was due on August 1, 2016. The chancellor held that English would be incarcerated if she failed to make any of the payments. English also had to continue making alimony payments as they became due. After filing an unsuccessful motion for reconsideration, English appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7. In general, a chancellor has substantial discretion in deciding whether a party is in contempt. The chancellor, who sits in the unique position to observe the parties and their demeanor, the evidence, and the testimony, is infinitely more competent to decide contempt matters than we are. Because contempt is an issue of fact to be decided on a case-by-case basis, these matters are committed to the substantial discretion of the trial court. Therefore, [an appellate court] will not reverse a chancellor's finding where it is supported by substantial credible evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez v.

Instead, she argues that the chancellor should have found that she was unable to satisfy her alimony obligation. A defendant can rebut a prima facie contempt case related to nonpayment of alimony by proving her inability to pay.\n   <em>\n    Doyle v.

A significant portion of the contempt hearing was devoted to scrutinizing English's financial declarations and records. According to English, her net monthly income was approximately $11,600. She claimed her monthly expenses were around $10,800. That figure did not include her alimony obligation, but it also does not account for the fact that Good Samaritan reimbursed English or outright paid for many of her expenses. The chancellor could have reasonably found that English's expenses were not \"necessary ... to continue [her] business\" and she had not been living as economically as possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105268\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/850/122/#p126\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The chancellor also noted that English did not have exclusive access to her accounts. Without detailing every minute expenditure, it was within the chancellor's discretion to find that English spent lavishly on meals and several trips over the course of a year. It was not unreasonable for the chancellor to find that English's expenses were \"out of control.\" The chancellor concluded that English \"ha[d] continued to live as she always ha[d,]\" \"no one appear[ed] to be on any sort of budget[,]\" and everyone\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"just spen[t] at will.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10.

There was substantial credible evidence to support the chancellor's decision that English had not been living as economically as possible and contributing everything she could toward her alimony obligation.

On January 21, 2016, the chancellor entered her \"order of contempt\" and held that English must surrender herself for incarceration if she did not pay Davenport $50,000 by March 1, 2016. The chancellor entered the \"final judgment on petition for contempt\" after English failed to make that payment. Although there is apparently a warrant for English's arrest, the record does not indicate that English is in custody. Be that as it may, English claims that the chancellor should not incarcerate her because she cannot pay Davenport $50,000. English also claims that her incarceration would violate Article 3, Section 30 of the Mississippi Constitution, which provides that \"[t]here shall be no imprisonment for debt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   But our supreme court has held that the \"constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt does not prevent a commitment to prison for nonpayment of alimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Felder\n   </em>\n   , 195 Miss. at 338, 13 So.2d at 827.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12. \"Inability to pay to avoid incarceration is a continuing defense as imprisonment does not accomplish the purpose of the civil contempt decree.\"\n   <em>\n    Vassar v.

Thus, the sums English failed to pay were not support; instead, the sums were meant to divest Davenport of the parties' businesses and assets.

Because I agree with those states that view property-division payments as an obligation within the constitutional prohibitions against imprisonment for debt, I concur with the majority that English may be held in contempt for her failure to pay Davenport, but not that she may be incarcerated.
