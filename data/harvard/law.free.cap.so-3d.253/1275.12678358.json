In order to qualify to serve as a juror, a person must:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   (1) Be a citizen of the United States and of this state who has\n   <strong>\n    resided\n   </strong>\n   within the parish in which he is to serve as a juror\n   <strong>\n    for at least one year\n   </strong>\n   immediately preceding his jury service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (2) Be at least eighteen years of age.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (3) Be able to read, write, and speak the English language and be possessed of sufficient knowledge of the English language.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (4) Not be under interdiction of incapable of serving as a juror because of a mental or physical infirmity, provided than no person shall be deemed incompetent solely because of the loss of hearing in any degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (5) Not be under indictment for a felony nor have been convicted of a felony for which he has not been pardoned by the governor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   B. Notwithstanding any provision in Subsection A, a person may be challenged for cause on one or more of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) A loss of hearing or the existence of any other incapacity which satisfies the court that the challenged person is incapable of performing the duties of a juror in the particular action without prejudice to the substantial rights of the challenging party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) When a reasonable doubt exists as to the competency of the prospective juror to serve as provided for in Code of Criminal Procedure Article 787.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (emphasis added)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The provision has been interpreted to mean to\n   <strong>\n    continuously reside\n   </strong>\n   (\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   one year).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this case a proposed juror under oath testified \"I\n   <strong>\n    reside\n   </strong>\n   in Madisonville.\" Madisonville is in St. Tammany Parish. This trial was held in Orleans Parish. The attorney for the defendant timely objected on the record to the non-qualified juror. No amount of waffling can overcome the plain language of the law. It is the duty of the court to know and enforce the law as written.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
