For the following reasons, we reverse and remand with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   K.S.S., who is the subject of this intrafamily adoption, was born on June 25, 2009 in Roseville, California. On September 10, 2010, K.S.S.'s parents, who were domiciled in California, divorced. That day, although K.S.S.'s parents were granted joint legal custody, L.S.S.M., the child's mother, was given \"90 percent [physical] custody\" and her father, A.L.S., Jr., was granted \"10 percent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.L.S., Jr. remarried in 2013. Almost immediately, L.S.S.M. moved away from California with K.S.S. and, after a few months, ended up in Louisiana. In 2015, L.S.S.M. remarried J.N.M.; the couple is domiciled in Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 22, 2017, J.N.M. and L.S.S.M. filed a petition for intrafamily adoption of K.S.S. in the Twenty-Ninth Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Charles, Louisiana. In response, A.L.S., Jr. filed,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   an answer and opposition to the intrafamily adoption on October 18, 2017. On October 23, 2017, the trial court heard testimony from the child's mother, stepfather, father, and stepmother. After taking the matter under advisement, the trial court terminated A.L.S., Jr.'s parental rights and determined that the adoption was in the best interest of K.S.S. On November 17, 2017, the trial judge rendered a final decree of adoption naming K.S.S. as J.N.M.'s child. From this judgment, A.L.S., Jr. now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   An intrafamily adoption is the adoption of a child by a stepparent or certain other relatives of the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. Ch.C. arts. 1170, 1243. The party petitioning the court for adoption carries the burden of proving a biological parent's consent is not required under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    In re B.L.M.\n   </em>\n   , 13-0448 (La.

However, even upon finding that a parent has lost his right to consent to the adoption, the adoption should only be granted when it is also found to be in the best interest of the child.\n   <em>\n    In re Intra Family Adoption of A.G.T.\n   </em>\n   , 06-805 (La.

The trial court's discretion is not absolute, however, and a determination of the child's best interest is subject to reversal if the record reveals manifest error in the determination.\n   <em>\n    In re B.E.M.\n   </em>\n   , 07-94 (La.

The costs of the representation of the child shall be taxed as costs of court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The language of the statute is mandatory and is not subject to waiver. Further, adoption is a creature of statute and all of the statutory requirements must be strictly carried out.\n   <em>\n    In re T.M.L.\n   </em>\n   , 06-1442 (La. App. 1 Cir. 12/28/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8322333\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/951/364/#p366\">\n    951 So.2d 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366. \"Throughout the Children's Code, independent counsel is typically required for the child in disputed cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8322333\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/951/364/#p366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In a termination of parental rights proceeding like this that will profoundly affect the minor's life, La. Ch.C. art. 1244.1(B) ensures that there is independent representation of the child's interest, free from potential conflicts. We are unpersuaded by appellees' - J.N.M. and L.S.S.M. - argument that appointment of independent counsel was not required because A.L.S., Jr.'s opposition was untimely. First, the trial court's duty to appoint counsel for the minor child is triggered by \"receipt of the opposition.\" The statutory language does not specify a \"timely opposition\" and, thus, does not contain a temporal element. We will not read one into the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   More importantly, a child's individual best interests warrant protection by independent legal representation. A child's fundamental right to independent counsel cannot be waived,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   La. Ch.C. art. 1244.1(B), much less thwarted by any procedural technicality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to appoint independent counsel to represent K.S.S. at all times after the opposition was filed. This fundamental defect necessitates that we reverse the judgment at issue and remand this matter to the trial court for the appointment of independent counsel for K.S.S. for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fox v.
