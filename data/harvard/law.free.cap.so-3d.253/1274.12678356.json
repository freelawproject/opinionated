As Associate Justice Knoll aptly articulated in\n   <em>\n    In re A.J.F.\n   </em>\n   , 00-0948, p.26 (La. 6/30/00),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236232\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/764/47/\">\n    764 So.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62 : \"In manifest error review, it is important that the appellate court not substitute its opinion when it is the [trial] court who is in the unique position to see and hear the witnesses as they testify. The trier of fact is not disadvantaged by the review of a cold record and is in a superior position to observe the nuances of demeanor evidence not revealed in a record.\" Given the standard of review in this case, I agree with the decision to deny this writ.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
