The present appeal stems from a circuit court's judgment dismissing an appeal from county court for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Discerning no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Belmont Holding, LLC, filed a complaint in replevin in the County Court of Jackson County against Davis Monuments, LLC, and Jason Davis, individually. The case proceeded to trial. The county court denied the replevin and entered a final judgment. Aggrieved by the county court's final judgment, Belmont filed a notice of appeal within thirty days of the final judgment. However, Belmont did not pay the cost bond within thirty days of the final judgment as required by Mississippi Code Section 11-51-79 (Rev. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. The Circuit Court of Jackson County, sitting as an appellate court, dismissed Belmont's appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction because Belmont had failed to pay the cost bond within thirty days of the county court's final judgment as required by Section 11-51-79. Belmont appeals, arguing that the circuit court had appellate jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. The overarching issue before the Court is whether the circuit court lacked appellate jurisdiction because Belmont had failed to pay the cost bond within the time period prescribed in Section 11-51-79. Because the circuit court lacked appellate jurisdiction due to Belmont's failure, we affirm the circuit court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. The pertinent procedural history and facts are not disputed. On March 8, 2016, Belmont filed a complaint in replevin against Davis in county court. Davis filed a counterclaim, and the case proceeded to a bench trial on March 28, 2016. On April 5, 2016, the county court entered an order denying the replevin, directing that Belmont immediately return certain property, and dismissing the case with prejudice. On April 12, 2016, Belmont filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59 of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. Belmont requested that the county court issue findings of fact and conclusions of law. On April 28, 2016, the county court entered a final judgment with findings of fact and conclusions of law. Again, the county court denied the replevin and ordered Belmont to restore certain property to Davis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. On May 24, 2016, Belmont filed a notice of appeal. On May 26, 2016, the circuit clerk issued its estimated costs for appeal, which was $374. On the same day, the official court reporter issued its estimated cost for preparing the trial transcript, which was $38. According to Belmont, it paid the cost bond between June 8, 2016, and June 16, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 21,\n   2016, Belmont filed a certificate of compliance. On June 24, 2016, the circuit clerk entered a notation on the docket that $374 had been paid by reference to Belmont's check # 1058.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. On March 8, 2017, Belmont filed its brief in support of its appeal. On May 1, 2017, Davis filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Belmont had failed to pay the cost bond within thirty days of the county court's final judgment. Davis argued that Belmont's failure to pay the appeal bond,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , cost bond,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   within thirty days was a jurisdictional requirement. A hearing was held on June 13, 2017. At the hearing, Belmont argued that it was unable to pay the cost bond on time because the circuit court did not provide its estimate of cost until May 26, 2016. Davis argued that Belmont had a duty under Section 11-51-79 timely to pay the cost bond, regardless of what the clerk had done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. On June 26, 2017, the circuit court entered an order granting Belmont's motion to dismiss. The circuit court found that Davis's failure to post the cost bond within the statutorily mandated thirty days deprived it of jurisdiction. The circuit court found that Belmont had paid the appeal cost (cost bond), to the circuit clerk on June 24, 2016. The circuit court found in pertinent part that Belmont:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   did not file their notice of appeal until May 24, 2016, giving themselves only four days to perfect their appeal by posting a cost bond. By the time the Circuit Clerk provided their estimate, [Belmont] still had two (2) days to pay before time expired. [Belmont] did not pay the Clerk's estimated cost of appeal until almost a month after it was provided, well outside of the statutory period for filing a cost bond. Furthermore, Rule 11 of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure provide[s] that when an appellant is unable to receive an estimate of cost from the clerk then the appellant should calculate the cost of the appeal \"at the statutory rate per page for the approximate number of pages of clerk's papers.\" As both the filing of an appeal and the posting of a cost bond are what give this Court jurisdiction to hear an appeal from County Court under Miss. Code Ann. [\u00a7] 11-51-79, this Court finds that the failure to pay the cost bond within the statutorily mandated thirty (30) days deprives this Court of jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. On July 21, 2017, Belmont filed a motion to reinstate the appeal. Belmont argued that it was entitled to a notice of the deficiency of its appeal from the circuit clerk under Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 2(a)(2). Belmont continued that the failure to give it official notice of the deficiency violated its due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Belmont also argued that Section 11-51-79's requirement of the payment of the cost bond conflicts with Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 3, because Rule 3 provides that timely filing a notice of appeal is the only requirement to perfect an appeal. Belmont argued that, because of the conflict, Rule 3(a) supersedes Section 11-51-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10. On August 18, 2017, the circuit court denied Belmont's motion. The circuit court found that the failure to perfect an appeal by paying a cost bond is not a deficiency as contemplated by Rule 2 of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure. Belmont appeals, raising the following three issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. Whether the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Mississippi [hereinafter \"circuit court\"] erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear Belmont's appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-51-75\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-51-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   as a result of Belmont's failure to pay the [cost] bond within thirty (30) days following the final judgment of the County Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2. Whether the circuit court erred in finding that \"the failure to perfect an appeal by paying a cost bond is not a 'deficiency' as contemplated by [ M.R.A.P. 2 ].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   3. Whether the circuit court deprived Plaintiff of due process by dismissing its appeal for failure to timely pay the [cost] bond without prior formal notice of the deficiencies in its appeal from the clerk of the circuit court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11. The overarching issue before the Court is whether the circuit court erred by determining that it lacked jurisdiction to hear Belmont's appeal because Belmont had failed to pay the cost bond within thirty days of the final judgment entered by the county court. The second and third issues are intertwined and related to the first. As such, the issues will be addressed together.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12. A\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review is applied to questions of law, legal conclusions, and jurisdictional questions.\n   <em>\n    Aladdin Constr. Co. v. John Hancock Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8894803\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/914/169/#p174\">\n    914 So.2d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174 (\u00b6 8) (Miss. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Whether the circuit court had appellate jurisdiction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13. Belmont argues that the circuit court erred by finding that it was deprived of jurisdiction by Belmont's failure to pay the cost bond within the statutorily mandated thirty days because the cost bond prepayment requirement of Section 11-51-79 is superseded by Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure 3(a) and 11(b)(1). We disagree for reasons further explained below. In short, the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure do not supersede the jurisdictional requirements of Section 11-51-79. Even if they did, the Section 11-51-79 requirement comports with the applicable procedural rule, Uniform Rule of Circuit and County Court Practice 5.04, which requires that, in order to perfect an appeal from county to circuit court, the costs of the appeal be paid within thirty days of the entry of the judgment being appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14. Belmont also argues that the circuit court erred by finding that the failure to perfect an appeal by paying a cost bond\n   is not a \"deficiency\" as contemplated by Rule 2 of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure, because a \"deficiency\" under Rule 2 specifically refers to the failure to comply with the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure; and Belmont argues that the payment of a cost bond is governed by Rule 11(b)(1) of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure. Thus, Belmont argues that the circuit court deprived it of due process by dismissing its appeal for failure timely to pay the cost bond without prior formal notice of the deficiencies in its appeal from the circuit court clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15. Belmont relies on\n   <em>\n    Van Meter v.

In\n   <em>\n    Van Meter\n   </em>\n   , the case originated in county court, where the jury returned a verdict against Wallace Van Meter and in favor of Bobby Alford.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 1). A final judgment was entered on June 23, 1998, and, on July 23, 1998, Van Meter filed a notice of appeal and paid the clerk's filing fee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 2). On September 2, 1998, Alford filed a motion to dismiss the appeal because Van Meter \"had failed to comply with appellate procedure in several ways.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Van Meter had been delinquent in filing a designation of record, an estimation of costs, and a Rule 11(b)(1) certificate of compliance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 6). On September 4, 1998, Van Meter filed a designation of the record, a request for an estimate of costs, and a response to the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 2).

On appeal, Van Meter argued that, after Alford had filed his motion to dismiss for failure to comply with the rules, he was not given fourteen days to correct the appeal's deficiencies, as required by Rule 2(a)(2) of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 3). In response, Alford argued that Rule 2 did not apply to appeals from county court to circuit court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We wrote that Rule 2(a)(2) applies to appeals from county court to circuit court. We also wrote that Rule 2(a)(2)\"mandates that, after a motion to dismiss has been filed, the court clerk (the circuit clerk in this instance) officially notify an appellant of deficiencies in his appeal and that the appellant be given fourteen (14) days therefrom to correct any deficiencies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We held that Van Meter therefore was deprived of due process when his appeal was dismissed because he was not given an official notice of deficiencies in his appeal by the circuit clerk.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 4). We remanded the case to the circuit court with instructions that the appropriate notice be issued to Van Meter informing him of the specific deficiencies in the appeal and giving him fourteen days to cure the deficiencies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17. In\n   <em>\n    Van Meter\n   </em>\n   , we also addressed whether the dismissal was \"an appropriate sanction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 432-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 6-10). We recognized that appellants are instructed to file a designation of record and an estimate of costs within seven days after the notice of appeal is filed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 6) (citing M.R.A.P. 10(b)(1) ; M.R.A.P. 11(b)(1) ). We also recognized that appellants are instructed to file simultaneously a Rule 11(b)(1) certificate when the estimate of costs is filed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We determined that Van Meter's \"deficiencies do not necessarily mandate a dismissal\" because Rule 3(a) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure states that the \"[f]ailure of an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the perfection of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the [appellate court] deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based on the evidence in the record, we determined that lesser sanctions may have been more appropriate and instructed the circuit court to consider lesser sanctions on remand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18. As noted by Davis, the\n   <em>\n    Van Meter\n   </em>\n   Court did not specifically address the failure to post a cost bond within thirty days as required by Section 11-51-79. In fact, the\n   <em>\n    Van Meter\n   </em>\n   Court did not mention Section 11-51-79 at all in its opinion. As such, jurisdiction was not in question. Indeed, Alford's motion to dismiss Van Meter's appeal was based on his failure to \"comply with appellate\n   <em>\n    procedure\n   </em>\n   in several ways.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 2) (emphasis added). However, to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Van Meter\n   </em>\n   may be interpreted as holding that the bond requirement under Section 11-51-79 is not jurisdictional, but rather a deficiency under Rule 2(a)(2), such an interpretation is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19. Belmont argues that the payment of the cost bond required by Section 11-51-79 is in direct conflict with Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a), which provides that the \"[f]ailure of an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the perfection of the appeal[.]\" M.R.A.P. 3(a). Belmont also argues that the payment of the cost bond required by Section 11-51-79 is in direct conflict with Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 11(b)(1), which provides that, \"[w]ithin seven (7) days after filing the notice of appeal, the appellant shall estimate the cost of preparation of the record on appeal, including, but not limited to, the cost of the preparation of the transcript, and shall deposit that sum with the clerk of the court whose judgment or order has been appealed.\" M.R.A.P. 11(b)(1). Belmont argues that Section 11-51-79's cost bond requirement has no force or effect because, under Rule 3 of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure, \"[a]ll statutes, other sets of rules, decisions or orders in conflict with these rules shall be of no further force or effect.\" M.R.A.P. 3(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20. Belmont's arguments are without merit. \"Th[e] Court repeatedly has held that statutory [cost] bonds are jurisdictional - that is, they relate to a court's appellate jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    5K Farms, Inc. v.

At the hearing on the motion to dismiss the appeal, Davis argued that Section 11-51-79 requires the appellant to pay the cost bond regardless of what the clerks have done. We agree. Here, the circuit clerk was under no obligation to notify Belmont of its failure to comply with the statutory jurisdictional requirement of paying the cost bond. Rule 2 simply does not apply to the deficiency at issue here,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., lack of jurisdiction. The deficiencies as described in Rule 2(a)(2) occur only \"(i) when the court determines that there is an obvious failure to prosecute an appeal\" or \"(ii) when a party fails to comply substantially with these rules.\" The circuit court, sitting as an appellate court, did not enter a discretionary dismissal under Rule 2(a)(2) for the failure to comply with \"these rules,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., the Mississippi Rules of Appellate\n   <em>\n    Procedure\n   </em>\n   ; rather, the circuit court dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   . As explained above, it is the Legislature's prerogative to set appellate jurisdiction of circuit courts. It did so in Section 11-51-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 33. For the same reasons, Rule 2(a)(2)'s instruction to provide a defaulting appellant fourteen days to correct the appeal's deficiencies is not applicable. Belmont was not deprived of due process when its appeal was dismissed without notice under Rule (2)(a)(2) because its failure was not a\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   deficiency; rather, its appeal was dismissed for its failure to comply with the statutory\n   <em>\n    jurisdictional\n   </em>\n   requirement of timely paying the cost bond. Belmont's deficiency and due process arguments are without merit. The circuit court's judgment and our holding further comport with Uniform Rule of Circuit and County Court Practice 5.04, which governs the procedures for appealing matters from county courts to circuit courts. Consistent with Section 11-51-71, Rule 5.04 requires that the costs of the appeal be paid within thirty days of the judgment or order being appealed in order for the appealing party to perfect the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 34.

I agree that the payment of the cost bond is jurisdictional. But I believe any deficiencies in the payment of the bond are addressed under the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure. Davis paid the proper cost bond but failed to do so within thirty days because of his inability to find out how much to pay. This is a deficiency, not a failure. Under the rules of this Court, mandatory dismissal occurs only when the notice of appeal is not timely, which is not at issue here. M.R.A.P. 2(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 38. The\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   case mixed statutes and court rules in its analysis but did not consider how deficiencies are addressed under Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 2(a)(2). In fact, this Court found that the cost bond paid by Martin was sufficient. The issue on appeal was whether Martin properly filed a supersedeas bond:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Lyons uses the term \"appeal bond\" but refers to Martin's motion to waive supersedeas bond and the $1,000 paid by Martin. In his motion to dismiss filed in circuit court, Lyons noted that the order allowing Martin to post bond in the amount of $1,000 did not state that the bond would supersede the judgment. While Lyons uses the term \"appeal bond\" for the bond requirement of Mississippi Code Section 11-51-79, he appears to be referring to a supersedeas bond.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7012842\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/87/444/#p451\">\n    87 So.3d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 39.

The statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   provided that\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   interlocutory appeals could be taken from county court. To take the argument of the majority and apply it here, the Legislature said there was no jurisdiction for an appeal from county court to circuit court.

Van Meter's appeal contained a number of deficiencies, resulting in a motion and subsequent order of dismissal. On appeal, this Court held, among other things, that an appeal from county court to circuit court is governed by the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court has previously addressed this issue in\n   <em>\n    American Investors, Inc. v.

The majority relies on Uniform Rule of Circuit and County Court Practice 5.04 to support its conclusion that the failure to pay the cost bond within thirty days of the judgment deprives the circuit court of appellate jurisdiction. Such summary treatment is contrary to the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure. Rule 2 mandates dismissal only when the notice of appeal is not filed timely.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (1) Mandatory Dismissal. An appeal shall be dismissed if the notice of appeal was not timely filed pursuant to Rules 4 or 5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   M.R.A.P. 2(a)(1). The majority has, in effect, amended the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 44. In my view, the late filing of an otherwise lawful appeal bond is a deficiency controlled by our rules. Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 2(a)(2) requires that the court clerk officially notify Belmont Holdings of the deficiency. As stated in\n   <em>\n    Van Meter\n   </em>\n   , the lack of notice is a deprivation of due process:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Van Meter was therefore deprived of due process when his appeal was dismissed because he was not given an official notice of deficiencies in his appeal by the circuit clerk. Alford's motion to dismiss cannot be substituted for an official notice of deficiencies from the court clerk. Even where a party has moved to dismiss, the plain language of the rule requires a notice from the clerk of the deficiency and a fourteen day opportunity to cure the deficiency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Van Meter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165280\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/430/#p432\">\n    774 So.2d at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 45. In conclusion, the automatic dismissal required by the majority for the failure to pay or post a cost bond within thirty days under Section 11-51-79 and Uniform Rule of Circuit and County Court Practice 5.04 conflicts with the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure. I would reverse the circuit court's judgment of dismissal and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   KITCHENS, P.J., AND KING, J., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In support, Belmont references a check in the amount of $412.40 dated June 8, 2016, which cleared on June 16. The actual amount of the cost bond is not at issue and not relevant for purposes of the issues on appeal. According to Davis and Belmont at the trial level, Belmont paid the cost of appeal in the amount of $374 on June 14, 2016. The circuit court later found that the appeal bond (or cost bond) had been paid on June 26, 2016, which is consistent with the trial court docket. Whether the cost bond was paid on June 8, June 14, June 16, or June 26, our analysis is not affected, because it is undisputed that Belmont did not timely pay its cost bond.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The Court has explained: \"The bond required to perfect an appeal is a cost bond, which is sometimes referred to as an appeal bond.
