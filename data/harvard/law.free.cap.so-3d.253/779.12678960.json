The appeal was not filed within 30 days of rendition of the order of disposition. In response to our order to show cause, Appellant argues the order is not final because additional judicial labor is required and contemplated. Specifically, the order directs the Department of Children and Families to file an Adoption Case Plan pursuant to section 39.811(8), Florida Statutes (2017), which the court will accept and adopt upon filing. However, the trial court's acceptance and adoption of an amended case plan pursuant to section 39.811(8) at some time in the future does not interfere with the finality of the order of disposition for purposes of a parent's right to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because Appellant did not timely seek review of the order of disposition, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED. This dismissal is without prejudice to Appellant's right to seek relief in the trial court.\n   <em>\n    In the Interest of E.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7516386,7516462\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/609/1289/\">\n    609 So. 2d 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Roberts, Kelsey, and Winsor, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
