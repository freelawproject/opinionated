On August 6, 2013, Adrian Montgomery and Terome O'Neal were drinking beer and liquor and smoking marijuana in a park. An eyewitness saw O'Neal knock Montgomery's joint to the ground. This prompted Montgomery to angrily attack O'Neal. Paramedics found O'Neal on the ground unconscious. He died days later in the hospital of multiple blunt-force trauma. Montgomery was indicted for deliberate-design murder but convicted on the lesser-included crime of depraved-heart murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Montgomery's first trial resulted in a mistrial. The judge granted a mistrial when the State learned-after the jury had been empaneled-that the medical examiner who had conducted O'Neal's autopsy had a sudden family emergency, rendering him unavailable. Montgomery argues his second trial placed him in double jeopardy because there had been no manifest necessity for the mistrial. We disagree. The cause of O'Neal's death was the main contested issue. Thus, the medical examiner was a key witness whose unavailability was unanticipated by the State. And due to the unknown and open-ended nature of the emergency, a continuance did not appear to be a reasonable option. So there was manifest necessity to declare a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Montgomery alternatively argues for the first time on appeal that one of the depraved-heart-murder instructions was fatally defective because it omitted the phrase \"without authority of law.\" But other instructions made clear that to find Montgomery guilty of murdering O'Neal, the killing could not be \"justifiable\" self-defense or an \"excusable\" accident. Thus,\n   when read as a whole, the depraved-heart-murder instructions were clear that the killing had to be unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. We affirm Montgomery's second-degree-murder conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Mistrial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. Montgomery's first murder trial began on Monday, October 3, 2016. Pretrial motions and jury selection took up the entire first day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. One issue that emerged in pretrial motions was the importance of expert testimony concerning O'Neal's cause and manner of death. The State had filed a motion in limine to exclude Montgomery's expert pathologist, Dr. Stephen Hayne. The exclusion was sought because Dr. Hayne had been designated too late and planned to offer a legal opinion outside his area of expertise. Montgomery's counsel disagreed. She countered that, because \"the State has their expert, Dr. J. Brent Davis, testifying as to the cause of death,\" Montgomery had the right to present his own expert, Dr. Hayne. She insisted \"the jury is entitled to hear his opinion as well as the State's pathologist's opinion and decide between the two which one they believe\" concerning O'Neal's cause of death. Instead of addressing the issue before trial, the court reserved his ruling on whether Dr. Hayne would be permitted to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. Following pretrial motions, the jury was selected and sworn. The jury then was sent home for the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. The next day, as soon as trial began, the State alerted the court it had \"an issue with the medical examiner,\" Dr. Davis. The State had just learned a few minutes earlier, through an assistant with the State Medical Examiner's Office, that Dr. Davis's father-in-law had been placed in hospice care the evening before. So Dr. Davis could not attend court to testify that day. Because the jury had already been empaneled, the State requested a mistrial or a continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. The court asked, if it were it to grant a continuance, would Dr. Davis be available to testify the next day. The prosecutor was unsure. The only thing she had been told was that Dr. Davis was with his father-in-law. And it was uncertain how much longer his father-in-law would live. The prosecutor then requested a brief recess to try to gain more information about Dr. Davis's situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. The court ordered a recess so the prosecutor could try to locate Dr. Davis and determine if he would be available to testify in a day or two. But the State was unable to contact him or determine his whereabouts. After the recess, the prosecutor informed the judge that the assistant she had spoken with had been unable to contact Dr. Davis or any of the other doctors in the Medical Examiner's Office. While the judge and the prosecutor speculated Davis was probably somewhere in the Jackson metro area, the assistant was unsure where Dr. Davis was or when he would return. All she knew was that he had a family emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. With a continuance seeming an unlikely option, Montgomery's counsel lodged an objection to the State's alternative request for a mistrial. Citing double jeopardy, she asked the judge to dismiss the charge against Montgomery. The State pointed out the incident leading to Dr. Davis's unavailability was unforseen and that Dr. Davis was a material witness. Agreeing with the State, the trial court granted a mistrial \"due to the fact that the witness is obviously not available.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. Trial was reset for November 7. During the pretrial motions, Montgomery\n   once again moved to dismiss, claiming his double-jeopardy protection would be violated by a second trial. Montgomery argued there had been no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial the month before. Instead, his counsel likened the situation to that in\n   <em>\n    Downum v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765418\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/734/\">\n    372 U.S. 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765418\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/734/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765418\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/734/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), in which the government simply failed to secure a material witness before trial started.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. The State disagreed. It maintained there had been manifest necessity based on Dr. Davis's sudden family emergency and the fact he was a necessary witness for the State. Further, Dr. Davis was the only forensic pathologist to sign O'Neal's autopsy report, so an alternate medical examiner could not testify about the cause of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. The court denied Montgomery's second motion to dismiss. The court reiterated that it had granted a mistrial based on Dr. Davis's family emergency. And if the mistrial had not been granted, the jury would have had to wait days without trial testimony. And this waiting game \"would have been inappropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Second Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15. The State's first witness at the second trial was Charles Brownlow. Brownlow had been with Montgomery, O'Neal, and several other men on July 6, 2013. The group had been drinking beer and liquor and smoking marijuana under a big oak tree in Pointdexter Park near downtown Jackson. According to Brownlow, Montgomery was smoking weed and became angry when O'Neal knocked the drugs out of Montgomery's hand. The two got into a fight. As Brownlow put it, \"there was a few words said, and then all I heard was like a hit, and then the next thing the old man ... was on the floor.\" Brownlow guessed Montgomery had hit O'Neal. Because the tree obscured his view, Brownlow did not actually see the blow, but he did see the end result-O'Neal lying on the ground unconscious with blood flowing from his mouth. While everyone else in the group scattered, Brownlow stayed with O'Neal until paramedics arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16. O'Neal was taken to the University of Mississippi Medical Center. He died three days later, after his family removed him from life support. O'Neal's mother, Catherine O'Neal Moore, testified about learning her son was in the hospital and having to remove him from life support. And the police detective and the crime-scene investigator testified about the criminal investigation resulting in Montgomery's murder indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17. Dr. Davis then testified. Dr. Davis performed the autopsy on O'Neal's body. He found multiple injuries, \"predominantly [to] the face and head, including bruising on the face.\" There were tears in the scalp, skull fractures, bruises on the brain, and bleeding in the brain. Dr. Davis determined the cause of death was \"multiple blunt-force trauma\" and the manner of death homicide. While O'Neal had significant natural diseases, blunt-force trauma, and not disease, caused his death. On cross-examination, Dr. Davis rejected that\n   the trauma could have been caused by falling on a tree root. In his expert opinion, O'Neal's death was not the result of an accidental fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18. The sole defense witness was Dr. Hayne, who was admitted as an expert forensic pathologist over the State's objection. According to Dr. Hayne, O'Neal's medical records revealed he had a disease that weakened his face and skull bones. Also, the toxicology report showed O'Neal had been impaired when he was injured. He testified O'Neal's injury to his face could have been caused by falling and striking a tree root. In his expert opinion, the cause of death was \"cranial facial trauma and fractures and injuries to the brain.\" He believed these injuries were caused by either a \"simply injury from a fall or a combination of three blows to the face with a fall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19. At the close of trial, the State requested an instruction on the lesser-included offense of depraved-heart murder. And the defense sought a heat-of-passion-manslaughter instruction. Given the option of deliberate-design murder, depraved-heart murder, heat-of-passion manslaughter, or not guilty, the jury found Montgomery guilty of depraved-heart murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-3-19\">\n    Miss.

Montgomery appeals his conviction. Represented by new counsel on appeal, he asserts three errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) The second trial violated his right against double jeopardy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) The depraved-heart murder instruction omitted an essential element.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (3) The lack of a complete trial record violates his statutory right to an appeal and is a denial of due process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Double Jeopardy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21.

In\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , this Court recognized that the Fifth Amendment protection against \"double jeopardy attaches in any criminal proceeding [in Mississippi] at the moment the trial jury is selected and sworn to try the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

However, discharging the jury before trial is complete does not always lead to a double-jeopardy bar. \"Because of the variety of circumstances that may make it necessary to discharge a jury before a trial is concluded, and because those circumstances do not invariably create unfairness to the accused, [a criminal\n   defendant's] valued right to have the trial concluded by a particular tribunal is sometimes subordinate to the public interest in affording the prosecutor one full and fair opportunity to present his evidence to an impartial jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p503\">\n    434 U.S. at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p503\">\n    98 S.Ct. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Yet in view of the importance of the right, and the fact that it is frustrated by any mistrial, the prosecutor ... must demonstrate 'manifest necessity' for any mistrial declared over the objection of the defendant\" if he is to avoid the double-jeopardy bar.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 24. As this Court has framed it, \"no retrial for the same offense will be permitted in any criminal case in which the first trial, following the swearing and impaneling of the jury, was aborted prior to conclusion, unless exceptional circumstances existed in the first case, and there was a manifest necessity for the trial judge to declare a mistrial.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9601712\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/398/1312/#p1314\">\n    398 So.2d at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At Montgomery's first trial, the jury had been selected, sworn, and empaneled. So jeopardy had attached. This meant that Montgomery could not be retried unless there was a manifest necessity to declare a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 25. The amount of discretion a trial court has to find manifest necessity turns on the\n   <em>\n    reason\n   </em>\n   for mistrial. For example, a trial court's decision that a juror is biased or a jury is hopelessly deadlocked is entitled to \"broad deference.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

From the outset, we pause to address Justice King's dissenting view that the trial court based its decision to declare a mistrial, not on Dr. Davis's unavailability, but rather simply because testimony had not begun and Montgomery could not show prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27. In\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , this Court expressed that the \"prudent procedure for any trial court before declaring a mistrial would be to state into the record the reasons for declaring a mistrial.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9601712\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/398/1312/#p1314\">\n    398 So.2d at 1318-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So contrary to the dissent's view, it was the State's showing its key witness was unavailable, and not Montgomery's inability to show prejudice, that drove the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28. While, at this juncture, the trial judge did not explicitly state there was \"manifest necessity\" to declare a mistrial, he was not required to do so.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p503\">\n    434 U.S. at 516-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p503\">\n    98 S.Ct. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So, a month later, when the trial judge further explained how he had considered but rejected there being a reasonable alternative to mistrial and why he had found there was manifest necessity to declare a mistrial, the judge was not \"cleaning up\" a deficiency in his earlier ruling.

A manifest-necessity finding tends to be upheld when the witness's availability was sudden and unknown to the prosecution before trial began and jeopardy attached, the witness was a key prosecution witness, and the trial court considered alternatives to declaring a mistrial but none appeared adequate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

The facts here follow that pattern. First, Dr. Davis's unavailability was sudden and surprising to the State. This case is not like\n   <em>\n    Downum\n   </em>\n   , in which the prosecution simply \"took a chance\" and \"allowed the jury to be selected and sworn even though one of its key witnesses was absent and had not been found.\"\n   <em>\n    Downum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765418\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/734/\">\n    372 U.S. at 735-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765418\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/734/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Dr. Davis had been prepared to testify when trial began. The record reflects the State had subpoenaed Dr. Davis to appear for trial beginning that Monday. So when jury selection started on Monday, October 3, the State had no reason to anticipate that its expert pathologist would be unavailable to testify that week. And it was only the next morning that someone in Dr. Davis's office called to alert the prosecution that Dr. Davis had a family emergency that would prevent him from coming to court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ziegele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310608\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/479/773/#p777\">\n    479 F.2d at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that, since the lead investigative officer \"had been present on the first day of the trial, it is evident that he would have been available as a witness if he had not become ill\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 32. Second, Dr. Davis was a key witness. Just the day before Dr. Davis became unavailable, during the pretrial motion to exclude Dr. Hayne, both sides teed up this case as largely a battle of experts on O'Neal's cause and manner of death. So when the trial judge learned of Dr. Davis's sudden unavailability the next day, the court was well aware that Dr. Davis's testimony about O'Neal's cause of death was crucial to the State's case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ziegele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310608\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/479/773/#p777\">\n    479 F.2d at 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the unavailable officer's testimony about the defendant's confession was \"the most important element in the prosecution's case\");\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20893471\">\n    2012 WL 893471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (noting the unavailable alleged rape victim was \"obviously an essential witness\");\n   <em>\n    McCorkle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4390158\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/95/31/\">\n    619 A.2d at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the missing witness was key, with \"both parties ha[ving] made extensive references to this witness's expected testimony\" during their opening statements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 33. That leaves only the question of whether the trial court adequately considered the alternatives to declaring a mistrial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794099\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/713/#p718\">\n    624 F.3d at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"strictest scrutiny\" to include requiring the trial court to conduct \"a careful consideration of any reasonable alternative to a mistrial\"). And here is where Montgomery focuses his no-manifest-necessity argument on appeal. He asserts the trial judge declared a mistrial without enough information. He points out that neither the\n   prosecutor nor the judge spoke with Dr. Davis directly, no one represented Dr. Davis himself was too incapacitated to testify, and it was not known whether a one- or two-day continuance would have resolved the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 34. It was the very lack of said information, however, that led the trial court to believe its only choice was to declare a mistrial. The trial judge in this case did the exact same thing the judge in\n   <em>\n    Ziegele\n   </em>\n   did-he granted a recess to better ascertain the witness's situation to determine if a continuance was possible.\n   <em>\n    Ziegele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310608\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/479/773/#p777\">\n    479 F.2d at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The judge directed the State to call the Medical Examiner's Office to find out if Dr. Davis was somewhere in the area and whether he would be available in the next few days, making a continuance feasible. Unfortunately, the State was unable to get any answers. The only thing Dr. Davis's assistant knew was that Dr. Davis was somewhere with his dying father-in-law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 35. Montgomery contends a day or two continuance\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have resolved the problem. But his argument is speculative. A day or two continuance could have resulted in the same situation-Dr. Davis still unavailable to testify due to his family emergency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the trial court's view, asking the jury to wait an unknown duration without trial testimony would have been inappropriate. The trial court in\n   <em>\n    McCorkle\n   </em>\n   reached a similar conclusion when considering a continuance until the State could secure the witness, who was suspected of faking his illness. In the court's view, there was \"no reasonable likelihood the witness was going to appear.\" So \"it would [have been] burdensome and unfair to the jurors to have this matter linger and them not knowing when the day of trial would be.\"\n   <em>\n    McCorckle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4390158\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/95/31/\">\n    619 A.2d at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20893471\">\n    2012 WL 893471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (noting the trial court had rejected the alternative of a continuance because it was \"unfair to the jury that's been sworn to have this case hanging over their heads for some indeterminate number of days\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 36. The trial judge considered the alternative to mistrial-a continuance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   But given the open-ended nature of Dr. Davis's unavailability-being with a dying family member-the trial court found a continuance was not an appropriate alternative. Therefore, under the circumstances, which included Dr. Davis's unexpected family emergency, the importance of his testimony, and the uncertainty that a continuance would suffice-we hold manifest necessity existed to declare a mistrial. So Montgomery's \"valued right to have the trial concluded\" by the first tribunal, in this case, was \"subordinate to the public interest in affording the prosecutor one full and fair opportunity to present his evidence to an impartial jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p503\">\n    434 U.S. at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p503\">\n    98 S.Ct. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And his second trial did not violate double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jury Instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 37. Alternatively, Montgomery argues he is entitled to a new trial because Instruction\n   15-a jury instruction for the lesser-included charge he was convicted of-was fatally defective. According to Montgomery, this instruction lacked the essential element that the killing must be \"without authority of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 38. Submitted as S-2A, Jury Instruction 15 instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   If you believe from all the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (1) The defendant, Adrian Montgomery;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (2) did, on or about the 6th day of July, 2013, in the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (3) kill Terome O'Neal, a human being, by beating the said Terome O'Neal with his fist;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (4) while in the commission of an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved heart, regardless of human life, although without any premeditated design to effect the death of any particular individual;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (5) and not in necessary self-defense;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   then and in that event, you must find the defendant, Adrian Montgomery, guilty of Depraved Heart Murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Montgomery zeroes in on the fact that this particular instruction did not contain the phrase \"without authority of law.\" He insists this omission was prejudicial because his theories of defense were self-defense and accident, both of which would have excused the killing. Moreover, because both the deliberate-design-murder instruction and the heat-of-passion-manslaughter instruction contained this phrase, he suggests the omission in Instruction 15 gave the jury the option to find him guilty of depraved-heart murder, even if his killing O'Neal had been lawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 39. Montgomery did not object to Jury Instruction 15 as given to the jury. While Montgomery did object to the instruction's original inclusion of the phrase \"or blunt object,\" the trial judge agreed to remove this language. He then asked Montgomery's counsel if she had any further objections to Instruction 15, to which Montgomery's counsel replied \"no.\" On appeal, Montgomery \"may not argue that an instruction was erroneous for a reason other than the reason assigned on objection to the instruction at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Irby v.

For this same reason, the objection Presiding Justice Kitchens relies on certainly did not preserve Montgomery's claim. That objection was to a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   instruction, Instruction 12, for a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 40.

Here, Montgomery did not specifically object to Instruction 15 because it lacked the phrase \"without authority of law.\" Nor did he raise any concern that the depraved-heart-murder instructions as a whole were missing this essential element.

But the three instructions immediately following Instruction 15 alleviate any concern that the jury may have mistakenly believed it could find Montgomery guilty for\n   <em>\n    lawfully\n   </em>\n   killing O'Neal. Instructions 16, 17, and 18 clearly instructed the jury on Montgomery's two defense theories.

Instead, this case is akin to\n   <em>\n    Harris v. State\n   </em>\n   .

The majority excuses the failure to instruct the jury that it had to find that Montgomery's actions had been \"without the authority of law\" on the basis of harmless error.

The majority relies on a misconstruction of the record to conclude that manifest necessity for a mistrial existed. Because manifest necessity for a mistrial was not shown, because the trial court inappropriately flipped the burden of proof regarding the appropriateness of a mistrial to the defendant, and because the prohibition against double jeopardy barred the defendant's retrial, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 59. The majority relies heavily on the trial court's \"finding\" that \"if the mistrial had not been granted, the jury would have had to wait days without trial testimony. And this waiting game 'would have been inappropriate' \" to find that manifest necessity existed to grant a mistrial. Maj. \u00b6 14. Yet, the trial court found no such thing in granting the mistrial, and nothing in the record indicates that the jury would have had to wait days without trial testimony. Moreover, when deciding whether to grant a mistrial, the trial court did not place the burden on the State to prove manifest necessity; rather, he inappropriately placed the burden on the defendant to prove prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 60. When the trial court asked counsel if they were ready for opening statements,\n   the State replied that the medical examiner's \"father-in-law is in hospice - - was put in hospice late yesterday afternoon. We just found out about it really a couple of minutes ago.\" The State explained that it had spoken with the doctor's assistant, who said that he was with his father-in-law and did not know how much longer he had to live. The trial court queried how soon the doctor could get to court, and the State did not know. The State did represent that the doctor was in the Jackson metro area, as the case was being tried in Jackson. The trial court then granted a fifteen minute recess to allow the State to find out more information regarding the absence, and to determine how soon Dr. Davis could arrive at court. The State was unable to contact Dr. Davis directly and was unable to glean much more information than it had at the outset of the day, just about twenty minutes before. The State, based on this scant information gleaned over a time period of only approximately twenty minutes, moved for a mistrial, stating in full: \"Your Honor, based upon my understanding of what the law is, I'm going to have to - - since the jury has already been empaneled and sworn, I'm going to have to ask the court to declare a mistrial.\" The defense objected and moved for dismissal based on double jeopardy. The following exchange then occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. He'll be facing double jeopardy?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   MS.

HARRIS: There has been no testimony offered at this point, Your Honor. This incident was unforeseeable. It was unforeseen. It wasn't something that was created by man. Life happened to this doctor who is a material witness in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. Well, I'm interested in the double jeopardy because we have mistrials all the time and the law allows people to be retried. And this one has not gone that far. We've even had jurors to deliverate and not be able to return a verdict and the court declares mistrials, and those matters are tried all the time and that's not double jeopardy. So what would make this double jeopardy?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   MS. STAMPS: Your Honor, our position is that double jeopardy attaches at the point that the jury has been sworn in and empanelled [sic] and we would ask that the case be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   THE COURT: All right.

This is a three year old case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   THE COURT: Well, usually, that's something the court mentions all the time and no one seems to be interested in that. So now it's a three year old case that the court has been desperately trying to get to trial. And the defendant is out on bond.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     There is no prejudice to this defendant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The state is entitled to have all of their witnesses here. The court would do the same for the defendant if a witness was not available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   The court will deny the motion to dismiss. This is not a situation where the defendant is being subjected to double jeopardy. The matter will be\n   reset for trial. The court wants this matter to proceed but, however, due to the fact that the witness is obviously not available, the court will declare a mistrial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   (Emphases added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 61. The trial court then issued a written order declaring a mistrial that incorrectly stated that the \"[j]ury retired to consider their Verdict, being in charge of Sworn officers of the Court, and presently, returned into open Court and stated that they are unable to agree upon a Verdict in said Cause. It is thereupon ordered by the Court that a MISTRIAL enter in said Cause.\" It is abundantly clear that the trial court found that a mistrial was appropriate because it was early in the proceeding and the defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 62. One month later, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy. It was only at the hearing on that motion that the trial court suddenly decided to clean up its earlier \"findings\" regarding the mistrial. It stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   The Court granted mistrial, due to that emergency, in that if a mistrial had not been granted, the jury would have had to be here a number of days without trial testimony, and the Court found that that would have been inappropriate. The Court found that the mistrial was granted because of the family emergency of the witness of the State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Consequently, the trial court found manifest necessity for the mistrial. Of course, these new \"findings\" were not actually what the trial court found in declaring the mistrial, nor does the record support these new \"findings.\" The Court should disregard these later, unfounded \"findings,\" and rely on the trial court's findings at the time of granting the mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 63.

Moreover, even if this Court gives credence to the trial court's later \"findings\" attempting to clean up the original \"findings,\" the record offers no support for those findings. The State did not produce evidence to show that Dr. Davis had an \"emergency\" as they claim. Indeed, while I acknowledge that this time must have been difficult for Dr. Davis and his family, hospice is, by its very definition, not an emergency.

The State produced no evidence that he would not be available for several days, only that he was not currently at court and that they had not been able to speak with him directly.

Citing a completely irrelevant regulatory statute, the dissent suggests Dr. Davis's father-in-law's situation was not urgent enough to render Dr. Davis suddenly unavailable. This suggestion not only ignores the record-the State was told Dr. Davis was \"with his father in law\" because \"he doesn't know how much longer he has to live\"-it also misses the point. The relevant inquiry is not whether being placed in \"hospice,\" as that term is defined for licensing purposes, constitutes an emergency. Instead, the real question is whether Dr. Davis's absence was \"known to or reasonably expected\n    <em>\n     by the\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    prior to jeopardy attaching.\"\n    <em>\n     McCorkle\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4390158\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/95/31/\">\n     619 A.2d at 61\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). Indeed, in\n    <em>\n     McCorkle\n    </em>\n    , it appears there was no real \"emergency\" after all because the government's key witness had lied to the court about being sick to get out of testifying. But that did not change the critical fact that the witness's absence came as a surprise to the State. Given that the State had subpoenaed Dr. Davis, the record supports that his absence was sudden and certainly unanticipated by the State.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    The only difference between\n    <em>\n     Ziegele\n    </em>\n    and this case is that, here, it was Dr. Davis's father-in-law, and not Dr. Davis himself, who became gravely ill.
