On August 1, 2018, Judge Kovach ruled that Mr. Ducote had falsely certified that he had filed Louisiana state tax returns in 2013, 2014, and 2015 and that he had failed to provide any proof that he was not required to file a Louisiana state income tax return for those years, and, thus, disqualified Mr. Ducote as a candidate in the November 6, 2018 Primary Election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Ducote now appeals his disqualification. On appeal, Mr. Ducote presents three assignments of error: first, the trial court erred as a matter of law in allowing Mr. Petit to proceed to trial on a theory that was not pled in his petition; second, the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that Mr. Petit established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that Mr. Ducote failed to file required Louisiana non-resident income tax returns, and that Mr. Ducote's failure to rebut the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case mandated his disqualification; and lastly, the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that Mr. Ducote's certifications in his notice of candidacy are false, thus requiring his disqualification under La. R.S. 18:492(A)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Election Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The manner of qualifying for an election is set forth in La.

After trial, Judge Kovach found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Paragraph 10 of the petitioners' petition alleges, 'According to the Louisiana Department of Revenue, Ducote has not filed the required state tax forms for 2013, 2014, or 2015.' This allegation is clear and unambiguous. It is sufficient to put Ducote on notice as to the basis of petitioner's challenge. Ducote has not filed the required Louisiana state income tax return, whether it should have been filed as a resident or a non-resident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 854 and La. C.C.P. art. 891, Louisiana requires only fact pleading. In order to plead \"material facts\" within Louisiana's fact-pleading system, the pleader must state what act or omission he will establish at trial.\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Thibeaux\n   </em>\n   , 14-1107 (La. 1/28/15),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6885208\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/159/426/#p432\">\n    159 So.3d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432. More specifically, La. R.S. 18:1406(B), which controls in petitions objecting to candidacy for election, states, \"The petition shall set forth in specific detail the facts upon which the objection or contest is based.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the petition in this case, Mr. Petit alleged in paragraph 6 that, in his Notice of Candidacy, Mr. Ducote certified that \"for each of the previous five tax years, I have filed my federal and state income tax returns, ..., or was not required to file\n   either a federal or state income tax return or both.\" Further, Mr. Petit alleged in paragraphs 10 and 11, which are in a subsection entitled \"FALSE CERTIFICATION REGARDING TAXES,\" that Mr. Ducote falsely certified that he \"had filed the last 5 years tax returns\" that he was \"required to file.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, Mr. Petit's allegation was sufficiently specific in detail to allow the candidate, Mr. Ducote, to know the nature of Mr. Petit's objection to his candidacy as called for in La. R.S. 18:1406(B). Specifically, the petition alleged that Mr. Ducote failed to file state tax returns in light of information that Mr. Ducote earned income in Louisiana during 2013, 2014, and 2015. Furthermore, neither the certification on the Notice of Candidacy nor the petition distinguished between the filing of resident and/or non-resident state tax forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Upon review, we find that, in his petition, Mr. Petit sufficiently placed at issue the question of whether Mr. Ducote filed state tax returns in Louisiana in the years 2013, 2014, and 2015 and his certification of said filings. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial judge's ruling on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Turning now to Mr. Ducote's second and third assignments of error, we note that at trial of this matter, Mr. Petit testified that, through a public records request to the Louisiana Department of Revenue (\"LDR\"), he learned that Mr. Ducote did not file state tax returns in Louisiana for the years 2013, 2014, or 2015. Further, Mr. Ducote admitted at trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Well, I will be glad to stipulate that I did not file Louisiana returns in the years 2013, 2014, 2015 because I was a Pennsylvania resident and domiciled. I wasn't required to. I did file in '16 and '17. And that's reflected in the exhibit. So, I mean, I'm not going to argue with that fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Thus, it is undisputed that Mr. Ducote did not file individual state income tax returns with the Louisiana Department of Revenue for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Mr. Petit also introduced testimony from Bradley Blanchard, an attorney in the Policy Services Division of the Louisiana Department of Revenue, who was accepted as an expert in Louisiana state income tax law. Mr. Blanchard testified that legal services, including representing clients at hearings and in trial in Louisiana, constitute \"Louisiana-sourced income\" that must be reported by a nonresident on a state tax return filed in Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   When questioned regarding corporate taxation, Mr. Blanchard testified that a corporation, even an \"S\" corporation, would need to report earnings from Louisiana on a corporate return filed in Louisiana and an employee of a corporation must file an individual income tax return for income earned in Louisiana. Further, if a corporation makes a distribution of profits or dividends to a shareholder in Louisiana that must be reported as income in Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mr. Petit also presented testimony from Keith Naccari, who was accepted as an expert in Louisiana taxation, regarding a nonresident's obligation to file a tax return in Louisiana. Mr. Naccari testified that La. R.S. 47:31 requires every nonresident that earns revenue from services they provide in Louisiana to file state income tax returns. Mr. Naccari, quoting from La. R.S. 47:243 and La. R.S. 47:244, further testified that corporations must pay taxes in Louisiana on \"gross apportionable income from Louisiana sources,\" which \"shall include revenue from services performed in the state and any other gross income derived entirely from sources within the state.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   During his testimony, Mr. Ducote stated that, as an employee of his corporation, he was paid a salary, which he declared as income on his federal and Pennsylvania state income tax returns. Mr. Ducote contended that he did not file a state income tax return in Louisiana because he was not a resident of Louisiana. Further, Mr. Ducote contended that any contracts for legal representation by his corporation were confected in Pennsylvania by a Pennsylvania corporation and, thus, any income earned as a result of those contracts was earned in and taxable in Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   After trial, Judge Kovach issued written Reasons for Judgment, which articulately discussed each of Mr. Petit's three objections to Mr. Ducote's candidacy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Judge Kovach found that Mr. Petit failed to present evidence that Mr. Ducote had not complied with the requirements of the Campaign Finance Disclosure Act and, thus, Mr. Petit had not borne his burden of proof that Mr. Ducote had falsely certified that he had complied. Second, Judge Kovach found that, although Mr. Petit did establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that Mr. Ducote is domiciled in Pennsylvania, Mr. Ducote presented sufficient evidence that he had changed his domicile to Covington, Louisiana in February 2016 to rebut the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, and most importantly for this opinion, Judge Kovach found that Mr. Petit presented substantial evidence, including Mr. Ducote's own admission, that Mr. Ducote did not file the required state tax forms in Louisiana for 2013, 2014, or 2015. Judge Kovach found that Mr. Petit presented evidence at trial that revealed that, in 2013, 2014, and 2015, Mr. Ducote was enrolled as an attorney representing Louisiana residents, was paid an income by his corporation for these Louisiana services, and received dividends as the corporation's sole shareholder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Judge Kovach opined that, although Mr. Ducote alleged that he was not domiciled in Louisiana during those years and, thus, was not required to file tax forms in Louisiana, La. R.S. 47:31 mandates that nonresidents that earn income from Louisiana sources must pay taxes on said income. Judge Kovach found that Mr. Petit had borne his burden of proving that Mr. Ducote falsely certified that he was not required to file state tax forms when, under Louisiana law, he was required to file income tax returns for all three years. Further, Judge Kovach found that Mr. Ducote did not rebut that showing. Upon so finding, Judge Kovach found that the false certification was sufficient to disqualify Mr. Ducote from the November election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Upon review, we find that the trial judge did not err in finding that Mr. Petit presented a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that Mr. Ducote\n   falsely certified that he was not required to file state tax returns for 2013, 2014, and 2015. Moreover, we find that the trial court did not err in finding that Mr. Ducote failed to rebut that showing. Accordingly, we hereby affirm the trial court's ruling disqualifying Mr. Ducote as a candidate for the office of Associate Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court, District 1 in the Primary Election on November 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Pursuant to La.
