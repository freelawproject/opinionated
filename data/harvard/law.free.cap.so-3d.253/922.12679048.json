Deputy Terry Smith of the Panola County Sheriff's Department was involved in a two-vehicle accident on Highway 6 in Panola County with Lynda and William Irwin. The Irwins died as a result of injuries sustained in the crash, and their daughter Beverly Irwin-Giles filed suit against Panola County under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (MTCA). The county subsequently moved for summary judgment, relying on the \"police protection\" exemption from the MTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-9\">\n    Miss.

Therefore, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Around 1 p.m. on July 21, 2015, Lynda and William Irwin were traveling west on Highway 6 in Panola County in their Buick Rainier SUV. Lynda was driving, and William was in the front passenger seat. In Panola County, Highway 6 is a four-lane divided highway that runs concurrent with U.S. Route 278.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. As the Irwins were traveling west on Highway 6, Deputy Terry Smith of the Panola County Sheriff's Department was driving north on Lawrence Brothers Road, which crosses Highway 6 and becomes Terza Road to the north of Highway 6. There is a stop sign on Lawrence Brothers Road at its intersection with Highway 6. Deputy Smith was driving a Chevrolet Silverado owned by the Panola County Sheriff's Department. He was returning to his office after unsuccessfully attempting to locate a suspect in a case; he had not turned on his lights or sirens, and he was in no particular hurry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Smith safely crossed the eastbound lanes of Highway 6 into the median of the highway. Then, as Smith attempted to cross the westbound lanes of Highway 6 onto Terza Road, he entered the path of the Irwins' Buick. The Buick hit the front passenger side of Smith's truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Data recovered from the Buick's \"black box\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicated that the Buick was traveling seventy-five miles per hour just prior to the collision, which was ten miles per hour faster than the posted speed limit. Smith testified in his deposition that he never saw the Buick before the collision. He said he remembered \"stopping and waiting for traffic to be clear,\" but he could not recall how long he waited or how many vehicles he may have waited on. There were no obstructions blocking his view of oncoming traffic. The Mississippi Highway Patrol (MHP) investigated the collision, and MHP's Uniform Crash Report indicated that Smith failed to yield the right of way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Both Smith's truck and the Irwins' Buick eventually came to rest off the road to the north of Highway 6. Smith suffered a fractured ankle and contusions in the crash but was able to get out of his truck. The Irwins both sustained severe and ultimately fatal injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Irwin-Giles retained an accident reconstruction specialist, Tim Corbitt, who examined MHP's report, photographs taken by MHP, and data downloaded from both vehicles' black boxes. In his report, Corbitt states that data from the Silverado's black box indicates that its speed increased from 25 mph to 30 mph in the 2.5 seconds before the crash. Based on this data, Corbitt opines that Smith did not stop either at the stop sign at the intersection of Lawrence Brothers Road and Highway 6 or in the median prior to continuing into the westbound lanes of Highway 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Irwin-Giles gave pre-suit notice under the MTCA and then filed suit against Panola County. In its answer, the county asserted, among other defenses, immunity pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 11-46-9(1)(c). After limited discovery, the county filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it was immune from liability under section 11-46-9(1)(c) because Smith had not \"acted in reckless disregard of the [Irwins'] safety and well-being\" and because Lynda was \"engaged in criminal activity at the time of the injury\" (speeding).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. The circuit court found that the evidence did not establish any causal nexus between Lynda's speeding and her injuries and also ruled that Lynda's \"speeding would not be imputed to William.\" However, the circuit court granted the county's motion for summary judgment after finding that Irwin-Giles failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Smith had \"acted in reckless disregard.\" The court reasoned that \"Smith was not driving 100 mph\" and \"was not pursuing anyone.\" The court also noted that Smith did not proceed blindly or enter a dangerous intersection. The court concluded that if Smith ran the stop sign and failed to yield, he might have been negligent, but his actions still did not rise to the level of \"reckless disregard.\" Irwin-Giles filed a timely notice of appeal from the circuit court's order granting summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. \"This Court applies a de novo standard of review to a grant of summary judgment and to issues involving the interpretation and application of the MTCA.\"\n   <em>\n    Lane v.

This statutory provision affords a governmental entity \"two avenues\n   of immunity: (1) if the decedent was engaged in criminal activity, then the [governmental entity] is immune, and (2) if the decedent was not engaged in criminal activity, and if the [governmental entity's] employees did not act with reckless disregard, then the [governmental entity] is immune.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Williams ex rel.

On appeal, the county argues that both \"avenues\" lead to immunity and summary judgment in this case. We first address the circuit court's ruling that the county is entitled to summary judgment because there is no genuine issue of material fact and Deputy Smith did not act in reckless disregard of the Irwins' safety. Second, we address the county's alternative argument that Irwin-Giles's claims are barred because Lynda was engaged in \"criminal activity\" (speeding) at the time of her injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In\n   <em>\n    Maldonado\n   </em>\n   , the deputy came to a complete stop at a stop sign at a four-way intersection.

In reviewing the circuit court's ruling granting summary judgment in favor of the county, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to Irwin-Giles, and she is \"entitled to the benefit of all reasonable favorable inferences that may be drawn from the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Burkhalter &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7505989\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/602/835/#p838\">\n    602 So.2d at 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying this standard, we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Smith \"acted in reckless disregard\" of the Irwins' safety. Smith testified that he came to a stop at the stop sign and again in the median, where he says that he stopped to wait for westbound traffic to clear. However, based on Corbitt's analysis of the \"black box\" data, Irwin-Giles presented evidence that Smith did not stop or even slow down at the stop sign or in the median before proceeding into the westbound lanes of Highway 6 and directly into the path of the Irwins' Buick. Moreover, although Smith testified that he looked both ways for oncoming traffic when he stopped, he acknowledged that there were no obstructions to his vision. The fact that Smith's view was not obstructed permits a reasonable inference that Smith did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   look for traffic before he crossed Highway 6. Thus, the fact-finder could conclude from the evidence in the record that Smith drove across a four-lane divided highway without stopping at a stop sign, or even slowing down, and without checking for oncoming traffic. This would be sufficient for the fact-finder to conclude that Smith \"fail[ed] or refus[ed] to exercise\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   care,\" which our Supreme Court has characterized as reckless disregard.\n   <em>\n    Maye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11511421\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/758/391/#p395\">\n    758 So.2d at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 21) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18. Our prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Vo\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case. In\n   <em>\n    Vo\n   </em>\n   , there was evidence that the deputy failed to check his mirrors before he backed up, but he also backed up slowly in a parking lot, resulting in a low-impact collision. Thus, the deputy in\n   <em>\n    Vo\n   </em>\n   exercised at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   degree of care, even if he was negligent. Moreover, as this case tragically illustrates, driving across a major four-lane divided highway-allegedly without stopping, yielding, or looking for oncoming traffic-obviously involves far greater risks to the \"safety and well-being\" of others,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-9\">\n    Miss.

There, the Supreme Court found that the deputy looked both ways before proceeding into the intersection, and his failure to see the plaintiff's car could be explained by an obstruction to his vision and the \"dangerous\" nature of the particular intersection. Here, in contrast, there were no obstructions to Smith's vision. And based on the \"black box\" data and Corbitt's affidavit and report, a fact-finder could reasonably infer that Smith must not have looked for oncoming traffic, or else he would have seen the Irwins' Buick. For these reasons, we conclude that Irwin-Giles presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact and survive summary judgment on the issue of reckless disregard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Irwin-Giles's claim based on Lynda's injuries and death requires further analysis.

Although a literal reading of section 11-46-9(1)(c) might bar any claim by a person \"engaged in criminal activity at the time of injury,\" our Supreme Court has interpreted the statute's language more narrowly. The Court has held that the statute \"is not designed to protect grossly negligent or intentional tortfeasors from liability where the fact that the victim is engaged in a criminal activity is merely fortuitous and has no relation to the transaction out of which the liability would otherwise arise.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Jackson v. Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11237272\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/764/373/#p379\">\n    764 So.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 379 (\u00b6 25) (Miss. 2000). The Court reasoned that \"[i]t would be anomalous to suggest, for example, that a recklessly\n   negligent officer who runs down a pedestrian on the sidewalk, escapes liability on a showing that the pedestrian was then and there in possession of untaxed whisky.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11237272\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/764/373/#p379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, an injured party's \"criminal activity\" will not bar her claim unless there is some \"causal nexus\" between the criminal activity and her injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142366\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/844/1161/#p1164\">\n    844 So.2d at 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 15-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 24. The parties disagree as to the precise nature of the \"causal nexus\" required by our precedents. The county argues that the claim is barred if there is a nexus between the injured party's criminal activity and her injuries, while Irwin-Giles contends that the relevant question is whether there is a nexus between the injured party's criminal activity\n   <em>\n    and the tortfeasor's police protection activities\n   </em>\n   . That is, Irwin-Giles argues that a claim is not barred unless \"the activities of the officer in carrying out his duties in protecting the public are directed toward the criminal activities of the [injured party].\" This point of disagreement is significant in this case because there is no nexus between what Deputy Smith was doing-returning to his office after an unsuccessful search for a suspect in an unrelated crime-and Lynda's speeding. Indeed, Smith testified that he never even saw the Irwins' Buick until after the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 25. While some statements in prior opinions support Irwin-Giles's position,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   we conclude that the county's position is more consistent with our precedent. In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , an intoxicated driver was killed when he drove into an intersection and into the path of a fire truck responding to a fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1162-63 (\u00b6\u00b6 3-7). The Supreme Court held that the decedent's criminal activity (driving with a .20% blood-alcohol content) barred a wrongful death claim against the city because \"there [was] a clear nexus between the criminal activity of Williams\n   <em>\n    and the injury suffered by him\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1165 (\u00b6 17) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Durn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306387\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/861/990/#p997\">\n    861 So.2d at 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 22) (discussing\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ). Without significant discussion, the Supreme Court's opinion also stated \"that there was a causal nexus between Williams's criminal activity and the actions of the [firefighters],\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142366\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/844/1161/#p1164\">\n    844 So.2d at 1162-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 3-7) ; however, Williams's driving under the influence logically had nothing to do with the firefighters' fire protection activities. The fire truck was responding to an unrelated fire, and Williams simply drove into its path from a cross street. The only relevant \"nexus\" in the case was between Williams's criminal activity and his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 26. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    McElroy v. City of Brandon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773333\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/198/373/\">\n    198 So.3d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), this Court held that an intoxicated driver's criminal activity\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   barred a wrongful death claim arising out of a crash with a police car. The crash resulted from the decedent's attempt to turn left in front of a police car on Highway 80 in Brandon. The police car was in the process of responding to an emergency call about a burglary at a nearby apartment complex.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773333\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/198/373/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773333\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/198/373/\">\n    at 375-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 3-9). The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the city, and we affirmed on appeal.

As in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , there was no nexus between the decedent's criminal activity (driving while intoxicated) and the police protection activity. The police officer was responding to a wholly unrelated burglary, and the decedent simply drove into his path from an exit ramp. Again, the only relevant nexus was between the decedent's criminal activity and his death. Based on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   and this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    McElroy\n   </em>\n   , we hold that a claim is barred under section 11-46-9(1)(c) if there is a causal \"nexus between the criminal activity of [the injured party]\n   <em>\n    and the injury suffered by him\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142366\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/844/1161/#p1164\">\n    844 So.2d at 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 17) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 27. Even so, we conclude that the county was not entitled to summary judgment in this case. Rather, we conclude that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Durn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , controls the outcome. In\n   <em>\n    Durn\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff was traveling south on Highway 49 when he passed a MHP state trooper traveling north. Soon after the two passed, the trooper observed a different vehicle speeding southbound, and the trooper made a U-turn to pursue the speeding vehicle. As the trooper approached the plaintiff's truck from behind, he attempted to pass the plaintiff in the northbound lane. But just as he did, the plaintiff made a left turn, and the trooper's car crashed into the plaintiff's truck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Durn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306387\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/861/990/#p997\">\n    861 So.2d at 993-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 2-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 28. On appeal in\n   <em>\n    Durn\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff \"committed a misdemeanor traffic offense by making a left turn when it was not reasonably safe to do so\" and thereby committed \"a criminal offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306387\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/861/990/#p997\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306387\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/861/990/#p997\">\n    at 996-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 19, 23). Nonetheless, the Court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , stating that it could not \"equate making a left turn with operating a vehicle with a .20% blood alcohol content.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306387\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/861/990/#p997\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306387\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/861/990/#p997\">\n    at 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 23). The Court reasoned that the trooper was pursuing a different vehicle, that the plaintiff's improper left turn \"was merely fortuitous,\" and that the claim was not barred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306387\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/861/990/#p997\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306387\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/861/990/#p997\">\n    at 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 23). The Court held that \"[i]t would defy common sense and natural justice for us to hold that [the] alleged improper left turn constituted criminal activity which entitled the Department [of Public Safety] to immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306387\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/861/990/#p997\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 24). In so holding, the Court emphasized that the trooper \"was traveling at a high rate of speed\" and failed to use his siren when he attempted to pass the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9306387\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/861/990/#p997\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 29. We question whether an immunity that the Legislature has defined by statute should be granted or denied based on the judiciary's views of \"natural justice.\" However, our role as an intermediate appellate court makes it unnecessary for us to make such a value judgment in this appeal. We simply hold that the county was not entitled to summary judgment because the evidence in the record-viewed in the light most favorable to Irwin-Giles and granting her all favorable inferences-so closely parallels the facts of\n   <em>\n    Durn\n   </em>\n   that our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Durn\n   </em>\n   is controlling. As the circuit judge concluded, there is no evidence in the record that Lynda could have avoided the crash had she not been speeding. Based on the evidence presented, all we can say is that the Irwins' Buick and Deputy Smith's truck tragically collided on Highway 6 because of the precise speed at which each vehicle was traveling. Like the improper left turn in\n   <em>\n    Durn\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that this is the sort of \"merely fortuitous\" happenstance that does not bar recovery under section 11-46-9(1)(c). Therefore, the county\n   is not entitled to summary judgment based on Lynda's speeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 30. We hold that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Deputy Smith's conduct constituted reckless disregard for the safety and well-being of others. In addition, we conclude Irwin-Giles's claims are not barred by Lynda's speeding because Lynda's speeding cannot be imputed to William and because Lynda's speeding was a \"merely fortuitous\" circumstance under\n   <em>\n    Durn\n   </em>\n   .
