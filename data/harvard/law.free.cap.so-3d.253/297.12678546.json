During Fiscal Year 2017, Governor Phil Bryant directed State Fiscal Officer Laura Jackson to reduce the budgets of various state agencies. In response, State Representative Bryant W. Clark and State Senator John Horhn brought a declaratory-judgment action against the Governor in Hinds County Chancery Court. They sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, a writ of mandamus ordering the Governor to reverse the reductions, and a declaration that Mississippi Code Section 27-104-13 (Rev. 2017) was facially unconstitutional. After an expedited hearing, the chancellor denied the motions for injunctive relief and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Representative Clark and Senator Horhn now appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Under our Constitution, the executive has the core power to control the budget of state agencies. Here, the Legislators' arguments that Section 27-104-13 violates the separation-of-powers doctrine miss the mark, as the budget reductions were an exercise of the executive's core constitutional power. Therefore, we affirm the chancellor's final order because Representative Clark and Senator Horhn have failed to overcome the strong presumption that Section 27-104-13 is constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Pursuant to Section 27-104-13, Governor Phil Bryant directed State Fiscal Officer Laura Jackson to reduce the budgets of various state agencies in September 2016, January 2017, February 2017 and March 2017. In September 2016, Governor Bryant and Jackson reduced the budgets of state agencies by a total of $56.8 million. Governor Bryant and Jackson also reduced state agencies' budgets by a total of $51 million in January 2017. In February 2017 and March 2017, among other reductions, Governor Bryant and Jackson reduced the budget of the Mississippi Adequate Education Program (MAEP)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by $19.8 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. On May 17, 2017, State Representative Bryant W. Clark and State Senator John Horhn (collectively, the \"Legislators\") sued Governor Bryant, Jackson, the Mississippi Department of Education and State Treasurer Lynn Fitch (collectively, the \"Executive\"). The Legislators sought a declaration that Section 27-104-13 was facially unconstitutional (or, in the alternative, unconstitutional as applied), a permanent injunction against the Executive's mid-year budget cuts, and a writ of mandamus ordering the Executive to reverse the February 2017 and March 2017 budget reductions to MAEP. The same day, the Legislators also moved for a preliminary injunction against the Executive. On May 30, 2017, the Executive filed its response in opposition to the Legislators' motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. The chancellor held a hearing on the merits of the motion for a preliminary injunction on May 31, 2017. The Legislators and the Executive both argued the merits of the motion. At the close of their arguments, the chancellor convened a conference in chambers. After the conference, the Legislators made an\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   motion pursuant to Rule 65(a)(2) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure for the chancellor \"to consolidate today's hearing with trial on the merits and to issue a decision and a final judgment.\" The chancellor then denied the Legislators' request both for a preliminary and a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. In its written order, filed on June 2, 2017, the chancellor denied the motion for a preliminary injunction. It then granted the Legislators' motion to consolidate the hearing on the preliminary injunction with the trial on the merits. Next, the trial court denied the Legislators' request for permanent injunctive relief and dismissed the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. The Legislators now appeal. For the Legislators, the issue on appeal is whether a statute allowing the Executive Branch to make appropriations decisions violates the separation-of-powers doctrine under the Mississippi Constitution. The Executive maintains that Section 27-104-13 does not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine where \"[t]he executive branch does not improperly perform a function 'at the core' of the power belonging to the Legislature, and [t]he statute fits comfortably within the boundaries of the nondelegation doctrine because it provides adequate standards for the [E]xecutive to follow.\" While we agree with the Executive that Section 27-104-13 is constitutional, we clarify that this case does not implicate separation of powers because the Executive was exercising its own core power under the Constitution. As the Legislators have failed to overcome the presumption that\n   Section 27-104-13 is constitutional, we affirm the chancellor's dismissal of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. \"When addressing a statute's constitutionality, we apply a de novo standard of review, bearing in mind (1) the strong presumption of constitutionality; (2) the challenging party's burden to prove the statute is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) all doubts are resolved in favor of a statute's validity.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The Legislators claim that Section 27-104-13 is unconstitutional and that the Governor's budget reductions violated the doctrine of separation of powers under the state Constitution. They direct us to\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. State\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that Mississippi's separation-of-powers doctrine is absolute, unlike its federal counterpart.\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

The Executive, though, maintains that Section 27-104-13\"is\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   's articulation of separation of powers-played out in statute.\" For the Executive, the budget reductions are a mandated exercise of the Executive's constitutional powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. We begin our analysis of this issue discussing the language of the statutory provisions implicated in this appeal. The challenged statute, Section 27-104-13, provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (2) The Department of Revenue and University Research Center, utilizing all available revenue forecast data, shall annually develop a general fund revenue estimate to be adopted by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee as of the date of sine die adjournment. If, at the end of October, or at the end of any month thereafter of any fiscal year, the revenues received for the fiscal year fall below ninety-eight percent (98%) of the general fund revenue estimate adopted by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee at the date of sine die adjournment, the State Fiscal Officer shall reduce allocations of general funds and state-source special funds to general fund and special fund agencies and to the \"administration and other expenses\" budget of the Mississippi Department of Transportation, in an amount necessary\n   to keep expenditures within the sum of actual general fund receipts, including any transfers to the General Fund from the Working Cash-Stabilization Reserve Fund for the fiscal year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-104-13\">\n    Miss.

While the Court framed the budget-control process as a \"process\" and a \"function,\" it did recognize that budget control is an \"executive\n   <em>\n    power.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649200\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/441/1329/#p1335\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1341 n.4 (emphasis added). The Court explained budget control:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Once taxes have been levied and appropriations made, the legislative prerogative ends, and executive responsibility begins to administer the appropriation and to accomplish its purpose, subject, of course, to any limitations constitutionally imposed by the legislature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    INS v. Chadha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196077\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/919/#p944\">\n    462 U.S. 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196077\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/919/#p944\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196077\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/919/#p944\">\n    77 L.Ed.2d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). We have held above that the constitution does not permit the legislature to directly or indirectly invade the powers and prerogatives of the executive branch of government. The legislature thus may not administer an appropriation once it has been lawfully made and is prohibited from imposing new limitations, restrictions or conditions on\n   the expenditure of such funds, short of full legislative approval.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1341. Section 123 of Mississippi's Constitution supports\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   's analysis. The section reads, \"The Governor shall see that the laws are faithfully executed.\" Miss. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 19. Here, as the Executive's budget reductions were an exercise of the Executive's constitutional power to control the budget, the Legislators have failed to meet their burden to overcome the presumption that Section 27-104-13 is constitutional. Importantly, the Executive's reductions did not affect the Legislative appropriations for any state agency. Instead, the Executive exercised its power of budget control and adjusted the budgets of various state agencies. In other words, the Executive's budget reductions did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers, as the Executive exercised its own core power.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 20. This distinction finds support in Section 63 of Mississippi's Constitution. Section 63 provides that no appropriation bill will be passed that \"does not fix definitely the\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   sum thereby authorized to be drawn from the treasury.\" Miss. Const. art. 4, \u00a7 63 (emphasis added). Thus, an appropriation is a definition of the maximum amount of funds available to a particular agency. An appropriation is not a mandate that the agency must spend the maximum funds granted it. On the contrary, it is an indication to the agency of the maximum sum of funds set aside to it for the fiscal year.\n   <em>\n    See Appropriations\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (\"3. A legislative body's ... act of setting aside a sum of money for a specific purpose.\");\n   <em>\n    Appropriations bill\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (\"A bill that authorizes governmental expenditures.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 21. The text of the appropriation bill at issue supports this conclusion as well. It provides that \"[t]he following sums, or so much of those sums as may be necessary, are appropriated ....\" H.B. 1643, 131st Leg., Reg. Sess. (Miss. 2016). Given the wording of the appropriations bill, the Legislature understood that it was granting the Executive some discretion in the amount of money it actually spent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 22. The Governor (as the head of the executive branch) must faithfully execute\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   laws passed by the Legislature. The Constitution charges the Governor to \"see that the laws are faithfully executed.\" Miss. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 123. In Mississippi, the Legislature has enacted measures to guide the Governor in fulfilling his duties. Here, Section 27-104-13 is based on the requirement that the State operate on a balanced budget.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-103-113\">\n    Miss.

Thus, the Executive was within the sphere of its constitutional authority to control the agencies' budgets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 23. Further, Section 27-104-13 provides the Executive sufficient guidance to execute the appropriation faithfully-according to the will of the Legislature-even when faced with unexpected deficits. The Section determines when the Executive is authorized to adjust the budget of a state agency. It exempts certain agencies' budgets from reduction and limits the percentage amount that an agency's budget may be reduced. Further, Section 27-104-13 requires the Executive to report any reductions to the Legislative Budget Office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-104-13\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-104-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (Rev. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 24. The Governor's reference to appropriations when he instructed Jackson to reduce the various budgets is insufficient to overcome the strong presumption that Section 27-104-13 is constitutional. Specifically, on February 21, 2017, the Governor informed Jackson that he was \"mandating additional cuts\" in order \"[t]o accomplish the $43 million in reductions\n   <em>\n    to FY 2017 appropriations\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) While this may have been poor wording on the part of the Governor to reference a reduction to appropriations as opposed to reductions of the state agencies' budgets, no evidence was offered that the Executive believed that it was reducing the actual appropriations to the agencies. The statement by the Governor must be read in the context of the full letter to Jackson. The Governor carefully laid out his authority for the budget reductions in the full letter. In addition, no evidence was offered to demonstrate that the Governor intended to engage in budget making as opposed to budget control. Thus, the Governor's mention of \"reductions to FY 2017 appropriations\" as opposed to the reductions of the state agencies' budgets does not overcome the strong presumption in favor of the constitutionality of Section 27-104-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 25. The Legislators have failed to overcome the strong presumption that Section 27-104-13 is constitutional. The Executive did not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine; it exercised its own core power to reduce the agencies' budgets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 26. The Executive's budget reductions were a constitutional exercise of the Executive's power to control the budget. The Legislators failed to overcome the strong presumption that Section 27-104-13 is constitutional. Thus, we affirm the chancellor's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 27.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   WALLER, C.J., RANDOLPH AND KITCHENS, P.JJ., KING, MAXWELL, BEAM AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.

My disagreement with the majority seems small, but I think it reaches one of the most fundamental principles embodied in our State's Constitution. In short, the plain language of Article 1, Section 2, of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 suffers no illusion that only \"core\" powers are reserved to the respective branches that exercise them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 29. Section 2 reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   No person or collection of persons, being one or belonging to one of these departments, shall exercise\n   <em>\n    any power\n   </em>\n   properly belonging to either of the others.

However, the above-quoted demarcation from Article 1, Section 2, of the Mississippi Constitution prohibits the branches from sharing \"any power.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 30. Accordingly, I concur with the majority except to the extent that its use of the word \"core\" understates the stark demarcation of powers as described by the use of the phrase \"any power\" in the text of our State's Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   ISHEE, J., JOINS THIS OPINION IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    MAEP is the state school-funding formula.
