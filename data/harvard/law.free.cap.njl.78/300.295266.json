The ash heap was upon defendant\u2019s premises close to the stable, and the fire took place about half-past three o\u2019clock of the morning of February 19th, 1908. The plaintiff, over continuous objections, deemed it necessary for the purpose of his case, to ask the witness Martin these questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>To your knowledge was there a fire at the same place before this ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\"><em>\"Q. </em>When was that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>On the 14th of December, 1901.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And did you make an investigation at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What did you find at that time might cause the fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">\u201c.-\u00cd. Hot ashes against the weather boards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\"><em>\"Q. </em>What burned at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-15\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Weather boards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-16\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you make an investigation of the cause of those weather boards burning at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-18\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Where were those weather boards you speak of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-19\"><em>\u201cA. </em>About the same location as the last fire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-20\">It further appeared from the testimony of this witness that after the 1901 fire a sheet-iron plate had been placed between the ash heap and the stable, and that when this witness reached the scene of the fire shortly after it started, that iron plate was not hot, but cool enough, indeed, to enable Mm to handle it. It will be perceived, therefore, that the conditions preceding the two fires were essentially different.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-21\">The only purpose, apparently, which could actuate the plaintiff in introducing this character of testimony as material to his cause, is the specious reasoning included in the proposition, <em>propter hoc, </em>the fire of 1901 originated; <em>ergo post hoc, </em>the fire in question must have so originated, and it requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>.no elaboration of argument to expose the fallacy of such a syllogism both in logic and in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">fielevancy of testimony, as defined by Stephen, is \u201cthat any two facts to which it is applied are so related to each other that, according to the common course of events, one, either taken by itself or in connection with other facts, proves or renders possible the past, present or future existence of nonexistence of the other.\u201d <em>Steph. Dig. Ev., art. </em>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The testimony in the case made it quite manifest that, since the fire of 1901, conditions had changed, and precautions against fire had been taken by defendant, so that under no reasonable construction of the physical principle of cause and effect could this testimony be applicable. It is inadmissible because of its remoteness in point of time, during which interim changed conditions resulted, but, primarily as is said in one case, \u201cupon grounds of public policy to prevent the multiplication of issues in a case\u201d without apparent connection. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Connell, </em>129 <em>Mass. </em>588; <em>State </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>24 <em>Vroom </em>260; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>New York Central Railroad Co., </em>109 <em>N. Y. </em>243.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">For this reason the judgment is reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
