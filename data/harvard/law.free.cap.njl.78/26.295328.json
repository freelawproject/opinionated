This resolution was adopted by the affirmative vote of six of the members of the board, one member again being absent. A copy of the resolution last above referred to wras presented to the common council at a meeting held on the 17th day of September, 1908, whereupon the common council assumed jurisdiction and passed the ordinance authorizing the construction of said sewer, on the loth day of December, 1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">Among the reasons filed by the prosecutor for setting aside this ordinance are the following: Because neither the resolution passed by the hoard of health on tlie third day of August, 1908, nor the resolution passed November 14th, 1908, was unanimously adopted by said hoard, and because the board of health of the city of Trenton, in adjudging the necessity of the proposed improvement was acting judicially and the prosecutor was entitled to notice and an opportunity to appear before the said board and he heard in respect thereto, which notice was not given, nor was such opportunity afforded.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b67-6\">Before Justices Garrison, Bergen and Voorhees.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-7\">For the prosecutor, <em>Martin P. Devlin.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-8\">For the defendants, <em>William E. Blackman.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b67-10\">Garrison, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av4\">A unanimous vote of all of the members of the board of health is not required by the statute, but only that the \u201cresolution he unanimously adopted by the said board of health.\u201d Granted, therefore, a hoard of health legally constituted and the adoption of the resolution, all present voting and none dissenting, and the statute has been complied with. This distinction is pointed out by Mr. Justice <em>Fort in Crickenberger </em>v. <em>Westfield, </em>42 <em>Vroom </em>467.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The other reason urged for vacating the ordinance is good. The owners of property who, by filing their objections under the statute, had held up the action of city council, should have had notice and an opportunity to appear before the board of health when that tribunal had under consideration the question of fact upon the determination of which the controversy between the city and the property owners depended. Even the written objections that had been filed before council do not appear to have been referred to or considered by the board of health. In'view of the legislative scheme and the situation of the contending parties the action of the board of health was distinctly judicial in character, <em>i. e., </em>it was the decision of a question of fact affecting directly and financially a known class of citizens; it was not the adoption of a general scheme of legislation. The effect of the determination by the board of health was to settle an existing controversy, the result of which was to impose a special burden upon one of the contesting parties, <em>i. e., </em>the landowners. The case indeed goes beyond that of <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Atlantic City, </em>44 <em>Vroom </em>710, in that here two clearly-defined parties were lined up on a well-defined issue made by written objections filed as part of this statutory proceeding. The opinion that settles such a controversy must, in our judgment, be upon notice to the objectors. By the very act of availing themselves of the statutory right to object the objectors acquired a <em>status </em>that entitled them to notice just as by filing remonstrances to the granting of a license th\u00e9 remonstrants acquire a <em>status </em>that entitles them to sue out a writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The ordinance brought up this writ, being based upon a certified opinion of the board of health that was itself improperly given, must be set aside.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
