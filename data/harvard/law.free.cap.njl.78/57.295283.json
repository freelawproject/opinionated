J., May 7/1904.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVn\">\u201cReceived of Albert Banse</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-15\">\u201cTwenty and no/100..................Dollars in full settlement of all claims and demands to the date hereof which I have or may have against said Albert' Banse, and also in full release of the judgment which I recovered against said Albert Banse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-17\">$20.00/100.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-18\">\u201cWitness his</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-19\">\u201cJottn Gray Pr Zeugert Jas. X Roberts.\u201d mark</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The circumstances attending the giving of this receipt were these: Roberts, who was an employe in the works of which Banse, Sr., was superintendent, had sued Banse for slander and-recovered a judgment for $75. A day or so after and before Banse had actually taken the \u201cappeal he was then talking of taking\u201d Roberts came to Banse\u2019s office and stated to Banse, Jr., whom he found.there, that he wanted to settle the ease out of court so that it would not be taken any further. Twenty dollars was agreed upon as the sum for which Roberts would settle the judgment, which was paid over to him in the presence of two fellow-workmen as witnesses called in for that purpose to whom Roberts expressed his satisfaction with the settlement of the suit he had thus made. Banse, Jr., notified his father\u2019s lawyer that the suit was settled, the appeal was dropped, and Banse, Jr., was reimbursed the $20 by Banse, Sr., and so the matter rested until the year 1908, when execution was issued upon the judgment. At this period Banse\u2019s right of review was gone by lapse of time. We find these facts from the testimony, and also that the abandonment of what the parties called \u201cthe appeal\u201d was in effect at the request of Roberts and was understood by both parties to be part of their settlement. On these facts there would be no question as to the defendant\u2019s right to have this judgment canceled were it not for the legal rule illustrated in <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Niagara Fire Insurance Co., </em>29 <em>Vroom </em>216, viz., that the payment of a -less sum in satisfaction of a larger one is no satisfaction. This rule, however, as was said by Mr. Justice Van Syckel in <em>Line </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>9 <em>Id. </em>358, \u201chas been constantly departed from upon slight distinctions\u201d as is generally the case with a technical rule that is not, on the whole, conducive to sound- morals.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">- To the many other grounds of .departure that have been recognized there should be added: \u25a0 that if the debtor, in addition to the payment of a part of the debt as an agreed satisfaction of the whole, does at the request of his creditor some substantial thing of detriment to his interests that he was not bound to do, upon the mutual understanding that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>an additional consideration for the creditor\u2019s promise to accept the less for the larger sum, legal effect may be given to such compact of the parties if the debtor has fully performed his part thereof to his detriment. Both on the ground of a new consideration and on that of estoppel an agreement thus made and performed should obtain legal recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Illustrative cases of the rule in question and its exceptions will be found in 1 <em>Cyc. </em>319 <em>et seq., </em>and in 1 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Encycl. L. </em>413.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In the present ease the dropping of appellate proceedings was a moving cause, and the defendant in consequence of his full performance of an honest compact has deprived himself of his right of review. This, we think, justifies us in carrying out the compact of the parties by ordering that the judgment be canceled and the writ of execution quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">That will be the rule, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
