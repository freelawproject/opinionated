For is there in the declaration any allegation to that effect which the defendant is bound to negative. In its commencement by way of recital it is said that the plaintiff, being a minor, sues by his next friend. But there is no substantive allegation that ho is a minor either there or elsewhere in the declaration. If he was an infant at the time suit was brought, still he might well have been of full age when he subsequently executed the release. If of full age, the release, being a matter of defence arising since the commencement of the action, but before plea, may be pleaded against the further maintenance of the suit. <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>5 <em>Dutcher </em>180; <em>Dryer </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>57 <em>Ala. 551; Kimball </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>3 <em>N. H. </em>101; <em>Wisheart </em>v. <em>Legro, </em>33 <em>Id. </em>177; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>9 <em>Dana (Ky.) </em>193. If the plaintiff was an infant at the time of the execution of the release, that fact would not make the release void. It would only render it voidable. If the plaintiff desires to avoid the release on account of his alleged infancy, he should file a replication setting up his infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">The plea being good, the motion to strike it out is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
