R. 25, the records from the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, the briefs and the oral arguments of counsel. The record reveals that the parties herein entered into a stipulated dismissal at defendants' coast. Thereafter, defendants-appellants ceased making payments on the settlement. The plaintiff-appellee moved for execution on the amount prayed in the complaint less any any payments made pursuant to the settlement. The court, without an evidentiary hearing, granted plaintiff-appellee's motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-22\">The terms of the settlement were not made a part of the record, even though a settlement was reached in a conference in the court's chambers and the court memorialized what is purported to be the settlement's terms on a case file card maintained by the court. <em>See, </em>appellee's brief, Exhibit \"A,\" entry for September 22,1986 (Copy attached as appendix to opinion). This card is not a part of the record, having not been filed with the case, and will not be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-23\">Where parties to an action voluntarily enter into a settlement agreement, the agreement is a binding contract and may be enforced. <em>Spercel </em>v. <em>Sterling Industries </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St. 2d 36. The appellant was entitled to a hearing on the matter since the settlement's terms, which are in dispute, were not part of the record. <em>See, Bolen </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App. 3d 36, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-24\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the matter remanded for a hearing on appellee's motion to enforce the settlement. Such hearing is to be conducted by a judge who was not the trial court judge in the case below so that the original judge is free to testify as a witness at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-25\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-26\">This cause is reversed and remanded to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-27\">It is ordered that appellants recover of appellee their costs herein taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-28\">The Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-29\">It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to carry this judgment into execution.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-30\">BLANCH EKRUPANSKY, P.J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b328-31\">FRANCIS E.
