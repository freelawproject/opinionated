A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">Three small oil paintings by plaintiff Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, a living American artist of worldwide renown, were stolen from a New York gallery owned by her husband, Alfred Stieglitz, in 1946 by some unknown thief. Their whereabouts remained unknown until March 1976, some 30 years after the theft, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>plaintiff discovered them in the possession of defendant Barry Snyder, d/b/a Princeton Gallery of Fine Art, who had purchased them from third party defendant Ulrich A. Frank for $35,000. Plaintiff commenced the present replevin action on May 18,1976 in an attempt to regain their possession. She appeals from summary judgment entered in defendant\u2019s favor adjudging her claim barred by the six-year period of limitations applicable to replevin suits. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The essential facts are relatively free from dispute despite dimmed memories and the death of a prior possessor which has foreclosed knowledge of the date when, and circumstances in which, the paintings passed from the thief to the subsequent possessors. They have been derived from answers to interrogatories and those given by way of oral deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The theft was not reported to the police, plaintiff viewing such official efforts to locate the paintings as being futile. \u201cI was certain [they] could not or would not do anything about what I\u2019m sure they would have thought was a minor theft.\u201d Nor did she confront a man by the name of Estrick, the person she suspected of being the thief. Instead, she hoped that the paintings would be found as were others stolen from the gallery at about the same time. Word of the theft was, however, given to many persons within her artistic circle.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s husband Stieglitz died during the summer of 1946 soon after the theft of the paintings and plaintiff became involved in the settling of his estate over the next three years. As she recited in her affidavit, \u201cI had the burdensome job of settling his estate and could not really pursue the stolen paintings beyond mentioning it to people who were around \u2014 the artists \u2014 the Stieglitz circle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">In February 1947 one Doris Bry began working as plaintiff\u2019s secretary. She and plaintiff discussed the stolen paintings many times over the course of the years although neither reported the loss because plaintiff was convinced such efforts would be unavailing. Eventually, however, in 1972, years before the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>to defendant Snyder, the paintings were listed as stolen with the Art Dealers Association which maintained a registry of stolen paintings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">At some unspecified date and in some unspecified manner after the 1946 theft, the paintings came into possession of third-party defendant\u2019s father, Dr. Ulrich Frank, an art collector. According to his son, Ulrich A. Frank, the paintings were displayed \u201cprominently\u201d on the walls of the residences where his father lived during the period of his possession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Information as to Dr. Frank\u2019s acquisition of these paintings will probably never be known because he died in 1968 before these facts assumed importance in litigation. Third-party defendant Frank acquired the paintings in February 1965 by gift from his mother and father. For the most part, the paintings remained in his homes on display for the next ten years, during part of which period he lived in Yardley, Pennsylvania. In December 1968 the paintings were displayed at a one-day art exhibit at the Jewish Community Center in Trenton, the owner being there listed as Anonymous. In 1978 all three paintings were consigned to the Danenberg Gallery in New York for sale. Finding no purchaser for them, the Gallery returned them to Frank. In March 1974 they were consigned to defendant Snyder for sale and in March 1975 Snyder purchased the three paintings for $35,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">O\u2019Keeffe first learned of the whereabouts of the paintings from an associate in New York who informed her that the paintings had been offered for sale to the Andrew Crispo Gallery in New York, presumably when under consignment to the Danenberg Gallery. From this information plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>able to locate the paintings in Snyder\u2019s Princeton gallery in March 1976. Her demand for the paintings was rejected and on May 18, 1976 she filed the present suit. Defendant concedes that plaintiff lacked knowledge as to the whereabouts of the paintings between February 1946 and February 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In her complaint plaintiff simply sought possession of the paintings which she alleged to have been stolen from her. Defendant\u2019s amended answer denied the essential allegations of the complaint and set out, as separate defenses, that (1) he was the owner of the paintings, (2) plaintiff\u2019s claim was barred by laches, (3) plaintiff\u2019s claim was barred by limitation, and (4) he held valid title by adverse possession. The record contains no responsive pleadings by third-party defendant Frank and plaintiff has filed no subsequent amendment to the complaint asserting any cause of action against him. Following discovery by way of interrogatories and oral depositions, plaintiff and defendant filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In an oral opinion granting defendant\u2019s motion and denying plaintiff\u2019s, the trial judge held that \u201cdefendant has simply failed to establish several of the basic requirements of adverse possession.\u201d He found that defendant\u2019s possession and that of those preceding him and upon which he relies was not a \u201ccontinual possession which was visible, open and notorious so as to put the plaintiff directly or impliedly on notice of the defendant\u2019s possession.\u201d Nonetheless, he held plaintiff\u2019s suit barred by passage of the statutory six-year period of time <em>(NJ.S.A. </em>2A:14-1), holding that her cause of action accrued at the time of the original theft in 1946. The indulgence of the discovery rule was denied plaintiff because \u201cshe failed to confront anyone or take any action at that time [at the time of the theft] against anyone, including a possible thief named Estrick. She simply did nothing.\u201d Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We start our consideration of this interesting case with an attempt to focus upon the narrow issue before us. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>virtually concedes that plaintiff lost possession of the paintings by theft. Indeed, he has no other choice given plaintiff\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, the affidavits of others that record conversations, antedating by years the present controversy, concerning this theft and the whereabouts of the stolen paintings, and the listing of the paintings as stolen in 1972 in a registry of stolen art years before defendant acquired title. Defendant also concedes the indisputable proposition of law that a thief acquires no title to the property stolen by him and can pass none to others regardless of their good faith and ignorance of the theft. <em>Joseph </em>v. <em>Lesnevich, </em>56 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 346 (App.Div. 1959); <em>Ashton v. Allen, </em>70 <em>N.J.L. </em>117, 119 (Sup.Ct.1903); <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 229, comment (e) at 448 (1965); <em>Prosser, Torts </em>(4 ed. 1971), \u00a7 15 at 87. It follows, then, that defendant must concede plaintiff\u2019s title to the paintings in question subject to her challenged right to assert that title and claim the paintings. If defendant is to retain the paintings, it is only as a result of the passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The time within which a suit in replevin must be brought is specified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1 as being within six years of the date on which the cause of action accrues. The essential question posed for resolution by the trial court and us is when did plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrue. Did the six-year period for suit commence running with the 1946 theft? Did it start running anew with each subsequent transfer of the paintings as against each successive new possessor? Does plaintiff\u2019s ignorance concerning the whereabouts of the paintings and in whose possession they were at any given time affect the running of the statutory period? Does the good faith or absence of it on the part of those who acquire possession through the thief affect the manner in which the statutory time period runs? How, if at all, does the doctrine of adverse possession affect the running of the statutory period? These are the areas of inquiry about which we must be concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Although authority concerning limitations of actions to recover possession of chattels is not plentiful, we do not write on a clean slate. The controlling authority of <em>Redmond v. New Jersey Historical Society, </em>132 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>464, 473-476 (E. &amp; A.1942), held principles of adverse possession, traditionally applicable to real property, to apply as well to personalty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">Dean Ames, in fully considering this question, contrasts the Roman and the English laws on the subject. He persuasively demonstrates, by a wealth of authorities, that other courts, when considering personalty, have consistently applied the same rules of law concerning the necessary requisites of adverse possession that they applied when considering the question of adverse possession of realty. The basis for this like application of principle is, in our opinion, sound and just. We adopt it. [at 473]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">This being a decision of our then court of last resort, we are permitted to do no less. Defendant, who raised the issue as a defense, agrees, as does plaintiff who prevailed thereon, as a matter of fact, in the trial court. See also, <em>Lightfoot v. Davis, </em>198 <em>N.Y. </em>261, 91 <em>N.E. </em>582 (Cr.App.1910); 3 <em>American Law of Property, </em>\u00a7 15.16 at 834-838 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Defendant does not challenge the summary nature of the ruling on the adverse possession issue by referring to unresolved issues of fact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, he contends that the asserted incorrect resolution of this issue stemmed from an error of law. Our own review of the record convinces us that the issue was properly susceptible of summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">One claiming title to property by reason of adverse possession must establish possession for the statutory period which is \u201cactual and exclusive \u2014 adverse and hostile \u2014 visible or notorious \u2014 continued and uninterrupted.\u201d <em>Foulke v. Bond, </em>41 <em>N.J.L. </em>527, 545 (E. &amp; A.1879). With minor changes, not here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>relevant (see <em>Mannillo v. Gorski, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>378 (1969)), those factual requisites of adverse possession have remained unchanged to .the present. Moreover, established principles squarely place the burden of proving each of these essential elements of adverse possession on the one claiming title on that basis, and such burden is satisfied only by evidence of a clear and positive nature. <em>Wilomay Holding Co. v. Peninsula Land Co., </em>36 <em>N.J.Super. </em>440, 443 (App.Div.1955); <em>Redmond v. New Jersey Historical Society, supra </em>132 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>at 473-474.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Defendant\u2019s failure of proof, according to the trial judge, centered on the requirements of visibility and notoriety of the possession. Although not thoroughly discussed, the trial judge apparently viewed the intramural residential display of the paintings and a one-day display at a local art exhibit as insufficient to establish a visible and notorious possession. The conclusion reached is in our view indisputably correct in light of the essential purpose for those requirements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">The requirement of the eight adjectives noted above [actual and exclusive, visible and notorious, continued and interrupted, hostile and adverse] * * * is consequently designed to flag to the true owner the necessity of taking timely legal action * * *. <em>[Brewer v. Porch, </em>98 <em>N.J.Super. </em>583, 588 (App.Div.1968), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 53 <em>N.J. </em>167 (1969)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Hence, title by adverse possession may never be acquired by mere possession however long continued \u201cwhich is not such as will give unmistakable notice of the nature of the occupant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Mannillo v. Gorski, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>at 388; 5 <em>Thompson, Real Property, </em>\u00a7 2546 at 619-624 (1979). Display in one\u2019s home provides to the true owner no more notice of the possessor\u2019s claim or warning of the need for timely legal action than would its retention in a closet. Neither mode of possession is such as to afford the true owner a realistic opportunity to regain possession by legal action.-</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Defendant does not seem to disagree. Rather, he contends that <em>Joseph v. Lesnevich, </em>56 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 355, placed a \u201crealistic limitation\u201d on the character of the possession required for adverse possession of chattels when it required that the bonds, title to which was in issue in that case, be held \u201cas openly and notoriously as the nature of the property would permit * Accordingly, defendant contends, the paintings were possessed as openly and visibly as their nature permits, and that his title by adverse possession was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We do not so read <em>Joseph v. Lesnevich, </em>which did not, except incidentally in connection with \u201ctacking,\u201d apply adverse possession as a means of barring plaintiff\u2019s action. Although the court did use the quoted words, it did so only in explanation of its ruling that defendants therein did not fraudulently conceal from plaintiff the latter\u2019s cause of action, thereby negativing that basis for tolling the running of the period of limitation. Use of the quoted phrase was not, as we read the opinion, an attempt to redefine the meaning of the visibility and notoriety requirements for adverse possession traditionally applied in realty cases for use in connection with adverse possession of chattels.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Moreover, we reject the modification in the meaning of visible and notorious possession defendant suggests be applied to chattels as a total defeat of the primary purposes of such requirements and as essentially inconsistent with recent compromises in the law\u2019s policy of repose, represented by acceptance of the so-called \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d to accommodate the just needs of claimants who would otherwise be deprived of all practical opportunity to assert their rights. See <em>Fernandi v. Strully, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>434 (1961), which expressly overruled <em>Weinstein v. Blanchard, </em>109 <em>N.J.L. </em>332 (E. &amp; A.1932), upon which <em>Joseph v. Lesnevich, supra, </em>so strongly relied. In our view, if a display of the chattel is not such as to give notice to the true owner of the chattel\u2019s whereabouts, the latter\u2019s claim therefor cannot be barred; our adoption of the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d applicable in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>contexts, demonstrates our rejection of the notion that one can be barred from asserting a right before he was afforded a real opportunity to assert it.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We fully recognize that by adoption of this view, applying all of the requirements for the adverse possession of land to chattels, we are in many, if not in most, cases foreclosing any real opportunity to acquire adverse title to stolen personalty. Jewelry, for instance, often the subject of theft, is not capable of museum display, except in extraordinary circumstances and, being small and designed primarily for personal wear, does not lend itself to the kind of display that would call an owner\u2019s attention to its possessor\u2019s potential adverse claim. Clearly, in such a case, title to jewelry stolen in California and subjected to country club display on the person of an innocent purchaser in New Jersey cannot vest title by adverse possession in the latter because the true owner in California was denied a fair opportunity of regaining title. To hold otherwise would reject reality in favor of the fiction that the character of the possession has been such as to place the true owner on notice of the need for prompt legal action. Such, however, are the difficulties inherent in applying to chattels principles of adverse possession developed with respect to land. No owner of land can be deprived of knowledge of where his land is. If he lacks such knowledge, it' is only because he lacks knowledge of his ownership, not of the land\u2019s location, ignorance entirely independent of and not resulting from a trespass or the action of a person from whom the defendant claims. Many chattels are, of course, small and even when openly held may not give notice of claimant\u2019s adverse possession to the true owner. In many cases both the owner and the possessor are equally innocent; one must bear the loss. The question is, and always has been, who of these two innocents must bear the loss? Where adverse possession is concerned, the law favors the owner, at least where he has been deprived of opportunity to defend his title, by the imposition of the several requirements to a title by adverse possession, all of which must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>be proved by clear and convincing evidence by the adverse claimant. We merely give effect to that policy in applying such law to personalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In this case the paintings were very small ones. They were stolen in New York, were thereafter kept out of artistic circulation in the major metropolitan galleries and museums, being displayed only on the walls of the several residences of their successive possessors. We assume that defendant and his predecessors lacked the intention to conceal them. The effect, however, on plaintiff\u2019s opportunity to recover them was the same as if they had had that intention. She could not have filed suit in New Jersey or elsewhere. In point of fact, we now know that they were kept for a time in Yardley, Pennsylvania, and thereafter in Princeton, N. J. Plaintiff, living in the far West, could not have known that. And, significantly, once they did appear on the New York art scene, when offered for sale to a New York gallery, plaintiff learned of their whereabouts and the present litigation was commenced. In our view, the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that the paintings were possessed in an open, visible and notorious manner was entirely justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">It yet remains to consider the legal significance of that conclusion. The trial judge apparently viewed as separate the questions of limita,tion and adverse possession, holding that although title by adverse possession had not been established, plaintiffs claim was nonetheless barred by limitation, the six-year period having commenced running with the theft in 1946. We view these two issues as being the same, and hence reach the contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">With respect to property, real or personal, the bar by limitations extinguishes not only the remedy afforded to recover the property, but the right thereto as well. Indeed, the only vice to the title of the person in possession of such property is the right of the true owner to assert his own title. Once that vice is removed by passage of time, the prescriptive right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>obtained by the possessor entitles him to pass his own good title to others, including the owner. Indeed, once title to adverse possession vests, the true owner can only regain title by purchase, gift or by himself proving the requisites of an adverse possession. \u201cAnd it is as true of chattels as of land that a prescriptive title is as effective for all purposes as a title by grant.\u201d Ames, \u201cThe Disseisin of Chattels,\u201d 3 <em>Harv.L.Rev. </em>317, 321 (1889-90). The \u201cperpetual injunction\u201d against enforcement of the true owner\u2019s right to his property virtually destroys that right. <em>Id. </em>This concept received express recognition in <em>Rowe v. Bonneau-Jeter Hardware Co., </em>245 <em>Ala. </em>326, 16 So.2d 689, 694, 158 <em>A.L.R. </em>1266 (Sup.Ct.1943), in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">Although as a general rule the statute of limitations operates only on the remedy, not on the right, as to the recovery of property it operates as to both. * * * So that in such suits the statute of limitations serves to cut the plaintiff off from the enforcement of his right of recovery by vesting such right in the respondent by adverse possession. As a defense to such a suit the statute of limitations and adverse possession are inseparable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">See also, 51 <em>Am.Jur</em>.2d, <em>Limitation of Actions, </em>\u00a7 22 at 606. Dean Ames reached the same conclusion in rejecting the view that as to property, statutes of limitation bar only remedies, not rights: \u201cAn immortal right to bring an eternally prohibited action is a metaphysical subtlety that the present writer cannot pretend to understand.\u201d <em>Ames, supra </em>at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Although not expressly enunciated, <em>Redmond v. New Jersey Historical Society, supra, </em>was decided on that basis. In that case, involving the attempted recovery of a valuable painting from the defendant society, the court held that because the possession was not adverse, plaintiff\u2019s claim was not barred even though the Society had possession thereof for 50 years. That <em>Redmond </em>viewed the defenses of limitations and adverse possession as but one defense is disclosed in the language of its holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Its [Society\u2019s] possession was not \u201cadversary.\u201d On the contrary, its possession, in our opinion, was merely \u201cpermissive\u201d however otherwise presently characterized by either party, and, therefore, no claim of \u201cadverse possession\u201d can be successfully maintained by the Society. * * * We so hold. The statute of limitations did not bar complainants\u2019 right of recovery. [132 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>at 475] <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Hence, actions for the recovery of property, real or personal, of the character required by the law of adverse possession, has persisted throughout the statutory period of limitations. With respect to real property, that period is 20 or 30 years. With respect to personal property, that period is six years. In both cases, however, the property must be possessed for the required period in the required manner. If one of the essential ingredients to adverse possession is missing, the claim for the property is simply not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In this connection it should be observed that neither the statutes of limitation barring rights of entry into real estate nor the statute specifying the period within which suits to recover personal property must be brought recites the requirements for adverse possession. Both types of statutes are essentially couched in terms of limitation similar to the statutes barring personal injury claims. Nonetheless, all judicial authority construing such enactments read into them the essential requirements of adverse possession. See <em>DeBow v. Hatfield, </em>35 <em>N.J.Super. </em>291 (App.Div,1955), certif. den. 19 <em>N.J. </em>327 (1955). Where such elements are not proved, the claim for the property is not barred. <em>Predham v. Holfester, </em>32 <em>N.J.Super. </em>419 (App.Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>1954). When the trial judge rejected defendant\u2019s claim of title to the paintings by adverse possession, he necessarily disposed of the defense of limitation as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Hence, by reason of <em>Redmond, supra, </em>and its necessary implications which we have attempted to explore herein, the elements of adverse possession have become part and parcel of the statute of limitations governing replevin actions. Where the elements, or any of them, are absent, the claim is not barred whenever the right may have accrued, or however long the converter\u2019s possession may have persisted, as has traditionally been the rule with respect to real property. As applied to the present case, the failure of defendant to establish that his and his predecessors\u2019 possession was sufficiently visible and notorious necessarily required not only that his defense of adverse possession be rejected, but the defense of limitation as well. They were, in truth, the same defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In direct answer to the questions posed at the outset of this opinion, a cause of action for replevin accrues, in the sense that the statutory time in which suit must be brought starts runnings, when the possession by the defendant, or by those claiming through him, assumes the characteristic elements of adverse possession. See 5 <em>Thompson, Real Property, </em>\u00a7 2552 at 660 (1979). Although a theoretical cause of action may exist before that time, the statutory period does not run against it. Once it starts running, it continues against subsequent possessors possessing the chattel in the same way; it does not start running anew with each subsequent conversion. <em>Joseph v. Lesnevich, supra. </em>Plaintiff\u2019s ignorance of the whereabouts of his property does not affect the running of the statute if the possession has the required openness and notoriety; where possession is held clearly and unequivocally, knowledge of the true owner will be presumed. 5 <em>Thompson, Real Property, </em>\u00a7 2546 at 619 (1979). The good faith of the possessors who nonetheless fail to possess the chattel openly and notoriously has no effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>on the running of the statutory period. Finally, the defenses of adverse possession and limitation are the same on the theory that the law refuses to recognize a title it will not protect. 3 <em>American Law of Property, </em>\u00a7 15.16 at 834 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In our view, the result reached is the just one given the difficult circumstances of this case. Plaintiff and defendant are assumed to be innocent parties. As to plaintiff the trial judge found, with ample justification, that the manner in which the successive possessors of the paintings held them failed to afford her adequate opportunity to take legal action to protect her interest in them. There is no question but that she is their owner. She should not be deprived of her property without having been afforded such an opportunity. That she did not report the theft to the police in 1946 is beside the point. She may well have been right that such an effort would have proved fruitless. The suspected thief may have been proved entirely innocent. Thirty years later we cannot know one way or the other. In any event, she cannot be deprived of her property on such remote speculation. Moreover, her lack of action did not, as the trial judge suggested it did, deprive defendant or his predecessors of the opportunity of proving their title. Clearly, she has title, and defendants have never seriously asserted otherwise. Had she been successful in earlier recovering her paintings, the result would have been that third-party defendant would never have enjoyed their possession for so many years without paying anything therefor. Although there doubtless will be cases where an innocent converter will be forced to take a substantial loss as a result of our holding, this case does not appear to be one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Moreover, defendant Snyder was not without means of self-protection. He was not a novice in dealing with art works. He purchased the paintings without provenance. He was thus aware of the uncertain history of the paintings\u2019 ownership. The artist, however, is alive and it was always open to him to check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>with her as to their authenticity and the legitimacy of his purchase. He elected to take his chances with this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Because we have detected no real dispute concerning the larcenous origin of defendant\u2019s possession, and our independent review of his record convinces us of the absence of any genuine controversy concerning that fact, we see no obstacle to entry of a judgment for return of the paintings to plaintiff. All that remains to be tried is the third-party claim wherein defendant seeks to recover from third-party defendant the monies paid for the paintings.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The judgment is reversed, judgment is entered for plaintiff, and the case remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\">An affidavit by one Lloyd Goodrich, made after entry of the summary judgment appealed from, suggesting that the three paintings were listed as stolen as of 1946 in a stolen painting list, was improperly included as part of appellant\u2019s appendix and does not figure in this opinion. <em>Bridgewater Tp. v.

Moreover, the fact that the decision was not based upon the claim having been asserted less than a year after the Society\u2019s refusal to surrender the painting reinforces our reading of the case that with respect to claims of property, real or personal, the defenses of adverse possession and limitation are one and the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b118-7\">FRITZ, P. J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AXz\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">I agree wholly with the majority that the result below was wrong and that the judgment entered thereon must be reversed. But the basis upon which I would found that conclusion is vastly different from that upon which they agree. One of the consequences of this disparity in our thinking is that I am not prepared to enter judgment for plaintiff but simply to say that it is entirely possible plaintiff is not precluded from her remedy by the statute of limitations and to return the matter for different proceedings from the limited ones the majority has ordered. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The principal disagreement I have with the majority springs from my conviction that the statutory bar of limitations found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1 was intended to do no more with respect to the asportation of chattels than foreclose a remedy in appropriate circumstances. It follows that I must disagree as well with an identity, espoused by the majority, between the statute of limitations dealing with personal property and the rule of adverse possession, and with their statement that \u201cWith respect to property, real or personal, the bar by limitations extinguishes not only the remedy afforded to recover the property, but the right thereto as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Supportive of my conclusion, to my way of thinking, is the vast difference in language between that statute and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-6 having to do with real property and from whence springs our adverse possession rule relating to land. Section 1 expressly requires that \u201c[e]very action at law * * * for replevin * * * shall be commenced within 6 years next after the cause of * * * action shall have accrued,\u201d and nothing more. Section 6, on the other hand, explicitly and precisely directs that unless entry upon real estate by the right or title owner is made within 20 years, that right or title shall \u201cbe barred * * * thereafter.\u201d In view of this I must except also to the observation of the majority that \u201c[bjoth types of statutes are essentially couched in terms of limitation similar to the statutes barring personal injury claims.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As is the case with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1, the personal injury limitation statute speaks only in terms of a time limitation for commencement of the action. Couched in wholly different language, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-6 legislates in terms of a loss of the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">It is clear beyond the need for citation, as the majority points out, that adverse possession with respect to land, springing from the operation of \u00a7 6, divests the owner of title. In fact, the statute says so. I think that is not so with regard to personal property, not only because the statute does not dictate that result, but also because in the absence of statutory divestment, our law strives mightily to protect title. We know that a thief acquires no title by a wrongful taking and cannot convey title to personalty. Even a bona fide purchaser of personal property from the thief does not acquire a good title as against the owner. <em>Kutner Buick, Inc. v. Strelecki, </em>111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>89, 97 (Ch.Div.1970). Justice (then Judge) Proctor has characterized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>possession by a thief as \u201ca continuing wrong.\u201d <em>National Retailers Mutual Ins. Co. v. Gambino, </em>1 <em>N.J.Super. </em>627, 629 (Law Div.1948). Acquisition of personal property by a criminal act generally prevents a conferring of good title even to a bona fide purchaser. 67 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Sales, </em>\u00a7 257 at 391. The Uniform Commercial Code provides that a purchaser of goods acquires only the \u201ctitle which his transferor had or had power to transfer,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-403, which in the case of a thief is none.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">As ancient and respected an authority as Sir William Blackstone tells us the compelling and, it seems to me, eternal reasons for this, with logic as pure today as it was then:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">* * * [W]hen I once have gained a rightful possession of any goods or chattels, either by a just occupancy or by a legal transfer, whoever either by fraud or force dispossess me of them, is guilty of a transgression against the law of society, which is a kind of secondary law of nature. For there must be an end of all social commerce between man and man, unless private possessions be secured from unjust invasions: and, if an acquisition of goods by either force or fraud were allowed to be a sufficient title, all property would soon be confined to the most strong, or the most cunning; and the weak and simple-minded part of mankind (which is by far the most numerous division) could never be secure of their possessions. [3 <em>Blackstone, Commentaries, </em>* 145]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">I am satisfied that if an owner were able to recover possession of his personal property from a thief by peaceable self-help, even though it was long beyond six years following the theft, the thief should have no cause of action for the return of the chattels. Because of affirmative legislative commitment by statute such cannot be said of a thief who \u201csteals\u201d land by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>virtue of 20-year possession and invocation of the doctrine of adverse possession. It is well enough to say, as does the majority, that we will not declare a right for which there is no remedy. I think we ought not transgress on that which may well be legislative prerogative to say that what that really means is where there is no remedy <em>at law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">I am also convinced that the basic and substantial differences between realty and personalty, not the least of which is the immovability of realty and its constant availability to public view \u2014 qualities hardly ever present with respect to personalty\u2014 raise insurmountable barriers to the intelligent, wholesale and strict application to personalty of the doctrine of adverse possession as we have applied it to real property. It is notable that even <em>Redmond v. New Jersey Historical Society, </em>132 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>464 (E. &amp; A.1942), does not equate adverse possession of realty with that of chattels. Rather it holds for a \u201clike application of principle.\u201d (At 474.) Even this, I think, is not sound if it imposes a judge-made conveyance of title in an area where the Legislature has clearly \u2014 by contrast of the language in \u00a7 1 with that of \u00a7 6 \u2014 opted otherwise. The harm is aggravated by our lip service to the protection of title to chattels, as above. To the extent that Dean Ames\u2019 proclamation of 90 years ago, quoted by the majority, is thought to represent the weight of present authority, it is difficult to reconcile it with the frequently-demonstrated proposition that, absent statute, a thief can never secure good title short of the owner\u2019s grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">But I agree wholly with the majority that we are not free to decide differently from our court of last resort, <em>In re Education Ass\u2019n of Passaic, Inc., </em>117 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255 (App.Div.1971), certif. den. 60 <em>N.J. </em>198 (1972), and I must yield to this superior precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">This is not to say that recognition of the application to personalty of a rule of adverse possession requires that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>judge-made doctrine be cloned to the statute of limitations. I see no reason why we should not instead gear it to the title-defeating statute which was the progenitor of the doctrine <em>(N.J. S.A. </em>2A:14-6) and refuse to lend our aid to thieves and their successors for any period of time less than that chosen to benefit squatters on land. The Legislature chose six years in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1. But they did not choose to vest title in other than an owner. If we do that as judges \u2014 as it would appear that both Dean Ames and the <em>Redmond </em>court would do \u2014 what is there that binds us to the legislative term?</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">My argument with the majority is only with respect to its superimposition of the doctrine of adverse possession upon the statute. Were it not for my concern that what we say here might develop into a handbook for larceny, I might well not have dissented. Manifestly, I do not disagree with my colleagues in their thesis that the time during which the successor to a thief profits at the expense of the victim of the thief is tolled for statute of limitation purposes until the owner knows (or should reasonably be expected to know) of his cause of action and the defendant or defendants. We have determined, as a matter of policy in New Jersey, that whether we are considering adverse possession or the bar of a statute of limitations, one with the color of title, whether it be to a parcel of realty or a cause of action for negligence, for instance, should not have that right defeated until a sufficient time after he or she knows, actually or constructively, of the existence of the right and the reasons for which it might be asserted against the defendant he or she has chosen. With respect to realty this knowledge has been framed traditionally in terms of adverse possession and depends, among other things, on the notoriety and visibility of adverse claim. <em>Mannillo v. Gorski, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>378 (1969). With respect to negligence, statutes of limitation are implicated and we have postulated this knowledge in terms of the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d as framing a time of the accrual of a cause of action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>Lopez v. Swyer, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>237 (App.Div.1971), aff\u2019d 62 <em>N.J. </em>267 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The policy in either case clearly is to limit the abridgement of claims on the reasonable, equitable, just and fair ground that a person ought not be deprived of a lawful claim, to the benefit of less lawful actors, until \u2014 as I observed above \u2014 he or she has actual or constructive knowledge of the existence of the right and the reasons for which it might be asserted against the defendant he or she has chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In sum: bound as I am by <em>Redmond, </em>I would hold that the period of adverse possession with respect to chattels should not be less than that afforded real property. For the reasons given by the majority, with which I am in complete agreement in this respect, I would further hold that in any event, adverse possession will not prevail against plaintiff in the circumstances of this case. Finally, I would apply the so-called \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d of <em>Lopez v. Swyer, supra, </em>with regard to the defensive bar of limitations and remand it to the trial judge for plenary hearing, followed by findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which \u201cthe equitable claims of opposing parties must be identified, evaluated and weighed,\u201d (62 <em>N.J. </em>at 274) and a decision predicated upon the <em>Lopez v. Swyer </em>guidelines reached.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 14-2:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Every action at law for an injury to the person caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of any person within this state shall be commenced within 2 years next after the cause of any such action shall have accrued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">An interesting variation on the theme is to be found in <em>Lieber v. Mohawk Arms, Inc., </em>64 <em>Misc.2d </em>206, 314 N.Y.S.2d 510 (Sup.Ct. 1970), where the \u201cowner,\u201d who apparently had himself stolen the chattels from Adolph Hitler, was awarded recovery from a bona fide purchaser who had purchased from a thief. As against defendant\u2019s charge there that plaintiff was himself a thief the court buttressed its determination by reference to a statutory enactment of Louisiana transferring title to a possessor after ten years of uninterrupted possession. New Jersey, of course, has no such statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
