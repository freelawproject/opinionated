He was also convicted of larceny of property valued at over $200. On appeal he contends: (1) it was error to deny his motion for judgments of acquittal; (2) it was error to deny his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>new trial motion because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, and (3) it was plain error to fail to dismiss the larceny charge because the property defendant was accused of taking was turned over to him with the knowledge and consent of its owner by prearrangement with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The first two issues are so clearly meritless as to require no discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). The last one, the subject of conflicting decisions elsewhere, has not previously been decided in any reported case in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In the present case the evidence would have allowed the jury to conclude that Larry Steel, a coconspirator, approached Donald Crowe, an employee of Rickel\u2019s Department Store. Steel offered to exchange drugs for store merchandise. Unknown to the would-be thief, the store employee was an undercover investigator employed by the store. He reported the incident to his supervisor and the police were called.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">On the day of the planned theft Crowe, the store employee, and his supervisor gathered together the merchandise that Steel, the coconspirator, had asked for. While police officers watched, the goods were turned over to Steel, defendant and. another man. The jury could have believed that defendant had been present during a prior conversation in the store with the undercover investigator and that he therefore had participated in the planning and execution of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">After the goods were turned over to the three men and loaded into their truck, defendant drove away. Before he could leave Rickel\u2019s lot he was apprehended and arrested. Defendant contends that since the owner voluntarily surrendered custody and possession of the merchandise, trespass \u2014 an essential element of the crime of larceny \u2014 was lacking and he is entitled to a judgment dismissing the larceny charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Larceny is \u201cthe wrongful or fraudulent taking and carrying away by any person of the personal property of another, from any place, with a fraudulent intent to deprive the owner of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>property.\u201d <em>State v. Leicht, </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 131 (App.Div. 1973). It is fundamental that the property must be taken without the consent of the owner. <em>Id. </em>at 133. Ordinarily, larceny is not committed where property is taken \u201cwith the full knowledge and consent of the owner or his authorized servant or agent, however guilty may be the taker\u2019s intent.\u201d 50 <em>Am.Jur</em>.2d, <em>Larceny, </em>\u00a7 23 at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Nevertheless, it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the owner has consented to the taking. The difficulties have been summarized in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">* * * There is no * * * larceny in cases where the owner parts with his personal property voluntarily and with knowledge that the taker intends to appropriate it to his own use. * * * [I]f the owner * * * voluntarily parts with both the possession and the title to the alleged thief, not expecting the goods to be returned to him or to be disposed of in accordance with his directions, then neither the taking nor the conversion amounts to larceny * \u201d . A felonious conversion of another\u2019s property by one having bare charge or custody of it involves a trespass and constitutes larceny, notwithstanding that such custody was acquired with the consent of the owner. [50 Am.Jur.2d, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 23 at 175-176]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Courts in some jurisdictions have drawn rather fine distinctions where owners of property have given it over to a would-be thief with the purpose of apprehending him. In Annotation, \u201cLarceny: Entrapment or Consent,\u201d 10 <em>A.L.R.3d </em>1121, 1125 (1966), these distinctions were summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">Where a property owner, having knowledge of a larcenous scheme, furnishes the property to be handed over to the accused, he may be held to have consented to the taking so that the accused is not guilty of larceny. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">On the other hand,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-12\">An owner\u2019s authorization of his employee to participate in a larcenous enterprise planned by the accused has been held not to constitute entrapment or consent to the taking. The participation of a coconspirator who has informed on the other conspirators has also been held not to constitute entrapment or consent. [Id. at 1125]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">There is respectable authority to the effect that there can be no larceny when a property owner willingly turns his property over to a would-be thief in order to apprehend him. <em>People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>Seligman, </em>35 A.D.2d 591, 313 N.Y.S.2d 593 (App.Div.1970), aff\u2019d 28 N.Y.2d 788, 321 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>901, 270 N.E.2d 721 (Ct.App.1971), rearg. den. 29 N.Y.2d 514, 323 N.Y.S.2d 982, 272 N.E.2d 490 (Ct.App.1971). There defendants engaged in a scheme to solicit money illegally. They convinced one property owner to turn $5,000 over to them to be used as a bribe for a nonexistent government official. They approached a second property owner, who reported to the police. When he turned the money over to defendants the police immediately arrested them. The New York Appellate Division held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">* * * [U]nder no view of the evidence can defendants be deemed guilty of consummated or attempted <em>common-law </em>larceny. The essence of common-law larceny is the taking of property without the owner\u2019s consent. [Citation omitted.] Neither Schiller nor Roe [the victims] involuntarily parted with his money. Therefore these convictions must be reversed (see <em>People v. Rollino, </em>37 Misc.2d 14, 233 N.Y.S.2d 580 (1962). [313 N.Y.S.2d at 598; emphasis in original]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In <em>People v. Rollino, </em>37 <em>Misc.2d </em>14, 233 N.Y.S.2d 580 (Sup.Ct. 1962), the court also concluded that a would-be thief could not be guilty of larceny \u201cwhen the coveted property is turned over to him with the knowledge and consent of the owner, by one of its agents, by pre-arrangement with the police, in order to supply a basis for the miscreant\u2019s criminal prosecution.\u201d 233 N.Y.S.2d at 581. See also, <em>State v. Durham, </em>196 N.W.2d 428 (Iowa Sup.Ct.1972), where the court held that a defendant could not be guilty of larceny because the owner turned money over to him so that the police could observe the transaction and arrest defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Nevertheless, courts in other jurisdictions on similar facts have reached the opposite conclusion. In 10 A.L.R.3d, <em>supra </em>at 1134, the author states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">There is another set of cases where someone is approached with a proposition to participate in a larceny, but communicates with the police or with his employer before he consents to participate, and is told to pretend to join in the plan to commit larceny. In such cases it has been held that the prior knowledge on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>part of the police or the employer who usually communicates with the police about the matter, does not constitute consent or entrapment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">See <em>State v. Smith, </em>33 <em>Nev. </em>438, 117 P. 19 (Sup.Ct.1911); <em>Commonwealth v. Dougherty, </em>18 <em>Pa.Dist. </em>857, 37 <em>Pa.Co. </em>62 (D.Ct.1909); <em>Jarrott v. State, </em>108 <em>Tex.Cr.R. </em>427, 1 <em>S.W.2d </em>619 (Ct.Crim.App.1927); <em>State v. Peterson, </em>109 Wash. 25, 186 <em>P. </em>264 (Sup.Ct.1919). We believe that these cases are better-reasoned and adopt the rule articulated in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In this case the owner of the property, at best, gave mere custody to defendant and his accomplices. It has been held \u201cthat one to whom property is delivered by the owner for some limited, special, or temporary purpose may be regarded as having its custody only, and as capable of committing larceny thereof.\u201d <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure </em>(Anderson 1957), \u00a7 466 at 107. Like the owner of the property in <em>State v. Leicht, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 133, this owner retained constructive possession of the property and when defendant received the property for a limited and temporary purpose he had \u201cbare charge\u201d of it. The owner did not consent to defendant\u2019s taking the property away.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">We find no plain error in the trial judge\u2019s failure to dismiss the larceny charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
