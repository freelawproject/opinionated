Because the sentencing judge participated in discussion of plea negotiations in violation of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(e) the conviction must be reversed and the case remanded with instructions to vacate Corbitt\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-19\">On Friday, January 25, 1991, the district court conducted a status conference and change of plea hearing for Corbitt and four co-defendants. When the pleadings began at 9:15 a.m., counsel for one of the defendants asked the court to extend the time for plea negotiations until Monday afternoon January 28, stating that he had \u201cjust received some new possibilities this morning that I need to convey to [my client].\u201d Other counsel concurred. The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEt\">\u2018 THE COURT: Well, let\u2019s just go to trial with all these fellows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-21\">MS. HELDMYER [the prosecutor]: United States is prepared to go to trial, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-22\">THE COURT: We don\u2019t play games in this court. Y\u2019all want to plead guilty, you can plead guilty today. If you don\u2019t want to plead guilty, we\u2019ll go to trial. We have' got plenty of time to try them. That will give each one of you until noon today to file any plea agreements. After that you will plead straight up or you go to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1229-23\">Tr. p. 5. There followed discussion of the length of trial and number of witnesses. Counsel for a co-defendant inquired whether, if his client did execute a plea .agreement by noon, when acceptance of the plea would occur, and the court instructed the attorney to stay available for Friday afternoon. The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-24\">THE COURT: You people know Judge Moore, I guess you know Judge Moore, and you know I don\u2019t play games with these people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>MR. GREGORY [counsel for a co-defendant]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-4\">THE COURT: They want to go out and get arrested, they come in here and they\u2019ll get a fair trial, and if they get found guilty, they\u2019ll also get a fair sentence, fairly high.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">Tr. p. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">The court announced a trial date of February 4. He appointed lead counsel and discussed such matters as jury instructions and marking of exhibits. The court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-6\">THE COURT: Get your running shoes on and we\u2019ll go to trial on the 4th of February at 9:00 a.m.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">Tr. p. 9. For plea agreements tendered by noon of Friday the court set 1:30 Friday afternoon to proceed with them. Proceedings recommenced, at 1:40 p.m. All defendants filed written plea agreements, and the court went through plea proceedings. Sentence was imposed on Corbitt on March 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\"> Rule 11 Fed.R.Crim.P. was amended in 1975 to clarify and regulate the procedure for discussions and agreements regarding pleas of guilty. Paragraph (e)(1) provides that attorneys for government and defense \u201cmay engage in discussions\u201d with a view toward reaching a plea agreement. It concludes with \u00e1 categorical mandate: \u201cThe court shall not participate in any such discussions.\u201d The purpose and meaning of this prohibition are that \u201cthe sentencing judge should take no part whatever in any discussion or communication regarding the sentence to be imposed prior to the entry of a plea of guilty or- conviction, or submission to him of a plea agreement.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Werker, </em>535 F.2d 198, 201 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 926, 97 S.Ct. 330, 50 L.Ed.2d 296 (1976). <em>Werker </em>described the concern implicated in the judge\u2019s disassociation from plea bargaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-9\">The primary concern of those who would dissociate the judge from the plea bargaining process has been that judicial intervention may coerce the defendant into an involuntary plea that he would not otherwise enter. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Peyton, </em>435 F.2d 1352 (4th Cir.1970). The defendant may fear that rejection of the plea will mean imposition of a more severe sentence after trial or decrease his chances of obtaining a fair trial before a judge whom he has challenged. The concern that these fears may be translated into an involuntary plea have been admirably expressed in an often-quoted statement by Judge Weinfeld:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apq\">\u201cThe unequal positions of the judge and the accused, one with the power to commit to prison and the other deeply concerned to avoid prison, at once raise a question of fundamental fairness. When a judge becomes a participant in plea bargaining he brings to bear the full force and majesty of his office. His awesome power to impose a substantially longer or even maximum sentence in excess of that proposed is present whether referred to or not. A defendant needs no reminder that if he rejects the proposal, stands upon his right to trial and is convicted, he faces a significantly longer sentence. One facing a prison term, whether of longer or shorter duration, is easily influenced to accept what appears the more preferable choice\u201d (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-12\"><em>United States ex rel. Elksnis v. Gilligan, </em>256 F.Supp. 244, 254 (S.D.N.Y.1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 201-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-14\"><em>U.S. v. Adams, </em>634 F.2d 830 (5th Cir. Unit A Jan. 1981), <em>citing Werker, </em>held that .Rule 11(e)(1) establishes \u201can absolute prohibition on all forms of judicial participation in or interference with the plea negotiation process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835. It further held that judicial participation in discussions preceding, a plea is plain error that can be 'raised on appeal sua sponte. <em>Id. </em>at 836. The court stated; \u201ca defendant who has pled guilty after the judge has participated in plea discussions should be allowed to replead, without having to show that actual prejudice has resulted from the participation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-15\">Two circuits have recently reaffirmed the principles established by <em>Adams </em>and <em>Werker. </em>In <em>U.S. v. Bruce, </em>976 F.2d 552 (9th Cir.1992), the defendants contended that the trial court had violated Rule 11(e)(1). Before the defendants had entered a plea, they and the prosecutor appeared before the trial judge. The judge asked the prosecutor to outline his plea offer, and then asked defendants and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>lawyers if they knew the minimum and maximum possible sentences. <em>See id. </em>at 555. The trial court then implied that if the defendants were found guilty it would have to impose a heavy sentence and asked the defendants to think about the plea \u201ccarefully.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The Ninth Circuit first held that judicial participation in a plea discussion is plain error reviewable for the first time on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 554. It then concluded that the trial judge\u2019s actions constituted participation in plea discussions in violation of Rule 11(e). <em>Id. </em>at 555-56. Central to this holding was the court\u2019s conclusion that Rule 11(e) is an absolute prohibition of all forms of judicial participation in plea negotiations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahc\">the unambiguous mandate of Rule 11 prohibits the participation of the judge in plea negotiations under <em>any </em>circumstances: it is a rule that, as we have noted, admits of no exceptions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 558 <em>(citing Adams, </em>634 F.2d at 839). The court also agreed with <em>Adams </em>that the defendants should be allowed to replead without showing actual prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">The Sixth Circuit, in <em>U.S. v. Barrett, </em>982 F.2d 193 (6th Cir.1992), also has held that Rule 11 prohibits any court participation in plea discussions. <em>See id. </em>at 195. Before the defendant had decided whether to plead or go to trial, the trial court held a conference call with the prosecution and defense counsel to resolve a dispute concerning the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 194. During the call, defense counsel suggested that the minimum sentence might be seven years. The judge said, \u201cthere is no way on God\u2019s green Earth I\u2019m going to sentence him to only seven years, and I think the likelihood is I\u2019m going to exceed the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judge also told defense counsel, \u201cI truly don\u2019t see what defense [the defendant] has. My understanding is that your investigator has found no people who he has been looking for, which doesn\u2019t surprise me one iota.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant entered a guilty plea six days later. <em>Id. </em>The Sixth Circuit held that these statements were coercive and violated Rule ll\u2019s absolute prohibition on judicial participation. <em>Id. </em>at 195. In so doing, it refused to consider whether other statements by the judge might have mitigated the <em>effect of the </em>quoted statements. <em>Id. </em>at 196. Rule 11, the court noted, is designed to totally eliminate judicial pressure from the plea bargaining process. <em>Id. (citing Werker, </em>535 F.2d at 203). The court concluded that the defendant must be allowed to withdraw his plea and remanded with instructions to assign the case to another judge.. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\"><em>Bruce </em>is similar to the present case. The trial court in <em>Bruce </em>did nothing flagrant; it simply indicated that the defendants were likely to receive a heavy sentence, thus they should think carefully about the prosecution\u2019s offer. That is analogous, to the judge\u2019s statement in this case that Corbitt and his co-d\u00e9fendarits would receive a \u201cfairly high\u201d sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">We do not need to address whether defense counsel\u2019s discussions with the trial court can be construed as an' objection to the court\u2019s participation. Judicial participation is plain error, and the defendant need not show actual prejudice. <em>Adams, </em>634 F.2d at 836, 839; <em>Bruce, </em>976 F.2d at 554, 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">Waiver under <em>U.S. v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.1990), is not implicated. That case addresses waiver of issues arising during sentencing hearings. 'This case concerns conduct prior to the entry of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\"><em>Adams </em>indicates that on remand the case should be reassigned to another judge even if there is no evidence that the judge is vindictive or biased, as a means to extend the prophylactic scheme established by Rule 11 and to prevent the possible misimpression created by the judge\u2019s participation. 634 F.2d at 842-43. <em>Barrett </em>agrees, 982 F.2d at 196. We conclude that we should follow the lead of those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-11\">The conviction of Corbitt is REVERSED and the case REMANDED with instructions that his plea be withdrawn and the case reassigned to another judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
