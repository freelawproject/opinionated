The petitioner was sentenced to a total effective term of twenty-eight years imprisonment. The petitioner\u2019s conviction and violation of probation were affirmed by this court on direct appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>76 Conn. App. 183, 818 A.2d 877, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 901, 823 A.2d 1220 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">On November 18, 2008, the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he is being illegally confined. Upon review, the habeas court, on November 26, 2008, declined to issue the writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the petition was wholly frivolous on its face pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-24 (a) (2). On December 15,2008, the petitioner filed apetition for certification to appeal and an application for waiver of fees, costs and expenses and the appointment of counsel. The court declined to rule on the petition for certification to appeal on the ground that it did not comport with General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b) because there was no judgment on the merits after a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>and the matter was not tried to a court. The court granted the application for waiver of fees, costs and expenses, but denied the motion for the appointment of counsel. The petitioner subsequently filed a motion for rectification and articulation. The court denied the motion for rectification, finding that it was neither warranted nor necessary. In response to the motion for articulation, the court stated that it did not appoint appellate counsel or refer the matter to the office of the public defender because the petitioner was not entitled to appointed counsel as a matter of law in a frivolous matter. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal [under General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b)], a petitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. . . . A habeas appeal that satisfies one of the criteria set forth in <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>[498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991)], is not, however, frivolous and warrants appellate review if the appellant can show: that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. . . . Thus, if an appeal is not frivolous, the habeas court\u2019s failure to grant certification to appeal is an abuse of discretion. ... In determining whether the habeas court abused its discretion in denying the petitioner\u2019s request for certification, we necessarily must consider the merits of the petitioner\u2019s underlying claims to determine whether the habeas court reasonably determined that the petitioner\u2019s appeal was frivolous. In other words, we review the petitioner\u2019s substantive claims for the purpose of ascertaining whether those claims satisfy one or more of the three criteria identified in <em>[Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, 432] and adopted by this court for determining the propriety of the habeas court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>denial of the petition for certification. Absent such a showing by the petitioner, the judgment of the habeas court must be affirmed [and the appeal dismissed].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ankerman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>122 Conn. App. 246, 250-51, 999 A.2d 789, cert. denied, 298 Conn. 922, 4 A.3d 1225 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner alleged that he is a \u201cforeign national,\u201d who is being treated as a \u201cslave\u201d and a \u201cprisoner of war\u201d in that he is being held at the \u201cplantation of MacDougallWalker\u201d in violation of his constitutional rights and \u201cGeneva Convention Treaties, Convention Against Torture, European Convention on Human Rights and U.S. Human Rights Acts.\u201d He asserted that his status as a \u201cslave\u201d and \u201cprisoner of war\u201d constitutes both a deprivation of due process and cruel and unusual punishment, and that he is being improperly held as an \u201cenemy combatant\u201d as a result of \u201cPost September] 11\u201d policies of the government. Because the record amply reveals that the petitioner is not a \u201cprisoner of war\u201d and is not \u201censlaved\u201d but, rather, is incarcerated as a result of convictions for crimes of which he was found guilty, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the petition was frivolous and declining to issue a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-12\"> The record reflects that the habeas court declined to act on the petition for certification to appeal. We previously have construed such inaction as a denial. See <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>111 Conn. App. 138, 141, 958 A.2d 790 (2008), cert. denied, 290 Conn. 905, 962 A.2d 793 (2009). Accordingly, we treat it as such in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-13\"> Practice Book \u00a7 23-24 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe judicial authority shall promptly review any petition for a writ of habeas corpus to determine whether the writ should issue. The judicial authority shall issue the writ unless it appears that:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">\u201c(1) the court lacks jurisdiction;</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">\u201c(2) the petition is wholly frivolous on its face; or \u201c(3) the relief sought is not available</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"> The petitioner also claims that the court improperly denied his motion for the appointment of counsel, both for purposes of filing a petition for certification to appeal and to represent him in his appeal of the court\u2019s determination of his petition as wholly frivolous. \u201cBecause Practice Book \u00a7 63-7 provides that the [petitioner\u2019s] sole remedy for review of the court\u2019s order concerning the appointment of counsel is by motion for review, the [petitioner] cannot properly raise this claim by way of a direct appeal or amended appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Casiano, </em>122 Conn. App. 61, 71, 998 A.2d 792 (2010). Accordingly, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\"> The petitioner does appear to set forth a potentially cognizable double jeopardy claim, contending that \u201ca conviction on one set of facts of both possession of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent and simple possession of narcotics, is fatally defective, invalid, and . . . void on its face.\u201d The petitioner\u2019s claim in this regard, however, is factually inaccurate. Specifically, as set forth in his petition, the petitioner was not convicted of those crimes but was, in fact, convicted of possession of narcotics and <em>sale </em>of narcotics. Thus, because the allegations set forth in the petitioner\u2019s petition refute his double jeopardy claim, his petition is frivolous in this regard as well. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>supra, 76 Conn. App. 183.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
