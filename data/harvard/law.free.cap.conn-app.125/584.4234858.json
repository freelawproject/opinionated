J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXD\">The petitioner, Jessica M., appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing her petition seeking to have herself adjudicated as neglected and as an uncared-for youth, filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (a). On appeal, Jessica claims that the court improperly determined that (1) it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petition, (2) it lacked statutory authority to order a retroactive commitment, (3) the collateral consequences exception to the mootness doctrine did not apply and (4) the capable of repetition yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine did not apply. On the basis of our decision in <em>In re Jose B., </em>125 Conn. App. 572,11 A.3d 682 (2010), which we also release today, we conclude that Jessica failed to establish the factual predicate for the court\u2019s statutory jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing Jessica\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are necessary for our discussion. On November 5, 2009, then seventeen year old Jessica filed a petition in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters in Hartford, alleging that she was neglected and uncared for as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 17, 2009, the department of children and families (department)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> successfully moved to intervene in the proceedings. The court also set a trial date of January 4, 2010, which was prior to Jessica\u2019s eighteenth birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">On that date, the court continued the matter due to (1) Jessica\u2019s failure to arrange for interpreters for two witnesses and (2) its granting of a motion in limine filed by the department. The court, on its own motion, transferred the case to the Child Protection Session in Middletown. Although a second trial date before Jessica\u2019s eighteenth birthday was offered, counsel for Jessica\u2019s mother was unavailable for that day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A trial date was scheduled for February 26, 2010, approximately five weeks after Jessica had reached the age of eighteen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>On February 5, 2010, the department filed a motion to dismiss the petition. It argued that the court, specifically, the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters, lacked jurisdiction over adults, individuals over the age of seventeen. The department further claimed that the court lacked statutory authority to adjudicate an individual over the age of seventeen as neglected or uncared for, even if the petition had been filed prior to the individual\u2019s eighteenth birthday. Last, the department argued that Jessica\u2019s petition was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The court heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss and issued its memorandum of decision on March 16, 2010. The court concluded that it lost subject matter jurisdiction and that the matter had become moot as of Jessica\u2019s \u201cceasing to be a child or youth.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, it stated that because the court was unable to issue any order committing Jessica to the custody of the department, or transferring guardianship<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> over her to another person, the case was moot and no exception to that doctrine applied. Accordingly, the court granted the department\u2019s motion to dismiss the neglect and uncared-for petition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Today, we released our decision in <em>In re Jose B., </em>supra, 125 Conn. App. 572. That case involved a similar fact pattern in which a neglect and uncared-for petition was filed prior to but not adjudicated before the petitioner\u2019s eighteenth birthday. In that case, we concluded: \u201cGuided by the reasoning set forth by our Supreme Court in <em>In re Matthew F., </em>[297 Conn. 673, 4 A.3d 248 (2010)], and our analysis of the relevant statutes, we conclude that the jurisdiction of the Superior Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Juvenile Matters did not cease merely because Jose reached the age of eighteen. Under the facts and circumstances of the present case, however, Jose failed to establish the requirements of \u00a7 46b-129 (j), namely, that the court could commit the eighteen year old Jose to the department. We conclude, therefore, that Jose failed to establish the factual predicate required for jurisdiction under that statute, and, accordingly, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the matter. The trial court, therefore, properly granted the department\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>In re Jose B., </em>supra, 583-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">We conclude that, pursuant to our analysis in <em>In re Jose B., </em>Jessica failed to establish the factual predicate required for jurisdiction under \u00a7 46b-129 (j).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no statutory authority for a retroactive commitment. Id. The court, therefore, lacked jurisdiction over the petition and properly granted the department\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> On January 15, 2010, Jessica filed an amended summary of facts in support of the neglect petition. Specifically, she alleged that her father had abandoned her and that her mother had lived at a different residence for the past two years and had not provided Jessica with financial or other support. Jessica also alleged that she had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder and was at great risk of injuring herself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\"> Because the commissioner of children and families acts on behalf of the department of children and families, references in this opinion to the department include the commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\"> On January 13, 2010, Jessica\u2019s mother filed a motion to strike or dismiss the neglect petition.
