The defendant claims that the court erred in denying its motion to open because the court lacked personal jurisdiction over it as a result of insufficiency of process and insufficient service of process, thus rendering the judgment void. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The plaintiff commenced this action on January 11, 2008, to foreclose its statutory lien on property over which the defendant also held a mortgage. The writ of summons named the defendant as \u201cMERS, Inc.,\u201d and was delivered to the Michigan address listed on the defendant\u2019s mortgage deed as it appeared in the land records.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 19, 2008, the defendant was defaulted for failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a motion for judgment of strict foreclosure on the property, which was granted on August 11,2008. The law date was scheduled for September 9, 2008. Thereafter, on November 26, 2008, the defendant filed a motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure, claiming that the judgment was void because the court never acquired personal jurisdiction over it and that the court abused its discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ordering a strict foreclosure rather than a foreclosure by sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">On March 2, 2009, the court held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure. At this hearing, the court asked the defendant\u2019s counsel, \u201care you pressing that [the writ of summons and complaint were] served at the wrong address?\u201d In response, the defendant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cNo. I think the court was ready to rule on that issue . . . [b]ut then we raised the equitable issue of whether it should have gone by strict [foreclosure] or [foreclosure by] sale.\u201d The court noted the defendant\u2019s position. The court then denied the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment, noting that it was bound to do so pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant filed a motion to reargue its motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure. On April 27, 2009, the court granted the motion to reargue but denied the relief requested. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In this appeal, the defendant argues that the court erred in denying its motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure because the court never had acquired personal jurisdiction over it, and, thus, the judgment was void. Specifically, the defendant contends that the delivery of the writ of summons and complaint to Michigan as well as to an address in Florida did not comport with Connecticut\u2019s corporate long arm statute; General Statutes \u00a7 33-929; or with General Statutes \u00a7 52-57 (c) because the defendant is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Virginia. Furthermore, the defendant contends that the process was insufficient because the summons listed its name as \u201cMERS, Inc.,\u201d instead of \u201cMortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.,\u201d and that the incorrect address was listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>on the writ of summons. The plaintiff contends, however, that the defendant consented to personal jurisdiction and, thus, this appeal is moot because the law days have run and title has vested. Under the circumstances of this case, we disagree with the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">We first set forth our standard of review. Because a challenge to the personal jurisdiction of the trial court is a question of law, our review is plenary. See <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Cerullo, </em>282 Conn. 109, 118, 918 A.2d 867 (2007). Although the court\u2019s conclusions are subject to plenary review, \u201c[questions of fact are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nascimento </em>v. <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>108 Conn. App. 447, 450, 947 A.2d 1057, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 910, 957 A.2d 872 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Generally, a judgment of strict foreclosure cannot be opened after title has become absolute in an encumbrancer. See General Statutes \u00a7 49-15 (a) (providing in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny judgment foreclosing the title to real estate by strict foreclosure may, at the discretion of the court rendering the same, upon the written motion of any person having an interest therein and for cause shown, be opened and modified . . . but no such judgment shall be opened after the title has become absolute in any encumbrancer\u201d). Here, the title became absolute in the plaintiff because the defendant neither redeemed the property nor filed a motion to open until after the passing of the law days. See <em>City Lumber Co. of Bridgeport, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>120 Conn. 16, 25, 179 A. 339 (1935) (\u201c[w]here a foreclosure decree has become absolute by the passing of the law days, the outstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>rights of redemption have been cut off and the title has become unconditional in the [encumbrancer]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u201cIt is axiomatic [however] that a court cannot render a judgment without first obtaining personal jurisdiction over the parties. No principle is more universal than that the judgment of a court without jurisdiction is a nullity. . . . Such a judgment . . . may always be challenged. ... [A] defect in process . . . implicates personal jurisdiction . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Argent Mortgage Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Huertas, </em>288 Conn. 568, 576, 953 A.2d 868 (2008). The defendant claims that the court erred in denying its motion to open because the court did not obtain personal jurisdiction over the defendant and thus the judgment of strict foreclosure was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">We cannot consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction to render judgment because the record is inadequate for review. Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (a) mandates that a trial court must disclose the factual bases of its decision. \u201cWhere a transcript of an oral decision of the trial court fails to set forth the factual basis of the trial court\u2019s decision, the [burden is on the appellant to] perfect the record on appeal either by filing a motion to compel the trial court to file a memorandum of decision ... or by filing a motion for articulation .... [T]his court will not attempt to supplement or reconstruct the record, or to make factual determinations, in order to decide the [appellant\u2019s] claim.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>111 Conn. App. 614, 621, 960 A.2d 1056 (2008), cert. denied, 290 Conn. 917, 966 A.2d 234 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Here, the record is devoid of factual findings that would allow us to make a determination regarding personal jurisdiction. The trial court made no findings relating to the defendant\u2019s state of incorporation or principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>place of business, both of which are essential to making a determination regarding personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As this court has stated, \u201c [without any specific findings of fact ... we cannot determine the basis of the court\u2019s ruling and thus cannot review the merits of [a] defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\"> The other defendant in this action is Charles Bordes. Bordes owned the property at issue over which Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., held a mortgage. Bordes was defaulted for a failure to appear and did not appeal from the judgment, and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., is the only defendant involved in this appeal. We therefore refer in this opinion to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\"> On December 30,2007, the writ of summons and complaint were accepted at the Michigan address and were then forwarded to the defendant\u2019s Florida address, where they also were signed for and accepted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-15 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201cno . . . judgment [of strict foreclosure] shall be opened after the title has become absolute in any encumbrancer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b41-11\"> The plaintiff argues that the defendant consented to the personal jurisdiction of the trial court. It is well established that \u201c[ujnlike subject matter jurisdiction . . . personal jurisdiction may be created through consent or waiver.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Phoenix Leasing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kosinski, </em>47 Conn. App. 650,653, 707 A.2d 314 (1998). The record seems to suggest that the defendant stated to the trial court that it was not contesting the issue of service of process. The record, however, is somewhat vague regarding this issue. Because we conclude that the record is inadequate to review the defendant\u2019s claim, we need not address the plaintiffs consent argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b41-12\"> Accordingly, we do not address the defendant\u2019s claim that the court abused its discretion by ordering a strict foreclosure rather than a foreclosure by sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
