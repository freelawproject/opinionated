Bento. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court abused its discretion with respect to its financial orders by (1) awarding the defendant attorney\u2019s fees, (2) ordering the parties equally to be responsible for a corporate debt and (3) dividing the parties\u2019 assets other than on a fifty-fifty basis. The plaintiff also claims that the court\u2019s finding that the parties had agreed to the division of their personal property was clearly erroneous. The plaintiff generally claims that the court\u2019s memorandum of decision is insufficient to support its financial orders due to the lack of factual findings. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">The plaintiff commenced this action in October, 2007, seeking dissolution of his marriage to the defendant. He alleged that he had been a resident of this state since June 18, 2007, and intended to make it his permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>residence. He further alleged that the marriage had broken down irretrievably. In addition to a dissolution of marriage, the plaintiff sought alimony, an equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 assets and such other relief as the court may deem necessary and proper. In January, 2008, the defendant admitted the allegations of the complaint and alleged a cross claim seeking a dissolution of marriage on the basis of irretrievable breakdown. She also alleged that the parties were the equitable and beneficial owners of the marital home in Hartsdale, New York. She sought a dissolution of the marriage, alimony, equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 assets, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other relief the court may deem proper. The action was tried to the court in October, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In its memorandum of decision issued on October 21, 2008, the court made the following findings of fact. The parties were married in Yonkers, New York, on July 10,1968, and have three children, all of whom have reached the age of majority. Neither of the parties has been the recipient of financial assistance from the state. At the time of trial, the plaintiff was sixty-six years old, and the defendant was sixty-three years old. The plaintiff previously had brought a dissolution action in the state of New York but had failed to prevail, and the case was disposed of in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The court found that the plaintiff has suffered two heart attacks, takes medication on a regular basis and has not been employed on a regular basis since 2000, due to his health problems. The plaintiff has only four years of education but appears to have obtained something equivalent to a graduate equivalency degree. The plaintiff acknowledged that he had had at least one extramarital sexual liaison in 2004. Although he claimed that the marriage had broken down in 2000, he continued to live with the defendant and take trips with her in an effort to reconcile.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The court found that the defendant\u2019s version of things was different. According to the defendant, the marriage broke down in 2005 when serious difficulties with the plaintiff began. She claimed to have been the victim of vile and opprobrious language, as well as physical acts of force against her. The court found that although most of what it described as the plaintiffs \u201cloathsome\u201d conduct occurred in the latter stages of the forty year marriage, there was sufficient evidence to prove that the cause of the marital breakdown was the plaintiffs fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In dissolving the marriage and entering its orders, the court considered the parties\u2019 claims and the criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 46b-82.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court dissolved the marriage and entered orders regarding alimony, the marital home, tax liabilities, assignment of real property in Portugal, the parties\u2019 bank accounts and motor vehicles and their personalty. The court also assigned responsibility for the parties\u2019 liabilities and awarded the defendant attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The majority of the plaintiffs claims concern the court\u2019s financial orders. \u201cOur standard of review for financial orders in a dissolution action is clear. The trial court has broad discretion in fashioning its financial orders .... [T]his court will not disturb the trial court\u2019s orders unless it has abused its legal discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>or its findings have no reasonable basis in fact. ... It is within the province of the trial court to find facts and draw proper inferences from the evidence presented.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Desai </em>v. <em>Desai, </em>119 Conn. App. 224, 235, 987 A.2d 362 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u201cA fundamental principle in dissolution actions is that a trial court may exercise broad discretion in awarding alimony and dividing property as long as it considers all relevant statutory criteria. ... No single criterion is preferred over others, and the trial court has broad discretion in varying the weight placed on each criterion under the circumstances of each case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>20 Conn. App. 551, 554, 568 A.2d 1044 (1990), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 221 Conn. 698, 607 A.2d 383 (1992). Our decisions neither hold nor intimate that \u201cthe trial court must make specific, detailed findings on each factor it considered pursuant to \u00a7 46b-82 or otherwise. We do, however, require that the record contain some indication as to the reasoning of the trial court in making an exercise of its discretionary powers in this type of proceeding.\u201d Id., 556 n.2, quoting <em>Markarian </em>v. <em>Markarian, </em>2 Conn. App. 14, 17 n.2, 475 A.2d 337 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The plaintiffs first claim is that the court abused its discretion when it awarded the defendant $7500 in attorney\u2019s fees. We are unable to resolve the claim due to ambiguity in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision as to this issue. By failing to file a motion for articulation, the plaintiff has failed to provide an adequate basis for review. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 60-5 and 61-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The court ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant $7500 toward the payment of her attorney\u2019s fees. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated, in relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>part: \u201cThe [plaintiff], who recently sought a dissolution action and failed to prevail and who has been less than cooperative in providing disclosure in this proceeding, shall pay to [the defendant] the sum of $7500 toward her attomey[\u2019s] fees.\u201d On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the court\u2019s award is contrary to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The court\u2019s order, however, is not clear as to the factual and legal basis on which it awarded the defendant attorney\u2019s fees. The memorandum of decision offers at least two reasons for the award, and the plaintiff failed to seek an articulation from the court. See Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. Moreover, in ruling on the contempt motions filed by the parties, the court denied the plaintiffs motion for contempt and overruled the plaintiffs objection to the defendant\u2019s motion for contempt. It is unclear whether the court, by implication, granted the defendant\u2019s motion for contempt<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and whether that was the basis of its award of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The appellant bears the burden of providing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>adequate record for review. <em>Mickey </em>v. <em>Mickey, </em>292 Conn. 597, 609, 974 A.2d 641 (2009). Because the record is ambiguous, we cannot review the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The plaintiffs second claim is that the court abused its discretion by ordering that the parties equally be responsible for a corporate debt owed Manuel Pedro and/or Maria Pedro. The court made no findings of fact, recited no evidence and cited no law with respect to this order. Moreover, it did not actually find that a debt was owed. The court merely ordered that \u201cboth parties shall be equally responsible for 50 percent of the funds due Manuel Pedro and/or Maria Pedro.\u201d The plaintiff did not seek an articulation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">We acknowledge that, in rendering a judgment of dissolution, the court has the authority to assign \u201cthe debts and liabilities of the parties\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Fewtrell </em>v. <em>Fewtrell, </em>87 Conn. App. 526, 531, 865 A.2d 1240 (2005); and to order \u201cone party to assume the joint liabilities of both parties. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (a) . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Osakowicz </em>v. <em>Osakowicz, </em>57 Conn. App. 807, 809-10, 750 A.2d 1135 (2000). Nonetheless, \u201c[t]here must be some indication in the record as to the basis of the trial court\u2019s determination of the award.\u201d <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 555. Neither party included a debt to Manuel Pedro and/or Maria Pedro on his or her financial affidavit. Without any finding that the parties owed a debt, the court abused its discretion in ordering them to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>responsible equally for it. The case is remanded to the trial court with direction to vacate that portion of the court\u2019s financial orders that the parties \u201cbe equally responsible for 50 percent of the funds due Manuel Pedro and/or Maria Pedro.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The plaintiffs third claim is that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing its financial orders regarding alimony, payment of the carrying costs on the marital home and division of the parties\u2019 assets. More specifically, the plaintiff claims that the court abused its discretion with respect to its alimony award in light of his income and that of the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He also claims that the court abused its discretion by failing to award him 50 percent of the proceeds from the sale of B &amp; S Realty of Yonkers, Inc. (B &amp; S Realty). He also complains that the court awarded him only 39 percent of the parties\u2019 net assets and the defendant 61 percent of the net assets. All of the plaintiffs claims are fact based pursuant to his interpretation of the evidence. Although the plaintiff complains that following a three day trial, the court did not make any findings regarding the financial circumstances of the parties, he failed to file a motion for articulation seeking the factual and legal basis of the court\u2019s orders. See Practice Book \u00a7 66-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The court issued the following financial orders. The defendant is to pay the plaintiff alimony in the amount of $1500 per month until the death of either party, the plaintiffs cohabitation as defined by statute or remarriage, the completion or cessation of the monthly note payments from the sale of B &amp; S Realty, or January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>30, 2009, whichever occurs first. Beginning February 1, 2009, the defendant shall pay the plaintiff alimony in the amount of $1800 per month until the death of either party, the plaintiffs cohabitation as defined by statute or remarriage, the completion or cessation of the monthly note payments from the sale of B &amp; S Realty or March 1, 2016, whichever shall first occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The court ordered the immediate sale of the marital home in Hartsdale, New York, the net proceeds of which were to be divided equally between the parties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With regard to other marital assets, the court ordered that the defendant is to pay the plaintiff, upon receipt, 40 percent of the net proceeds from the $1.5 million balance due from the sale of B &amp; S Realty. The defendant must pay any federal and state taxes due with respect to the sale prior to the date of judgment. Any tax obligation related to the property incurred subsequent to judgment shall be divided between the parties with the defendant paying 60 percent of the postjudgment taxes. The court awarded the defendant property in Viera, Portugal, and Corredoura, Portugal, and the plaintiff property in Porto de Mos, Portugal. The Citibank and Commerce Bank checking and savings accounts were awarded to the defendant, along with the Chrysler minivan. The plaintiff was awarded the Chase savings and checking accounts and the Mercedes 350 automobile.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The court ordered the parties to be responsible for their respective liabilities and their own medical and dental expenses and for health insurance coverage. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>court found that the defendant has benefited from the proceeds of the sale of B &amp; S Realty that had occurred in April, 2006. She received a cash payment of $100,000 and $250,000 in a lump sum payment. In addition, she has received the monthly interest on the $1.5 million note that was given by the purchasers of the business. The court also found that the plaintiff was incapacitated and that the plaintiff and the parties\u2019 daughter, Teresa Tomas, assumed responsibility for operating the business. A large part of the $350,000 from the sale of B &amp; S Realty was used to pay the liabilities of the business. Nonetheless, the court concluded that the defendant received a substantial benefit from the proceeds of the sale of the business and ordered her to pay the federal or New York state tax obligation as it relates to the sale to the date of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Section 46b-82 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn determining whether alimony shall be awarded, and the duration and amount of the award, the court shall hear the witnesses, if any, of each party . . . shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the . . . dissolution of the marriage . . . the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of each of the parties and the award, if any, which the court may make pursuant to section 46b-81 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The court found that the plaintiff had suffered two heart attacks, takes medication on a regular basis and has not worked <em>on a regular basis </em>since 2000 due to his health problems.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court also found that the plaintiff was responsible for the breakdown of the marriage due to \u201chis loathsome conduct\u201d during the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>stages of the forty year marriage.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In their briefs, the parties recite the evidence from their respective points of view concerning the history of their business and financial dealings. Our review of the transcripts discloses that the parties hold widely different, views of the facts. The court made no credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In this case, we cannot conclude that the court failed to consider the factors enumerated in \u00a7 46b-82. In the second paragraph of the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, the court noted the length of the parties\u2019 marriage and their ages, the plaintiffs health problems, recent employment history and level of education. Moreover, the court noted that the plaintiff had engaged in at least one extramarital affair in 2004. The court also noted the different perspectives of the parties as to when the marriage had broken down irretrievably and who was to blame. The court did not make specific findings as to the history of the parties\u2019 business relationship and income or their assets and liabilities. The court divided the marital home equally between the parties and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff alimony. With respect to moneys due from the sale of the parties\u2019 business, the court roughly divided the proceeds 40 percent to the plaintiff and 60 percent to the defendant. The court ordered the defendant to pay any prejudgment tax liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Although the memorandum of decision is spare, the court was not required to render its financial orders with mathematical precision. The plaintiff did not file a motion for articulation seeking clarification of the court\u2019s financial orders. The heart of the plaintiffs claim is that the court did not divide the parties\u2019 assets fifty-fifty and equalize their monthly incomes. In doing so, he fails to consider that the court found him at fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>for the breakdown of the marriage and that the court ordered the defendant hable for the business tax obligations. We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding alimony and dividing the parties\u2019 assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly found that the parties had stipulated to the division of their personal property and therefore failed to award the plaintiff certain personalty. We agree that the record does not support the court\u2019s finding that the parties stipulated to the division of their personalty. During the evidentiary portion of the trial, the plaintiff presented no evidence as to personal property he wanted from the marital home. Immediately prior to closing arguments of counsel, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">\u201cThe Court: . . . What did we do with the personalty? We talked about that, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: You asked [the plaintiffs counsel] to give me a list. I still haven\u2019t received a list.

It\u2019s in [the plaintiffs] handwriting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">\u201cThe Court: No, no, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Following oral arguments, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: ... I do have [the plaintiffs] list. It is handwritten. I don\u2019t know if the court will entertain \u2014 if I could provide it to you and provide a copy to [the defendant\u2019s counsel], but I did receive this right before we came to court today. Handwritten.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Have you shown it to [the defendant\u2019s counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: I have not shown it to [the defendant\u2019s counsel] yet. I have the original, and then I just had my office copy it because we didn\u2019t even receive it ahead of time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201cThe Court: Did you look at that personal list, that personal property list?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: She\u2019s doing it now, just quickly, Your Honor. Is there anything that you don\u2019t think you know that he can have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Your Honor, can I submit this to the court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">\u201cThe Court: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Actually, I object. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Ifs just his request. I\u2019m not saying. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">\u201cThe Court: Why don\u2019t you just make a note, no objection, and give it to me in chambers, okay? Whatever you have on that list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-14\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Oh, come back in chambers with whatever we have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-15\">\u201cThe Court: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-16\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Okay. I\u2019ll do that, yes. We\u2019re almost done, Your Honor. Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-17\">\u201cThe Court: Recess, please.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Counsel delivered the list to the court, and the court attached the list to its memorandum of decision. The attachment is a handwritten list containing the notation \u201cO = he can have [illegible]. A.\u201d What appear to be the signatures of the plaintiff and counsel are at the bottom of the page. The meaning of the writing and notations on the document is ambiguous, and there is no record regarding its content. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated that \u201c[t]he parties have agreed to a division of personal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Given the record with respect to the parties\u2019 personalty, we conclude that the court\u2019s finding that the parties agreed to the division of their personal property is clearly erroneous.
