The plaintiff, Joseph Kopylec, appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment upholding, in part, a cease and desist order issued by the North Branford zoning enforcement officer. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court misconstrued the North Branford zoning regulations with regard to his use of woodchips. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The plaintiff is the co-owner of 3.4 acres located at 944 Totoket Road in North Branford (town), an R-40 residential zone, which permits residential dwellings, their accessory uses and farming activities pursuant to \u00a7 23.1 of the North Branford zoning regulations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 4,2005, Carol A. Zebb, the town zoning enforcement officer, issued a three point cease and desist order against the plaintiff. Only the second point is relevant to this appeal. Point two ordered the plaintiff to stop \u201cstockpiling in excess of 100 cubic yards of woodchips during the calendar year and/or using the aforesaid woodchips for landscaping work, including changes of the contours of a lot when no building permit is required, without benefit of a Zoning Permit as required by Section 43 of the Zoning Regulations of the Town of North Branford . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The plaintiff appealed from the cease and desist order to the defendant, the zoning board of appeals of the town of North Branford, which upheld the cease and desist order on February 27, 2006. Thereafter the plaintiff appealed to the trial court. In a memorandum of decision filed September 10, 2008, the court sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>the plaintiffs appeal as to points one and three of the cease and desist order but denied it as to point two. On September 26,2008, the plaintiff filed a direct appeal to this court that was dismissed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 63-4 (additional papers to be filed by appellant). The plaintiff filed a motion to reargue on September 29, 2008, which the trial court granted. On January 20, 2009, the court issued a memorandum of decision, affirming its September 10, 2008 judgment. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a petition for certification to appeal. Following this court\u2019s granting of certification, the plaintiff appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">A court\u2019s review of a zoning board\u2019s decision to uphold a cease and desist order is limited to a determination of whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the order. <em>Lallier </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>119 Conn. App. 71, 80, 986 A.2d 343, cert. denied, 295 Conn. 914, 990 A.2d 345 (2010). The role of an appellate court is to \u201cdetermine whether the trial court correctly concluded that the board\u2019s act was not arbitrary, illegal or an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Curran </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>117 Conn. App. 458, 462, 979 A.2d 599 (2009). \u201cIn reviewing a decision of a zoning board, a reviewing court is bound by the substantial evidence rule, according to which, [conclusions reached by [the board] must be upheld by the trial court if they are reasonably supported by the record. The credibility of the witnesses and the determination of issues of fact are matters solely within the province of the [board]. . . . The question is not whether the trial court would have reached the same conclusion, but whether the record before the [board] supports the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>reached.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vine </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>281 Conn. 553, 559-60, 916 A.2d 5 (2007). The plaintiff bears the burden of proof \u201cto demonstrate that the board acted improperly . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>233 Conn. 198, 206, 658 A.2d 559 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">This appeal turns on the construction of the town\u2019s zoning regulations. \u201cBecause the inteipretation of the regulations presents a question of law, our review is plenary. . . . We also recognize that the zoning regulations are local legislative enactments . . . and, therefore, their interpretation is governed by the same principles that apply to the construction of statutes. . . . Whenever possible, the language of zoning regulations will be construed so that no clause is deemed superfluous, void or insignificant. . . . The regulations must be interpreted so as to reconcile their provisions and make them operative so far as possible.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Heim </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>289 Conn. 709, 715-16, 960 A.2d 1018 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The court determined that \u00a7\u00a723 and 43 of the town\u2019s zoning regulations are permissive in nature. Section 43 bars a variety of activities that may be conducted only in accordance with certain specific exclusions or on securing a temporary special use permit. Zebb ordered the plaintiff to stop stockpiling woodchips in excess of 100 cubic yards and/or using woodchips for landscaping work, including changes in the contours of the land when no building permit was required, without a zoning permit, as required by \u00a7 43.2.3 of the zoning regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>In considering the plaintiffs appeal, the defendant applied \u00a7 43 of the town\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The court found that filling of land is only permitted in accordance with \u00a7 43.2 or upon securing a temporary special use permit. The plaintiff argued that he was not using the woodchips for fill but was using them as fertilizer for agricultural purposes. The court determined, however, that \u00a7 44.5 of the North Branford zoning regulations indicates that \u00a7 43 of the regulations applies to farming operations. The plaintiffs expert, David Lord, testified that there were at least 250 to 300 cubic yards of woodchips on the plaintiffs property. There is no evidence in the record that the plaintiff obtained a temporary special use permit as required by \u00a7 43.2.3. Moreover, Zebb was not permitted to enter the property to measure the volume of woodchips. The court concluded that, given the foregoing circumstances, to say that a \u00a7 43 cease and desist order cannot issue in effect would mean that \u00a7 43 cannot be enforced. On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court properly construed the zoning regulations at issue and that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the defendant\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\"> North Branford Zoning Regs., \u00a7 23, entitled \u201cPermitted Uses,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201c23.1 . . .

The defendant raised the issue again in its brief but did not reanalyze the question. We, therefore, decline to review the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\"> Section 43 of the North Branford zoning regulations provides, in relevant part: \u201c43.1 General: Excavation, grading or filling of land, or removal of sod, loam, clay, sand, gravel or stone from any lot, is permitted only in accordance with the exclusions listed in Par. 43.2 or upon securing a TEMPORARY SPECIAL USE PERMIT from the Commission in accordance with Par. 43.3 through 43.6.
