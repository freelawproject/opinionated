J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOo\">The defendant, Javier Santos, appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying his motion to correct an illegal sentence. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court erred in determining that (1) a new or supplemented presentence investigation report was not required when his probation was revoked pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) his sentence was not imposed in an illegal manner as a result of the court\u2019s failure to order, sua sponte, a new or supplemented presentence investigation report. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the defendant\u2019s appeal. On August 17, 1995, the defendant was convicted of robbery in the first degree. <em>State </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>108 Conn. App. 250, 252, 947 A.2d 414 (2008). A presentence investigation report was completed, and the court sentenced the defendant to twelve years imprisonment, execution suspended after five years, and five years probation. On June 5, 2000, the defendant began his five year probation sentence. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>April 12, 2005, approximately seven weeks before the expiration of his probation sentence, the defendant was arrested and charged with sexual assault in the first degree and sexual assault in the second degree. On May 25, 2005, a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest issued for violation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s trial on the sexual assault charges and his hearing on the violation of probation were held simultaneously, with additional evidence being allowed on the violation of probation charge after the jury returned its verdict. The jury found the defendant not guilty of the sexual assault charges, using the criminal standard of proof of beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 253. Pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32, however, the court found that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation, revoked his probation and ordered him to serve six of the seven years of his unexecuted sentence. This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s violation of probation judgment. Id., 252. The sentence review division of the Superior Court denied the defendant\u2019s application to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">On August 29, 2008, the defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence with the court. On October 24, 2008, at a hearing on the motion, the defendant was allowed to amend his motion orally to include the claim that his sentence was imposed illegally because the court had neglected to order a new or supplemented presentence investigation report, pursuant to the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 43-3 (a), prior to his sentencing for the violation of probation. On November 17, 2008, the court denied his motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">On appeal, the defendant first claims that Practice Book \u00a7 43-3 (a) requires a court to order a new or supplemented presentence investigation report prior to revoking probation pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32 and imposing any portion of the unexecuted original sentence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">We begin by setting forth our standard of review. \u201c [A] claim that the trial court improperly denied a defendant\u2019s motion to correct an. illegal sentence is reviewed pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tabone, </em>279 Conn. 527, 534, 902 A.2d 1058 (2006). To the extent that he contends that the court was <em>required </em>to order a new or supplemented presentence investigation report pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-3 (a), however, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s claim presents a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The defendant does not claim that he requested an updated presentence investigation report prior to the dispositional phase of his hearing, nor does he claim that the court erroneously denied such a request. Additionally, the defendant does not claim that \u00a7 53a-32 explicitly requires a court to order one.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>defendant argues that the court was required, sua sponte, to order a new or updated presentence investigation report in his case because \u201cnothing in [\u00a7 53a-32] allows or mandates an exception to [Practice Book] \u00a7 43-3 when sentencing a defendant under ... \u00a7 53a-32.\u201d The defendant argues that because the court did not order a new or supplemented presentence investigation report, the sentence imposed was illegal. We disagree and conclude that Practice Book \u00a7 43-3 (a) had no application to the defendant\u2019s sentence issued pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 43-3 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the defendant is convicted of a crime . . . the punishment for which may include imprisonment for more than one year, the judicial authority shall order a presentence investigation, or the supplementation of any existing presentence investigation report. . . .\u201d Thus, the defendant\u2019s argument rests on the premise that, for purposes of Practice Book \u00a7 43-3 (a), he was \u201cconvicted of a crime\u201d when found to be in violation of probation and thereafter sentenced to a portion of his unexecuted sentence pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32. This premise is without support in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">\u201cWe begin by reiterating the well recognized principle that a probation revocation hearing is not a stage of a criminal prosecution. . . . Probation violation matters are statutory procedures to which many substantive and procedural rules of criminal law do not apply.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Jacobs, 30 Conn. App. 340, 342, 620 A.2d 198 (1993), aff'd, 229 Conn. 385, 641 A.2d 1351 (1994). \u201c[A] probation revocation proceeding consists of two distinct stages. . . . The first phase is conducted to determine liability, and . . . [t]he second, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>disposition, phase occurs if a violation of probation is established in the first phase. . . . During the second phase, the court makes its disposition as authorized by \u00a7 53a-32.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>243 Conn. 339, 348, 703 A.2d 109 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">\u201cRevocation hearings are not concerned with punishment or retribution. . . . The element of \u2018punishment\u2019 in probation revocation of [the] defendant is attributable to <em>the crime for which he was originally convicted </em>and sentenced. Thus, any sentence [the] defendant had to serve as the result of the violation of [probation] was \u2018punishment\u2019 for the crime of which he had originally been convicted. Revocation is a continuing consequence of the original conviction from which probation was granted.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 177-78, 540 A.2d 679 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>222 Conn. 299, 306, 610 A.2d 1147 (1992) (\u201cthe subject matter jurisdiction over a probation revocation proceeding derives from the original presentment of the information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Accordingly, when the defendant was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32, he had not been \u201cconvicted of a crime\u201d for purposes of Practice Book \u00a7 43-3 (a). The court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32 (d). Neither that statute nor the associated Practice Book \u00a7 43-29 requires a court to order a new or supplemented presentence investigation report prior to the revocation of probation. Thus, the court was not required to order a new or supplemented presentence investigation report.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>42 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>App. 768, 785-86, 682 A.2d 521 (1996), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 243 Conn. 339, 703 A.2d 109 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The defendant also contends that he received an illegal sentence because, as a consequence of not having an updated presentence investigation report, the court relied on inaccurate information in sentencing him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that although he was allowed to speak in mitigation of his sentence, the court did not find him credible, and instead sentenced him relying on the outdated educational, employment and family histories that were presented in his original presentence investigation report, as well as the state\u2019s false allegation that he had been derelict in his child support obligations. The defendant contends that had an updated presentence investigation report been ordered, the court would have sentenced him to a term considerably less than the six year term that he received. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">\u201cWe will reverse the court\u2019s denial of the [defendant\u2019s] motion to correct [an illegal] sentence only on a showing that the court abused its discretion. . . . Furthermore, in reviewing the [defendant\u2019s] claims, we do not question credibility determinations reached by the court, for the trial court is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Cazzetta, </em>97 Conn. App. 56, 60, 903 A.2d 659 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">\u201c[I]f a sentence is within statutory limits it is not generally subject to modification by a reviewing court. ... A sentencing judge has very broad discretion in imposing any sentence within the statutory limits .... The court may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information [it] may consider or the source from which it may come.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>199 Conn. 308, 320, 507 A.2d 99 (1986). A sentencing court, however, must rely on information possessed of \u201csome minimal indicium of reliability . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>20 Conn. App. 572, 585, 570 A.2d 709, cert. denied, 214 Conn. 806, 573 A.2d 318 (1990). The court, therefore, is precluded \u201cfrom relying on materially untrue or unreliable information in imposing a sentence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>295 Conn. 825, 843, 992 A.2d 1103 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">To establish that his sentence was imposed in an illegal manner, the defendant is \u201crequired to show that the information was materially false or unreliable and that the trial court relied substantially on the information in determining the sentence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>supra, 20 Conn. App. 585. \u201cA sentencing court demonstrates actual reliance on misinformation when the court gives explicit attention to it, [bases] its sentence at least in part on it, or gives specific consideration to the information before imposing sentence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>supra, 295 Conn. 843 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">The defendant has not carried his burden. The record shows that the defendant and his attorney both spoke in mitigation of the defendant\u2019s sentence. The defendant had the opportunity to explain his educational and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>employment circumstances, and to address the state\u2019s contention that he was behind on his child support obligations. \u201cThe primary value of a [presentence investigation report] stems from the information contained therein, not from the report itself. Most of this information can be brought to the trial court\u2019s attention by either party by means other than a [presentence investigation report].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lorthe </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>103 Conn. App. 662, 683 n.18, 931 A.2d 348, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 939, 937 A.2d 696 (2007). To the extent the defendant asks us to consider the propriety of the court\u2019s credibility determinations at the dispositional phase of his revocation of probation hearing, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The record shows that in determining the defendant\u2019s sentence the court inquired into whether the goals of rehabilitation thought to be served by probation were being met by the defendant. The court gave specific consideration to the gravity of the defendant\u2019s initial conviction, the information in the defendant\u2019s original presentence investigation report, the nature and number of the defendant\u2019s probation violations and the defendant\u2019s employment history while on probation. The defendant has not identified, nor are we able to find in the record, any materially false information specifically considered by the court in determining the defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-11\"> As noted by the court, after the pleadings and prior to the court\u2019s decision, subsection (b) of \u00a7 53a-32 was redesignated subsection (d) by Public Acts 2008, No. 08-102, \u00a7 7. Hereafter, for convenience, we refer only to \u00a7 53a-32 (d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-8\"> In pertinent part, the court ruled: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s reliance on the sentencing procedures of Practice Book \u00a7 43-3 is misplaced.
