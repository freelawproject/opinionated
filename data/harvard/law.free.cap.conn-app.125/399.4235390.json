(Semac), appeal from the judgment of the trial court, rendered after a trial to the court, in favor of the plaintiff, Fibre Optic Plus, Inc. On appeal, the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>claim that the court improperly (1) rendered judgment more than 120 days after the completion date of trial in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 51-183b and (2) concluded that they waived application of the 120 day requirement set forth therein. Although we disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants waived application of \u00a7 51-183b, we nonetheless affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The following facts, as found by the court, and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of the defendants\u2019 appeal. In the spring and summer of 2005, Darien High School was undergoing a large scale renovation project (project). Semac was the general contractor retained by the town of Darien to oversee the project, and American was a subcontractor employed on the project by Semac. Additionally, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 49-41 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> XL, a bonding company, served as the surety for a payment bond underwriting the work performed on the project. Shortly after construction commenced, American approached the plaintiff, seeking assistance in completing wiring connection services for new computers being installed in the high school as part of the project. Pursuant to an oral agreement with American, the plaintiff subsequently provided substantial services for the project, yet was never fully reimbursed by American for its work. As such, in March, 2006, the plaintiff filed a five count complaint against American, Semac and XL,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>payment of the outstanding balance owed for services it rendered on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In October, 2007, a four day trial to the court was held, with the close of evidence occurring on October 25, 2007. Following the close of evidence, extensive posttrial briefing ensued, and the final briefs were submitted on January 22,2008. On May 14,2008, in a memorandum of decision, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff on counts two, three, four and five with respect to the liability of the defendants; however, the court did not award any damages to the plaintiff on those counts. With respect to count one, the court stated that it had \u201cnot felt sufficiently persuaded, in the absence of oral argument, as to which side must prevail, or, if the plaintiff prevails, which [theory] . . . would form the appropriate [basis for] recovery . . . .\u201d The court further explained that it would \u201cschedule a hearing in late May or early June, 2008, to consider argument of the parties\u201d as to the appropriate basis for relief under count one and, at that time, would also \u201cweigh and determine the costs, interest and attorney\u2019s fees with [regard] to all counts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Despite the court\u2019s scheduling proposal, by June, 2008, no hearing had taken place to resolve the lingering liability and damages issues. Then, on June 4, 2008, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>defendants filed an \u201cobjection to the court\u2019s continued personal jurisdiction,\u201d claiming that the court had failed to render judgment within 120 days of the completion date of the trial in violation of \u00a7 51-183b. As argued by the defendants, because the court had failed to render a timely judgment in accordance with \u00a7 51-183b, the court could not \u201cretain continuing personal jurisdiction over the parties,\u201d and any subsequent judgment against them would be voidable. On September 3, 2008, the hearing originally scheduled for May or June, 2008, was held. At the September 3, 2008 hearing, the court overruled the defendants\u2019 objection to its \u201ccontinuing personal jurisdiction,\u201d rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff on all counts, and awarded damages, including interest, attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages, in accordance with its ruling. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Subsequently, this court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for review of the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion for articulation, directing the court to \u201carticulate whether it [had] found a waiver [by the defendants] of the 120 day rule, and, if so, the factual basis underlying [this] conclusion.\u201d In response, the court stated that the \u201cdefendants did impliedly, at least, waive the 120 day requirement,\u201d and alternatively, \u201cwaiver was not necessary [under \u00a7 51-183b], because [completion of] the [trial] . . . did not occur until the court made its last determination\u201d on September 3, 2008, with judgment being rendered that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The defendants now claim that the court improperly rendered its September 3,2008 judgment more than 120 days after the completion date of trial in contravention of \u00a7 51-183b. Specifically, the defendants maintain that the 120 day time requirement began to run on the last day that posttrial briefs were submitted, or January 22, 2008. Therefore, the defendants argue, the court was required to render judgment on or before May 21, 2008, which it failed to do. Additionally, the defendants argue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>that the court\u2019s conclusion that they had waived the application of the 120 day time requirement was clearly erroneous. We address each of the claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The defendants first claim that the court improperly rendered judgment more than 120 days after the completion of trial in violation of \u00a7 51-183b. In support of this claim, the defendants assert that the appropriate date for assessing when the 120 day period began to run was the date that the final posttrial brief was filed, or January 22, 2008, rather than the date of the final hearing and argument on September 3, 2008. Our case law is clearly to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Section 51-183b provides in relevant part: \u201cAny judge of the Superior Court . . . who has commenced the trial of any civil cause, shall have power to continue such trial and shall render judgment not later than one hundred and twenty days from the <em>completion date of the trial </em>of such civil cause. The parties may waive the provisions of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In construing the meaning of the phrase \u201c \u2018completion date of the trial\u2019,\u201d our Supreme Court, in <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>192 Conn. 601, 604, 472 A.2d 1281 (1984), endorsed the principle that \u201c \u2018completion\u2019 has been held to encompass the availability of all the elements directly or indirectly to be considered [by the trial court] in the rendering of a decision.\u201d More recently, this court has had the opportunity to elaborate on this principle in a case with a procedural posture similar to that in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>King, </em>121 Conn. App. 105, 110, 994 A.2d 330 (2010), the plaintiff brought a civil action against the defendant, alleging, inter alia, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. The matter was tried to the court in March, 2008, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>and the presentation of evidence concluded on March 14, 2008. Id., 108, 110-11. \u201c[Posttrial] [b]riefs were filed on April 22, 2008, and argument was held on May 27, 2008. On September 24, 2008, the court rendered judgment as to liability and damages in favor of the plaintiff on all counts . . . .\u201d Id., 111. The defendant appealed, claiming, inter alia, that \u201cthe court [improperly] rendered judgment more than 120 days after the completion date of trial in violation of \u00a7 51-183b.\u201d Id. In support of his argument, the defendant maintained that the \u201ccompletion date of trial was April 22, 2008, the date posttrial briefs were filed . . . .\u201d Id., 113. Moreover, the defendant claimed that, because no evidence was received by the court during the May 27,2008 argument, that date could not constitute the \u201ccompletion date\u201d under \u00a7 51-183b. Id., 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s arguments in <em>Taylor, </em>this court held that the \u201ccompletion date of trial was the date on which the court last heard argument on the issues of liability and damages before it rendered judgment on those issues . . . .\u201d Id., 108. In so ruling, this court explained that \u201c[r]egardless of whether evidence was taken [during argument on May 27, 2008], and despite the fact that . . . case law cited by both parties considers the filing of posttrial briefs as the completion of trial, there can be no doubt that the [May 27, 2008] hearing could \u2018be considered in the rendering of a decision\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of <em>Frank. </em>Id., 114, citing <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 604. Thus, \u201c[b]ecause it [was] unquestionable that this postbrief argument could be considered in the court\u2019s decision . . . the completion date of trial\u201d was May 27, 2008, and the trial court properly rendered judgment within 120 days on September 24, 2008. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 121 Conn. App. 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Here, as in Taylor,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendants argue that the \u201ccompletion date\u201d of the trial for purposes of \u00a7 51-183b was the date that the final posttrial brief was filed, or January 22, 2008. The record, however, is clear that the date \u201con which the court last heard argument on the issues of liability and damages before it rendered judgment on those issues\u201d was September 3, 2008. Id., 108. Despite the fact that the court previously had issued a memorandum of decision on May 14, 2008,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6we cannot say that the subsequent September 3, 2008 hearing failed to \u201cencompass . . . elements directly or indirectly . . . considered [by the court] in the rendering of [its final] decision.\u201d <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 604. As the defendants concede, \u201c[t]he dispute underlying the present case was not, and could not have been, resolved until a decision on damages was rendered and a final determination as to count one was made.\u201d Nonetheless, the court only resolved the issue of liability and damages following the September 3,2008 hearing at which both parties appeared and presented argument as to those issues. Consistent with <em>Taylor, </em>\u201c[r]egardless of whether evidence was taken\u201d by the court during the September 3, 2008 hearing, it is \u201cunquestionable that this postbrief argument [was] considered in the court\u2019s [final] decision . . . .\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 121 Conn. App. 114-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Thus, we conclude that the \u201ccompletion date\u201d of trial in the present case was September 3, 2008. We further conclude that, because the court rendered judgment that same day, the court fully complied with the 120 day time requirement set forth by \u00a7 51-183b. Accordingly, the defendants\u2019 claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The defendants next claim that the court improperly determined that the \u201cdefendants [had] impliedly, at least, waive [d] [application of] the 120 day requirement,\u201d primarily by way of the defendants\u2019 \u201coverall acquiescence with the litigation\u2019s progress . . . .\u201d Recently, we declined to adopt such reasoning for purposes of finding waiver under \u00a7 51-183b, especially where, as here, a litigant files a seasonable objection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Foote </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>125 Conn. App. 296, 305, 8 A.3d 524 (2010) (\u201c[b]ecause the most that can reasonably be required is objection seasonably made after the filing of the decision . . . the passage of time after the expiration of the 120 day statutory deadline but prior to the filing of the decision, even if significant, cannot, in and of itself, create a duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>speak\u201d [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]). Nonetheless, because we conclude that the court appropriately rendered judgment within 120 days of the completion date of trial pursuant to \u00a7 51-183b, there is no need to consider further whether the defendants waived the application of \u00a7 51-183b.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-41 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cEach contract exceeding one hundred thousand dollars in amount for the construction, alteration or repair of any public building or public work of the state or a municipality shall include a provision that the person to perform the contract shall furnish to the state or municipality ... a bond in the amount of the contract which shall be binding upon the award of the contract to that person ... for the protection of persons supplying labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> Count one of the complaint, brought against XL, sought damages under General Statutes \u00a7 49-42 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who performed . . . subcontracting work [pursuant to a contract within the scope of General Statutes \u00a7 49-41 (a)] . . . who has not received full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>payment for such . . . work . . . may enforce such person\u2019s right to payment under the bond [provided for under \u00a7 49-41 (a)] . . . .\u201d The remaining four counts of the complaint were brought against American and Semac, with causes of action sounding in breach of contract, unjust enrichment and violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. Also, we note that, although the initial complaint was amended in October, 2007, the operative complaint for purposes of this appeal is the March, 2006 complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\"> Although the court did not specifically mention that it would also make a determination with respect to damages at the tentatively scheduled hearing, this conclusion is evident from the fact that the court did not award any damages in favor of the plaintiff in its May 14,2008 memorandum of decision, as well as the fact that damages eventually were ordered on all counts at the final hearing on September 3, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b430-5\"> We note that neither party in <em>Taylor </em>petitioned our Supreme Court for certification to appeal to consider the principal issue involved in both that case and the present appeal. It is axiomatic that one panel of this court cannot overrule the precedent established by a previous panel\u2019s holding. See, e.g., <em>First Connecticut Capital, LLC </em>v. <em>Homes of Westport, LLC, </em>112 Conn. App. 750, 759, 966 A.2d 239 (2009) (\u201cthis court\u2019s policy dictates that one panel should not, on its own, reverse the ruling of a previous panel\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Boccanfuso </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>89 Conn. App. 260, 285 n.20, 873 A.2d 208 (same), cert. denied, 275 Conn. 905, 882 A.2d 668 (2005). As such, we are bound in this case by this court\u2019s ruling in <em>Taylor.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\"> Importantly, the court\u2019s May 14,2008 memorandum of decision, rendered within 120 days of the filing of the final posttrial brief, specifically informed both parties of the need for further argument on the unresolved liability and damages issues. Were it otherwise, we would conclude that the court\u2019s September 3, 2008 judgment would be void under \u00a7 51-183b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\"> The defendants in the present appeal objected to the court\u2019s \u201ccontinuing personal jurisdiction\u201d under \u00a7 51-183b fourteen business (court calendar) days after the court filed its initial May 14, 2008 memorandum of decision. Although we conclude that the court\u2019s September 3, 2008 judgment did not run afoul of \u00a7 51-183b, for purposes of waiver, we disagree with the court, that the defendants failed to preserve application of the 120 day requirement set forth therein. See <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 420, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980) (objection filed ten days after judgment rendered is seasonable and no claim of waiver or consent tenable); <em>Foote </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>125 Conn. App. 296, 8 A.3d 524 (2010) (motion to set aside judgment filed nine days after rendering of habeas decision is seasonable objection); <em>Building Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>40 Conn. App. 89, 104, 669 A.2d 620 (objection filed within five days of judgment being rendered constitutes seasonable objection), cert. denied, 236 Conn. 920, 674 A.2d 1326 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
