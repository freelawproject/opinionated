Reizfeld, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dissolving his marriage to the plaintiff, Celin G. Reizfeld, and entering related financial orders. On appeal, he claims that the court improperly (1) awarded the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees, (2) deviated from the statutory child support guidelines, and (3) ordered that the plaintiff be allowed to reside in the defendant\u2019s home rent and expense free for approximately six months following the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage. The plaintiff cross appeals, claiming that the court improperly determined that the parties were bound by a valid and enforceable antenuptial agreement. With respect to the defendant\u2019s claims, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>the trial court. With respect to the plaintiffs cross appeal, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The following facts, as found by the court, and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of these appeals. On July 27, 1998, the parties executed an ante-nuptial agreement (agreement) \u201cto fix and determine their respective rights in and to all property that the other may own or enjoy at the time of [their] marriage or thereafter ... in the event of a dissolution of [their] marriage . . . .\u201d Both parties were represented by counsel throughout the negotiation and drafting of the agreement, and both parties acknowledged that they were entering into the agreement \u201cfreely, voluntarily, and with full knowledge of [their respective rights].\u201d At the time the agreement was executed, the parties had one three year old child, and the plaintiff was approximately eight months pregnant with their second child. Also at that time, the defendant was in possession of nearly $2.4 million in assets, while the plaintiff was in possession of approximately $4500 in assets. On August 13, 1998, the parties married in New Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">On October 11, 2006, the plaintiff commenced this dissolution action, claiming that the parties\u2019 marriage had broken down irretrievably. In addition to awards of periodic alimony and child support, the plaintiff sought an equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 assets. The defendant filed a special defense, claiming that the parties\u2019 rights upon dissolution of the marriage were governed exclusively by the agreement. The plaintiff filed an amended reply to the defendant\u2019s special defense, arguing that the agreement was unenforceable against her because it was unconscionable both when executed and at the time the defendant sought its enforcement. The matter was tried to the court over seven days in January and February, 2009. On May 4, 2009, the court rendered judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage. In so doing, the court specifically found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>that the agreement was enforceable and awarded the plaintiff alimony and child support,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as $7500 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Additionally, the court ordered that the plaintiff be allowed to reside in the defendant\u2019s home until September 1, 2009. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">On August 28, 2009, in a memorandum of decision, the court granted the plaintiffs postjudgment motion seeking additional funds from the defendant for attorney\u2019s fees to defend the appeal. In addition to ordering that the defendant pay the plaintiff $6000 to defend the appeal, the court also extended the time that the plaintiff be allowed to remain in the defendant\u2019s home until October 15, 2009. Thereafter, the defendant amended his appeal to include a challenge to this postjudgment ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The defendant now claims that the court improperly awarded the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees because the agreement precludes either party from seeking the payment of such fees from the other in the event of a dissolution action. The defendant also claims that the court improperly deviated from the statutory child support guidelines to the detriment of the parties\u2019 minor children and improperly ordered that the plaintiff be allowed to remain rent and expense free in the defendant\u2019s home for a period of six months following the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage. On cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that the agreement was enforceable against her in light of its apparent unconscionability. We address the parties\u2019 claims in turn. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">DEFENDANT\u2019S APPEAL A</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly awarded the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees both in its initial May 4, 2009 financial orders and its subsequent August 28, 2009 postjudgment memorandum of decision. Specifically, the defendant maintains that the award of attorney\u2019s fees to either party in the context of a dissolution action is precluded by the language of the agreement, which the court found to be valid and enforceable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this claim. Nowhere in the parties\u2019 agreement is the issue of attorney\u2019s fees addressed directly. Rather, the issue is addressed implicitly by two separate provisions of the agreement \u2014 namely, paragraphs 5 and 10 (B). Paragraph 5 provides: \u201cNeither of the parties shall seek, in any action for dissolution of marriage, payment for <em>liabilities </em>from the other.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Paragraph 10 (B) states: \u201cThe parties agree that in any [dissolution] action, neither [party] will ask for different or greater rights than those specified [in the agreement] and that each will abide with and be bound by the provisions of [the] [agreement . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">On June 12, 2009, the court granted in part the defendant\u2019s motion for articulation with respect to the \u201cfactual and legal basis for awarding the [p]laintiff attomeyfs] fees and costs . . . .\u201d In clarifying its ruling, the court referenced General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>did not explain how \u00a7 46b-62 applied in light of the parties\u2019 agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant now argues that paragraphs 5 and 10 (B) operate to prohibit the award of attorney\u2019s fees and that the court improperly awarded the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees notwithstanding its June 12, 2009 articulation. Specifically, the defendant maintains that, as to paragraph 5, the term \u201cliabilities\u201d encompasses attorney\u2019s fees, and, thus, the plaintiff is precluded from seeking the payment thereof. As to paragraph 10 (B), the defendant asserts that, because the agreement is silent as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees and because \u201cneither [party may] ask for different or greater rights than those specified [in the agreement],\u201d the plaintiff is further barred from seeking the payment of her attorney\u2019s fees. In response, the plaintiff counters that the meaning of the term \u201cliabilities\u201d in the agreement is ambiguous and undefined and should not be read to include attorney\u2019s fees, especially when the agreement is otherwise silent in this regard. Additionally, the plaintiff raises equitable challenges to the agreement\u2019s applicability on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees given the parties\u2019 grossly disproportionate financial positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Before addressing the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments, we begin with the applicable legal principles and standard of review governing our analysis. \u201cThe standard of review in family matters is well settled. An appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>conclude as it did, based on the facts presented. . . . It is within the province of the trial court to find facts and draw proper inferences from the evidence presented. ... In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action. . . . [T]o conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, we must find that the court either incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Elia </em>v. <em>Elia, </em>99 Conn. App. 829, 831, 916 A.2d 845 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">\u201cAn antenuptial agreement is a type of contract and must, therefore, comply with ordinary principles of contract law.\u201d <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>181 Conn. 482, 486, 436 A.2d 8 (1980). Thus, as contracts, \u201cantenuptial agreements are to be construed according to the principles of construction applicable to contracts generally. The basic purpose of [contract] construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 491. \u201cIf a contract is unambiguous within its four comers, intent of the parties is a question of law requiring plenary review. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity .... Similarly, any ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms [contained therein]. . . . Although ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact . . . [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number><em>Montoya </em>v. <em>Montoya, </em>280 Conn. 605, 612-13, 909 A.2d 947 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">We conclude that the term \u201cliabilities,\u201d as contained in paragraph 5 of the parties\u2019 agreement, is unambiguous and includes within its \u201cordinary meaning\u201d attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Montoya </em>v. <em>Montoya, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 612. As the plaintiff notes, \u201c[p]renuptial agreements in Connecticut have been governed since October 1, 1995, by the Connecticut Premarital [Agreement] Act, [as codified in] General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36a et seq.\u201d The Connecticut Premarital Agreement Act does not define the terms \u201cliable\u201d or \u201cliabilities.\u201d As our Supreme Court recently explained, \u201c[w]hen a statute does not provide a definition, \u2018words and phrases . . . are to be construed according to their common usage. ... To ascertain that usage, we look to the dictionary definition of the term.\u2019 . . . Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u2018liability\u2019 as \u2018something for which one is liable ... as ... an amount that is owed whether payable in money, other property, or services,\u2019 and defines \u2018liable\u2019 as \u2018bound or obligated according to law or equity ....\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Potvin </em>v. <em>Lincoln Service &amp; Equipment Co., </em>298 Conn. 620, 633, 6 A.3d 60 (2010). Given this definition, we fail to see how attorney\u2019s fees, which are simply \u201c \u2018an amount that is owed . . . payable in money\u2019 id.; to one\u2019s lawyer, are not within the plain meaning of \u201cliabilities\u201d as contained in paragraph 5 of the parties\u2019 agreement. Having found the parties\u2019 agreement valid and enforceable, the court was bound, as with any other contract, to give effect to the agreement \u201c \u2018according to its terms\u2019 \u201d as a manifestation of the parties\u2019 intent in entering the same. <em>Montoya </em>v. <em>Montoya, </em>supra, 612. This conclusion is consistent with the development of our law in dissolution actions involving enforceable antenuptial agreements. See <em>Crews </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>295 Conn. 153, 169, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>989 A.2d 1060 (2010) (\u201c[w]hether provident or improvident, an [antenuptial] agreement moved on calculated considerations is entitled to the sanction of the law\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Montoya </em>v. <em>Montoya, </em>supra, 613 (\u201cas with all contracts, we assume a deliberately prepared and executed agreement reflects the intention of the parties [and] . . . we generally may consider [the parties\u2019] intent only to the extent that it is evidenced by their writing\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>250 Conn. 226, 235, 737 A.2d 383 (1999) (\u201c[t]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words [of their agreement] and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 491 (\u201c[w]here there is no ambiguity [in an antenuptial agreement] . . . there is no occasion for construction and the agreement will be enforced as its terms direct\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Further, the plaintiffs argument that equitable considerations of the parties\u2019 financial statuses provide an adequate basis for awarding the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees is unpersuasive in this context, especially given the court\u2019s finding of the agreement\u2019s validity. See, e.g., <em>Friezo </em>v. <em>Friezo, </em>281 Conn. 166, 199, 914 A.2d 533 (2007) (\u201c [contracting parties are normally bound by their agreements . . . irrespective of whether the agreements embodied reasonable or good bargains\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Thus, because the court found that the parties\u2019 agreement was enforceable, and because we conclude that the term \u201cliabilities\u201d as used in paragraph 5 of the agreement includes attorney\u2019s fees, the plaintiff was precluded from seeking the payment of her attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>fees from the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *By ordering the defendant to pay the trial attorney\u2019s fees of the plaintiff in the amount of $7500 and appellate attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $6000, the court abused its discretion. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect to the award of attorney\u2019s fees and remand the case with direction to amend the judgment to enter orders denying the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly deviated from the statutory child support guidelines. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court incorrectly calculated his child support obligation by assigning the plaintiff an actual gross weekly income of $ 150, rather than using the plaintiffs earning capacity of $500 in gross weekly income. The defendant also argues that the court incorrectly ordered that he be responsible for 70 percent of unreimbursed medical expenses and child care costs, given the court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff was obligated to pay 73 percent of such expenses as well as the parties\u2019 joint custody arrangement of their minor children. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to the disposition of this claim. In calculating the defendant\u2019s child support obligation, the court completed two separate child support worksheets. On one of those worksheets, the court, utilizing the parties\u2019 financial affidavits, calculated the defendant\u2019s child support obligation using the plaintiffs actual gross weekly income, or $150. This calculation resulted in the defendant\u2019s presumptive child support obligation of $240 per week.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>The court then prepared a second worksheet using the plaintiffs anticipated earning capacity of $500 in gross weekly income.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This calculation had the effect of reducing the defendant\u2019s child support obligation by $35 to a total of $205 weekly. Also on this second worksheet, the court noted that the plaintiff would be responsible for 73 percent of the unreimbursed medical expenses and child care costs, while the defendant would be responsible for 27 percent of such expenses. In its May 4, 2009 financial orders, the court set the defendant\u2019s child support obligation at $240 per week<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and explained that it was \u201cnot [deviating] from the [child support] guidelines [notwithstanding] shared physical custody or . . . [the plaintiffs] earning capacity [because] . . . the [plaintiff] need[ed] time to get back into the workforce and find affordable housing for herself and the [parties\u2019] children, [as well as] the significant disparity in assets [between the parties], the [defendant\u2019s] prior income levels and profession . . . and the best interests] of the [parties\u2019] minor children . . . .\u201d Additionally, in contrast to its worksheet notation, the court ordered that the defendant be responsible for 70 percent of the unreimbursed medical and child care costs. The court further explained that, although these assignments were a deviation from the presumptive percentages, they were warranted by the parties\u2019 disproportionate financial circumstances. The defendant now argues that the court improperly calculated his child support obligation on the basis of the plaintiffs actual gross weekly income, rather than the plaintiffs earning capacity. The defendant also argues that the court improperly ordered that he be responsible for 70 percent of the unreimbursed medical and child care costs, given the court\u2019s initial worksheet notation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>that the plaintiff was responsible for 73 percent of such expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">It bears repeating that \u201c[i]n determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action. . . . Appellate review of a trial court\u2019s findings of fact is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review. The trial court\u2019s findings are binding on this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence in the record to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Buehler </em>v. <em>Buehler, </em>117 Conn. App. 304, 317-18, 978 A.2d 1141 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Here, both parties presented extensive evidence over the course of a seven day trial as to their respective financial assets. Notably, the defendant\u2019s financial affidavit shows a net worth of approximately $706,000, while the plaintiffs financial affidavit discloses no significant asset base whatsoever. Moreover, the court found that the defendant was a successfully practicing attorney, with an annual gross income of more than $70,000 and \u201csignificant future opportunities to support himself and . . . increase his income . . . .\u201d These findings were in stark contrast to the plaintiffs limited earning capacity and gross yearly income of only $7800. In light of this evidence, we cannot say that the court\u2019s findings and conclusions with respect to the defendant\u2019s child support obligation were clearly erroneous. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s argument that the court improperly deviated from the child support guidelines by using the plaintiffs actual gross income is misguided, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>deviation would instead be in using the plaintiffs earning capacity. As such, the court\u2019s decision to adhere to the guidelines for purposes of calculating the defendant\u2019s child support obligation was supported by the evidence presented by both parties and did not constitute an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>Wallbeoff </em>v. <em>Wallbeoff </em>113 Conn. App. 107, 108 n.1, 965 A.2d 571 (2009) (\u201c[t]he current support, health care coverage contribution, and child care contribution amounts calculated [under the child support guidelines] . . . are presumed to be the correct amounts to be ordered\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Additionally, the evidence provided ample support for the court to deviate from the presumptive percentages with respect to the minor children\u2019s unreimbursed medical and child care costs. As the court stated in its articulation, this deviation was based on \u201cthe [plaintiffs need] ... to get back into the workforce and find affordable housing for herself and the [parties\u2019] children, the significant disparity in [the parties\u2019] assets, the [defendant\u2019s] prior income levels and profession . . . and the best interests] of the [parties\u2019] minor children.\u201d See <em>Wallbeoff </em>v. <em>Wallbeoff </em>supra, 113 Conn. App. 108 n.l (\u201c[t]he presumption regarding [the amount of health care expenses and child care costs] may be rebutted by a specific finding on the record that such amount would be inequitable or inappropriate in a particular case\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We find that the initial notation attributing the payment of 73 percent of these expenses to the plaintiff was merely a scrivener\u2019s error that was ultimately corrected by way of the court\u2019s May 4, 2009 financial orders. The record is replete with evidence sufficient to justify the court\u2019s financial orders, both with respect to the defendant\u2019s child support obligation, as well as the defendant\u2019s responsibility for unreimbursed medical expenses and child care costs. As such, the court did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>discretion in setting the defendant\u2019s child support obligation at $240 per week, nor did the court abuse its discretion by obligating the defendant to pay 70 percent of the unreimbursed medical and child care costs for the parties\u2019 minor children. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly ordered that the plaintiff be allowed to remain in the defendant\u2019s home rent and expense free for a period of six months following the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s order in this regard constituted an additional award of alimony to the plaintiff and that the court failed to assign appropriately a value to the plaintiffs continued use and occupancy of the defendant\u2019s home. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the disposition of this claim. In support of its May 4, 2009 financial orders, the court made a number of factual findings regarding the parties\u2019 property interests, including the family home located in Woodbridge. Importantly, the court found that the plaintiff had \u201cno credible claim to any interest in the home,\u201d as it constituted a premarital asset of the defendant, and initially ordered that the plaintiff vacate the home by September 1, 2009. On May 7, 2009, the defendant filed a motion for articulation requesting that the court clarify the \u201cfactual and legal basis\u201d for allowing the plaintiff to remain in the home until September 1, 2009, as well as whether this order constituted an additional award of alimony and, if so, the value thereof. On June 12, 2009, the court granted in part the defendant\u2019s motion for articulation and, on August 28,2009, clarified its initial order in a memorandum of decision. As the court explained, the order allowing the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>remain in the family home did not constitute an additional award of alimony, and the court went further in extending the time that the plaintiff be allowed to remain in the home until October 15, 2009. The defendant now claims that the court improperly ordered that the plaintiff be allowed to remain in the family home rent and expense free until October 15, 2009, particularly in light of the fact that the court found the home to belong \u201cfree and clear\u201d to the defendant pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement. Furthermore, the defendant maintains that the court improperly determined that the plaintiffs continued \u201cuse and occupancy\u201d of the defendant\u2019s home did not constitute an additional award of alimony and failed to assign appropriately a value thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Our review of the record discloses that at no time did the defendant offer any evidence from which the court could calculate the approximate value, if any, of the plaintiffs \u201cuse and occupancy\u201d of the family home following the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage. Moreover, the parties\u2019 agreement is utterly silent as to how such a value would be calculated. Thus, assuming arguendo that the court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs continued use of the family home did not constitute an additional award of alimony was improper, any such ruling would be harmless given the defendant\u2019s failure to provide an adequate evidentiary basis for the court to utilize in calculating the value of such an award. See <em>Misthopoulos </em>v. <em>Misthopoulos, </em>297 Conn. 358, 383, 999 A.2d 721 (2010) (\u201cThe harmless error standard in a civil case is whether the improper ruling would likely affect the result. . . . When judging the likely effect of such a trial court ruling, the reviewing court is constrained to make its determination on the basis of the printed record before it.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). \u201cBecause it is the . . . appellant\u2019s responsibility to provide this court with an adequate record for review . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>we will not remand a case to correct a deficiency the . . . appellant should have remedied\u201d by presenting evidence to support his claims in the first instance. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>124 Conn. App. 36, 40, 3 A.3d 1018 (2010). Because the defendant failed to provide any evidence from which the court could make a value calculation regarding the plaintiffs continued \u201cuse and occupancy\u201d of the defendant\u2019s home following the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, any error in the court's ruling was harmless, and we need not address further the defendant\u2019s arguments in this regard. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S CROSS APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Next, we address the plaintiffs cross appeal, in which she claims that the court improperly concluded that the parties\u2019 agreement was valid and enforceable against her. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the agreement is unenforceable because it is unconscionable now, as the defendant seeks to enforce it, and when it was originally executed. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the disposition of the plaintiffs cross appeal. The plaintiff initially raised the issue of the agreement\u2019s unconscionability in her January 5, 2009 amended reply to the defendant\u2019s special defense. The basis for the plaintiffs claim of unconscionability was that, at the time the agreement was executed, \u201cthe plaintiff was pregnant with the defendant\u2019s second child, within days of delivery, and in a heightened emotional state.\u201d Also, the plaintiff maintained that enforcement of the agreement would leave \u201cthe plaintiff without any funds whatsoever with which to support herself.\u201d In its May 4, 2009 factual findings in support of its financial orders, the court explained that \u201calthough the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>agreement may not be acceptable to the [plaintiff] at this point in time, [the] court does not find it unconscionable when executed or now when enforcement is sought.\u201d Importantly, the court noted that both parties, \u201cparticularly the [plaintiff], were afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with independent counsel\u201d at the time the agreement was executed, such that execution of the agreement constituted each parties\u2019 \u201cfree act and deed . . . .\u201d The plaintiff now claims that the court improperly concluded that the agreement was enforceable, given its apparent unconscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">\u201cWhether enforcement of an agreement would work an injustice is analogous to determining whether enforcement of an agreement would be unconscionable. It is well established that [t]he question of unconscionability is a matter of law to be decided by the court based on all the facts and circumstances of the case. . . . Thus, our review on appeal is unlimited by the clearly erroneous [or abuse of discretion] standard. . . . This means that the ultimate determination of whether a transaction is unconscionable is a question of law, not a question of fact, and that the court\u2019s determination on that issue is subject to plenary review on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crews </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>supra, 295 Conn. 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">\u201cWhen legal conclusions of the trial court are challenged on appeal, we must decide whether [those] . . . conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record. ... To render unenforceable an otherwise valid antenuptial agreement, a court must determine: (1) the parties\u2019 intent and circumstances when they signed the antenuptial agreement; (2) the circumstances of the parties at the time of the dissolution of the marriage; (3) whether those circumstances are so far beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time of execution; and (4) if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the circumstances are beyond the parties\u2019 initial contemplation, whether enforcement would cause an injustice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 167-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">\u201c[In any case] the party seeking to challenge the enforceability of the antenuptial contract bears a heavy burden.\u201d Id., 169. \u201cIn the absence of a clear indication that the antenuptial agreement is unenforceable because it was not validly entered into, that it violated public policy, or that it would be unjust to enforce the agreement due to a significant and uncontemplated change in the parties\u2019 circumstances . . . we are unable to rewrite the terms of the contract to which the parties themselves agreed.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Here, the record clearly supports the court\u2019s conclusion that the parties\u2019 agreement was validly executed and not unconscionable. Not only were both parties represented by their own counsel in negotiation and execution of the agreement, but there was also a third independent attorney who oversaw \u201cexecution of the document [to] make sure [execution] was [each party\u2019s] free act and deed and that [each party was] not under any duress at the time of signing.\u201d Moreover, although there is a gross disparity in the financial assets of the parties, this disparity existed at the time the agreement was executed. Thus, we cannot say, based on our review of the record, that the \u201ccircumstances of the parties at the time of the dissolution of the marriage\u201d; <em>Crews </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>supra, 295 Conn. 168; were beyond the contemplation of the plaintiff, either when the agreement was executed or when the defendant sought its enforcement in this dissolution action. Although we are mindful of the equitable concerns raised by the plaintiff in support of her unconscionability argument, our consideration of whether the \u201c \u2018agreement was a good bargain for the plaintiff does not enter into the analysis\u2019 \u201d on appeal. Id. In the present case, there is no indication that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>parties\u2019 agreement \u201cwas not validly entered into, that it violate [s] public policy, or that it would be unjust to enforce the agreement due to a significant and uncontemplated change in the parties\u2019 circumstances . . . .\u201d Id., 173. Thus, we conclude that the court properly determined that the parties\u2019 agreement was enforceable and, accordingly, the plaintiffs cross appeal fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The judgment is reversed only with respect to the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment denying the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\"> At the time that the court rendered judgment, the parties\u2019 minor children were fourteen years old and ten years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b811-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any proceeding seeking relief under the provisions of this chapter . . . the court may order either spouse ... to pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of the other in accordance with their respective financial abilities . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\"> The court also referenced plaintiffs trial exhibit forty, which is the plaintiffs affidavit as to her attorney\u2019s fees, as well as the initial May 4, 2009 judgment and financial orders. Nonetheless, the court did not explain how either of these references supported its award of attorney\u2019s fees given the parties\u2019 agreement. Also, the record is devoid of any articulation as to the court\u2019s postjudgment award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees, though for purposes of this appeal, we presume that the court\u2019s justification for attorney\u2019s fees is identical for the award of both trial and appellate attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\"> Given this conclusion, we need not address further the defendant\u2019s argument that paragraph 10 (B) of the parties\u2019 agreement also precludes the award of attorney\u2019s fees in this dissolution action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b816-11\"> We note that this relatively modest amount is based on the court\u2019s acceptance of the defendant\u2019s claim in his financial affidavit that his net income totals $731 per week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\"> The court based this figure on its specific finding that the plaintiffs earning capacity was \u201cat least\u201d $26,000 per year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\"> This amount was later reduced on November 12, 2009, to $120 by way of a stipulated agreement between the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
