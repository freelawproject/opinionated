He went to trial on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and was found guilty of that charge. Thomas was sentenced on July 2, 1999. At sentencing the two drug count convictions and the felon in possession conviction were grouped together under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c) because they involved substantially the same harm. Thomas\u2019 base offense level as calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 was 14 based on the amount of crack cocaine, which was enhanced to 16 because of the specific offense characteristic of his firearm possession. Thomas\u2019 base offense level of 16, along with his criminal history category of VI, indicated a guidelines range of 46 to 57 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-18\">However, as a result of the application of the armed career criminal provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), Thomas\u2019 offense level was increased to 34 because he had used or possessed a firearm in connection with a controlled substance offense. Therefore, Thomas\u2019 sentence was based on the guideline range applicable to armed career criminals \u2014 262 to 327 months \u2014 and he was sentenced to 295 months on the firearm possession count. On the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>crack cocaine offenses, the district court sentenced Thomas to the statutory maximum of 240 months to run concurrently with the sentence on the firearm count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-3\">Thomas appeals the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence. That motion was based on the retroactively applicable amendment to the crack cocaine guidelines. As we recently explained: \u201c... Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines ... together with Amendment 713, retroactively reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007); Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">We have subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal because the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to decide the motion for reduction of sentence. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326. Although Thomas filed his motion for re-sentencing before Amendment 706 became retroactively applicable on March 3, 2008, the district court did not rule on it until after the amendment became effective. <em>Moore </em>holds that under these circumstances there is jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">The defendants in <em>Moore, </em>just like Thomas, had their base offense levels calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which determines the applicable level based on the quantity of drugs involved in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1325. The <em>Moore </em>defendants, also like Thomas, had their offense levels adjusted to either 37 or 34. <em>Id. </em>The district court adjusted the <em>Moore </em>defendants\u2019 offense levels because they were classified as career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4131.1(a). <em>Id. </em>This Court held that because the defendants\u2019 sentences were based on the guideline ranges applicable to career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1, their base levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of their guideline ranges for sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. Therefore, Amendment 706\u2019s effect on their base offense levels made no difference in the sentencing ranges upon which their sentences were based. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">There is only one difference between this case and <em>Moore: </em>Thomas was sentenced under the guideline for armed career criminals, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, while the <em>Moore </em>defendants were sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. However, that difference in the applicable recidivist guideline does not call for a difference in result. The reasoning in <em>Moore </em>applies here as well. We explained in <em>Moore </em>that, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">The reduction of base offense levels in relation to crack cocaine quantities under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) has no effect on Thomas\u2019 sentencing range. <em>See id. </em>As was the case in <em>Moore, </em>Thomas would have been subject to exactly the same guidelines range if the provisions of Amendment 706 had been in effect at the time he was originally sentenced because his sentence was based on the guideline range applicable to armed career criminals under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
