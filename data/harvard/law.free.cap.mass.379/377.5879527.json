At the trial in the District Court of Hampshire, the individual defendant Judkins impleaded his insurance company, General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation, Limited (General), and the plaintiff there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>after asserted his claim directly against the insurer pursuant to Dist./Mun. Cts. R. Civ. P. 14 (a) (1975). General, having received no notice of the accident until June 3, 1975, twelve months and five days after the accident, and proceeding under a policy requiring notice \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d disclaimed coverage for any amount beyond the compulsory statutory limit of $5,000. After trial, the District Court judge ordered judgment for the plaintiff against the individual defendants and General in the amount of $100,000. The Appellate Division of the District Courts, Western Division, upheld this judgment as to liability and damages, but vacated that part of the judgment against General in excess of the statutory limit of $5,000, for the failure of the insured defendant Howard Judkins to give timely notice of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The plaintiff appeals this reduction in General\u2019s liability. He argues that the Legislature\u2019s passage of St. 1977, c. 437, amending G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 112, providing that late notification by an insured will not defeat a claim against an insurer unless the insurer has been prejudiced thereby, does not foreclose our amendment of the contrary common law rule applicable at the time of the accident. We decline to abrogate that rule and therefore affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">This court has held on other occasions that notice of an accident given by an insured to his insurer even with substantially less delay than in the instant case did not constitute notice \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d <em>Brackman </em>v. <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>349 Mass. 767 (1965). <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. </em>&amp; <em>Sur. Co., </em>337 Mass. 185, 188-189 (1958). <em>Depot Cafe Inc. </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co., </em>321 Mass. 220, 224-225 (1947). See <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assurance Corp., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 712 (1975). Claims were defeated even where the insurer suffered no prejudice. See <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>344 Mass. 223, 226 (1962); <em>Imperiali </em>v. <em>Pica, </em>338 Mass. 494, 498 (1959). The requirement of notice has been regarded as a condition of the contract of insurance, and a breach of that condition, in the absence of estoppel or waiver, relieved the insurer of liability. <em>Polito </em>v. <em>Galluzzo, </em>337 Mass. 360, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>364-365 (1958). <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Great Am. Indem. Co., </em>316 Mass. 155, 157 (1944). See <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>New Amsterdam Cos. Co., </em>247 N.Y. 271, 276-277 (1928). As a result of this doctrine, if a defendant was dilatory, as was the situation here, the injured plaintiff could receive no more under the defendant\u2019s liability insurance policy than the statutorily mandated minimum. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A (5), as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 20; <em>Masterson </em>v. <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>288 Mass. 518, 521-522 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The accident in which the plaintiff was injured occurred well before G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 112, was amended in 1977 to change the common law rule of notice relative to motor vehicle liability insurance policies. The plaintiff, mindful of the generally accepted principle that all statutes are construed to operate prospectively, unless a retrospective application is indicated by necessary implication, see <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vinciullo, </em>364 Mass. 624, 626 (1974), does not urge us to apply the statute retroactively to his case. Rather, he asks us to abolish the common law rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The plaintiff relied in oral argument on <em>Soule </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., </em>378 Mass. 177 (1979). In that case the plaintiff was not aided by a statute which was enacted after his cause of action arose and which modified the common law prospectively. Nevertheless, this court modified the applicable common law retroactively, and the plaintiff prevailed under that modification. However, an important distinction between <em>Soule </em>and the present case mandates a contrary result. <em>Soule </em>and its complementary statute were preceded by a number of cases clearly announcing a trend away from \u201carchaic common law rules\u201d in the area of tort immunities. <em>Id. </em>at 184, and cases cited therein. Consequently, the modernization of that area of law by both the Legislature and this court was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 185. In contrast, the statute involved in the instant case concerns an aspect of contract law that we have not previously questioned. See cases, <em>supra, </em>upholding the notice requirement. Essentially, the plaintiff asks us now to depart retroactively from the meaning and import that we have given for at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>two generations to a significant condition of contracts of insurance. The Legislature has determined here that the change in the law shall be prospective only. We defer to its decision, see <em>Soule </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., supra </em>at 185, and decline to engage in retroactive revision of the common law as it existed prior to the 1977 statutory amendment. Cf. <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>377 Mass. 914 (1979) (governmental immunity); <em>Swartz </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>375 Mass. 628, 631 (1978) (strict liability in tort); <em>Kolofsky </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>370 Mass. 856 (1976) (liability to guest passengers); <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Emerson Hosp., </em>367 Mass. 714, 716 (1975) (charitable immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The order of the Appellate Division vacating the judgment for the plaintiff against General in the amount of $100,000 and entering a decision for the plaintiff against General for $5,000 and dismissing the report as to the individual defendants is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
