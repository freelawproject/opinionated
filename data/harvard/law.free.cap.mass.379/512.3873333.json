At that time, there was on record a mortgage deed from Wendell to the defendant bank purporting to relate to \u201c[a]ll right, title and interest in and to the land owned by [Wendell] located in Hampshire County.\u201d In this proceeding the plaintiffs seek a determination that the mortgage to the bank is subordinate to their mortgage. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>argue that the general description in the mortgage deed to the bank prevents it from being effective, at least as to them. The bank filed a motion for summary judgment which was allowed, and judgment was entered for the bank. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We agree with the judge\u2019s conclusions, but, because the plaintiffs seek a declaration of rights in this proceeding, we order the entry of judgment that the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage does not have priority over the bank\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">It is agreed that Wendell acquired the subject parcel in 1974 by deed and immediately gave a mortgage to a savings bank. The deed and the mortgage were recorded. Wendell\u2019s subsequent mortgage deeds, first to the bank and then to the plaintiffs, were recorded in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the mortgage to the bank fails to comply with G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 6A, as appearing in St. 1970, c. 222, which is set forth in full in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We shall assume, without deciding, that a mortgage deed, including a second mortgage, conveys land within the meaning of \u00a7 6A. There is no suggestion in \u00a7 6A, however, that, if an instrument is accepted for recording in violation of the provisions of \u00a7 6A, any adverse consequences must follow. Indeed, \u00a7 6A indicates that failure to comply with its terms \u201cshall not affect the validity of any instrument.\u201d In any event, \u00a7 6A is inapplicable to any instrument that states that it \u201cdoes not create any new boundaries.\u201d Although that explicit statement does not appear in the bank\u2019s mortgage deed, the fact that the mortgage deed created no new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>boundaries is obvious from its terms. Section 6A does not aid the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Apart from considerations of \u00a7 6A, there is no basis for subordinating the bank\u2019s mortgage as to land owned by Wendell pursuant to a deed of which the plaintiffs had constructive notice because it was recorded prior to the recording of the bank\u2019s mortgage. See <em>Hampshire Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Calkins, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 697, 698-699 (1975), where the mortgage description (\u201call of our . . . land situated within Hampshire County\u201d) was substantially the same as that involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Judgment shall be entered declaring the rights of the parties in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> \u201cNo instrument conveying unregistered land shall be accepted for recording unless <em>(a) </em>the instrument indicates that the land conveyed is the same as described in or conveyed by prior recorded instruments identified sufficiently to locate the place of recording within the registry, or states that the instrument does not create any new boundaries, or (b) the instrument identifies the land conveyed either by reference to a plan or plans previously recorded in the same registry of deeds and identified sufficiently to locate the place of recording therein, or by reference to a plan or plans recorded with the conveyance. Failure to comply with this section shall not affect the validity of any instrument.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
