See <em>Thames </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>365 Mass. 477, 479 (1974); <em>Costarelli </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 677, 681-682 (1978); <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794-795 (1969). See also G. L. c. 263, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, 8A, and G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 75. Jones asserts that the Commonwealth is barred from reprosecuting him because in his case there was no \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for declaring a mistrial over his objection and after the evidence had been completed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">We summarize the facts. Jones and a codefendant, Frank Rivera, were indicted for the murder and armed robbery of William Dowling. Each defendant was also indicted for both armed robbery and assault and battery upon George Miller by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The trial of the two defendants, who were represented by separate counsel, commenced in mid-summer. Among the many motions filed by Jones were a motion for severance and a motion for individual interrogation of the jurors. Jones also requested that the judge ask approximately thirty-one questions in addition to the statutory questions. See G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. Both motions were denied and exceptions noted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">During the empanelment of the jury the judge made a number of caustic remarks about both defense counsel,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> apparently prompted by their conduct. Although Jones\u2019s motion for additional questioning of the jurors was initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>denied, the judge finally decided to ask the questions proposed by Jones. In the course of reading the questions to the jurors as <em>a </em>group, the judge and Jones\u2019s counsel engaged in some verbal clashes. The most serious exchange between the judge and Jones\u2019s counsel which occurred during the jury empanelment tended to disparage Jones\u2019s counsel\u2019s legal ability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Rivera\u2019s counsel objected to the judge\u2019s remarks directed at him and attempted to make a motion which the judge declined to hear until \u201cafter court.\u201d After the jurors were excused Rivera\u2019s counsel made an oral motion for mistrial in</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">which Jones\u2019s counsel joined.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge found that the conduct of both counsel was \u201cscandalous\u201d and denied the oral motion for mistrial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Jones filed a written motion for mistrial the next morning. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No references to the written motion are found in the record until the discussion, six days later, as to whether a mistrial ought to be granted. At the start of the third day of trial, just prior to the Commonwealth\u2019s opening, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>instructed the jury to disregard any colloquy between counsel and the court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">In its opening the Commonwealth claimed that it would prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Jones robbed one George Miller and committed an assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (a knife) on Miller. The Commonwealth alleged that Jones would be identified as the person who stabbed one William Dowling in the chest. The Commonwealth said that Miller would \u201cpositively identify] Herman Jones as the . . . person who had robbed him [Miller] and put the knife to his [Miller\u2019s] neck, and whom he had seen run from the scene\u201d where Dowling was stabbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s expectations as expressed in its opening, Miller did not identify Jones as being at the scene of the crime. As a result of the failure of the Commonwealth\u2019s proof, counsel for Jones said little or nothing for the first two days of testimony. Counsel for Jones, however, renewed his motion for severance when it appeared that cross-examination by Rivera\u2019s counsel might harm his client\u2019s interests.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although Jones\u2019s counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>silent during the Commonwealth\u2019s case, there were frequent exchanges between the judge and Rivera\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">During the Commonwealth\u2019s presentation of its case-in-chief the judge ruled favorably on an evidentiary request made by Jones\u2019s counsel. Jones obtained directed verdicts at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case on two of the four indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Jones presented evidence which, if believed, would have shown him to be elsewhere at the time of the crime. After the Commonwealth and the defendant had presented their evidence,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rivera\u2019s counsel began presenting Rivera\u2019s defense. At this time, the colloquies between Rivera\u2019s counsel and the judge escalated both in frequency and hostility. Rivera\u2019s counsel was continually admonished for asking leading questions during Rivera\u2019s direct examination. Finally, the judge sharply rebuked Rivera for interjecting a statement while the judge was discussing the admissibility of an answer with his attorney.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>At this point, the judge ordered the jury to take a recess, and Rivera\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial. Jones\u2019s attorney objected to a declaration of a mistrial at that time. The prosecutor indicated he was prepared to go forward. The judge informed Jones\u2019s lawyer that he was allowing the previous motion for a mistrial, which had been taken under advisement. Jones\u2019s counsel then formally waived the earlier motion, explaining that it had been based on the events occurring during empanelment and that any prejudice arising in that regard had since been abated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">In responding to those objections, the judge said, \u201cI just don\u2019t think if one defendant is removed for whatever reason, that it should go, and I\u2019ll give you a mistrial, which you asked for originally.\u201d The judge further noted that he had granted the motion before it was waived. He went on: \u201c Beyond you, . . . and beyond me and beyond everybody, stand Rivera and Jones, and right now I\u2019ll take my share of it. Things <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>have got out of hand and perhaps they were from the beginning, so with that in mind, I allow both your motions which were filed.\u201d The record reveals that the judge was concerned about the possibility of jury bias or prejudice.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Jones\u2019s counsel asked for a severance which the judge allowed saying \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should have to go through that twice.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The next day, however, the judge reversed his ruling granting a severance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Thereafter, Jones\u2019s motion to dismiss the remaining indictments on double jeopardy grounds was denied. Pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, Jones sought a stay of retrial claiming that to reprosecute him would violate the common law of this Commonwealth against being twice in jeopardy as well as the prohibition against double jeopardy contained in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Cos-tarelli </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 677, 681-682 (1978). Accord, <em>Abney </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 654-662 (1977). A single justice of this court granted the stay and transferred the matter to a single justice of the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The single justice of the Appeals Court reserved and reported the question of \u201cwhether the Commonwealth is barred by the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States from proceeding with the trial of Jones ... on the criminal indictments at issue, or, alternatively, whether the record as a whole reveals that there was \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 for the mistrial granted by the trial judge over the objection of the defendant.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 383 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The Appeals Court concluded that Jones did not consent to the mistrial by filing a motion for mistrial based on the jury empanelment, that there was no judicial overreaching<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that on the record the Commonwealth had demonstrated a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 505 (1978). We agree with the Appeals Court that Jones did not consent to the mistrial. However, we think that the record does not support a con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>elusion that there was \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial, and we hold that the Commonwealth is barred from repros-ecuting Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Jones asserts that there was no \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial in his case. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, 22 </em>U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580 (1824). Jones claims that since both the Commonwealth and the defendant had rested, severance was the appropriate remedy. Severance, Jones contends, would have permitted him to continue with the first tribunal selected to hear his case, a tribunal he believed to be \u201cfavorably disposed to his fate.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 486 (1970).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, he contends that a severance would have also served \u201cthe public interest in insuring that justice is meted out to offenders.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 92 (1978). <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 506 (1978). <em>Downum </em>v. <em>United States, </em>372 U.S. 734, 736 (1963). <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689 (1949). See Note, Mistrials and Double Jeopardy, 15 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 169, 172, 182-183 (1977). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">There is no hard and fast rule as to whether severance should be granted or denied in joint trials.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Courts which have declined to sever and have upheld the declaration of a mistrial as to all defendants have based their decision, first, on the complexity of the case, and second, on the proposition that in a complex, multi-defendant case, fairness to all the defendants may preclude severance. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>390 F.2d 420, 422-424 (4th Cir. 1968) (several defendants). <em>Oelke </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 F.2d 668, 672 n.5 (9th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1029 (1968) (three defendants). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>372 F.2d 453, 465-466 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 907 (1967) (six defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>ants). See <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>486 F.2d 1118, 1123-1124 (4th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 876 (1974) (two defendants) .</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Jones claims that his case was relatively simple and that the judge erroneously denied the severance because it would be \u201cmerely for the convenience of counsel.\u201d See note 16, <em>supra. </em>In essence, Jones argues that there is no basis on this record to deny a severance for reasons of complexity or fairness to all defendants, and that the judge\u2019s decision therefore was not based on \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">We think that the deep respect due a defendant\u2019s right to a single prosecution required serious consideration of severance as the appropriate remedy. Although the judge\u2019s denial of a severance at the start of the trial was well within his discretion, judicial discretion is much narrower after the trial starts. \u201cRulings on motions for severance are governed by a wide discretion and have a strong basis in considerations of trial efficiency and convenience. But a much more restricted discretion controls where double jeopardy is concerned, since this is a fundamental constitutional right.\u201d <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States, </em>202 F.2d 354, 356 (D.C. Cir.) (Bazelon, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 879, and sub nom. <em>Bayne </em>v. <em>United States, </em>344 U.S. 881 (1952) ,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See Note, Jeopardy and Mistrials, 125 U. Pa. L. Rev. 449, 528 (1977). \u201cMany and unpredictable are the sources of conflicting rights among themselves in the trial of co-defendants, especially in conspiracy cases. We are reluctant to open the field to mistrial for the benefit of one defendant at the cost of the valued right of another defendant to go to the jury of his selection . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>506 F.2d 291, 299 (2d Cir. 1974) (four defendants). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>516 F.2d 941, 947 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Beasley, </em>491 F.2d 507, 509-510 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 955 (1974). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>think that these cases are controlling in the circumstances of Jones\u2019s case, and that severance was the appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Moreover, the record reveals that the judge failed to give either Jones\u2019s counsel or the prosecutor a \u201cfull opportunity to explain their positions on the propriety of a mistrial.\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 515-516 (1978). In contrast to the trial judge in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>the judge in the present case cannot be said to have \u201cacted responsibly and deliberately,\u201d and to have \u201caccorded careful consideration to respondent\u2019s interest in having the trial concluded in a single proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516. The judge\u2019s remarks indicate that he viewed severance as an inappropriate alternative in any case involving codefendants. See note 16, <em>supra. </em>The judge\u2019s failure to explore the alternatives before declaring the mistrial for Jones precludes us from upholding his decision as an exercise of sound discretion. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 516. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>593 F.2d 415 (1st Cir. 1979) (cautionary instruction as alternative to mistrial); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>591 F.2d 1293 (9th Cir. 1979) (alternative methods of dispelling juror bias not explored); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>571 F.2d 934 (5th Cir. 1978) (no argument from counsel as to necessity for mistrial and no consideration of alternatives). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>McCambridge, </em>551 F.2d 865, 872 (1st Cir. 1977) (cautionary instruction given when code-fendant pleaded during trial).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We agree with the Commonwealth that \u201c[njeither party has a right to have his case decided by a jury which may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>tainted by bias.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Washington, supra </em>at 516. See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>155 U.S. 271 (1894); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>142 U.S. 148 (1881); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>130 Mass. 61, 62-63 (1881) (all concerning individual juror bias). Our conclusion that reprosecution is barred does not trample on the right to trial by an impartial jury, as suggested by the Commonwealth. That principle does not give the judge unlimited discretion to declare a mistrial over a defendant\u2019s objection. Rather, it invites a judge to consider a variety of factors in an effort to strike a proper balance between the conflicting interests. We think the judge erred by failing to consider the various alternatives to a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The Commonwealth claims that since the constant clashes between defense counsel and the bench infused extraneous issues into the case, reversal on appeal would be a certainty, and hence severance was not an appropriate remedy. See <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 469, 471 (1973).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s position overlooks the possibility of an acquittal.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s position also overlooks the many factors that must be considered before a mistrial is declared, such as the right to have a particular tribunal decide a person\u2019s fate once and for all, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the right of an accused to retain control over the proceedings in the event of error. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 93-94 (1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 609 (1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 486 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The Commonwealth also argues that a defendant who misbehaves should not be able to escape retrial if the judge thereby declares a mistrial. We agree. \u201c It would be a reproach to the administration of justice if a defendant through his counsel, could pollute the atmosphere of a trial and then turn this to his own advantage on appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>346 Mass. 373, 379 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 933 (1964). The short answer to this contention, however, is that the record does not reflect misconduct on the part of Jones\u2019s counsel sufficient to penalize Jones or to deprive him of his right against more than one prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Although the judge in the instant case purported to act pursuant to the mistrial motion made by Jones at the close of the first day of trial, the Commonwealth does not contend that Jones consented to the mistrial. Relying on <em>Lee </em>v. <em>United States, </em>432 U.S. 23 (1977), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gentile, </em>525 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 903 (1976),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the Commonwealth does, however, contend that by not requesting a hearing and a ruling on his written motion for a mistrial Jones contributed to the ultimate declaration of a mistrial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The oral motion was denied at the time it was made. Since the written motion set forth essentially the same grounds, albeit on an elaborated basis, Jones could well have concluded that the written motion had been denied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>There was no hearing on the written motion at the time it was filed, and the trial went forward as if the motion had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">At the time the mistrial ruling was announced the judge claimed to base his ruling on Jones\u2019s earlier written motion. Defense counsel asked to be heard and, at the earliest possible moment, counsel waived the written motion and made it clear that his client\u2019s position had changed. \u201cAn earlier request for a mistrial may, with the mere passage of time, be considered as having been improvidently made and fortunately denied.\u201d <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 A.2d 759, 769 (D.C. Ct. App. 1978). See <em>Gershon </em>v. <em>Sardonia, </em>50 Misc. 2d 423, 425 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1966) (\u201cDuring the course of a trial the picture constantly changes and a motion made and denied may eventually benefit the party who moved\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McCambridge, </em>551 F.2d 865, 872 (1st Cir. 1977) (\u201cconcerns which led counsel to file the motion[s] . . . [may be] dissipated in light of later events . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">A defendant is entitled to withdraw a motion for mistrial which is initially not granted and then later revived by the court. If a judge decides to rest the decision to declare a mistrial on a defendant\u2019s earlier motion, the judge must inquire whether the defendant wishes to maintain the motion. See Note, Jeopardy and Mistrials, 125 U. Pa. L. Rev. 449, 557 (1977). If the defendant makes it clear in answer to the judge\u2019s inquiry that he wishes to withdraw the earlier motion for a mistrial, the judge must then decide whether there is \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for a mistrial over the defendant\u2019s objection. If the motion for mistrial is withdrawn by the defendant, the judge may not rely on the earlier request for mistrial as permitting a mistrial by consent.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201c [WJhere the request for mistrial is not granted and the trial proceedings resume, the defendant is again entitled to resume con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>trol over the course of those proceedings, a control which would be meaningless if subject to defeasance through a purported grant of a request made prior to the resumption of control.\u201d <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 A.2d 759, 767 (D.C. Ct. App. 1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robson, </em>461 Pa. 615, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 934 (1975); <em>United States ex rel. Russo </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>483 F.2d 7 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1023 (1973); <em>Maes </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>180 Colo. 169 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Appellate deference will be accorded the trial judge\u2019s discretionary determination that \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d exists only if the record reflects that the trial judge gave reasoned consideration to the various available alternatives as well as to questions of fairness before declaring a mistrial. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 516-517 (1978).

Your Honor may not be aware of the situation, but your Honor says a lot of things which makes a lot of people smile a lot. Now, perhaps your Honor does not mean to be humorous, but some people take it to be. But your Honor should be aware that we do not take this lightly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The judge: \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m mistaken.

As reason therefor the defendant states the following: The defendant filed a written motion for examination of prospective jurors in accordance with G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. This statute provides that upon such motion the examination \u2018shall be conducted individually and outside the presence of other persons about to be called as jurors or already called.\u2019 The motion was denied. The defendant also requested that certain questions be asked of prospective jurors. The court, in the beginning, declined to do so, and exceptions were saved. Following the luncheon recess, and after certain jurors had been selected who could not then be challenged peremptorily, the court decided to read the questions of counsel to the entire venire. In doing so, it appeared to counsel, the court was making light of the questions. Of course, this manner would not be reflected in the record. The court also made open comments about certain grammar used in the questions which the defendant feels prejudiced him in the eyes of the prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">\u201cAdditionally, the remarks to counsel reflecting a belief that the matter was not being taken seriously prejudiced the defendant in the eyes of the prospective jurors. Such remarks came as counsel smiled; but the smiles were produced by other remarks of the court which were funny, though. not necessarily intended to be funny. Further, counsel was not the only person to smile at the remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">\u201cLastly, the defendant was prejudiced by remarks which indicated that counsel was not competent. The defendant does not contend that these remarks by the court were intentional; nor does the defendant contend that the court in any way desired to convey that counsel was not competent. The defendant does contend that the remarks being heard by prospective jurors who did not know counsel could have been interpreted to mean that counsel did not know what he was doing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\">\u201c[A]ny colloquy, words back and forth, between counsel and me, one or the other or both, or the district attorney, as the trial develops, certainly is nothing that you would consider or have affect you in any way as to the rights of these defendants. Certainly, you would not interpret anything that this Court might say in the course of this trial in any way as infringing on your powers, which are finally to decide the facts in this case. You have a right to resent any intrusion by this judge or any other judge in your function, which is to determine in the final analysis what happened, and what the connection if any there be, was between these two defendants and the alleged crimes that are named in the indictments.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\"> The judge: \u201cFirst time you\u2019ve spoken in two days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Counsel for defendant Jones: \u201cI have had no occasion to speak before, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">The judge: \u201cGo ahead. What do you want to say?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">Counsel for defendant Jones: \u201cI would simply say, your Honor, if [counsel for Rivera] pursues that line of questioning that he just intimated to the Court, I would renew, or ask to renew, my motion for severance, because it would definitely be prejudicial to \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">The judge: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll deny your motion to sever. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> Rivera\u2019s counsel was continually instructed to avoid repetitive questions, and to avoid repeating the witness\u2019s answers. The judge engaged in some direct questioning of witnesses and made comments disparaging counsel\u2019s skill. Moreover, at side bar the judge threatened to hold counsel in contempt, and in open court he said he would deal \u201csummarily\u201d with Rivera\u2019s counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\"> The defendant received the judge\u2019s permission to reopen if another witness became available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\"> The only exchange between the judge and Jones\u2019s counsel even mildly similar to the exchanges between the judge and Rivera\u2019s counsel occurred toward the end of Jones\u2019s direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Counsel for defendant Jones: \u201cNow, after you were arrested, Mr. Jones, did you say anything to the police?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">The defendant : \u201c No. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">Counsel for defendant Jones: \u201cWere you asked any questions by the police?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">The defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">Counsel for defendant Jones: \u201cDid you sign anything?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">The judge: \u201cAll three of those questions are all leading. I\u2019ll exclude them and the answers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-19\">Counsel for defendant Jones: \u201cI thought I was trying to be brief and that was the quickest way to do it, Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">The judge: \u201cIt\u2019s also advantageous, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-22\">Counsel for defendant Jones: \u201cOh, Judge. He \u2014 well, all right. All right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\"> Counsel for defendant Jones: \u201cBefore you make that final, Judge, let me say this.

I didn\u2019t get a chance to say not one thing about it. More importantly, Judge, the basis for a mistrial was based on what happened during the impanelling of the jury. You are allowing [counsel for Rivera\u2019s] motion that he just made, which is based on entirely different matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">The judge: \u201cI am allowing both motions which were filed at the outset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-20\">Counsel for defendant Jones: \u201cJudge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-21\">The judge: \u201cI note your exception, I can\u2019t do any more than that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-22\">Counsel for defendant Jones: \u201cJudge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-23\">The judge: \u201cYou want to talk to [Rivera\u2019s counsel] and you both want to go forward, that\u2019s all right with me.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\"> This was most clearly demonstrated by the judge\u2019s explanation of the mistrial to the jury, which we quote in full.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cNow ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I am reluctant and sorry to tell you that at the outset of this trial certain motions were filed by counsel, motions for mistrial, because of various exchanges, if you will, between counsel and me, and I took those motions under advisement, and as the trial progressed, I think that there have been issues introduced into this case that might hurt you or hinder you in the determination of the sole issue of this case, which is the guilt or innocence of these defendants. I take no small part of it myself for impatience, and perhaps interfering, but on the chance that you might have feelings one way or another, whether you dislike the Judge or dislike the lawyers or what have you, I\u2019m going to allow a mistrial. I don\u2019t think I am concerned [sic] there are issues in here that might disturb you, other than the main issue, which is, did the defendants commit these crimes. So there will be a mistrial and scheduling at another day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry and I know you are, but I think for <em>[sic] </em>the ends of justice would be much better served if perhaps a different court heard these matters.

I don\u2019t think anybody should have to go through that twice. I\u2019ll allow the motion to sever.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b632-16\"> The judge: \u201cMr. Davis, in the heat of the moment last night, I allowed a motion to sever. In view of these two dismissals today, the only other altercation where this man had a go-around on the ground by himself on admission, and by the allegations of the Commonwealth and someone else says Poochie was there, I\u2019m not going to sever those cases. There would be no point in it other than the convenience of counsel. I understand your emotion, and very heartfelt compassions, but I think in the interest of trying anything twice, it should be tried together, unless you want to separate them, . . . Do you agree with the motion?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-18\">The prosecutor: \u201cNo, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\"> The Appeals Court found that \u201c [t]he record does not show that the judge\u2019s actions were \u2018motivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass or prejudice\u2019 the defendant.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 383, 396 (1979), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 611 (1976). Neither the Commonwealth nor the defendant disagrees with the Appeals Court\u2019s conclusion that there was no judicial overreaching. On the view we take of Jones\u2019s claim we do not reach the issue of judicial overrreaching. The record reveals, however, that the judge was extremely impatient, even if we assume that counsels\u2019 behavior was irritating and their method of examining witnesses inept.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\"> Although Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion in <em>Jorn </em>was a plurality opinion of four Justices, we rely on it as one of the principal cases setting the parameters of the protection afforded by the double jeopardy clause. <em>Thames </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>365 Mass. 477, 479 n.3 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\"> The problems arising from considering the propriety of mistrial in a joint trial have not been addressed by the Supreme Court. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>506 F.2d 291, 295 (2d Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\"> In <em>Scott, </em>a mistrial as to all four defendants was held proper when the trial judge determined that counsel for three of the four had been improperly admitted pro hac vice. Despite an opportunity to do so, the defendant Scott had not requested a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> Aside from the area of jury prejudice, other cases decided since <em>Jorn </em>have similarly emphasized the importance of serious consideration of alternatives to a mistrial. See <em>Dunkerley </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>579 F.2d 141 (2d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1090 (1979) (mistrial improper where continuance was fair, practical, and feasible alternative); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>589 F.2d 1025 (10th Cir. 1978) (abuse of discretion where judge discharged jury out of the presence of defendant and prosecutor after a continuance of one and a half months); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKoy, </em>591 F.2d 218 (3d Cir. 1979) (duty of appellate court to see that alternatives to declaring a mistrial were completely canvassed so as to avoid double jeopardy bar); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>598 F.2d 132 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (defense counsel must be given effective opportunity to explore alternatives).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\"> The cases cited by the Commonwealth in support of its argument are neither persuasive nor controlling. The Commonwealth relies on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guglielmini, </em>384 F.2d 602 (2d Cir. 1967), and <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>15 Ill. 2d 344, cert. denied, 359 U.S. 1005 (1959). In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guglielmini, supra, </em>trial errors included not only statements by the judge serving to demean defense counsel and cast unfavorable light on the defense, but also admission of irrelevant, prejudicial evidence, improper argument by the prosecutor on the basis of that evidence, and possibly confusing instructions on reasonable doubt. The court based its holding on the cumulative effect of these errors. <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>does not use any of the analysis dictated by Supreme Court decisions since 1959. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>346 Mass. 373, 378-380 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 933 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\"> As we read the record, a second trial would enhance the possibility of Jones\u2019s conviction since he would not be able to make a tactical use of the Commonwealth\u2019s inability to keep its word to the jury as outlined in its opening. A second jury would not hear Miller\u2019s testimony or know that Miller failed to identify Jones as the person seen running from Dowling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\"> In <em>Lee, </em>defense counsel was keenly aware that the motion to dismiss (treated therein as the functional equivalent of a motion for a mistrial) was under advisement. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gentile, supra, </em>defense counsel had actively participated in a discussion of his codefendants\u2019 motion for a mistrial, then refused to join the motion. The trial judge found there was implied consent, and declared a mistrial as to both defendants. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the decision on the basis of <em>Gori </em>v. <em>United States, </em>367 U.S. 364 (1961) (mistrial proper where declared solely for the defendant\u2019s interests).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\"> Even if a defendant continues to press for a mistrial, if the motion is necessitated by prosecutorial or judicial overreaching, double jeopardy may still bar a second trial. See <em>United States v. Kessler, </em>530 F.2d 1246, 1255-1256 (5th Cir. 1976). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>589 F.2d 904, 905-906 (5th Cir.) cert. denied, 441 U.S. 950 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
