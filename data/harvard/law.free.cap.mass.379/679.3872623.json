(AmTote), on September 27, 1978. Datatrol Inc. (Datatrol), a disappointed bidder, commenced this action on October 13, 1978, in the Superior Court for Suffolk County. Datatrol sought, inter alia, a preliminary injunction forbidding the Lottery, the executive director, chairman, and members of the Lottery, and the State Purchasing Agent (Agent) from entering a contract with AmTote for the computer system. On October 18, 1978, the request for an injunction was denied. However, on November 13, 1978, the plaintiff was allowed to amend the complaint by adding a request for a determination that the award to AmTote did not comply with the requirements of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, and was therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">After trial on the merits, a judge of the Superior Court entered judgment on February 28, 1979, setting aside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>award to AmTote. On March 8, 1979, the judgment was ordered amended to enjoin the Lottery and the other defendants from performing a contract executed pursuant to the award. The Lottery\u2019s motion for a stay of judgment was denied, and an amended judgment was entered on March 19, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">On March 22, before the Lottery\u2019s appeal was docketed, AmTote moved in the Appeals Court to intervene as a party appellant and moved for a stay of the judgment. The Appeals Court single justice denied both motions on March 28. On April 26, after the Lottery\u2019s appeal was docketed, Am-Tote appealed the denial of the March 22 motion and renewed its motion to intervene. The single justice of the Appeals Court transferred the motion to the panel assigned to decide the appeal. AmTote\u2019s appeal was consolidated with the main appeal. We transferred the appeals here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Thus, the Lottery and AmTote appeal from the amended judgment of March 19. Furthermore, AmTote appeals from the denial of its motion to intervene, and AmTote\u2019s renewed motion to intervene is before us de nova. We grant AmTote\u2019s motion to intervene, and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">We state the relevant facts, as found by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">On May 19, 1978, the Lottery issued an Invitation to Bid and Request for Proposals (RFP) for a lottery computer system. This invitation described itself in the following terms. <em>\u201cPurpose of Bid Request. </em>The purpose of this bid request is to solicit technical and cost proposals for the procurement of equipment and support services necessary for the implementation and operation of an <em>On-Line Number Selection Lottery Processing System. </em>Such a system would be utilized for operating the Massachusetts Lottery\u2019s current Numbers Game, the soon to be implemented Lotto Game and other planned number selection Lottery games to be offered in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>future. Further, this on-line system is to be operated in parallel with the Lottery\u2019s currently installed Off-Line Number Selection Lottery Processing System . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In outline, the system was described as consisting of at least 300 to 500 on-line betting terminals to be installed at sales agent locations throughout the Commonwealth, and a telephone communications system linking the terminals to a central computer, to be installed at Lottery headquarters in Braintree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The system\u2019s principal function was to improve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>the efficiency of the daily numbers game.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The RFP sets out a description of the purposes of the system, the jobs it was supposed to do, and the support services to be furnished by the bidder. However, the RFP does not set out a description of many aspects of the system itself. Thomas Bryan O\u2019Heir, the deputy director of the Lottery for planning and development and the author of the RFP, characterized the RFP as a \u201cproblem oriented bid specification.\u201d It stated a general problem to be solved. The bidders were to supply the specifications of a system that would solve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>problem. The judge identified fourteen areas in which the specifications were left open, \u201c(a) The type of business arrangement desired by the Commission. . . . [T]he [RFP (at par. 14.11)] sets forth five types of business arrangements which are \u2018possible under this procurement\u2019: Facility Management Proposals; Turn-Key System Proposals; System Equipment Proposals; Specific Equipment Proposals; and Software/System Implementation Proposals. . . .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>\u201c(b) The delivery or completion date for the system</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">\u201c(c) The number of computer terminals per telephone circuit. This number is significant because the fewer telephones per circuit, the more circuits required and the greater is the communications cost of operation. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\u201c(d) The number of characters to be on the keyboard of the terminal. The number selected by the bidder could be from twenty to one hundred and twenty. The number of characters would be a factor in cost, ease of operation, maintenance required and operational capability.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">\u201c(e) The numbers of characters to be on the display panel.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq2\">\u201c(f) The ticket format and whether multi-bet or single-bet tickets should be used; if several bets could be entered on one ticket, this would obviously lower transaction time and the cost of ticket stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">\u201c(g) The maximum average transaction time for the system. The Invitation to Bid emphasizes the importance of this feature. It could vary widely depending on the equipment used. More expensive and more complex equipment could be used to achieve a lower transaction time, in the process increasing the cost of maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">\u201c(h) A maximum cost for the system proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">\u201c(i) The overall design of the software system required, \u201c(j) The specific complement of equipment required at the central computer location.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">\u201c(k) Whether it was desirable or undesirable that a supplier use subcontractors. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>\u201c(1) Whether an encryption system was desirable and the type of system to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u201c(m) The optical mark reader is a very recent advance in computer technology which permits the bettor to write the terms of his bet on a special card which the machine can read and transmit to lottery headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\u201c(n) The bidders were requested to specify in addition 63 additional characteristics of the terminal proposed \u2014 See par. 12.6 of the Invitation to Bid\u201d (footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The judge found that it was feasible for the Lottery to have filled in all of the foregoing open specifications, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The RFP stated that bidders\u2019 proposals would be evaluated according to eighteen criteria,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> subject to a proviso:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>\u201cFor purposes of bidding vendors may assume that equal weighting will be applied to all factors listed. The Lottery however reserves the right to assign any weight to whatever criteria it has listed in order to arrive at an award decision which best satisfies the requirements of this specification and the Lottery\u2019s long term best interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In keeping with this loosely constrained procedure, the RFP further stated: \u201cIt is to be understood that awards will be made to successful vendors based upon the criteria listed above. This may not result necessarily in an award to the lowest bidder although, clearly, where all other elements are equal, this will be the deciding factor.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The RFP required submission of proposals by Friday, June 30, 1978, at 2 p.m. Several companies, including Datatrol, met the 2 p.m. deadline. AmTote requested from the Agent and received a two-hour extension over the plaintiff\u2019s protest. AmTote filed its bid at 3:45 p.m. After June 30, O\u2019Heir submitted a letter to Dr. William E. Perrault, executive director of the Lottery, evaluating the bids and expressing a preference for AmTote. On July 3, the Agent disqualified AmTote. The Lottery rejected all bids and on August 23,1978, announced a rebid on the original RFP. Of six companies to submit bids by the September 8, 1978, deadline, O\u2019Heir chose three \u201cfinalists\u201d including AmTote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>and Datatrol.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In a written analysis of these bids, he recommended that AmTote\u2019s proposal be accepted. Perrault, the Agent, and the Lottery approved the award for AmTote and the award was made on September 27, 1978. During the course of the instant litigation, the Lottery and AmTote proceeded to negotiate a contract which they executed on February 16, 1979.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In his decision of February 28, 1979, the judge ruled that G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, the general procurement statute, applies to the award of a lottery computer system. He ruled that problem-oriented bidding \u201cis not absolutely prohibited by Mass, [sic] law but, . . . it is a bidding process which must undergo a \u2018most careful scrutiny\u2019 to determine whether its use in the circumstances of this award has thwarted the object of the competitive bidding statute to ensure genuine competition and avoid favoritism, and whether . . . the plans and specifications state the quantity and quality of the work with as much certainty and definiteness as may be practicable.\u201d The judge found that the extension for Am-Tote in the first round of bidding was an act of favoritism. He remarked that \u201c [w]ith the bids opened and analyzed, I am unable to see what legitimate purpose was served by the use of problem solving in the second round of bidding.\u201d Thus, the Lottery bore \u201ca heavy burden to dispel the taint of favoritism which now surrounded the letting of the contract,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and it was \u201cessential\u201d that the specifications be made definite in the second RFP. The judge further ruled the Lottery\u2019s failure to have definite specifications thwarted genuine and open competition. Despite the Lottery\u2019s good faith in choosing AmTote, \u201cthe bidding process was fatally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>flawed.\u201d Furthermore, the use of problem-oriented specifications prevented the Lottery from properly applying the preference for Massachusetts goods in G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22 (17). The judge concluded that the award to AmTote is void and should be set aside because it does not comply with G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22. On March 8, 1979, he found that on February 16, 1979, the Lottery and AmTote had executed a contract pursuant to the award, and he ruled that the contract should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The Lottery argues that G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, and the regulations in 802 Code Mass. Regs. 2.00 (1978), promulgated thereunder, do not apply to the procurement of a highly sophisticated electronic data processing system. The Lottery also claims that, even if the statute and regulations apply, the RFP met the requirements. The Lottery argues that the judge erroneously substituted his judgment for that of the Lottery and based his conclusions on findings and evi-dentiary rulings which were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">AmTote argues that it should be permitted to intervene, and that the RFP met all legal requirements. According to AmTote, the injunction forbidding the Lottery and AmTote from performing their contract was too broad; to the extent that the contract was for services, it was beyond the scope of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22. Finally, AmTote asserts that Datatrol lacks standing to attack the specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We first consider two preliminary issues: AmTote\u2019s motion to intervene in these proceedings and the question of Datatrol\u2019s standing to sue. When the single justice of the Appeals Court transferred the motion to intervene to a panel of the Appeals Court under Mass. R. Civ. P. 24 (a) (2) and 24 (b) (2), 365 Mass. 769-770 (1974), he transferred his jurisdiction to rule on that motion. See also Mass. R. Civ. P. 21, 365 Mass. 767 (1974). Our transfer of the appeals to this court brings the motion before us. We allow the motion under rule 24 (b) (2). As the recipient of the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>which was set aside below, AmTote has sufficient interest in the proceeding to justify its intervention. Common questions of law and fact abound, and there is no assertion that the intervention \u201cwill unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 24 (b) (2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">AmTote argues that Datatrol lacks standing to challenge the validity of the Lottery\u2019s bid specifications. According to AmTote, a would-be contractor has no standing to attack an award if his attack negates the awarding authority\u2019s right to award the contract to anyone; only if he has a possibility of being awarded the contract under the challenged procurement does he have standing. Furthermore, AmTote argues that Datatrol twice bid on the problem-oriented specifications without protesting; Datatrol cannot be heard to protest only after it has lost the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Assuming arguendo tjiat AmTote may attack Datatrol\u2019s standing at this juncture, we nevertheless find neither of AmTote\u2019s arguments persuasive. A bidder on a contract governed by G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, has standing to challenge the compliance of the awarding authority with the requirements of that section. Cf. <em>Interstate Eng\u2019r Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass. 751, 755-756 n.6 (1975); <em>Industrial Eng\u2019r &amp; Metal Fabricators, Inc. </em>v. <em>Poorvu Constr. Co., </em>354 Mass. 287, 290 (1968); <em>Quincy Ornamental Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Findlen, </em>353 Mass. 85, 87-88 (1967). But cf. <em>Sweezey </em>v. <em>Mayor of Malden, </em>273 Mass. 536 (1931) (statutorily authorized taxpayer suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">AmTote\u2019s estoppel argument is mistaken in principle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Lottery in this case is no private party unfairly induced to change its position in reliance on Datatrol\u2019s silence. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>substantial change of position has occurred. In addition, the Lottery as a public agency has a duty to award contracts in accord with law. The purposes of competitive bidding go beyond economy and efficient administration to the prevention of favoritism in the awarding of government contracts. See, e.g., <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>253 Mass. 247, 252 (1925). Erecting a technical theory of estoppel as a bar to suits by disappointed bidders will not further that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The central question before us is the applicability of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, to the award of a contract for a lottery computer system.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the statute applies, we must decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>whether the Lottery\u2019s problem-oriented specifications satisfy the statute. The Lottery argues that the contract in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>volves sophisticated electronic equipment in a rapidly changing industry and that the Legislature, which enacted the statute in 1922, could not have contemplated such a contract. The Lottery\u2019s argument continues that a reading of the statute as a whole, and of the regulations, 802 Code Mass. Regs. 2.00 (1978), reveals that the statute deals with personal property that can be standardized. Furthermore, in G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27B, inserted by St. 1973, c. 1230, \u00a7 6, the Legislature specifically provided for \u201crules and regulations governing the lease or purchase of data processing . . . equipment or systems.\u201d Although G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27B, does not apply to the State Treasurer\u2019s department and the Lottery, the Lottery claims that the statute reflects a legislative belief that G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, does not pertain to purchases of data processing equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">AmTote argues that G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, does not apply to contracts for services. It claims the contract actually executed by AmTote and the Lottery provides exclusively for operational services, not for purchase of tangible property. Therefore, AmTote concludes that the judge could only enjoin the Lottery from entering a contract for the purchase of equipment; the injunction that actually issued was over-broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">We reject both defendants\u2019 arguments. General Laws c. 7, \u00a7 22, authorizes the Commissioner of Administration to \u201cmake rules, regulations and orders which shall regulate and govern the manner and method of the purchasing, delivering and handling of, and the contracting for, supplies, equipment and other property.\u201d Section 22 (1) states that the regulations shall provide for \u201c [t]he advertisement for and the receipt of bids for supplies and other property and the stimulation of competition with regard thereto.\u201d The regulation, 802 Code Mass. Regs 2.00 (6) (1978), states: \u201cNo supplies; material or other property shall be purchased or contracted for without competition . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>The statute uses a panoply of terms that refer to tangible personal property: \u201csupplies,\u201d \u201cequipment,\u201d \u201ccommodities,\u201d \u201cmaterials,\u201d \u201carticles.\u201d It also includes the catch-all, \u201cother property.\u201d This language is evidence of legislative intent to sweep broadly and encompass property not known in 1922. Cf. Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 150-151 (1975) (microfilm copies of public records are \u201cother property\u201d). See also Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 135-136 (1963). Although the Lottery is correct to identify standardization of purchasing practices and equipment as a goal of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, the statute\u2019s broader purposes reach beyond regulating procurements of common fungible goods.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The legislative history of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, supports this reading. The statute was drafted in 1922 by a Commission on State Administration and Expenditures, and the language relevant to this case appeared in the earliest draft. The commission recommended, \u201c [t]hat a central purchasing agency be established to take responsibility for <em>all State purchasing, </em>to standardize departmental requirements, and to make blanket purchases where practicable\u201d (emphasis supplied). Report on State Administration and Expenditures submitted to the General Court by the Commission on State Administration and Expenditures, 1922 House Doc. No. 800 at 12. The commission did not link the coverage of the statute to the desirability of making blanket purchases of fungible goods. There is no indication that the commission contemplated any limit on coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The Lottery\u2019s argument based on G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27B, is also incorrect. The Lottery argues that G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27B, is evidence of a legislative belief that all procurements of data processing systems, including those to which G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27B, does not apply, fall outside the ambit of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22. In G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27B, we find a legislative pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>pose to establish competitive procedures for procurement of some data processing systems. See 801 Code Mass. Regs. 5.00 (1978). It does not follow that departments exempt from those specific procedures may procure systems without competition. When the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27B, it was presumptively aware of the general procurements statute, G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22. See <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>372 Mass. 46, 51 (1977). However, even if we were to assume that recent legislation might be useful in interpreting a much earlier enactment, nothing in the language or legislative history of G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27B, supports the Lottery\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">AmTote\u2019s argument that the injunction issued below is overbroad because G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, does not apply to service contracts is faulty in two respects. First, it implies that the applicability of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, is to be determined by the character of the contract executed after competitive bidding. In fact, the character of the RFP determines the applicability of the statute. If the statute applies and has been violated, the contract awarded is void. <em>Grande &amp; Son </em>v. <em>School Hous. Comm. of N. Reading, </em>334 Mass. 252, 259 (1956). <em>Sweezey </em>v. <em>Mayor of Malden, </em>273 Mass. 536, 542 (1931). If it appears from the RFP that the contract eventually executed might be covered by the statute, the statutory requirements control. Here the possibility that the contract could involve purchases of equipment makes G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, applicable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Second, the contract executed here is not exempt from G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22. The statute applies not only to purchases, but also to \u201cthe contracting for . . . equipment.\u201d We believe that a contract for equipment includes a lease. Otherwise, the departments could use long-term leases to evade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the competitive bidding requirement. Furthermore, although the contract provides for operating and maintenance services, those services are incidental to the procurement of equipment and software. The Lottery has never treated those services separately from the equipment. We do not believe they should be severed now.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Also, under the contract, the Lottery can choose eventually to purchase the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Having determined that G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, applies, we must decide whether the statute permits problem-oriented bid specifications. \u25a0 The purpose of competitive bidding statutes is \u201cto establish genuine and open competition after due public advertisement in the letting of contracts for . . . [public] work, to prevent favoritism in awarding such contracts and to secure honest methods of letting contracts in the public interests.\u201d <em>Morse </em>v. Boston, 253 Mass. 247, 252 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>(1925). Accord, <em>Pacella </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>339 Mass. 338, 342 (1959); <em>Sweezey </em>v. <em>Mayor of Malden, supra </em>at 540; <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Municipal Council of Taunton, </em>275 Mass. 535, 542 (1931). \u201cThe . . . specifications must state the quantity and quality of the work required with as much certainty and definiteness as may be practicable. Every bidder must be able to know what materials are to be furnished and what work is to be performed in order to comply with the contract.\u201d <em>Sweezey, supra. </em>In <em>Sweezey, </em>the city of Malden sought bids on a contract for furnishing and laying pavement on a street. The specifications stated the thickness of the layer of pavement, but not the composition or manner of laying the wearing surface. The court sustained an attack on these open specifications: \u201cTo permit each bidder to furnish his own specifications for the construction of the wearing surface might, and probably would, allow a substantial variance in the manner of construction and its cost. Such a method of bidding would not result in bids being submitted on any common basis. Where, as here, each bidder is invited to bid upon his own specifications, it is plain that there can be no real competition between such bidders. Such an advertisement not only destroys competition, but gives city officials an opportunity to exercise favoritism in awarding contracts. A compliance with the ordinances makes it mandatory that prospective bidders shall stand upon an equal footing and that no one shall be permitted to submit his bid upon a basis different from that of any other bidder. To allow a bidder to furnish his own specifications for any material part of the contract in question would destroy genuine and fair competition and be subversive of the public interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542. <em>See Burt </em>v. <em>Municipal Council of Taunton, </em>275 Mass. 535, 543 (1931) (alternative ground of decision). See generally 10 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7\u00a7 29.52, 29.53, 29.56 (3d ed. 1966). The <em>Sweezey </em>rationale is entirely applicable to the Lottery\u2019s problem-oriented specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The Lottery and AmTote, however, argue that G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, differs from the ordinance in <em>Sweezey. </em>AmTote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>claims G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, does not require specifications at all. Furthermore, the statute does not mandate that contracts be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, and AmTote contends that the requirement of definite specifications should apply only to statutes including a low bidder requirement. Finally, AmTote argues that the prohibition of open parameter bidding has undesirable practical and legal consequences and that public procurements are peculiarly unsuited to \u201cjudicial legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The defendants are correct that G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, does not expressly require the departments to use detailed specifications and does not contain a low bidder requirement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The regulations do, however, require a statement of the \u201cquantity and quality of the item . . . to be furnished.\u201d 802 Code Mass. Regs. 2.00 (4) (1978). This statement must inform the bidders of the character of the contract to be awarded, so that their bids conform to the needs of the department. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>The statement must also be specific in order to ensure that the department can evaluate all of the bidders on a common footing. Cf. <em>Detroit </em>v. <em>Hosmer, </em>79 Mich. 384, 388 (1890). The description need not label the item by a specific brand nor define it so rigidly that only one thing can comply. See 802 Code Mass. Regs. 2.00 (6) (1978). A determination that increased specificity is feasible is not necessarily fatal to the specification. However, the item to be purchased should be described with enough precision to permit fair comparison among the several bids. This is the principle stated in <em>Sweezey, supra </em>at 540: \u201cThe . . . specifications must state the quantity and quality of the [items] required with as much certainty and definiteness as may be practicable.\u201d Contrary to AmTote\u2019s assertion, the requirement of a common footing is not dependent upon a statutory low bidder requirement. Thus, in construing a statute that did not expressly require competitive bidding, detailed specifications, or award to the lowest bidder, we nevertheless held: \u201cThe statute here in question required open competitive bidding upon a common footing after a proper advertisement. It insures full publicity as to the contract and conduces toward the guarding of the public welfare.\u201d <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Middlesex, </em>274 Mass. 437, 439 (1931).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Archambault </em>v. <em>Mayor of Lowell, </em>278 Mass. 327, 332-333 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>AmTote argues that the rationale of the common footing requirement is to make possible a mathematically precise comparison based on price. When the awarding authority can consider factors other than price, it should be permitted to state its evaluation criteria and its needs and to request competition on all of the criteria. This argument, however, diverts attention from the true problem: as the evaluation criteria multiply and the specifications become more vague, the comparison between the bids becomes progressively harder and less meaningful. The point of the common footing requirement is not to ensure such definite specifications that all bidders are bidding on exactly the same thing. The requirement is designed to ensure meaningful, manageable comparison. As Datatrol correctly points out, the need for definiteness may even increase when criteria other than price come into play and awards based on favoritism become harder to detect.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">AmTote and the Lottery argue that, should we take the view we express, our decision would amount to judicial legislation. AmTote states that the \u201cdelay and uncertainty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>inherent in regulation by litigation is destructive of the procurement process.\u201d Furthermore, AmTote asserts several reasons for sanctioning problem-oriented specifications. The technique permits the Lottery to learn from industry experts the best design for a lottery computer system. The technique also tests the expertise, of the bidders. By leaving specifications open, the Lottery can shift to the vendor certain legal obligations connected with performance of the contract. Finally, if the Lottery filled in the specifications that were left open, only AmTote could comply; thus, the award would fail under the rule of <em>Waszen </em>v. <em>Atlantic City, </em>1 N.J. 272, 283 (1949), in which the court invalidated an award made on the basis of overly restrictive specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The defendants are correct that judicial legislation is inappropriate in public procurements law. However, interpreting a statute in accord with its purpose is not to legislate, but merely to serve the Legislature. The purpose of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, is to encourage efficient purchasing and to discourage awards based on favoritism. The Legislature may have given up some of the advantages of a more flexible purchasing policy in order to foster honesty and accountability in government.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But the Legislature has chosen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>and we will not displace or tamper with that choice. Am-Tote\u2019s last argument, concerning overly restrictive specifications, raises a question not before us today. We do not decide it. Cf. <em>Pacella </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>339 Mass. 338, 346 (1959) (G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 8A).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In the view we take, the defendants\u2019 arguments that the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous need not be considered. Our decision rests instead on our view of the statute and the undisputed nature of the request for proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The judgment, as amended, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\"> The system was described in somewhat greater detail in REP par. 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">\u201c4.1 Approximately 300 to 500 on-line betting terminals to be installed at sales agent locations with the possibility of expansion up to 750 or 1,000 terminals or conceivably more, depending upon cost of the terminals, reliability of operation and effect on total revenue experienced from the installation of the initial quantity of terminals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">\u201c4.2 Communications facilities necessary to on-line connect these sales agent betting terminals to control computers to be installed at the Massachusetts Lottery\u2019s Headquarters facility located in Braintree, Massachusetts.

Instead, betting slips must be picked up physically from each sales agent location and carried by courier to the Lottery\u2019s headquarters in Braintree for processing.

E.g., <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>251 Mass. 468, 471 (1925).\u201d AmTote further contends that the organic statute governing lottery operations supports the distinction between a contract for equipment and a contract for services. General Laws c. 10, \u00a7 25 <em>(b), </em>discusses \u201ccosts incurred in the operation and administration of the lottery.\u201d Section 25 <em>(b) </em>lists both contracts for \u201coperational services\u201d and those \u201cfor the purchase or lease of lottery equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">AmTote\u2019s first argument states a version of a widely recognized exception from competitive bidding requirements. The award of a contract for personal services, especially those of an expert consultant, need not comply with competitive bidding rules. See generally, Annot., 15 A.L.R.3d 733 (1967). We do not take issue with AmTote\u2019s distinction between contracts for services and contracts for equipment. In fact, had the Lottery wanted to hire a consultant for help in designing the on-line system, competitive bidding on that contract would not have been necessary. The error in AmTote\u2019s formulation is that contracts for services can be incident to procurements subject to competitive bidding, and the two can be so intertwined that competitive bidding is necessary on the whole \u201cpackage.\u201d That was the situation here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b716-6\"> We need not decide whether the statute impliedly contains a low bidder requirement. However, \u201c[i]n the absence of the not unusual provision requiring contracts to be awarded' to the lowest responsible bidder such a requirement is not to be implied, but it is to be inferred that the awarding of contracts is left to the reasonable judgment of the municipal officers charged with responsibility therefor.\u201d <em>Archambault </em>v. <em>Mayor of Lowell, </em>278 Mass. 327, 332 (1932).

However, a later passage in the manual states that the award will be made to the lowest and \u201cbest bid, considering price, quality of article to be supplied, and satisfactory to requirements of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. We need not consider the meaning of this language nor whether the Agent can inject a low bidder requirement that is not explicit in the statute. Similarly, in its RFP, the Lottery stated that it would award the contract to the lowest bidder \u201cwhere all other elements are equal.\u201d We need not decide whether the Lottery could commit itself in the RFP to award a contract to the lowest bidder and then refuse to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b717-5\"> Statutes governing the award of contracts in this Commonwealth are so various as to provide scant guidance in the construction of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22. For example, some statutes speak of \u201ccompetition,\u201d \u201ccompetitive bidding\u201d or \u201ccompetitive bids\u201d and expressly require both detailed specifications and award to the low bidder. E.g., G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M; G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A, 44C. Cf. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7A (if school bus contract is not awarded to lowest bidder, written justification necessary). A second class of statutes, including G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, refers to \u201ccompetition\u201d but does not expressly require either detailed specifications or award to the low bidder. A third class of statutes expressly requires public advertisement for proposals and public opening of bids submitted, but little more. E.g., G. L. c. 34, \u00a7 17; G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 4B; G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 56D. But cf. G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 8A (\u201ccompetitive bidding\u201d in title of section, but omitted from body). <em>Larkin, supra, </em>construed G. L. c. 34, \u00a7 17, a statute in the latter category.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\"> AmTote attempts to use <em>Devir </em>v. <em>Mayor of Malden, </em>277 Mass. 502 (1931), to attack the principle set out in <em>Sweezey. </em>In <em>Devir, </em>which involved the same ordinance as <em>Sweezey, </em>the court considered a contract for surfacing four streets. Bidders could bid on either or both of two types of paving surface, and the city could award a contract for any one or more of the streets to any bidder. We approved the specifications. AmTote argues that we have therefore approved open parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\"><em>Devir, </em>however, involved a request for bids on a per yard basis. A bidder could supply a per yard bid for each of the two wearing surfaces. Bidders knew the minimum and maximum number of yards for which a contract could be awarded. The court decided that the requirement of bidding by the square yard was not inherently obnoxious to the competitive bidding ordinance: \u201cTo effect such a result it must further appear either that the unit basis was subject to change at the will of an official board <em>... or that the unit was not sufficiently definite to furnish a common basis for submission of bids\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 507. <em>Devir </em>stands for the proposition that an awarding authority can solicit bids on alternative specifications or on a job whose scope is bracketed within well-defined limits. <em>Devir </em>implies neither that entirely open specifications are permissible nor that an awarding authority may invite bidders to supply their own specifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\"> It is not clear that the Lottery had to sacrifice either of the first two advantages that the defendants point out. Before formulating its RFP, the Lottery could have contracted for consultants\u2019 services to help determine the best design of an on-line system. Furthermore, by testing the qualifications of would-be bidders before permitting them to bid on the contract, the Lottery could have gouged their expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">AmTote\u2019s argument that problem-oriented bidding confers certain legal advantages on the awarding authority is based in part on <em>Alpert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>357 Mass. 306 (1970). A contractor on a highway and bridge contract received a substantial equitable adjustment when difficulties with subsurface material proved more extensive than the awarding authority\u2019s specifications had represented. We said: \u201cIf the D.P.W. had actually intended to leave the determination of the amount of unsuitable material open to the independent investigation of [the contractor], it could easily have omitted the specification from the preliminary quantity sheets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321. AmTote states: \u201cIt is ironic that the Lottery, having accepted the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s suggestion, has been held by the Superior Court Department to have acted illegally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">AmTote\u2019s argument ignores a critical distinction between the facts to be specified in <em>Alpert </em>and those in the present case. In <em>Alpert, </em>the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>ment of Public Works attempted to describe a condition in nature. The scope of the condition was difficult to ascertain, and the agency\u2019s description was in error. Indeed, description to that level of detail may not have been practicable. The facts to be specified by the Lottery did not involve ascertaining the scope of a natural condition. They involved intellectual decisions about the best design of a computer system. Detailed description was practicable because it depended solely on the Lottery\u2019s choices.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
