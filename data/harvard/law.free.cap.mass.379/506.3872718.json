Sandler. The defendants, beneficiaries under the trust, are the settlor\u2019s husband, named both in his individual capacity and as executor of the settlor\u2019s will, and their two minor children. A guardian ad litem was appointed to represent the interests of the minor children and those persons not yet in being who may become interested in the trust. Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974), a judge of the Probate and Family Court Department of the Trial Court reserved and reported the case without decision to the Appeals Court. All parties thereupon filed a joint application for direct appellate review, which we allowed in accordance with G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10 (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">All parties are in agreement as to the facts. On July 9, 1968, Ellen B. Sandler, as donor, executed an agreement of trust naming Merrill C. Berman and herself as trustees. The trust, known as the Ellen B. Sandler Trust, was revocable and at the donor\u2019s death divided into a marital deduction trust and a non-marital deduction trust, known as Trust A and Trust B respectively. The marital deduction trust, the only one in question here, was set out in section 1 of article Third of the trust agreement. It was determined by a fractional share formula and contained the usual provisions necessary not only for its administration but also for its qualification as a marital deduction under I.R.C. \u00a7 2056 (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first paragraph of section 1 provided for a smaller marital deduction to equalize the estates of the donor and her husband should the husband mot survive his wife by six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>On June 29,1972, an attorney for Mrs. Sandler<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> proposed an amendment to the trust, the purpose of which was to excise from the trust the so called equalization language which the attorney feared might jeopardize qualification for the marital deduction. A paragraph was to be substituted identical to the first paragraph of section 1 of article Third of the original trust agreement except for the substitution of a presumption of the husband\u2019s survival in place of the equalization language. However, the scrivener omitted the words \u201cthe first paragraph of\u201d from the clause detailing the language to be deleted. Thus, instead of deleting merely the first paragraph of the first section of article Third, the amendment excised the entire first section. In effect, the paragraphs specifying the essential elements of the marital deduction trust were replaced by one paragraph calling for the creation and funding of such a trust. The amendment was signed by Mrs. Sandler on October 1, 1972, and was accepted by the trustees. No one noticed the scrivener\u2019s omission until after Mrs. Sandler\u2019s death on August 4, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The trustees, joined by the guardian ad litem,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seek reformation of the amendment so that they may proceed with the funding of the trusts<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and with the filing of necessary tax returns. Although the availability of the marital deduction is \u201ca matter to be decided under Federal tax law,\u201d any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>modification of the trust agreement to conform with the settlor\u2019s intent with respect to the marital deduction is \u201cclearly a matter of State law\u201d which this court may properly decide. See <em>Babson </em>v. <em>Babson, </em>374 Mass. 96, 101-102 (1977), quoting from <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>363 Mass. 625, 633 (1973). It is appropriate for us to render a decision in this case despite the parties\u2019 agreement that the amendment contained an inadvertent scrivener\u2019s mistake, cf. <em>Pastan </em>v. <em>Pastan, </em>378 Mass. 148, 149 (1979); <em>Babson </em>v. <em>Babson, supra </em>at 101-103 (1977), because only an interpretive decision by the highest State court will dispose of contrary interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bosch, </em>387 U.S. 456, 465 (1967). We conclude on the basis of the discussion below that the amendment should be reformed so as to delete only the first paragraph of the first section of article Third and to retain the remainder of section 1 as found in the 1968 trust instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">It is settled that a written instrument, including a trust, will be reformed on grounds of mistake upon \u201cfull, clear, and decisive proof\u201d of the mistake. See <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>235 Mass. 220, 224 (1920), quoting from <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>171 Mass. 447, 449 (1898); 4 A. Scott, Trusts \u00a7 333.4 (3d ed. 1967); 13 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 1548, 1585 (3d ed. 1970); Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 333, Comment e (1959). Cf. <em>Franz </em>v. <em>Franz, </em>308 Mass. 262, 265-267 (1941) (deed). The doctrine of reformation for mistake with regard to trusts differs from that with respect to instruments such as contracts, however, in one important respect. In contract law, reformation will not be granted unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>parties\u2019 mistake is mutual. <em>Eno </em>v. <em>Prime Mfg. Co., </em>317 Mass. 646, 650 (1945). <em>Corbett </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>196 Mass. 319, 321 (1907), appeal dismissed sub nom. <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>215 U.S. 125 (1909). However, mutuality of mistake is not always required where trusts are concerned. Since a settlor usually receives no consideration for the creation of a trust, a unilateral mistake on the part of the settlor is ordinarily sufficient to warrant reformation. 4 A. Scott, Trusts \u00a7 333.4 (3d ed. 1967). Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 333, Comment e (1959). Included in the category of unilateral mistakes for which relief may be obtained is a settlor\u2019s acceptance of a trust instrument which, because of the mistake or inadvertence of the scrivener, fails to embody the settlor\u2019s intentions. Cf. <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Mudge, </em>13 F. 260, 261-262 (D. Mass. 1882); <em>Franz </em>v. <em>Franz, supra </em>at 266-267; <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Loring, supra </em>at 225; G. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 991 (2d ed. 1962); 13 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 1549A (3d ed. 1970). The additional fact that the settlor in the case at bar has died should not foreclose relief, <em>Roos </em>v. <em>Roos, </em>42 Del. Ch. 40, 44-45 (1964), and cases cited therein; W. Kerr, Fraud and Mistake 566 (7th ed. 1952); Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 333 (1959), so long as the evidence of mistake meets the requisite standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In light of the foregoing principles, we now examine both the settlor\u2019s intent with regard to the trust amendment and the proffered evidence of mistake. To ascertain the settlor\u2019s intent, we look to the trust and its amendment as a whole and in particular focus on the circumstances known to the settlor upon execution of the amendment. See <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>366 Mass. 261, 266-267 (1974). Consideration of the latter extrinsic evidence is proper where, as here, an amendment renders a trust ambiguous. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The present amendment, like the original trust, provides for the creation of a separate trust for the settlor\u2019s husband to be funded with \u201c that fractional share of the trust property which ... is needed to obtain the maximum marital deduction allowable in determining the federal estate tax on the donor\u2019s estate.\u201d This language standing alone demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>strates that the settlor intended that her estate avail itself of the maximum permissible marital deduction in computing the Federal estate tax. See <em>id. </em>at 267. However, the amendment as drafted created doubts about the trust\u2019s qualifications for the marital deduction. If read literally, the amendment would replace the operative provisions of the marital deduction trust, without which the deduction would fail to qualify, with one paragraph specifying only the amount to be set aside for such a trust. Such a literal construction would not give effect to the settlor\u2019s expressed intent to qualify the trust for the marital deduction. See <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>350 Mass. 568, 571 (1966). Also militating against a literal construction of the amendment is the rationale given by Mrs. Sandler\u2019s attorney for proposing the amendment, namely that such a change would eradicate any doubts concerning the trust\u2019s qualification for the deduction. The overwhelming weight of the evidence, as established by the allegations of the complaint, the admissions in the defendant\u2019s answer, the letter of the attorney who drafted the trust amendment, and the face of the amendment itself, clearly and decisively points to a scrivener\u2019s error as the source of the mistake. Thus, we conclude that the settlor executed the 1972 trust amendment solely with the intention of conforming the trust provisions to the requirements of the Federal estate tax marital deduction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that she did not intend thereby to eliminate the trust\u2019s operative provisions, and that the trust amendment should be reformed to reflect this intent. Accordingly, judgment shall enter in the court below reforming the trust amendment so as to delete only the first paragraph of the first section of article Third and to retain the remainder of section 1 as it appears in the original trust agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-9\"> Two key elements of a qualifying marital deduction trust include the right of the surviving spouse to receive all the net income for life and a general testamentary power of appointment in the surviving spouse over the principal of the trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\"> The attorney who proposed the trust amendment is not involved in the present suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\"> We are not faced with a potential conflict between the trustees and the guardian ad litem. The guardian ad litem agrees that the requested reformation is in the best interests of the settlor\u2019s minor children and her unborn and unascertained issue, who are the discretionary beneficiaries of Trust B, the nonmarital deduction trust. Assuming an adjusted gross estate of $1,500,000, Trust B could be reduced by Federal estate taxes of approximately $454,500 if the marital deduction were not available. If the deduction were available, however, Federal estate taxes would reduce Trust B only by approximately $191,000. Consequently, the reformation could save Trust B, the issue\u2019s trust, about $263,500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\"> The original trust was nominally funded with $10. Under the donor\u2019s will, dated July 9, 1968, her probate assets other than real estate and tangibles \u201cpoured over\u201d into the two trusts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\"> We note that there is no indication in the record that the Internal Revenue Service received notification of this action. We express no opinion on the significance of this omission but observe that the Internal Revenue Service has usually chosen not to participate in such actions. See <em>Pastan </em>v. <em>Pastan </em>378 Mass, at 149; <em>Babson </em>v. <em>Babson, </em>374 Mass, at 102-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We assume that if the Appeals Court of this Commonwealth decided a matter and this court thereafter denied a petition for further appellate review, the Federal authorities would accept that process as a sufficient expression of views by the highest State court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\"> The fact that we are influenced in our interpretation of the amendment by \u201ca consideration of the [settlor\u2019s] tax intentions\u201d is in no way im- . proper.
