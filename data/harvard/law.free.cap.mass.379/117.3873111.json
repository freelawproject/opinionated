We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Borans argues numerous assignments of error on appeal. Specifically, Borans claims that the judge erred in (1) refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal of the charges against him; (2) admitting as evidence conversations held in the absence of the defendant; (3) denying the defendant\u2019s motion to sever; (4) refusing to permit the defendant to cross-examine witnesses concerning their knowledge of the maximum penalties for certain crimes; and (5) refusing to require the assistant district attorney to furnish defendant with notes of interviews with Commonwealth witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s theory is that, from the outset of Mayor William Reinstein\u2019s administration, there existed two schemes to compel contractors and vendors to make campaign contributions in exchange for public contracts. The first scheme sought a twenty-five thousand dollar kickback from Simon Sharigian, President of Si Associates, the contractor who was selected by the mayor to provide the specifications for the various categories of furnishings and interior equipment for the high school. The second scheme required Sharigian to solicit those contractors (vendors)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> interested in bidding for contracts to provide individual cate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>gories or items of furnishings and equipment. Sharigian was to determine whether \u2014 and how much \u2014 these individual contractors would be willing to pay as a kickback to city officials in return for being awarded contracts with the city of Revere.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Those involved developed well concealed schemes for bribery and kickbacks under the guise of legitimate transactions. The participants also sought to camouflage the kickbacks in a variety of ways, including false and backdated invoices and correspondence, as well as requests for the purchase of tickets for political fund raising dinners and by giving false testimony before the grand jury. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence discloses a shocking betrayal of the public trust. According to the evidence, Borans misused the power of his office to induce political contributions to the mayor. Borans also actively participated in two schemes to siphon funds from the Revere public treasury for the private gain of public officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The following is a capsulized version of the evidence against Borans viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In January of 1972, William Reinstein took office as the mayor of Revere. Reinstein immediately appointed Borans, who had managed Reinstein\u2019s campaign, to the position of purchasing agent for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\n<em>The Twenty-Five Thousand Dollar Payment by Sharigian</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">At the time Reinstein and Borans took office, the new Revere high school was in the early stages of construction. Harold M. Turiello, the architect who had designed the structural aspects of the school, had been authorized by the previous mayor of Revere to begin the internal nonstructural specification work for the furnishings and equipment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Turiello began work, and in January and July of 1972, Turiello sent bills to the city for consultation work and for the preparation of preliminary studies. These bills were paid by the city after Turiello\u2019s contract was examined by the city solicitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In late February, 1972, Turiello met with Reinstein at the construction site. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Reinstein told Turiello, \u201cI want to speak very frankly with you. I want yo\u00fc to join my team. We could work in harmony together. . . . There are tickets to be bought, functions to be held, activities that we can become involved with. . . . You can see that you can make me very happy.\u201d Turiello did not respond to these overtures or to overtures made by Reinstein in the spring.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Finally, in mid-July, Reinstein approached Turiello at the construction site. Reinstein said to Turiello, \u201cSay, there, Harold, I am goddam fed up with you. You\u2019re a cheap s.o.b. You\u2019re dancing me around.\u201d Reinstein also told Turiello that he (Turiello) \u201cshould have been a priest.\u201d Reinstein then turned and walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">On September 12, 1972, Turiello was summoned to Mayor Reinstein\u2019s office. When he arrived, Turiello found Borans seated in the office with the mayor. Borans opened the conversation by telling Turiello to remain calm and not to \u201cbecome emotional.\u201d Reinstein then told Turiello that \u201cI have decided to dispense with your services on the furnishings and equipment phase.\u201d Reinstein refused to give Turi-ello a reason for his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>During the late spring of 1972, a partner in an office equipment supply business located in Worcester was asked whether his firm would be interested in doing the interior specifications work. Shortly thereafter, the partner met with Borans in Borans\u2019 office at the Revere city hall. The two men spent approximately twenty minutes discussing the details of the Revere high school work, and the partner left to prepare the proposal to be made by his firm. The Worcester firm\u2019s bid for the interior specifications work, totalling $84,000, was mailed to Borans on October 13, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Approximately two weeks later, a meeting was arranged with Reinstein and Borans, the Worcester contractor and others. Reinstein first asked about the firm\u2019s qualifications and experience. Then Reinstein said, \u201cYou understand that if you get this job there would have to be a ten thousand dollar contribution in cash?\u201d The contractor responded that \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019d come up with ten thousand dollars.\u201d The mayor then \u201cmentioned something about a tax affair.\u201d The contractor told Reinstein that he would \u201chave to go back and talk to [his] partner.\u201d Borans said nothing during the meeting. The Worcester firm had no more contacts with Revere officials, and was not awarded the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In early November, 1972, Simon Sharigian received two telephone calls from one Frank Bowden.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At this time, Sharigian was in the process of forming a firm, Si Associates, to do interior design, furnishings and purchasing for commercial interiors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Bowden first told Sharigian that there was a contract available for the furnishings and equipment specification work for the new Revere high school. Next, Bowden told Sharigian that Sharigian \u201chad the inside track on the contract that was available and it involved a sizeable amount of money.\u201d However, Bowden told Sharigian that some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>work had already been done, and, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get involved with quite a bit of money thrown back on this particular contract.\u201d When Sharigian expressed interest in the plan, Bowden said that Sharigian would be receiving a call from a Robert Tobin.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Shortly thereafter, Sharigian received a call from Tobin, a Suffolk County deputy sheriff, who arranged a meeting to be held in the sheriff\u2019s office at the Suffolk County court house. At the meeting, Tobin handed Sharigian a copy of the $84,000 bid proposal submitted by the Worcester firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Tobin then asked Sharigian how much money Sharigian would need to do the same job. Tobin said, \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a document here for eighty-four thousand dollars. This is what we are talking about. How much can we realize back on this end? How much do you think you can do the job for? What do you think you can get back for us on this in terms of money?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Sharigian asked Tobin how much the Worcester firm had offered. Tobin responded, \u201cHe only would throw back ten thousand dollars. He is out of the picture.\u201d Sharigian then offered to \u201cthrow back forty thousand, maybe half.\u201d Tobin agreed, but insisted that all or \u201ca good portion of this forty thousand has to be in cash.\u201d Tobin then told Sharigian to prepare a proposal for the job under Sharigian\u2019s firm\u2019s name and to address the proposal to Borans.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The following day, Friday, November 24, 1972, Shari-gian prepared a proposal in the name of Si Associates. He then took the papers to Tobin\u2019s office. Tobin looked at the proposal and handed Sharigian two copies of the actual contract for the job. The contract between Si Associates and the city of Revere was finally approved on December 22, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">In the middle of March, 1973, Sharigian again met with Tobin at Tobin\u2019s office in the Suffolk County court house. Sharigian explained to Tobin that the work was more difficult than Sharigian had anticipated. He then informed Tobin that his firm would only give Tobin twenty-five thousand dollars instead of the agreed-upon forty thousand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>dollars. Tobin agreed, and told Sharigian to make out two checks: one in the name of Francis B. Bowden for seventeen thousand dollars, the other to Jack B. Stone for three thousand dollars. Tobin also told Sharigian that he (Tobin) wanted five thousand dollars in cash, but Sharigian responded that the cash payment would have to be delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">On March 19, 1973, Sharigian made out the checks. While each check relates that the check was for \u201cServices to Si Associates on Revere High School,\u201d neither Bowden<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nor Stone ever did work for Si Associates. The same day, Shari-gian personally delivered the checks to Tobin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Around this time, Borans telephoned Stone and asked Stone to come to his (Borons\u2019) office at Revere City Hall. When Stone arrived at Borans\u2019 office, Borans told him that he (Borons) felt that Stone was a \u201cvery good friend.\u201d Borans then asked Stone to \u201cdo him a favor.\u201d Borans said that Sharigian owed him (Borons) \u201ca personal debt of three thousand dollars.\u201d Borans said that Sharigian had \u201ca contract with the City of Revere to do the interior work for the new Revere High School.\u201d Borans added that \u201cbeing an official of the City of Revere, he didn\u2019t want to see the check.\u201d Borans asked Stone to accept the check from Sharigian and send Si Associates a bill for $3,000. Borans then said, \u201cWhen you receive the check, cash the check and bring it over to me.\u201d Borans promised that Stone \u201cwould possibly get some future work from the city of Revere.\u201d Although Stone was \u201creluctant,\u201d he agreed to Borans\u2019 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">A few days later, Stone received a check for $3,000 from Si Associates, signed by Sharigian. Stone called Borans, who repeated his earlier instructions to cash the check and bring the money to him (Borons). When Stone brought the money, Borans counted it and then thanked Stone.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>In late July or early August of 1973, Borans and Paul Martel, an architectural draftsman employed by Si Associates, drove to Beverly to inspect certain office equipment under consideration for the Revere high school. During the return trip, Borans told Martel that \u201cyou and Si are doing a really fine job on the school.\u201d Borans alluded to the possibility of future contracts with the city, and Martel responded that Si Associates did not wish to be considered for future contracts with the same kickback arrangements. Martel said that Si Associates had already paid over twenty-five thousand dollars, and that, \u201c[tjhis is ridiculous, totally absurd, the kinds of money we\u2019re throwing back.\u201d Borans responded,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThe Mayor only expected eight or ten thousand out of this entire contract.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As far as I know, he\u2019s only gotten about three thousand dollars cash.\u201d Borans also told Martel that \u201cin the future what you would have to kick back would be about 10 %, and that 10 % amount would be 10 % of your fee and there would be consideration taken out for income taxes.\u201d Shortly thereafter Reinstein had lunch with Borans and Sharigian. Reinstein said that in the future Sharigian should work with Dave Borans or Ronald Paone, the clerk of the works.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Paone called Sharigian in early November, 1974, and asked to meet with Sharigian. At the meeting Paone told Sharigian that \u201cthe Mayor was looking for the two thousand dollars that was still owed him.\u201d Sharigian and Paone agreed that Sharigian would purchase fifteen one hundred dollar tickets to a Reinstein fund raising event. Paone said that with the purchase of the tickets \u201cwe\u2019ll call it even.\u201d Sharigian said that he would have to write postdated checks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>to cover the tickets. Paone \u201cagreed to that.\u201d Sharigian\u2019s checks were presented for payment and on two occasions the bank returned the checks because Sharigian\u2019s account contained insufficient funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">At the time Sharigian\u2019s checks bounced, the city of Revere owed Si Associates around $7,700 and Sharigian owed Martel five thousand dollars. Martel went to Borans and said, \u201cDave, help me [Martel] out.\u201d Martel told Borans that he (Martel) could only get his (Martel\u2019s) money if the city paid Si Associates. Borans said he would speak to Reinstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Thereafter Borans told Martel that the \u201cCity of Revere would release a check for $3,500 . . . and . . . [Martel] was to give them $800 ... as a sign of good faith.\u201d When \u201cthey got this . . . then they would release the second $3,500 and [Martel] would give them . . . the balance.\u201d Martel brought the money from the first check to Borans. Borans suggested it be given \u201cto Billy\u201d (Reinstein). Martel said he\u2019d \u201cjust as soon give it to you [Borons].\u201d Borans replied, \u201cFine. The next check will be on its way.\u201d On receipt of the second check Martel brought Borans \u201cthe balance of the $1,500.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\n<em>Sharigian\u2019s Solicitation of Vendor Payments to Revere Officials</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">During the third week of January, 1973, shortly after Sharigian began work on the firm\u2019s contract as specifier for the high school, Sharigian met with Reinstein at the mayor\u2019s office. The mayor assured Sharigian that he (Reinstein) had assembled an efficient organization. Then Reinstein said, \u201cYou have a pretty good idea what we are involved with here. You have had a chance to review the categories and talk to a few of these people [vendors].\u201d Then, pointing to himself, Reinstein asked, \u201cHow much can we expect back on this end?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">When Sharigian responded that he had no idea, Reinstein asked, \u201cWell, isn\u2019t it standard, isn\u2019t it fair to say that a standard ten percent is the usual kickback fee on contracts? . . . Do you have any idea? A hundred thousand? Fifty thousand? Twenty thousand?\u201d Sharigian told Reinstein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>that he (Sharigian) would \u201crelate this conversation\u201d to Martel, and \u201cwe will get the ball rolling for you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Sharigian returned to his office and informed Martel of the details of his conversation with Reinstein, making Martel fully \u201caware of the fact that this was going to take place out of our office.\u201d Martel and Sharigian were to \u201csolicit individual vendors as they came into our office, making them aware there was something down there, and the thing was it was going to be for the Mayor\u2019s campaign.\u201d Martel was to prepare and keep a list of the vendors and their proposed \u201ccontributions,\u201d and \u201cthe Mayor said that we would be working with Mr. Borans on this. We were to keep him [Borons] informed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Throughout 1973 and early 1974, as Sharigian and Martel prepared the specifications for the various categories of interior furnishings and equipment for the high school, they interviewed prospective vendors. The interviewing process included not only discussion of specifications and prospective bids, but also solicitations by Sharigian and Martel of vendor kickbacks to Reinstein in the form of \u201ccampaign contributions.\u201d Martel kept Borans continually informed of \u201call the activity\u201d of Si Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In early 1974, Martel was summoned to a Saturday morning meeting with Reinstein and Paone, at Reinstein\u2019s home in Revere. Paone said, \u201cWe want you to give us the names of the people that are going to pay off to us.\u201d Martel took out the list of all the vendors who were to provide furnishings and equipment for the high school and began to read off the amounts which the vendors were willing to pay. Paone asked Martel for the total figure, and Martel responded that the total was \u201cfifteen or sixteen thousand dollars.\u201d A few days later, Martel met with Borans at Borans\u2019 office. Borans asked Martel to give him (Borons) a \u201cduplicate list\u201d of the amounts which the vendors had \u201cagreed to kick back.\u201d Martel made out the list and gave it to Borans.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">While a relatively large number of vendors were apparently involved in the vendor kickback scheme, we detail only the circumstances surrounding payments by the R.G. Shiers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Company and by Smith Associates, whose payments are the subject of specific charges against Borans.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Among the vendors solicited for kickbacks by Sharigian was Richard Shiers, the president of R.G. Shiers Company. Shiers was interested in bidding on two contracts: one for the school\u2019s curtains and draperies, and the other for the stage curtains. Sharigian explained to Shiers that \u201cin order to be a successful bidder on the job there would have to be a contribution to Mayor Reinstein\u2019s campaign fund.\u201d Shiers agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On June 6, 1973, Shiers met with Sharigian at Sharigian\u2019s office to work out the details of Shiers\u2019 payment to Rein-stein. \u201cWe determined that there would be a twenty-five-hundred-dollar kickback on both contracts,\u201d for a total payment of five thousand dollars. Shiers \u201cindicated to Si [Sharigian] that I would include that amount of money in my bid price for both contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">On July 12, 1973, before the two contracts were put up for bids, Shiers met with Borans to discuss the kickbacks. Borans \u201cindicated that the amounts had been discussed with Mayor Reinstein and the amounts were acceptable.\u201d Bor-ans, however, was concerned that Shiers might be the only bidder for the stage curtain contract and asked if Shiers \u201ccould possibly get another bidder just to add authenticity to our own bid.\u201d Borans assured Shiers that even if Shiers\u2019 bid were not the low bid for the contracts that Shiers\u2019 firm would be awarded both contracts. Shiers subsequently provided Borans with the name and address of an Alabama firm which was willing to file a bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The deadline for the submission of bids for each of the two contracts was October 11, 1973. Shiers\u2019 firm did not submit a timely bid for the stage curtain contract because Shiers\u2019 messenger brought the bid to Sharigian instead of Revere City Hall. Shiers\u2019 firm also was not the low bidder for the draperies contract. The following day, Shiers met with Borans and Sharigian. The three men decided that the best plan would be to find a way to reject all timely bids for the stage curtain contract and to disqualify the low bidder for the draperies contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Borans\u2019 position was that \u201cif we have to rebid this thing four, five, six times, the bid is definitely going to the R.G. Shiers Company.\u201d Subsequently, the low bidder for the draperies contract was disqualified and Shiers\u2019 firm was awarded the contract. All timely bids for the stage curtain contract were also disqualified, new bids were solicited and Shiers\u2019 firm was awarded the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">After Shiers began work, he determined that the installation of stage curtains would cost less than originally anticipated. Accordingly, Shiers sent a \u201cchange-order\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> letter to Sharigian which stated: \u201cThe changes which have been incorporated into the shop drawings will allow us to offer a credit of seven thousand, six hundred fifty dollars to the City.\u201d A copy of the letter was sent to Borans, who told Shiers that he had received the change-order letter but that he was reluctant to act on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Shortly thereafter, Shiers met with Paone who asked Shiers to make an initial payment on Shiers\u2019 kickback agreement. Shiers agreed to make out a check for $2,000 to Si Associates and that, in turn, Sharigian would make out a check to \u201cthe people in Revere.\u201d This arrangement was completed by the end of April, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Shiers again met with Paone in July of 1974. Paone explained to Shiers that he (Paone), Reinstein and Borans were dissatisfied with Si Associates\u2019 \u201ccollection bureau.\u201d Reinstein, Borans and Paone had decided that \u201cPaone would now be the fellow that was handling future kickback payments.\u201d Paone then suggested that Shiers increase the amount of his kickback. When Shiers resisted, Paone commented on Shiers\u2019 proposed credit to the city of $7,650 and suggested that this money from the credit be given to Rein-stein.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Shiers agreed to give an additional $5,000 to Reinstein by crediting the city only $2,650. However, Shiers told Paone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>that he could make no further kickback payments until he received some money on his contracts with the city of Revere. A few days later, Shiers received a call from Borans who said that the city would issue a check shortly. Borans then told Shiers to \u201cmake arrangements with Mr. Paone to complete the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">By early October, 1974, Shiers had made kickback payments totalling $7,500. On October 3, 1974, Shiers spoke with Borans, who \u201cwanted us to complete our previously stated arrangements and complete the ten-thousand-dollar kickback.\u201d Shiers then met with Paone in the parking lot of the high school on October 16 and handed Paone a check for $2,500, thus completing his payment of the ten thousand dollar kickback.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">A second vendor solicited by Sharigian and Martel was Smith Associates. This firm was awarded the library furniture and shelving contract for the high school in the amount of $81,997. Prior to the time that the firm submitted the bid, Robert B. Davidson, a salesman for Smith Associates, met with Martel at the offices of Si Associates to discuss the fact that change orders increasing the contract price would be issued on the contract after it was awarded, adding certain items of equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Martel told Davidson that \u201che [Martel] had known the Mayor of Revere, Mayor Reinstein, for practically all his life, but until a couple of months ago he didn\u2019t know that he was a crook.\u201d Martel then said that \u201con the change orders that would be coming through that we would kick back fifteen per cent to the Mayor.\u201d Martel then said that the fifteen per cent kickback \u201cwas not coming out of [Smith Associates\u2019] pocket. We were to take our material costs and add a fifteen percent.\u201d Davidson said that he would inform the president of Smith Associates, who later approved the arrangement. Eventually, four change orders totalling approximately $25,000 were issued for Smith Associates after being approved by Borans.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In November, 1974, Davidson spoke to Borans about the fact that the city had not yet paid Smith Associates. Borans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>responded, \u201cWell, where\u2019s our money?\u201d Davidson answered that Smith Associates had agreed to pay a $2,700 kickback and that the firm would pay nothing until it (Smith Associates) received payment from the city. On November 7, a check was issued to Smith Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Martel then informed Davidson that the $2,700 payment would be made to Paone. On November 11, 1974, the president of Smith Associates gave Davidson a plain brown envelope containing $2,700 in cash.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Davidson took the envelope to a restaurant in Revere, where he met Paone. After the two men had coffee, Davidson \u201ctook the envelope out of [his] pocket and . . . slipped [it] under the table . . . to him.\u201d The two men then left the restaurant and \u201cwent our separate ways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\n<em>Testimony before the Grand Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Borans testified before the grand jury on June 28, 1976.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> During the course of his testimony, Borans denied any knowledge of a kickback payment from Simon Sharigian to Mayor Reinstein or any of Reinstein\u2019s associates.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>After Borans\u2019 testimony for the day was concluded, Borans returned to the district attorney\u2019s office with the assistant district attorney and with Charles McNally, the investigator for the Suffolk County district attorney\u2019s office who was in charge of the Revere high school investigation. The three men arrived at the office at approximately 5 p.m. After arriving, \u201cBorons acknowledged that he was here on a voluntary basis and agreed to be interviewed, adding that he had nothing to hide. ...\u201d Borans repeatedly denied any personal knowledge of a kickback scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">At approximately 9 p.m., the assistant district attorney terminated the interview. As Borans prepared to leave, he told McNally, \u201cI picked up the money from Bob Tobin and delivered it to Reinstein.\u201d McNally asked Borans to repeat the statement to the assistant district attorney. Borans did so, adding that he saw Reinstein take the money out of the envelope and put it in his (Reinstein\u2019s) coat pocket. However, Borans said that he would deny making this statement before the grand jury, if asked, and he would continue to deny knowledge of any payments from Si Associates to Rein-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>stein. Borans said that he would cooperate with the district attorney\u2019s office only after the grand jury returned indictments against the other participants in the scheme and did not indict Borans. When the assistant district attorney rejected this arrangement, Borans left the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In late May and early June of 1976, Stone, the recipient of the $3,000 check, had frequent conversations with Borans concerning the ongoing investigation of the alleged kickbacks. On each occasion, Borans told Stone to say that he (Stone) had actually done consulting work for Si Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">On July 12, 1976, Stone met with Borans at Borans\u2019 office. Stone told Borans that he (Stone) would be testifying before the grand jury the following day. Borans told Stone, \u201cWell, stick to the story, that you did consulting work for Si Associates and there\u2019ll be no problems and there is nothing to worry about.\u201d Borans also told Stone \u201cthat Si Sharigian would back [Stone] up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">On July 13, 1976, Stone testified before the grand jury. Stone testified that he had done consulting work for Si Associates. Stone testified that the $3,000 check which he received from Sharigian was in payment for Stone\u2019s consulting services and that Stone had in fact \u201crendered three thousand dollars\u2019 worth of services.\u201d Before the grand jury, Stone denied \u201cparticipating] in a scheme whereby the proceeds, either all or part of that three thousand dollars, was funneled back to anyone in the City of Revere.\u201d The same evening, Stone spoke with Borans. \u201cHe asked me did I stick to the story, and I told him I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">On July 15, Stone again appeared before the grand jury. Stone repeated his story that he performed \u201cat a minimum, a three-thousand-dollar service to Si Associates.\u201d Stone also denied sending an invoice to Sharigian \u201cto cover up the three-thousand-dollar payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">On December 2, 1976, Stone was arraigned on an indictment charging him with perjury before the grand jury in his testimony of July 13 and 15. Stone pleaded not guilty. On May 27, 1977, Stone returned to court and pleaded guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>to the indictment charging him with perjury before the grand jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">I. <em>Directed Verdicts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Borans asserts that the judge should have granted his motions for directed verdicts of acquittal, made at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, on the indictments against him. In reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict, we consider only the evidence introduced up to the time the Commonwealth rested its case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>378 Mass. 392, 403-404 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ama-zeen, </em>375 Mass. 73, 80 (1978). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>370 Mass. 147, 150 (1976). To determine whether there was sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt to warrant the submission of the charges to the jury, the test is \u201cwhether the evidence, in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the contrary evidence presented by the defendant, is sufficient, as to each indictment, to permit the jury to infer the existence of the essential elements of the crime charged in that indictment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. 729, 740 (1975). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>377 Mass. 453, 455-456 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tabor, </em>376 Mass. 811, 824 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra. </em>Moreover, \u201cthe evidence and the inferences permitted to be drawn therefrom must be \u2018of sufficient force to bring minds of ordinary intelligence and sagacity to the persuasion of [guilt] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671,. 677 (1979), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>264 Mass. 368, 373 (1928). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680, 685-686 (1979). Accord, <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979) (\u201c[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d [emphasis in original]). Applying this test, we conclude that there was ample evidence to permit the jury to find the defendant guilty of each of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">A. <em>Perjury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Borans argues that the judge erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal of the charge of perjury. Borans asserts that the Commonwealth failed to demonstrate that Borans\u2019 allegedly false testimony before the grand jury was material to the grand jury investigation. Further, he maintains that the questions asked of him before the grand jury \u2014 and his responses thereto \u2014 were ambiguous and equivocal. Finally, Borans claims that the grand jury proceedings were invalid as to him because he was \u201cbrought before the Grand Jury in order to extract perjured testimony from him.\u201d Thus Borans concludes that the judge should have directed a verdict of acquittal of the charge of perjury. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">To sustain a conviction for perjury, false testimony must be given \u201cin a matter material to the issue or point in question.\u201d G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 1. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Louis Constr. Co., </em>343 Mass. 600, 606-607 (1962); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>12 Met. 225, 229 (1847). Moreover, it is well established that \u201c [materiality in respect of perjury means relevance in the sense that the answer might tend in reasonable degree to affect some aspect or result of the inquiry.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, </em>373 Mass. 345, 352 (1977), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>350 Mass. 102, 110 (1966). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>116 Mass. 17, 20-21 (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Borans does not disagree that his false testimony before the grand jury concerning payments by Simon Sharigian was material to an issue well within the legitimate scope of the grand jury\u2019s inquiry. Borans asserts, however, that his \u201ctestimony certainly had no practical effect on the decision to return indictments\u201d because other witnesses had already provided the grand jury with a \u201cmore than sufficient . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>[basis] for indictment.\u201d Thus Borans concludes that his testimony was immaterial to the grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Borans\u2019 argument that his testimony had no <em>actual </em>effect on the grand jury\u2019s decision to return indictments, \u201cmisperceives the legal requirements regarding materiality. The government need not show that because of the perjured testimony, the grand jury threw in the towel. Actual impediment of the investigation is not required. . . . Grand jurors are capable of judging credibility and they are free to disbelieve a witness and persevere in an investigation without immunizing a perjurer.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>568 F.2d 411, 421 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 437 U.S. 903 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The argument that false testimony must actually impede or otherwise influence the grand jury\u2019s investigation has been almost universally rejected. The proper \u201ctest of relevancy and materiality is not whether the false testimony did in fact influence a pertinent determination. Instead, it must be decided whether, viewed objectively, the testimony directly or circumstantially had a reasonable and natural tendency to do so.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giles, supra </em>at 111. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, supra. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>596 F.2d 157, 165 (6th Cir. 1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beer, </em>518 F.2d 168, 172 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gugliaro, </em>501 F.2d 68, 71 (2d Cir. 1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Devitt, </em>499 F.2d 135, 139 (7th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 975 (1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Masters, </em>484 F.2d 1251, 1254 (10th Cir. 1973); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lococo, </em>450 F.2d 1196, 1199 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 945 (1972). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>92 N.M. 470, 474475 (Ct. App. 1979). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Demauro, </em>581 F.2d 50, 53 n.l (2d Cir. 1978) (more stringent view of materiality applied in SEC proceedings may not apply \u201cin the context of a grand jury investigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Clearly, the questions asked of Borans before the grand jury related directly to the subject matter of the grand jury\u2019s investigation \u2014 political corruption in the city of Revere involving kickbacks to public officials in Revere. Borans\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>answers to these questions would have a natural tendency to affect the grand jury\u2019s determination regardless of the testimony of other witnesses. \u201cThe \u2018natural effect or tendency\u2019 obviously flows from an assumption on the part of the speaker that the tribunal will believe what he says. On this basis materiality refers to the connection between the words said only by the accused and the objective of the investigation; other testimony which the grand jury has heard, except as it may tend to delimit the objective of the inquiry, is therefore irrelevant to a determination of materiality. And we think it equally obvious that had appellant\u2019s false statements been believed, the natural effect would have been to impede the grand jury\u2019s investigation.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>464 F.2d 424, 436 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 949 (1972). We conclude that Borans\u2019 testimony before the grand jury was on a matter material to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Next the defendant argues that a close examination of Borans\u2019 testimony reveals that both the questions asked of him and the answers which he gave were ambiguous and equivocal. Borans points to the fact that he truthfully told the grand jury that he was aware that Sharigian and Martel has purchased fund raising tickets as evidence of a \u201cretraction or clarification\u201d of his previous answer, which \u201cshows that Borans really did not understand what a kick-back in this context was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">However, Borans properly conceded that, in evaluating a witness\u2019s answers, \u201c[i]t is also important that the witness\u2019s entire testimony be read together to determine whether perjury truly occurred.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>353 Mass. 1, 11 (1967); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crippen, </em>570 F.2d 535, 537 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1069 (1979). We think this concession fatal to the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">While it is true that Borans admitted before the grand jury his awareness that Sharigian had purchased Reinstein\u2019s fund raising tickets, Borans <em>denied </em>any knowledge of payments from Sharigian other than for tickets. He also denied that he had spoken with Martel concerning the amount of money paid by Si Associates, and he denied any knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>that Sharigian had given money to Tobin.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Contrary to Borans\u2019 assertion, examination of the transcript of Borans\u2019 grand jury testimony reveals that \u201cconsidered in the context of the entire examination of the defendant, the question[s were] clear and unambiguous,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crippen, supra, </em>as were Borans\u2019 responses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Finally, Borans claims that since the Commonwealth held \u201call of the cards,\u201d calling him before the grand jury placed Borans in a dilemma: either give incriminating testimony or perjure himself. Moreover, Borans maintains that we should reverse his conviction of perjury because he was brought before the grand jury for the purpose of trapping him into perjury. Both contentions are specious.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Borans\u2019 first argument ignores the fact that he had another option available to him: the assertion of his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Assuming that Borans \u201cwas indeed a \u2018putative defendant,\u2019 that fact would have no bearing on the validity of a conviction for testifying falsely. . . . [He] was free at every stage to interpose his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, but perjury was not a permissible option.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. 564, 583-584 (1976). See <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>States </em>v. Wong, 431 U.S. 174,177-178 (1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edelson, </em>581 F.2d 1290, 1292 (7th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 908 (1979) (\u201ctarget\u201d status of a witness is no excuse for perjury).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Borans\u2019 suggestion that he was somehow \u201ctrapped\u201d into perjury is also without merit. \u201c[T]he prosecutor\u2019s questioning was not a trap to support a prosecution for perjury. The subject matter of the meeting should have made it memorable, and the prosecutor\u2019s repetition and restatement provided ample cues to stimulate defendant\u2019s recollection. . . . If indeed a trap was set, it was aimed not at perjury, but at flushing out the truth.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Pomerantz, </em>46 N.Y.2d 240, 243 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We agree with the judge that the Commonwealth presented ample evidence to warrant the submission of the charge of perjury to the jury. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">B. <em>Subornation of Per jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Borans was convicted of subornation of perjury in connection with the testimony of Jack Stone before the grand jury on July 13 and July 15, 1976. See G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 2. Borans argues that the judge should have directed a verdict of acquittal on the indictment charging him with subornation of perjury because: (1) Stone retracted his perjured testimony; and (2) Borans merely \u201ccounseled Stone to \u2018stick to the story\u2019 that he had done the work\u201d for Si Associates.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We think the judge correctly denied Borans\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Borans argues that he cannot be convicted of subornation of perjury because Stone subsequently retracted his perjured testimony before the grand jury. According to Borans, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Stone\u2019s \u201csubsequent voluntary appearance before the Grand Jury wherein he recanted his previous misstatements while the Grand Jury was still considering the Revere High School matter, is sufficient to insulate him [Stone] from a perjury conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The short answer to Borans\u2019 argument is that the argument is factually inaccurate. Stone did not recant his testimony before the grand jury concerning the issue of whether Stone had actually performed three thousand dollars\u2019 worth of services for Si Associates. Indeed, subsequent to Stone\u2019s testimony before the grand jury he was indicted for perjury.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Far from being \u201cinsulatefd] . . . from a perjury conviction,\u201d Stone ultimately pleaded guilty to the charge.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus Borans\u2019 argument concerning Stone\u2019s alleged recantation of his perjured testimony cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Finally, Borans asserts that there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that Borans actually suborned Stone\u2019s perjured testimony. On appeal, Borans admits that he \u201ccounseled,\u201d and \u201cadvised,\u201d Stone to \u201cstick to the story\u201d but claims that such evidence is insufficient to support a conviction for subornation of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>5 Met. 241, 245 (1842), we indicated that \u201c[t]o constitute subornation of perjury, the party charged must have procured the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the perjury, by inciting, instigating, or persuading the guilty party to commit the crime.\u201d We concluded that there must be \u201csolicitation on the part of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We need not decide whether a course of action which involves only \u201cthe suggestion of a course of perjury,\u201d however reprehensible, would support a conviction for subornation of perjury under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 2. Here, Borans\u2019 \u201ccounsel-ling\u201d extended well within the range of persuasion, and we are not required to draw such a fine line.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Stone testified that Borans repeatedly told him that if he would \u201cstick to the story,\u201d Stone would not be in trouble. On the day before Stone perjured himself, Stone met with Borans at Borans\u2019 office. Borans told Stone to \u201cstick to the story, that you did consulting work for Si Associates and there\u2019ll be no problems and there is nothing to worry about.\u201d Moreover, Borans <em>also </em>told Stone that Sharigian would corroborate Stone\u2019s false testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">These facts are sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that Borans actually procured Stone\u2019s perjury by persuading him to testify falsely before the grand jury. See <em>Commonwealth v. Fine, </em>321 Mass. 299, 301 (1947) (defendant advised witness to \u201cstick to . . . [his] story\u201d and \u201cyou are all right\u201d). There was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">C. <em>Violations of G. L. c. 268A, </em>\u00a7 <em>2(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Borans was charged with six violations of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 2(h).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Two of the indictments involve Borans\u2019 accept-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>anee of payments for Reinstein from Martel. The remaining four indictments involve the vendor kickbacks: three arise out of the kickbacks made by the R.G. Shiers Company; one arises out of the kickback made by Smith Associates. We think that the judge properly denied Borans\u2019 motions for directed verdicts of acquittal on each of the six charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">As to the payments made by Martel, Borans admits that he accepted two cash payments totalling $1,500 for Rein-stein. Borans\u2019 sole argument on appeal is that since the $1,500 was ostensibly directed toward the purchase of \u201ctickets to a Reinstein fundraiser . . . [and] that it was to cover [earlier] bad checks for the tickets . . . there is no indication that he [Borons] knew the $800 and $700 payments were anything other than legitimate campaign contributions.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The jury could have found that, at the time Borans accepted two cash payments for Reinstein from Martel, Borans was aware of the fact that these payments constituted the final instalment of Sharigian\u2019s kickback agreement. See <em>supra </em>at 125-126. The jury could also have found that Borans was aware of and actively participated in the kickback scheme by conditioning his approval of the issuance of city checks to Si Associates on the receipt of kickback payments from Martel. Campaign contributions to induce public officials promptly to perform their duties are unlawful. Nor can public officials condition the disbursement of government funds on the receipt of \u201ccampaign contributions.\u201d See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>359 Mass. 77, 89-90 (1971). There was ample evidence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>which the jury could find that Borans violated G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 <em>2(b) </em>in his acceptance of $1,500 from Martel.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Similarly, the evidence of Borans\u2019 participation in the scheme to solicit kickbacks from vendors was sufficient to allow the jury to decide the question of Borans\u2019 guilt. As to Shiers, Borans\u2019 involvement in the kickback scheme was continuous and active. After Shiers made a $5,000 kickback arrangement with Sharigian, and before Shiers submitted bids to the city of Revere, Borans personally informed Shiers that he (Borons) had spoken with Reinstein and the $5,000 kickback would be \u201cacceptable.\u201d Moreover, after Shiers\u2019 firm failed to submit a timely bid on one of the contracts and was not the low bidder on the other contract, Borans indicated that he would see to it that the city awarded Shiers the contracts in any event because \u201cDick [Shiers] had agreed originally to throw back twenty-five hundred on each [contract].\u201d Finally, after Shiers was awarded the two contracts, Borans repeatedly insisted that Shiers complete his kickback payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">As to the vendor kickback from Smith Associates, the evidence indicates that Smith Associates was to increase its price as an accommodation to Revere officials and to remit the increase to the mayor\u2019s campaign treasury. Thus the firm was used as a conduit through which the illegal kickbacks were to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Borans approved the change orders from which the Smith Associates\u2019 kickback was to be paid. Further, when Davidson telephoned Borans in late 1974 to complain that Smith Associates had not yet received payment from the city, Bor-ans inquired about the $2,700 kickback promised by Smith Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Borans argues that he never personally \u201creceived anything of value from any of the vendors.\u201d He also maintains that he was never influenced in the performance of his official duty by the fact that a vendor had agreed to make a kickback payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">However, G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>does not require that a public officer <em>personally </em>receive anything of value. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>sufficient that the public officer \u201casks, demands, exacts, solicits [or] seeks,\u201d something of value on behalf of another. See note 23, <em>supra. </em>We think that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude not only that Borans was aware of the vendor kickback scheme, but also that with regard to the kickbacks from Shiers and from Smith Associates he \u201ccommitted <em>overt </em>acts in furtherance\u201d of the scheme (emphasis in original). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass. 188, 353 (1971), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>407 U.S. 910, and sub nom. <em>Beneficial Fin.

Borans claimed that \u201cthe transcript fails to produce any evidence of Borans\u2019 knowledge and intentional participation in the scheme.\u201d On the contrary, there was evidence from which the jury could conclude that at the time Borans approved the change order, he knew and intended that by approving a change order credit of only $2,650, $5,000 of the city\u2019s money was not a payment for services rendered to the city of Revere, but was to be a kickback to the mayor\u2019s campaign treasury. Finally, two days after Borans approved the change order he (Borons) told Shiers \u201cto complete the ten-thousand-dollar kickback.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The submission of the amended change order constitutes a false presentation of a bill for labor and materials sufficient to support a conviction of larceny by false pretenses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Abbott Eng\u2019r, Inc., </em>351 Mass. 568, 572, 579 (1967); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Louis Constr. Co., </em>343 Mass. 600, 604 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">E. <em>Accessory After the Fact.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Borans does not argue specifically that the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for a directed verdict on the indictment charg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ing Borans as an accessory after the fact was erroneous.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus this assignment of error is deemed waived. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Napolitano, </em>378 Mass. 599, 600 n.2 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amazeen, </em>375 Mass. 73, 74 n.l (1978). In any event, the evidence outlined in the summary of facts, <em>supra, </em>when considered in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is more than sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that Borans was guilty as an accessory after the fact to a felony in connection with Sharigian\u2019s $25,000 kickback payment to Beinstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">II. <em>Evidence of Conversations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">During the trial, the Commonwealth sought to introduce as evidence various conversations involving Beinstein and others at which Borans was not present. The judge ruled that the testimony was admissible under either of two theories: (1) that Borans was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with Beinstein and others; and (2) that Borans was charged with being an accessory after the fact to a felony committed by Beinstein. Borans maintains that \u201c[njeither of the two justifications offered . . . for the admissibility of this hearsay evidence stands up under close scrutiny.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Borans\u2019 initial objection is directed to the judge\u2019s decision to admit evidence of conversations involving Reinstein and Turiello and Reinstein and the Worcester contractor which occurred prior to the date on which Sharigian was initially solicited for a kickback. According to Borans, these early conversations, relating to kickback solicitations of Turiello and the Worcester contractor, occurred prior to the commencement of any joint criminal enterprise to solicit a kickback from Sharigian and have no relevance to the crimes for which Borans is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">It is well settled that, to be admissible against a defendant, the out-of-court statements of coconspirators or joint criminal venturers must have been made during the pend-ency of the criminal enterprise and in furtherance of it. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>370 Mass. 703, 708-709 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>362 Mass. 455, 477 (1972) (\u201cthe same general rule of evidence applies to cases where a conspiracy or common enterprise is shown to exist even though not charged\u201d). However, \u201c[t]he relation of parties charged with conspiracy is not an immaterial matter, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>unless too remote, acts and transactions prior to the alleged date of the commencement of the conspiracy are relevant. The date when a conspiracy is alleged to have begun is not, in effect, a wall behind which the court and jury may never look for the purpose of discovering facts that have a bearing upon the fact of the conspiracy itself.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>314 Mass. 210, 227 (1943). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wampler, </em>369 Mass. 121, 123 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stasiun, </em>349 Mass. 38, 50 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The conversations between Reinstein and Turiello, commencing the month after Reinstein took office as mayor of Revere, tended to show that from the outset of Reinstein\u2019s administration, Reinstein planned to solicit a kickback payment from the person who held the contract as specifier for the interior design and furnishings of the new Revere high school. When Turiello failed to cooperate, a replacement was sought. The Worcester contractor was solicited for the position. During a meeting at which Borans was present, Reinstein informed the contractor that in order to obtain the contract as specifier for the new high school, the contractor would be required to pay Reinstein $10,000 in cash.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> After the contractor failed to respond, a search for a \u201csuitable\u201d contractor was undertaken and the successful solicitation of Sharigian commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u201c[T]he government had a right to show the whole history of the conspiracy from its commencement to its consummation. . . . [The evidence] tended to show the preparations made by [the principal] and the beginning and development of his scheme. It was like the evidence which always has been held to be competent that one charged with a crime had made preparations for its commission, or had by word or deed manifested an intention to commit that crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>207 Mass. 563, 570 (1911). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butynski, </em>339 Mass. 151, 152 (1959) (\u201cThe consistency of the . . . conduct . . . tended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>show . . . relevant background . . . [and] that it was part of a general purpose and course of operations\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farmer, </em>218 Mass. 507, 512-513 (1914). Accord, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagan, </em>357 Mass. 585, 589 (1970) (\u201cthe mere fact that evidence tends to prove the commission of some other crime does not render it inadmissible as long as it is relevant to the crime being tried\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In any event, the conversations to which Borans objects are also admissible to show that Borans was the accessory after the fact to a felony. \u201c[T]o convict him, it was necessary to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that. . . the alleged principal . . . was guilty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>338 Mass. 130, 135 (1958). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagan, supra </em>at 590; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tilley, </em>327 Mass. 540, 546 (1951). Thus evidence relevant to show the actual commission of a felony by Reinstein,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> including his preparations therefor, are admissible against Borans, who is charged as accessory after the fact to Reinstein\u2019s felony.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Accord, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagan, supra </em>at 589-590.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>III. <em>Other Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">A. <em>Motion to Sever.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The defendant contends that he was entitled to three trials: one involving the Sharigian kickback, a second concerning the vendor kickbacks, and a third on the indictment charging him with perjury. Thus he asserts that the judge\u2019s denial of his motion to sever was error. However, the judge\u2019s decision to deny the motion to sever \u201cwas for him to make as matter of discretion, and we reverse him only if there has been \u2018a clear abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>211 Mass. 50, 54 (1912) (\u201cNo sound reason can be given why several indictments charging different crimes arising out of a single chain of circumstances should not be tried together\u201d). Here, the judge could reasonably have concluded that the indictments all resulted from the construction of the new Revere high school, and that separate trials were neither required nor warranted.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth v. Rosenthal, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>B. <em>The Scope of Cross-Examination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Defense counsel sought to ask the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses (Martel, Sharigian, Bowden, Davidson) whether they were aware of the maximum penalties for crimes for which they either had been or could be charged. When the Commonwealth objected,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the judge ruled that the defense counsel \u201cmay ask him if he was informed of the penalties attached to the particular crimes of which he was informed he was a suspect and not what the years would be or what the Court might do as far as the penalty is concerned.\u201d This procedure was followed with regard to Bowden and Davidson.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dougan, </em>377 Mass. 303 (1979), we indicated that while \u201c[t]he defendants are entitled, as of right, to reasonable cross-examination of a witness for the purpose of showing bias, particularly where that witness may have a motivation to seek favor with the government . . . , the trial judge still has discretion to control the scope of the examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310. Here, especially since many of the charges against witnesses were similar to those faced by the defendant, we find no abuse of the judge\u2019s discretion. Indeed, the judge allowed the defendant considerable latitude in questioning witnesses as to the crimes for which they could be or had been charged and, in Bowden\u2019s case, that Bowden was testifying under a grant of immuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>ty. The defendant\u2019s right to reasonable cross-examination of witnesses \u201cis not necessarily infringed by curbing inquiry where the matters sought to be elicited have been sufficiently brought to the attention of the trier of fact through other questioning or other means.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>370 Mass. 548, 572, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 943 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">C. <em>Notes of Interviews with Commonwealth Witnesses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The defendant asserts that the judge erred in refusing to require the assistant district attorney to turn over notes made by the assistant district attorney and his investigators relating to Commonwealth witnesses. According to the defendant, he is entitled to inspect these materials pursuant to our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewinski, </em>367 Mass. 889, 901-903 (1975). See also Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 and 23, 378 Mass. 874 and 893 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In <em>Lewinski, </em>we indicated that a defendant may, without a showing of \u201cparticularized need,\u201d move to inspect all \u201cprior written statements of prosecution witnesses which are available to the prosecution and are related to the subject matter of their testimony at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 902. However, we also indicated that the prosecution need disclose only \u201cany statement made by the witness and in some definite way approved by him, a transcript of a contemporaneous verbatim or substantially verbatim stenographic or other recording of an oral statement by the witness, and a written report consisting of a statement by the witness. \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Here, the defense counsel moved for production of such materials at the conclusion of the direct examination of each of the principal prosecution witnesses. On each occasion, the assistant district attorney represented to the court that the Commonwealth had already given to the defendant all transcripts of grand jury minutes, all depositions and all witness statement summaries which had been approved or adopted by the witness.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The assistant district attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>further represented to the judge that the only materials which the Commonwealth had not turned over to defense counsel consisted of notes made by the prosecutor or his investigators which had never been adopted by witnesses and which constituted the prosecutor\u2019s work product. The judge refused to compel the assistant district attorney to reveal these materials to the defendant.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">On the record before us, we cannot say that the judge\u2019s refusal to compel production of these materials was error. While the defendant\u2019s trial counsel cross-examined the principal witnesses extensively, and while this cross-examination included discussion of the witnesses\u2019 meetings with the Commonwealth\u2019s investigators, we are unable to find in the record the slightest support for a claim that the Commonwealth was in possession of a statement adopted by any witness which had not been turned over to the defendant or that the Commonwealth\u2019s representations were made in bad faith.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Compare <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>94, 100-101, 105-106 (1976) (\u201cwork-product doctrine\u201d does not preclude discovery where witness had \u201cadopted or approved\u201d a writing containing trial strategy). Moreover, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions on appeal, the defendant never requested that the judge examine the prosecutor\u2019s notes in camera, and the defendant never requested that the notes in question \u201cbe identified so that in case of conviction and appeal it may be sealed and transmitted to the reviewing court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewinski, supra </em>at 903.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The defendant \u201cas the appealing party has the burden of showing in the record by agreement if possible, otherwise by evidence, the existence of the records he contends were wrongfully denied him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>369 Mass. 715, 724 (1976). The prosecutor has a continuing duty promptly to disclose to the defendant\u2019s counsel any changes of substance in the statements of prospective witnesses of which the prosecutor becomes aware. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 14(a)(4); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>377 Mass. 887, 894 (1979). There is nothing in the record to show misconduct by the prosecutor or that the prosecutor withheld materials from the defense which should have been dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>closed.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>376 Mass. 1, 20-27 (1978).

Stone repeatedly and unequivocally stated in his testimony on July 15 that he had performed at least $3,000 worth of services for Si Associates. The defendant\u2019s argument, extensively addressed in his brief on appeal, thus is at best a serious misunderstanding and at worst a misrepresentation of the facts in this case. While we recognize that the trial transcript is approximately 3,000 pages long, we cannot ignore the significant number of factual inaccuracies contained in the defendant\u2019s brief. See generally S.J.C. Rule 3:22, DR 7-102(A) (5), 359 Mass. 818 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\"> Stone had not been sentenced at the time of Borans\u2019 trial. This fact was brought to the attention of the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b159-10\"> General Laws c. 268A, \u00a7 2, as amended through St. 1964, c. 287, provides in pertinent part: <em>\u201c(b) </em>Whoever, being a state, county or municipal employee . . . directly or indirectly, corruptly asks, demands, exacts, solicits, seeks, accepts, receives or agrees to receive anything of value for himself or for any other person or entity, in return for</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">(1) being influenced in his performance of any official act or any act within his official responsibility, or</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">(2) being influenced to commit or aid in committing, or to collude in, or allow any fraud, or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud, on the commonwealth or on a state, county or municipal agency, or</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">(3) being induced to do or omit to do any acts in violation of his official duty; . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\"><em>(d) . . . </em>shall be punished by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars or by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>years or in a jail or house of correction for not more than two and one half years, or by both such fine and imprisonment in a jail or house of correction; and in the event of final conviction shall be incapable of holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the commonwealth or under any state, county or municipal agency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\"> While the jury could have accepted Borans\u2019 explanation of his receipt of the money from Martel and disbelieved the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, they were not required to do so. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>378 Mass. 392, 406 n.15 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"> Borans\u2019 references to the crime of being an accessory after the fact are directed <em>solely </em>to the question whether certain conversations occurring in Borans\u2019 absence were admissible. See <em>infra </em>at 145-148.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\"> Borans also appears to argue that the judge was required to make a preliminary finding that a joint criminal enterprise existed as a precondition to his admission of the evidence concerning the conversations. However, we have indicated that, especially in a case where the evidence tends to be complicated, it is permissible for a judge to admit declarations of coconspirators on the representation of the prosecution that the Commonwealth will subsequently introduce sufficient evidence to show that the defendant was part of the conspiracy. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>348 Mass. 29, 56-58 (1964), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>380 U.S. 913 (1965). Then, \u201cif the evidence fell short of the representations made by the prosecutor,\u201d the defendant may properly move to strike the testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 57. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dominico, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 693, 717-718 (1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>582 F.2d 1128, 1131 (7th Cir. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>578 F.2d 757, 768 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 981 (1978); <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>v. <em>Graham, </em>548 F.2d 1302, 1308 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>529 F.2d 557, 559 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 908 (1976). Accord, <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>240 Mass. 264, 312-314 (1922). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>James, </em>590 F.2d 575, 581-582 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 917 (1979). See generally P. Marcus, Prosecution and Defense of Criminal Conspiracy Cases, \u00a7 5.05[3] [b] (1978) (\u201cShould the prosecution not establish the existence of the conspiracy to the trial court\u2019s satisfaction, the defense could either move to strike the declarations, or move for a mistrial\u201d). Moreover, here the judge repeatedly gave \u201ccautionary instruction[s] at the time of admission of the proof, with further instructions in the final charge, explaining the conditions to be met before such evidence may be considered.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Krohn, </em>573 F.2d 1382, 1387 &amp; n.5 (10th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>436 U.S. 949 (1978). The judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the testimony, coupled with the denial of the defendant\u2019s motions for directed verdicts, demonstrates that the judge found that the Commonwealth had presented sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s participation in the schemes. The judge properly did not disclose this ruling to the jury because, as the judge later instructed the jury, the jury were required \u201cto consider the same questions to determine whether it should make the findings which the judge concluded were warranted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>373 Mass. 329, 337 n.3 (1977). There was no error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> Since Borans attended this meeting, Borans has not objected to the admission of Reinstein\u2019s statement on this basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> As to conversations involving Turiello, the Worcester contractor and Sharigian (in the initial stages of the kickback solicitation), Borans concedes that \u201c[h]ad Reinstein been on trial, this evidence might, arguably, have been relevant as to him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> The defendant relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, 357 </em>Mass. 149 (1970), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fancy, </em>349 Mass. 196 (1965), to support his claim that the evidence is not relevant to the charge that Borans is an accessory after the fact. However, in neither <em>Perry </em>nor <em>Fancy </em>was the defendant charged with being an accessory after the fact to a felony. Moreover, we reversed convictions in both cases on the ground that the defendant\u2019s association with felons, \u201cwithout more, is not enough to convict the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, supra </em>at 151. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fancy, supra </em>at <em>200. The </em>question in each case was <em>not </em>whether the defendant\u2019s association with the principal felons was admissible \u2014 which it was \u2014 but whether that evidence, standing alone, would support a conviction. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>366 Mass. 132, 136 (1974) (Commonwealth must show defendant\u2019s knowledge of felony). We are adamant that guilt by association is insufficient to support a conviction. In this case, however, the evidence of Borans\u2019 guilt by his participation in the unlawful schemes is overwhelming.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\"> The question of joinder is now governed by Mass. R. Crim. P. 9(a)(1) and (3), 378 Mass. 859 (1979): \u201cTwo or more offenses are related offenses if they are based on the same criminal conduct or episode or arise out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan. ... If a defendant is charged with two or more related offenses, either party may move for joinder of such charges. The trial judge shall join the charges for trial unless he determines that joinder is not in the best interests of justice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\"> The Commonwealth properly points out that both Federal cases upon which the defendant relies to support his assertion that the trial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>perjury indictment should have been severed held that there was no error in the judges\u2019 denial of motions to sever perjury indictments from indictments for substantive offenses. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pacente, </em>503 F.2d 543, 545-547 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1048 (1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sweig, </em>441 F.2d 114, 118-119 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 932 (1971). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jamar, </em>561 F.2d 1103, 1106-1107 (4th Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hilliard, </em>436 F.Supp. 66, 72-75 (S.D.N.Y. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\"> One of the Commonwealth\u2019s first objections to a question concerning a maximum penalty was grounded in tbe fact that defense counsel had misstated a maximum penalty. The judge then informed defense counsel that \u201cI am going to ask you to ask the witness if he was informed as to the punishment of the crime. Not a recitation as to what the penalty is, because I do not intend to check the statute book each time to find if you are accurate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\"> On appeal, counsel for the defendant implies that the adopted statements of certain witnesses turned over to the defendant prior to trial were unfairly incomplete. For example, he asserts that while the testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>many of Sharigian and Martel encompassed seven trial days, the defendant viewed only \u201ca nine page statement drawn up by Mr. McNally and affirmed by the witnesses\u201d and the witnesses\u2019 grand jury testimony. The Commonwealth denies this claim, and notes that as to Sharigian the defendant received two adopted statements, totalling seventy-two typewritten, single-spaced pages. As to Martel, the defendant received a fifty-four page, single-spaced, typewritten statement. The record substantiates the Commonwealth\u2019s position. See also note 21, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b172-12\"> The defendant makes much of the fact that, as to Stone, the assistant district attorney stated that he had no notes of any interviews conducted prior to Stone\u2019s perjurious testimony before the grand jury. However, the defense was given a copy of Stone\u2019s grand jury testimony. The defense was also given a subsequent statement adopted by Stone wherein Stone stated that in earlier interviews with the assistant district attorney Stone had \u201cstuck to [the] story\u201d which he later gave to the grand jury. During Stone\u2019s testimony at trial, he freely admitted that he had.originally told a different story to investigators and before the grand jury. These \u201cprior inconsistent statements\u201d resulted in Stone\u2019s conviction of perjury, a fact which was fully brought to the attention of the jury by the Commonwealth as well as by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\"> In each case, the judge refused to make a formal ruling, taking the position that he was refusing to compel production of the documents and that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewinski, </em>367 Mass. 889 (1975), did not require a judge to make a formal ruling. He stated to defense counsel that the assistant district attorney \u201cwas very explicit in that you were provided everything he has and I do not think it is required. I will note your exception.\u201d While a formal denial of the defendant\u2019s motion might have been preferable, it is clear from the record that the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion by his \u201crefusal to make an order\u201d compelling the Commonwealth to turn over the materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\"> The record reveals that extensive statements adopted by virtually every principal prosecution witness were turned over to the defendant prior <em>to </em>trial. See, e.g., note 33, <em>supra. </em>Further, in the case of Shiers, the assistant district attorney offered to turn over certain mathematical computations, and figures which he had discussed with Shiers just prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>trial. The assistant district attorney had earlier given to the defense a statement adopted by Shiers and the transcript of a prior inconsistent tape-recorded statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\"> The defendant asserts that \u201cthe Court did make the discovery allowed part of the record, but refused to make the additional testimony requested at trial (and not made available) part of the record.\u201d The page reference to the transcript cited in the defendant\u2019s brief is to a bench conference during which the defendant\u2019s trial counsel requested that copies be made of the statements of witnesses which the Commonwealth had already turned over to the defendant. Defense counsel also requested that these statements be made a part of the record. When the judge and the assistant district attorney pointed out that the statements were already a part of the record, the defendant\u2019s counsel responded that \u201cI had forgotten those were in evidence.\u201d We were unable to find an instance in which the judge denied a request to make the additional materials a part of the record. Apparently, the judge was never asked to make any additional materials a part of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
