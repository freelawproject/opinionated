L. c. 89, \u00a7 1), failing to stop on entering a through way (G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 9), and refusing to stop for a police officer (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 25). Germano signed written waivers of his right to counsel and his right to an initial jury trial. After trial without a jury before a District Court judge, Germano was convicted on all three offenses, receiving fine sentences of $10, $20, and $25, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Germano seeks to appeal these convictions to a trial de nova in a jury of six session. The Commonwealth has moved to dismiss his appeal, arguing that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20F (inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 41), prohibits jury trials of all motor vehicle violations (other than parking violations) punishable neither by imprisonment nor, in the case of a first offense, by a fine greater than $100. The trial judge in the jury of six session reported<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the issues raised by the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We hold that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20F,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does not eliminate Germano\u2019s right to a de nova trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The report raises three questions regarding the correct procedures to be afforded those charged with minor motor vehicle violations under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20F:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u201c1. Is the defendant entitled to a de nova trial by a jury of six after a finding of guilty of a motor vehicle offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>which carries with it no penalty of imprisonment or fine in excess of $100 for a first offense?</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u201c2. What type of proceeding is referred to by the language contained in G. L. c. 90, s. 20F, paragraph 6, which provides: \u2018The decisions of the judge shall then be final, subject to NORMAL APPELLATE REVIEW\u2019?</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u201c3. Is a person charged with a motor vehicle offense which carries with it no penalty of imprisonment or fine in excess of $100 for a first offense entitled to trial by a jury at <em>any stage </em>of the proceedings under G. L., c. 218, s. 26A, or G. L., c. 218, s. 27A(c) ?\u201d (Emphasis furnished in report.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We answer the first, and therefore the third, of these questions affirmatively, and find that decision of the present case does not require an answer to question 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Germano did not avail himself of the option provided by \u00a7 20F of paying the maximum fines provided for his alleged violations, and thus securing a noncriminal disposition of the charges against him. Instead, Germano has chosen to contest the validity of the charges against him by submitting to criminal prosecution. Section 20F provides that in order to institute the criminal prosecution of a contested case, the officer who issued the original citation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> must \u201cmake a complaint\u201d and \u201cfollow the procedure established for criminal cases.\u201d If \u201cthe procedure established for criminal cases\u201d refers to the procedure generally applicable to misdemeanor prosecutions in the District Courts, Germano is entitled to a de nova trial by jury. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18. G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26A.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">However, the Commonwealth contends that \u201cthe procedure established for criminal cases\u201d refers to a unique procedure \u201cestablished\u201d by \u00a7 20F itself. Section 20F makes no explicit reference to such a procedure. The Commonwealth observes, however, that the sixth paragraph<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>provides an appeal procedure from the \u201cfinding and disposition\u201d of a magistrate. Such a magistrate, the Commonwealth argues, must be viewed as the initial trier of fact in <em>all </em>contested proceedings brought under \u00a7 20F. The Commonwealth adds that this appeal procedure leads to a de nova hearing before a judge of a District Court. The statute\u2019s failure to provide for trial by jury before this judge and its specific reference to \u201cdecisions of the judge\u201d are said to exclude implicitly the possibility of trial by jury at this stage of the proceedings. Finally, the fact that the judge\u2019s decisions \u201cshall ... be final\u201d subject only to \u201cnormal appellate review,\u201d is seen as limiting appeals to questions of law, and as therefore precluding an appeal from such decisions to the jury of six session.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">We do not think that the Commonwealth\u2019s reading of \u00a7 20F can survive the Legislature\u2019s plainly expressed desire to preserve the right of those in Germano\u2019s position to obtain a trial by jury. It is the teaching of our cases that \u00a7 20F must be read in the context of the Court Reorganization Act taken \u201cas a whole ... to the end that, as far as possible, the [entire legislative program] will constitute a consistent and harmonious whole.\u201d <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Mansfield, </em>320 Mass. 140, 142 (1946). And the Court Reorganization Act, in addition to creating \u00a7 20F, contains two separate sections specifically guaranteeing a right to trial by jury to criminal defendants in the District Courts. St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7\u00a7 302 &amp; 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The first of these sections provides in part: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a defendant after a finding of guilty, jury-waived, in a district court . . . may appeal therefrom and shall thereafter be entitled to a trial de nova in a jury of six session . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18 (as appearing in St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 302). The Commonwealth argues that this language applies only to cases in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>initial hearing is held before a \u201cjustice\u201d;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6*\u00a7 20F, the Commonwealth maintains, implicitly requires that an initial hearing be held before a magistrate. Such a distinction, however, even if accurately drawn, is insufficiently explicit to overcome our well-established rule that \u201c [exceptions to a general law, whether statutory or constitutional, should be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yee, </em>361 Mass. 533, 537 (1972). See <em>Baker Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 872, 877 (1977). We believe that, had the Legislature been engaged in drawing such a fine line as that suggested by the Commonwealth, it would have been explicit in denying the right to a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Section 188 of the Court Reorganization Act reinforces this conclusion. General Laws c. 218, \u00a7 26A (inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 188) provides, in part, that trial of criminal offenses in the District Courts \u201cshall be by a jury of six, unless the defendant files a written waiver and consent to be tried by the court without a jury,\u201d in which case the defendant retains a right to appeal his conviction to a trial de nova in the jury of six session.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The Commonwealth marshals a highly technical argument to demonstrate that the Legislature intended to place \u00a7 20F proceedings outside the reach of G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26A. The Commonwealth begins by observing that G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26A, provides that both first instance and de nova jury trials must be held in \u201cthose jury sessions designated by [G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A] for the hearing of such appeals.\u201d Section 27A, the Commonwealth adds, does not provide for jury trials in every division of the District Courts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>situation, the Commonwealth continues, contrasts to that created by \u00a7 20F, which provides for the trial of all cases brought thereunder within the District Court division having jurisdiction of the judicial district in which the violation occurred. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20F, first par. The resulting possibility that a defendant prosecuted under \u00a7 20F might find himself in a non jury trial division implies, the Commonwealth concludes, a legislative intent that the broad mandate in favor of trial by jury contained in G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26A, not apply at all to cases within the scope of \u00a7 20F.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Rather than representing an elaborate \u201cloophole,\u201d however, this difference between the two sections of the Court Reorganization Act can be more satisfactorily explained as the type of \u201cgap\u201d we have previously found to be virtually inevitable in any piece of legislation as complex as the court reorganization plan. <em>See Mailhot v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>375 Mass. 342, 345 (1978). And it is, in any event, sufficient to note once again that the Commonwealth\u2019s argument cannot overcome the strong presumption against implied exceptions to statutes of such general applicability as G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26A.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In construing a statute we are also guided by the principle that \u201c [i]t is not to be lightly supposed that radical changes in the law were intended where not plainly expressed.\u201d <em>Ferullo\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 635, 637 (1954). In the context of criminal law it is difficult to imagine a more radical change than elimination of the right to trial by jury. Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 20F, violations now within its scope were processed in a manner indistinguishable from that followed in the case of other misdemeanor offenses within the final jurisdiction of the District Courts. See generally G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 1 (as amended through St. 1975, c. 418), and G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2 (as amended through St. 1968, c. 725). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The right to a trial by jury<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was specifically guaranteed by the then existing version of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18 (as amended through St. 1974, c. 167).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Prior law, however, provided no procedure for securing a noncriminal disposition of those minor motor vehicle offenses now within the scope of \u00a7 20F. The absence of such a procedure contrasted sharply with its availability in the case of parking violations. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20A (as amended through St. 1962, c. 786, \u00a7\u00a7 1-5) and G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20C (as amended through St. 1977, c. 612).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Since 1934, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20A, has allowed those charged with parking violations to pursue one of two options: (1) confess the offense charged and pay a specified fine, thus securing a noncriminal disposition, or (2) contest the charges in a criminal proceeding. St. 1934, c. 368, \u00a7 1. For forty-five years the procedure to be followed under this second option, which is to say the procedure to be followed in all contested cases, has been described in the statute as \u201cthe procedure established for criminal cases.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20A, third par., inserted by St. 1934, c. 368, \u00a7 1, and most recently amended by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 39. Similar language appears in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20C, sixth par., inserted by St. 1962, c. 786, \u00a7 6, and most recently amended by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 40.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Viewed in this light, the critical phrase \u201cprocedure established for criminal cases\u201d as used in \u00a7 20F, must be given the long-standing meaning ascribed to this precise language as it appears in a virtually identical context in the parking violation statutes. \u201c [I]f possible a statute is to be interpreted in harmony with prior enactments to give rise to a consistent body of law.\u201d <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>372 Mass. 46, 51 (1977). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>We have indicated that the procedure to be followed in criminal prosecutions of parking violations is \u201cthe usual criminal procedure.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marder, </em>346 Mass. 408, 410 (1963), appeal dismissed, 377 U.S. 407 (1964). And the Commonwealth concedes that, as used in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 20A and 20C, the \u201cprocedure established for criminal cases\u201d refers to the procedure applicable to misdemeanor prosecutions in general, and thus guarantees the right to trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Moreover, it appears that the Legislature relied heavily on \u00a7 20A in drafting the new \u00a7 20F. The first two and one-half sentences<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the fifth paragraph of \u00a7 20F offer a virtually word-for-word transcription of language in the third paragraph of \u00a7 20A (as it existed at the time of the enactment of \u00a7 20F) specifying the procedure for prosecuting parking violations. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20A (as amended by St. 1962, c. 786, \u00a7\u00a7 1-5). \u201cThe Legislature is presumed to use a term in the sense in which it has been used before in the same context.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercy Hosp., </em>364 Mass. 515, 520 (1974). And, \u201c[wjhere the Legislature uses the same words in several sections which concern the same subject matter [here, minor motor vehicle violations], the words \u2018must be presumed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>have been used with the same meaning in each section.\u201d\u2019 <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 184, 188-189 (1969), quoting from <em>Liddell </em>v. <em>Standard Accident Ins. Co., </em>283 Mass. 340, 346 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">We believe that the Legislature, by the enactment of \u00a7 20F, sought to provide \u201ca sensible, simple, administrative method of making necessary traffic rules effective, without clogging the courts, causing undue public inconvenience and resentment, or depriving any citizen of full opportunity at his option for a judicial determination of facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marder, </em>346 Mass. 408, 411 (1963), appeal dismissed, 377 U.S. 407 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 20F also strongly suggests that \u00a7 20F was enacted in an effort to treat minor motor vehicle infractions in a manner similar to parking violations. The two and one-half sentences in the fifth paragraph of \u00a7 20F apparently borrowed from \u00a7 20A displaced language that in prior drafts of \u00a7 20F would have explicitly provided for a unique, nonjury trial procedure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Thus, we conclude that the Legislature intended to conform the procedure for prosecuting violations under \u00a7 20F to that already in effect for the prosecution of parking violations. Consequently, we hold that Germano is entitled to appeal to a de nova trial by a jury of six. The case is remanded to the jury of six session for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"AsT\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 20F, inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 41, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AbP5\">\u201cNotwithstanding any provisions of the General Laws to the contrary, any police officer who takes cognizance of a violation of chapters eighty-five to ninety D, inclusive, involving the operation of a motor vehicle, other than a violation involving the parking of motor vehicles, where the maximum statutory penalty does not exceed one hundred dollars for the first offense and which does not provide for a penalty of imprisonment, shall forthwith give to the offender a citation, known throughout the commonwealth as a uniform traffic citation.
