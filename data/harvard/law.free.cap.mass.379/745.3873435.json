This is an action for monetary damages based on the use of a photograph of the plaintiff as an illustration to an article appearing in the November, 1976, issue of The Atlantic Monthly magazine, published by The Atlantic Monthly Company. The defendants are the publisher of the magazine and the author of the article. The plaintiff alleges two separate grounds for recovery: (1) that the defendants used her photograph without her consent for advertising or trade purposes in violation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3A; and (2) that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>fendants\u2019 use of this photograph libelled the plaintiff. Both defendants moved in the Superior Court to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). The motions were allowed and judgments were entered for the defendants. We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The magazine ran a story in its November, 1976, issue entitled \u201cAfter the Sexual Revolution\u201d which, from the truncated portion accompanying the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, appears to deal with modern sexual and social mores. There is no suggestion that the plaintiff is personally mentioned, discussed or identified in the magazine article. Rather, she is merely one of several people shown in an otherwise unrelated photograph used to illustrate the article. The plaintiff did not authorize this publication of her photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">1. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants\u2019 use of her photograph was in violation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3A, which provides, inter alla, that \u201c[a]ny person whose name, portrait or picture is used within the commonwealth for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade without his written consent . . . may recover damages for any injuries sustained by reason of such use.\u201d This statute, which was first enacted in 1973, has not previously been construed or applied by the State courts of Massachusetts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Both parties have argued that in interpreting G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3A, this court should be guided by the extensive case law of New York construing the older New York Civil Rights Law \u00a7\u00a7 50-51 (McKinney 1976 &amp; Supp. 1979),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>which contains language identical to the essential language of the Massachusetts statute. \u201cThe text of the [New York] statute appears to proscribe only . . . the appropriation and use in advertising or to promote the sale of goods, of another\u2019s name, portrait or picture without his consent. [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]. . . The New York courts have, however, construed the statute to operate much more broadly. . . . Specifically, it has been held in some circumstances to authorize a remedy against the press and other communications media which publish the names, pictures, or portraits of people without their consent.\u201d <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>385 U.S. 374, 381-382 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">We decline to apply such a broad interpretation to G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3A. The statutory scheme of Massachusetts differs from that of New York. The caption of New York Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50 is \u201cRight of Privacy,\u201d although the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>nowhere appears in the text of the statute itself.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even if it might be said that this wording invited broad construction, it would be inappropriate to follow this route in construing G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3A, because our Legislature has provided a separate statute, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B, with the caption \u201cRight of Privacy,\u201d which reads in pertinent part, \u201cA person shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In order to avoid creating an unwarranted statutory redundancy where none actually exists, we must interpret G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3A, in a way that permits it to perform its intended function without overlapping the function of the Right of Privacy statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">A sharp distinction must therefore be drawn between the interest which is protected by the New York \u201cRight of Privacy\u201d statute and that which is protected by G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3A. In <em>Themo </em>v. <em>New England Newspaper </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>Publishing Co., </em>306 Mass. 54, 57 (1940), this court characterized the right of privacy as a right which \u201cdirectly concerns one\u2019s own peace of mind.\u201d In contrast, the interest which is protected by G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3A, is the interest in not having the commercial value of one\u2019s name, portrait or picture appropriated to the benefit of another. The value of one\u2019s name, portrait or picture is not appropriated \u201cwhen it is published for purposes other than taking advantage of his reputation, prestige, or other value associated with him, for purposes of publicity.\u201d See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652C, Comment d (1977). Thus, the crucial distinction under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3A, must be between situations in which the defendant makes an incidental use of the plaintiff\u2019s name, portrait or picture and those in which the defendant uses the plaintiff\u2019s name, portrait or picture deliberately to exploit its value for advertising or trade purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">An examination of a pair of cases from outside this jurisdiction is helpful in clarifying this distinction as it applies to the case at bar. In <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Maine Times, </em>373 A.2d 1221 (Me. 1977), the defendant newspaper published, without consent, a photograph of the infant plaintiff in conjunction with a book review. The plaintiff contended, inter alla, that the photograph \u201cexploited his likeness and his heritage as a member of the Penobscot Nation or Tribe of Indians.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1222. The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine found that the plaintiff had not alleged a cause of action for the tort of \u201cappropriation of [an]other\u2019s name or likeness\u201d because \u201cthe appropriation must benefit the tortfeasor. . . . It is only when the publicity is given for the purpose of appropriating to the defendant\u2019s benefit the commercial or other values associated with the name or likeness\u201d that this cause of action can exist. \u201cThe fact that the defendant is engaged in the business of publication, for example of a newspaper, out of which he makes or seeks to make a profit, is not enough to make the incidental publication a commercial <em>use </em>of the <em>name </em>or likeness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1224, quoting from Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652C, Comment d (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The Maine court distinguished <em>Pavesich </em>v. <em>New England Life Ins. Co., </em>122 Ga. 190 (1905), \u201ca case where the defendant had caused a newspaper advertisement to be published containing a photograph of the plaintiff who was depicted therein as urging the purchase of life insurance from the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Maine court noted that in <em>Pavesich </em>the advertisement, \u201cby soliciting sales, was of direct pecuniary benefit to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Another instructive case is <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Dell Publishing Co., </em>251 F.2d 447 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 357 U.S. 921 (1958), in which the plaintiffs complained that the defendant magazine damaged them by publishing their picture without permission in connection with the true story of the homicide of a member of the plaintiffs\u2019 family. The court, ruling in favor of the defendant, analyzed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim as follows. \u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 tragedy was published because the publisher thought that the public would be interested in reading about it, and not to advertise, promote or publicize anything else. . . . \u2018[Cjommercial\u2019 uses are those in which an individual\u2019s picture or story has been associated with something else in commercial advertising. Experience has shown that a person of normal sensitivity is likely to find this type of commercialization of his personality very objectionable. At the same time no social interest is jeopardized in curbing such unauthorized advertising practices. Quite different are the cases like this one where a story is recounted solely for the reader interest it may evoke. . . . [Tjhe commercial character of newspapers and magazines is not a significant circumstance in this . . . case. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450-451. The court added that it was likewise unconcerned with whether the article was intended to inform or entertain the reader, refusing \u201cto make a distinction between news for information and news for entertainment in determining the extent to which the publication is privileged.\u201d Id. at 451. See <em>Zacchini </em>v. <em>Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., </em>433 U.S. 562, 578 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Under the foregoing principles it is clear that the instant case is one of incidental use of the plaintiff\u2019s picture and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>an actionable appropriation of that picture for trade or advertising purposes. Here the photograph was published in connection with what is apparently a sociological commentary, and not as a means of soliciting sales or in association with an advertisement of any kind. The article or story involved, whether it be viewed as an effort to inform or entertain the readership, is a legitimate, noncommercial use. The fact that the defendant is engaged in the business of publishing The Atlantic Monthly magazine for profit does not by itself transform the incidental publication of the plaintiff\u2019s picture into an appropriation for advertising or trade purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">2. The plaintiff\u2019s claim of libel must also fail. The test of whether a publication is defamatory is whether, in the circumstances, the writing discredits the plaintiff \u201cin the minds of any considerable and respectable segment in the community.\u201d <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 853 (1975). The publication in question is not defamatory on its face. See <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>New England Newspaper Publishing Co., </em>286 Mass. 258 (1934). The photograph in the instant case merely depicts four well-dressed young women, including the plaintiff, conversing in a group. A young man in the background appears to be clapping his hands and dancing to music. In short, the picture portrays an ordinary party scene at what is apparently a public lounge, club or restaurant. Moreover, the plaintiff has not pleaded any defamatory innuendo. \u201cNo facts are set out which show that in consequence of the circumstances attending their publication the words were intended to convey or would or could be understood to convey a derogatory meaning not on their face.\u201d <em>Colby Haberdashers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bradstreet Co., </em>267 Mass. 166, 170 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Because it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of either of her claims which would entitle her to relief, we affirm the action of the Superior Court in dismissing both counts of the complaint under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6). See <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\"> But see <em>Old Colony Donuts, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Cos., </em>368 F. Supp. 785, 788-789 (D. Mass. 1974), where the Federal District Court denied recovery under this statute for the televising of pictures of the plaintiffs doughnut shop and business name because the television program involved a matter of public interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\">\u201c\u00a7 50. <em>Right of privacy.

It was grounded upon an alleged invasion of a \u2018right of privacy,\u2019 defined by the Court of Appeals to be \u2018the claim that a man has the right to pass through this world, if he wills, without having his picture published . . . or his eccentricities commented upon either in handbills, circulars, catalogues, periodicals or newspapers . . . .\u2019 171 N.Y., at 544. The Court of Appeals traced the theory to the celebrated article of Warren and Brand\u00e9is, entitled The Right to Privacy, published in 1890. 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193. The Court of Appeals, however, denied the existence of such a right at common law but observed that \u2018[t]he legislative body could very well interfere and arbitrarily provide that no one should be permitted for his own selfish purpose to use the picture or the name of another for advertising purposes without his consent.\u2019 171 N.Y., at 545.
