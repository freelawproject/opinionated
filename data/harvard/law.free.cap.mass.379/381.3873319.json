L. c. 93A. The trial judge found and ruled that the \u201cplaintiff had a conventional claim in contract for breach of contract and of implied warranty for a reasonably good and workmanlike performance.\u201d The judge awarded the plaintiff damages for breach of contract but declined to consider her claims under G. L. c. 93A. The plaintiff appealed and we granted her motion for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the plaintiff established a claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, and is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs, but not to multiple damages. Thus, we reverse the judge\u2019s finding and ruling as to waiver<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the claims for costs and attorney\u2019s fees, but affirm his refusal to award multiple damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The plaintiff, coowner of a duplex house, which she had been renting to others from approximately August, 1975, received a complaint from a tenant in August, 1976, as to a leak in the front hallway area. At that time the plaintiff was preparing the other side of the house for new tenant occupancy. The plaintiff decided to have the roof of the duplex dwelling reshingled and she discussed the roofing job with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On August 10, 1976, the defendant and the plaintiff signed a contract. The defendant agreed to reshingle the roof of the entire dwelling \u201cin a workman-like manner according to standard practices\u201d for $1,800. Shortly thereafter the plaintiff joined her husband, who was then stationed in California on military duty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff paid the defendant promptly on being notified that the job was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Although defects in the workmanship became apparent in the fall of 1976, the plaintiff did not complain to the defendant until the spring of 1977 when she returned to Massachusetts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that time the plaintiff notified the defendant of her dissatisfaction with his work. The defendant told the plaintiff that he would make some minor corrections, an offer which the plaintiff refused. The plaintiff and her husband moved into the house in July, 1977. The plaintiff then sent a demand letter pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3), to which the defendant made no written response, and thereafter commenced this lawsuit. After a trial, the plaintiff prevailed on the contract claim, but the judge declined to give the plaintiff any relief pursuant to her G. L. c. 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that it was error for the judge to refuse to consider her claim under G. L. c. 93A. In this contention the plaintiff is clearly correct. As we have previously stated, G. L. c. 93A \u201cis a statute of broad impact which creates new substantive rights and provides new procedural devices for the enforcement of those rights.\u201d <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 693 (1975). Such relief is in addition to, and not an alternative to, traditional tort and contract remedies. <em>York </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>369 Mass. 157, 164 (1975). See <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. 621, 626 (1978). The position adopted by the trial judge was specifically rejected in <em>Slaney. \u201c </em>[Wjhere equity jurisdiction is specifically conferred by statute, it is no objection that the plaintiff also has a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law.\u201d <em>Slaney, supra </em>at 700. Therefore, it was error for the trial judge to refuse relief under c. 93A because it was \u201cunnecessary to secure adequate relief for said plaintiff,\u201d or because the plaintiff would thereby find herself \u201cin a better position than she would have been in had the defendant fulfilled his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>contractual obligations.\u201d Of course, a judge can refuse the requested relief if he or she rules that the plaintiff has not proved a right to relief, but that is a far cry from the action taken by the trial judge in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We turn to the plaintiff\u2019s further argument that the pleadings and the judge\u2019s findings of fact show that she is entitled to relief under G. L. c. 93A, <em>\u00a7 </em>9, as matter of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the applicable version of the statute, relief under c. 93A was open to two classes of people. Section 9 governed private actions by consumers, persons who purchased or leased goods, services or property primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Section 11 provided remedies for those engaged \u201c in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d In order to recover under \u00a7 9 (as then in effect), a party was required to show: first, that he or she purchased or leased goods, services or property, real or personal primarily for personal, family or household purposes; second, that the defendant used or employed an unfair or deceptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>act or practice;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> third, that the complaining party suffered loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result; and fourth, that a proper written demand for relief was sent to prospective defendants at least thirty days prior to filing the complaint. G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), (3), as amended through St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The main issue on which there is a dispute is whether the plaintiff\u2019s contract is one primarily for personal, family or household purposes. If the plaintiff is a personal consumer, she is entitled to relief under \u00a7 9. The plaintiff relies on the pleadings to establish her status as a \u00a7 9 consumer. She claims that the defendant\u2019s answer contains an admission that the contract is a \u201cconsumer contract\u201d and hence she is entitled to multiple damage relief under \u00a7 9. The record does not bear out the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The defendant admitted the contract was a \u201cconsumer contract\u201d for purposes of the breach of implied warranty claim<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but specifically denied the allegations contained in the plaintiff s complaint concerning G. L. c. 93A, with the exception that he admitted receipt of the plaintiff\u2019s demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>letter, to which he made no written response. Rule 8 (e) (2) of Mass. R. Civ. P., 365 Mass. 749 (1974), authorizes a party to \u201cset forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either in one count or defense or in separate counts or defenses\u201d and to \u201cstate as many separate claims or defenses as he has regardless of consistency.\u201d A litigant pleading inconsistent or alternative defenses under rule 8 (e) (2) \u201cdoes not thereby run the risk of being held to have unwittingly pleaded himself into a . . . judgment.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Texaco, Inc., </em>456 F.2d 219, 220 (10th Cir. 1972). Therefore, alternative or inconsistent pleadings may not be used as binding judicial admissions. See <em>Continental Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>439 F.2d 1294, 1298 (5th Cir. 1971). See also <em>Giannone </em>v. <em>United States Steel Corp., </em>238 F.2d 544, 547-548 (3d Cir. 1956). See generally 5 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 1282 and 1283 (1969). Prior practice is to the same effect. \u201c[Fjacts stated in pleading one separate and complete defence cannot be used in determining the issue upon another separate and complete defence.\u201d <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>314 Mass. 67, 69-70 (1943). Accord, <em>Stone &amp; Webster Eng\u2019r Corp. </em>v. <em>First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>345 Mass. 1, 4 (1962); <em>Beacon Motor Car Co. </em>v. <em>Shadman, </em>226 Mass. 570, 578 (1917); 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1064 (2), at 70 (Chadbourn rev. 1972); McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 265, at 634 (2d ed. 1972). Thus the plaintiff may not rely on the \u201cadmission\u201d to an allegation in another count to establish her status as a \u00a7 9 consumer. The defendant\u2019s express denial of the claim under c. 93A, \u00a7 9, required the plaintiff to prove that she purchased goods or services primarily for personal, family or household purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The facts found by the judge show that at the time the contract was signed the plaintiff had received a complaint from one tenant and was preparing the other half of the duplex house for new tenant occupancy. Thereafter, the plaintiff rented the entire dwelling and left for California. The judge ruled that the plaintiff had \u201cnot purchased goods or services primarily for personal, family or household pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>poses within the meaning of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But cf. <em>Lant-ner </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>374 Mass. 606, 607-608 (1978) (c. 93A, \u00a7 9, inapplicable to sale of residence by individual homeowner).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">By the express language found in \u00a7 1 of G. L. c. 93A, a person who rents real property is engaged in \u201ctrade\u201d or \u201ccommerce.\u201d Since the plaintiff was using the entire house as rental property at the time she purchased the defendant\u2019s services, she was acting in a business context and, thus, engaging in \u201ctrade\u201d or \u201ccommerce.\u201d Although the plaintiff was occupying one-half of the duplex house<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> at the time the demand letter was sent as well as at the time of trial, that fact does not make erroneous the judge\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff did not purchase goods or services primarily for personal, family or household purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The judge\u2019s finding, however, that there was a material and substantial breach of warranty provides the plaintiff with ample basis for recovery under \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>c. 93A, \u00a7 2; <em>Slaney v. Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 702 (1975); Attorney General\u2019s Rules and Regulations, 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.08 (2) (1978).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nothing in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint or request for rulings precludes such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Under \u00a7 11 the plaintiff\u2019s damages are limited to actual damages if the breach of warranty is not a wilful or knowing violation of \u00a7 2. Cf. <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. 621, 627-628 (1978). The judge specifically ruled that the defendant\u2019s breach of the contractual warranties was not wilful, intentional, and deliberate, but essentially was due to inexperienced and unsupervised employees. While it is not a defense to a c. 93A claim that the defendant\u2019s conduct was negligent rather than intentional,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> negligence does not give rise to a multiple damages claim under \u00a7 11. The judge\u2019s findings foreclose recovery of multiple damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Although the plaintiff\u2019s motions for attorney\u2019s fees and costs were made pursuant to \u00a7 9 (4), which requires that \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in connection with said action\u201d be awarded any time a violation of \u00a7 2 is found, the motions are also applicable to claims under \u00a711, which contains the same requirements. As to attorney\u2019s fees, the law is quite clear that \u201cwhen attorney\u2019s fees are statutorily authorized legal service organizations are entitled to receive such awards.\u201d <em>Lincoln St. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>374 Mass. 630, 631 (1978). Accord, <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>378 Mass. 758, 763-764 (1979). While the amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee is largely discretionary, the judge on remand should consider the nature of the case and the issues presented, the time and labor required, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>amount of damages involved, the result obtained, the experience, reputation and ability of the attorney, the usual price charged for similar services by other attorneys in the same area, and the amount of awards in similar cases. <em>Id. </em>at 764, and authorities cited therein. Attorney\u2019s fees attributable to this appeal and any proceedings after remand may be included in the award. <em>Id. </em>at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">On the issue of costs, the plaintiff seeks to recover $167.10, the principal component of which is $119.10 for her expert witness, as \u201ccosts incurred in connection with said action.\u201d She was awarded $35.50 in usual costs by the court, pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 23.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The usual rule in Massachusetts is that the litigant must bear his own expenses, <em>Creed </em>v. <em>Apog, </em>377 Mass. 522, 525 (1979). Chapter 93A is a statutory exception to that rule. Although the award of expert witness fees is usually discretionary, <em>George </em>v. <em>Coolidge Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>360 Mass. 635, 640 (1971), we think that reasonable expert witness fees should normally be recoverable in a c. 93A case in order to vindicate the policies of the act. See generally Note, Expert Witness Fees: Protection for the Indigent Party, 48 Nw. U.L. Rev. 106 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The issue, however, is whether actual cost, i.e., the amount which the expert witness has charged the plaintiff, is recoverable or whether some discretion resides in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>judge as to the amount to be paid as costs. Although the word \u201cincurred\u201d as used in a contract has been construed to mean \u201cpersonally obligated to pay,\u201d <em>Lincoln St. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>374 Mass. 630, 632 (1978), where it is the statutory policy to award reasonable costs incurred, the trial judge has discretion to set the amount to be awarded even if the plaintiff is personally obligated to pay the amount billed. Where the award of costs is statutorily authorized, judges are vested with discretion either expressly or by judicial construction in determining the size of the award. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>115 N.H. 99, 101-103 (1975) (construing N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 525: 14-a [1974]). <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Henning, </em>268 A.2d 872, 874-875 (Del. 1970) (construing 10 Del. Code tit. 10, \u00a7 8906 [1974]). <em>Leadville Water Co. </em>v. <em>Parkville Water Dist., </em>164 Colo. 362, 365-367 (1967) (construing Colo. Rev. Stat. 56-6-2 [1963]). <em>State Dep\u2019t of Highways </em>v. <em>Salemi, </em>249 La. 1078, 1083-1084 (1966) (relying on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13.3666 [West 1968]). Of course, consideration should be given to factors such as the time spent by the expert in testimony, the number of appearances, preparation time, the degree of learning and skill possessed by that witness, as well as the assistance such testimony gave to the trier of fact.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utils. Comm\u2019n, </em>195 Colo. 130, 136-137 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The judgment denying all relief under G. L. c. 93A is reversed, and the case is remanded for consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s motions for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\"> The defendant also filed a notice of appeal, but he did not prosecute his appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\"> The judge found and ruled \u201cthat the insertion of a M.G.L.A.
