A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Axy\">Plaintiff appeals from the involuntary dismissal of his suit for personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">Plaintiff, a truck driver, while en route to a destination in Connecticut found the brakes of his employer\u2019s truck to be inoperative. He drove into a nearby gas station and, upon reporting the situation by telephone to his employer, was instructed to leave the truck there and \u201ccome in and we\u2019ll have somebody in the morning fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">On the following morning, January 3, 1964, upon his return to the service station plaintiff found a man working on the truck who told him \u201che was from the Diamond T <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>people\u201d and wore a shirt on which \u201cDiamond T\u201d was written. The man completed his work in about half an hour and then told plaintiff, \u201cEverything is all right,\u201d \u201cEverything is in good shape.\u201d Plaintiff thereupon resumed his journey, but after driving about 20 miles, while leaving the Connecticut Turnpike, he found that the brakes were again inoperative. He was on a downgrade and when he drove onto an embankment to avoid striking a car in front of him, the truck overturned. He sued for his resultant injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The truck plaintiff had been driving had been purchased from and serviced by defendant Diamond T of Hudson County, Inc. up to the time of the accident. One Arthur Agresta, defendant\u2019s general manager, was called as a witness by plaintiff and testified, in effect, that on January 3, 1964 his employer had been notified that a Diamond T truck owned by plaintiff\u2019s employer needed servicing. He identified the bill for $17.56 which was rendered to plaintiff\u2019s employer by defendant for the work on the truck on the day in question. The bill referred to \u201cshop card number 17970,\u201d was dated January 31, 1964, and read as follows: \u201cRoad Service. Man to Bruckner Blvd, Whitestone Bridge. Check brake system. Work done by Manor Truck Repair Bronx N. Y.\u201d Agresta was unable to identify the specific individual who had actually repaired the truck, his explanation being \u201cmy dealing is not with the man who went on the road service; it would be with his employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">On the basis of the foregoing testimony the trial judge granted defendant\u2019s motion for an involuntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The trial judge determined that the evidence was insufficient to justify submission to the jury of the issue of whether or not defendant had contracted to make the repairs. He ruled that \u201cif the brakes were repaired they were repaired by an independent contractor * * * over whom, * * * Diamond T had no control.\u201d We disagree. The motion for dismissal admitted the truth of plaintiff\u2019s evidence and every inference of fact favorable to plaintiff which could be legitimately drawn therefrom. <em>Larocca v. American </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>Chain and Cable Co., </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>1, 5 (1953). Erom the testimony the jury could well have found that plaintiff\u2019s employer had purchased the truck in question from defendant, defendant had customarily serviced the truck, and when the brakes became inoperative on the day in question defendant, through Agresta its manager, was called upon to make the necessary repairs and proceeded to do so, thereafter submitting its bill for services. It could also have found that, in lieu of sending one of defendant\u2019s employees to the Bronx where the truck was, Agresta made an arrangement with Manor to send one of its men to effect the repairs on defendant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The evidence adduced was sufficient to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case as to the existence of defendant\u2019s undertaking to make repairs. In order for defendant to be held liable for defects in the work done, it was not necessary for the workman actually entrusted with the task of making the repairs to be one of its regular employees. Defendant would have been equally liable if it had \u201cborrowed\u201d Manor\u2019s employee for the purpose of doing the work, <em>Restatement 2d, Agency, </em>\u00a7 227, <em>p. </em>500 (1958), or contracted directly with Manor to do the work for it. 24 <em>Am. Jur., Garages, Parlcing Stations, and Liveries, </em>\u00a7 24, <em>pp. </em>491-492 (1939); <em>Russell\u2019s Express, Inc. v. Bray\u2019s Garage, Inc., </em>94 <em>Conn. </em>520, 109 <em>A. </em>722 <em>(Sup. Ct. Err. </em>1920); see Annotation, \u201cLiability of garageman to one ordering repair of motor vehicle, for defective work,\u201d 92 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1408 (1963). It follows that the motion for involuntary dismissal should have been denied. <em>Cf. Zierer v. Daniels, </em>40 <em>N. J. Super. </em>130, 133 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Eeversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
