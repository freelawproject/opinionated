J. 8. A. </em>34:15-13(g). As of the date of her remarriage, there had to be a recomputation of benefits since the number of dependents was reduced from three to two. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:15-13(b). Also, as of said date, the two remaining de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>pendents became entitled to receive the recomputed benefits. To defer the recomputation for a period of 50 weeks, as appellant suggests, until petitioner had received additional compensation benefits equal in amount to the statutory payment due her, would prejudice the two remaining dependents since, during that 50-week period, their share of compensation benefits would be only $20 per week instead of the $39.23 due them under the recomputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
