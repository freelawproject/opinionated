We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The levy was proper under <em>B. B. </em>4:77-12, with particular reference to the (e) section of the rule. The passbook was not negotiable commercial paper, nor negotiable investment securities\u2014-(c) and (d) of the same section.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Appellant argues also that since the passbook was <em>in custodia legis </em>it was not subject to levy. This may be so. However, the savings account itself was not <em>in custodia legis </em>but was a <em>chose in action </em>in which the Yellas had a subsisting interest. It was therefore subject to levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
