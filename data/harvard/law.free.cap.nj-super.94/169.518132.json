J. S. </em>2A:16d-3). Jndge Giuliano sentenced defendant to be committed to the New Jersey State Hospital pursuant to the provisions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">On December 29, 1964 defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to <em>R. R. </em>3 :10A. Judge Giuliano, who also conducted the hearing on this petition, concluded on the basis of the Supreme Court ruling in <em>State v. Wingler, </em>25 <em>N. J. </em>161 (1957), that since defendant was aged 19 at the time of the offense, ho could not be properly sentenced as an adult aggressor in accordance with the provisions of the statute. However, the trial judge ruled that the commitment for specialized treatment was warranted under the provisions of <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:164-5 because it appeared from the totality of the record, including the clinical findings contained in the report of the Diagnostic Center, that defendant\u2019s conduct was characterized by violence in addition to the statutory prerequisite of a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior. Judge Ginliano\u2019s opinion denying the application for post-conviction relief is reported in 87 <em>N. J. Super. </em>571 <em>(Law Div. </em>1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">On this appeal defendant claims that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s conduct was characterized by violence as specified by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">It appears from the report of the Diagnostic Center itself that defendant\u2019s conduct, which consisted of a physical attack upon a seven-year-old boy against his will, was characterized by violence as that term is used in the statute. The trial judge was justified in so determining. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, there need not be a showing that the violence exerted by the defendant was of such a degree that it manifested itself in outrage or fury, resulted in pain or harm to the victim, or left a mark upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>It was also proper for the trial court to consider the record in reviewing the information contained in the Diagnostic Center\u2019s report as to the details of the offense. See Wingler, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The order denying the application for post-conviction relief is affirmed substantially for the reasons set forth in Judge Giuliano\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
