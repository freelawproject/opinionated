A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AgUY\">Plaintiff in an action for false imprisonment obtained a jury verdict for compensatory damages and judgment thereon was entered in the amount of $16,000. Defendant appeals from the judgment and from a denial of its motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">We cannot say from our study of the record that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence or that the trial court erroneously denied the motion, for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">We find no reversible trial errors. In particular, we note that defendant was not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law; <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:170-100 was explained and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>issues of probable cause, apprehension and detention were fairly presented to the jury. Since the jury disallowed punitive damages defendant was not prejudiced by the presentation of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Defendant did not object to the court\u2019s charge with respect to aggravation of a prior blood pressure condition. See <em>B. B. </em>4:52-1; <em>Aiello v. Myzie, </em>88 <em>N. J. Super. </em>187, 193 <em>(App. Div. </em>1965), certification denied 45 <em>N. J. </em>594 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\"> While the amount of the verdict appears to be on the high side, it is not so excessive as to call for judicial intervention. Absent the \u201cinescapable conclusion of mistake, passion, prejudice, or partiality,\u201d we cannot invade the constitutional office of the jury. <em>Wytupeck v. City of Camden, </em>25 <em>N. J. </em>450, 466 (1957); <em>Massotto v. Public Serv. Coordinated Transp., </em>71 <em>N. J. Super. </em>39, 54 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Plaintiff produced two medical experts who testified as to the causal relationship of the episode to her psychiatric condition and the permanent nature thereof. Dr. David Flicker, a neurologist, examined plaintiff on behalf of defendant, but the doctor was not called as a witness; no medical testimony was proffered for the defense. The trial court charged the jury it had the right \u201cto infer that Dr. Flicker was not called as a witness by the defendant because if he was called, his testimony would have been unfavorable to the defendant.\u201d The giving of any charge relating to Dr. Flicker\u2019s nonproduction was objected to before the charge was delivered. We think the circumstances permitted a charge on the subject, but not the one that was given. However, the language used was not objected to at any time. Therefore, the question is whether the instructions constituted plain error. B. <em>B. </em>1:5-3 (c); 2:5.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The charge that was given was objectionable because it permitted the jury to infer (1) defendant deliberately concealed or suppressed Dr. Flicker\u2019s testimony and (2) if called, Dr. Flicker would have testified affirmatively in favor of plaintiff \u2014 \u201cunfavorable to the defendant.\u201d There is nothing in the record that would justify an inference that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>defendant deliberately concealed or suppressed the doctor\u2019s testimony; parties often do not call doctors whose evidence would not be helpful enough to warrant the expense and intrusion upon their professional time. As to the inference that if the doctor had been called he would have testified affirmatively in favor of plaintiff, the most that could have been inferred by reason of his nonproduction was that, if he had been produced, his testimonjr would not have aided defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">As our Supreme Court said in <em>State v. Callahan, </em>76 <em>N. J. L. </em>426, 428 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1908), affirmed 77 <em>N. J. L. </em>685 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1909), the nonproduction of a witness \u201cwill not justify an arbitrary presumption of suppression of evidence.\u201d See also <em>Merrill v. St. Paul City Ry Co., </em>170 <em>Minn. </em>332, 212 <em>N. W. </em>533, 534 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1927); <em>Davis v. Franson, </em>141 <em>Cal. App. 2d </em>263, 296 <em>P. 2d </em>600, 605 <em>(D. Ct. App. </em>1956); <em>Knotts v. Valocchi, </em>2 <em>Ohio App. 2d </em>188, 207 <em>N. E. 2d </em>379, 382 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1963). \u201cThe only inference that may be drawn from failure to produce available witnesses * * * is that * * * the evidence would not have been favorable to the party omitting to produce such witnesses.\u201d 20 <em>Am. Jur., Evidence, </em>\u00a7 187, <em>p. </em>192; and see <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 193, <em>p. </em>195; 29 <em>Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 180, <em>pp. </em>224r-227. ISTote generally, 2 <em>Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. </em>1940), \u00a7\u00a7 285-290; <em>State v. Clawans, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>162, 170-171 (1962); <em>Wild v. Roman, </em>91 <em>N. J. Super. </em>410, 415-416 <em>(App. Div. </em>1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"> Even in charging upon this inference caution should be exercised. <em>Shoenberg v. C. I. R., </em>302 <em>F. 2d </em>416, 420 (8 <em>Cir. </em>1962); <em>Jenkins v. Bierschenk, </em>333 <em>F. 2d </em>421, 425 (8 <em>Cir. </em>1964); <em>Merrill v. St. Paul City Ry Co., supra; Grady v. Collins Transportation Company, </em>341 <em>Mass. </em>502, 170 <em>N. E. 2d </em>725, 729 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1960). See also <em>Wild v. Roman, supra, </em>91 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>415. The court must assess the nonproduction of a witness with a view to the person and testimony involved. <em>Cf. Giardelli v. Public Service Railway Co., </em>8 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>104, 106, 149 <em>A. </em>39, 40 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1930); <em>Robinson v. Equitable Life Assurance Society, </em>126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>N. J. Eq. </em>242, 247 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1939); <em>Pawlowski v. Marino, </em>71 <em>N. J. Super. </em>120, 126 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">We do not think it is proper to assume that normally a psychiatric opinion must support one of two opposite contentions; the opinion may lie somewhere in between, or go off in an entirely different direction. The best that can bo said, in the present circumstances, is that the court, in its discretion, might have indicated to the jury that it could assume the nonprodnction of Dr. Flicker indicated that his testimony would not have specifically contradicted that of plaintiff\u2019s experts, and it would not have materially aided defendant\u2019s case. There was no basis for an assumption that Dr. Flicker\u2019s testimony would have been favorable or unfavorable to anyone. Note, <em>Whitcomb v. Whitcomb, </em>267 <em>S. W. 2d </em>400, 402 <em>(Ky. Ct. App. </em>1954) (handwriting expert); <em>Epstein v. City and County of Denver, </em>133 <em>Colo. </em>104, 293 <em>P. 2d </em>308, 313, 55 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>783 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1956) (real estate appraisers). And see 53 <em>Am. Jur., Trial, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 695, 697, <em>pp. </em>531-532; <em>cf. </em>Annotation, 131 <em>A. L. R. </em>693, 696\u2014 702 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">However, since there was no objection, based upon these grounds, to the language of the charge, the question becomes whether it constituted plain error which substantially affected the defendant\u2019s rights. In <em>Vespe v. DiMarco, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>430, 435-436 (1964), our Supreme Court discussed this problem, and observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\u201c* - * <em>It. R. </em>4:52-1 imposes an obligation on counsel to object to portions of a charge which he considers erroneous. Where there is a failure to comply with the rule appellate tribunals are not disposed to review a challenged instruction. In rare cases, however, where the instruction qualifies as plain error under <em>It. R. </em>1:5\u20143(c), an exception is made. Such error exists when the language employed by the trial judge in guiding the deliberations of the jury constitutes legal impropriety affecting the substantial rights of the party affected of sufficiently grievous nature to justify notice by the reviewing court and to convince the court that, of itself, the error possessed a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result. State <em>v. Corby, </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>106, 108 (1958).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Erom our review of the record, we are not prepared to say that the irLegal impropriety\u201d herein discussed, of itself, possessed a clear capactiy to bring about an unjust result. The verdict was a fair conclusion derivable from the evidence adduced at the trial, and we do not find that the error adversely affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
