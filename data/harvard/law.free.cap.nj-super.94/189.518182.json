A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AyM\">In addition to the dispute as to the allowance of counsel fees hereinafter noted, these consolidated appeals involve the challenge by decedent\u2019s brother, plaintiff Nathan Silverman (Nathan), of the trial court\u2019s ruling sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>taining the validity of the marriage of Prank Silverman (Prank! and Hannah G. Silverman (Hannah) and denying the relief sought by the first count of Nathan\u2019s complaint, the removal of Hannah as administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Nathan does not appeal from the trial court\u2019s adverse determinations on the second and third counts of his complaint seeking respectively the establishment of an alleged lost will of decedent and the enforcement of a trust agreement purportedly entered into between Nathan as beneficiary and the decedent Prank as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Nathan contends that the marriage was invalid by reason of the provisions of <em>L. </em>1939, c. 227, now <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>37:1-10, which abolished common law marriages as of December 31, 1939 and provided that no marriage contracted on and after that date</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201c* * 4 shall be valid unless the contracting parties shall have obtained a marriage license as required by section <em>37 :l-2 </em>of this Title, and unless, also, the marriage, after license duly issued therefor, shall have been performed by or before any person, religious society, institution or organization authorized by section 37:1-13 of this Title to solemnize marriages; and failure in any case to comply with both prerequisites aforesaid, which shall always be construed as mandatory and not merely directory, shall render the purported marriage absolutely void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">It is undisputed that Hannah and Prank obtained a license as directed by <em>B. 8. </em>37 :l-2; the license was issued on January 2, 1963 by the licensing officer of the City of Long Branch. It is also undisputed that Hannah and Prank were married on January 5, 1963 by a person authorized by <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>37:1\u201413 to solemnize marriages, the mayor of Deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Nathan contends, however, that despite this literal compliance with the requirements of <em>B. 8. </em>37:1\u20142 and <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>37:1-13, the marriage is invalid under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>37:1-10 because the license was obtained in Long Branch on the basis of application signed by Prank and Hannah reciting that she was a resident of Long Branch whereas in fact she resided in Wall Township. Nathan argues that as a result, the license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>was not a license \u201cduly issued\u201d as called for by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>37 :1\u201410 since <em>B. S. </em>37 :l-3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cTlie licensing officer shall issue the license which shall be obtained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAn\">a. In the municipality of this state in which the female party to the proposed marriage resides ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJy\">b. In the municipality in which the male party resides, if the female party is a nonresident of this state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI0\">c. In the municipality in which the proposed marriage is to be performed, if both parties are nonresidents of this state,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">and therefore the license should have been obtained in Wall Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling sustaining the validity of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">Preliminarily, we note that since the misrepresentation as to the prospective bride\u2019s residence did not relate to a fact affecting the legality of the proposed marriage, <em>cf. Dacunzo v. Edgye, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>443 (1955) ; see <em>Thompson v. Monteiro, </em>58 <em>N. J. Super. </em>302 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1959), the license issued by the licensing officer of Long Branch may not be collaterally attacked in these proceedings. <em>Cf. Marathon Bus Line v. State Board of Public Utility Com\u2019rs, etc., </em>8 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>379, 150 <em>A. </em>224 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1930); <em>Ironbound Transp. Co. v. Board of Public Utility Com\u2019rs, </em>8 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>896, 152 <em>A. </em>325 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\"> More significantly, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>37:1-10 does not evidence a legislative intent that a misrepresentation of the prospective bride\u2019s residence in the application for a license should have the drastic effect of voiding a marriage which is otherwise valid. It is the general rule that the fact of such misrepresentation and the fact that the license ivas obtained in the wrong municipality does not nullify the marriage solemnized under it unless a statute specifically so provides. Annotation, 61 <em>A. Ij. R. 2d </em>858, 862; 55 <em>G. J. S. Marriage </em>\u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">Nor is such a result called for to accomplish the purposes and objectives of the 1939 act <em>(L. </em>1939, <em>c. </em>227, now <em>N. J. S. A. </em>37:1-10) which abolished common law marriages. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>appears from the statement attached to the bill <em>(Assembly No. </em>10) which was enacted as <em>chapter </em>227 of the <em>Laws of </em>1939,'\u201cthe purposes of this bill [were] two-fold.\u201d First, it would insure that there would be no evasion of the then recently enacted statute <em>(L. </em>1938, c. 126; <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>37:1-20, <em>et seq.) </em>requiring blood tests of persons intending to marry and the filing with the application for a marriage license of a certificate showing that the applicants are not infected with syphilis. Second, it would eliminate \u201cthe many abuses arising from common law marriages and the countless claims of marital relations under this loose form of matrimony\u201d and make \u201cpossible the maintenance of proper records, desirable from the State\u2019s standpoint as well as from either spouse\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Neither purpose\u2014the prevention of marriage of syphilitics or insuring public records of marriage\u2014is defeated or affected by a misrepresentation as to residence or the obtaining of a marriage license in the wrong municipality. Irrespective of where in this State the license is obtained, the requisite medical certificate must accompany the application; the marriage license <em>(N. J. 8. A. </em>37:1\u20147) and the certificate of marriage <em>(B. 8. </em>37:1-17) on the reverse side thereof must be written on blank forms prepared by the State Department of Health and supplied by it to the local licensing officers <em>(N. J. 8. A. </em>26:8\u201447); and once the marriage is performed, the certificate of marriage and marriage license are to be transmitted to the ultimate repository, the State Registrar of Yital Statistics <em>(N. J. 8. A. </em>26:8-43), who is required to index them alphabetically and record them <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>26:8-44).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The only other issues presented here involve the trial court\u2019s allowance to Nathan\u2019s counsel of a fee of $1,250 and $35 costs to be paid out of the estate. The administratrix appeals, contending that no counsel fees should have been awarded to Nathan; he cross-appeals, asserting that the allowance was inadequate and that the court erred in ruling that counsel fees may be awarded him only as to the first count of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>R. R. </em>4:55-7(b) does not authorize an allowance to Nathan of counsel fees out of the estate for services rendered in prosecuting the third count of the complaint, a suit by plaintiff to advance his own interest as beneficiary of an alleged trust. <em>Sunset Beach Amusement Corp. v. Belk, </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>162, 169 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"> The power to make an allowance out of the estate does exist with respect to an action seeking to establish a lost will such as is pleaded in the second count, since if plaintiff were successful, the services of his attorneys would redound to the benefit of others in addition to plaintiff, those named as beneficiaries in the will. <em>Sunset Beach Amusement Corp. v. Belk, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>168; 7 <em>N. J. Practice (Clapp, Wills &amp; Administration) (3d ed. </em>1962), \u00a7 1545; <em>cf. R. R. </em>4:55-7(e). However, in view of the trial court\u2019s opinion indicating an obvious lack of merit in the second count, an allowance of counsel fees for services rendered with respect thereto would not be warranted. <em>Cf. Ferguson v. Rippel, </em>23 <em>N. J. Super. </em>132, 142 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); <em>In re Lenart's Estate, </em>125 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>129 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\"> The trial court had the power to make an allowance for services rendered by Nathan\u2019s counsel with respect to the first count. Wo find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision as to the amount to be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
