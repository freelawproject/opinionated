McCLANAHAN.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Wetlands America Trust, Inc. (\"WAT\") holds a conservation easement on property in Loudoun County owned by White Cloud Nine Ventures, L.P. (\"White Cloud\"). On appeal, WAT contends the circuit court erred in rejecting claims in its declaratory judgment action that White Cloud's construction activities on the property and intended commercial uses for its newly-constructed facility violate the easement. We affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   WAT is a non-profit organization that holds conservation easements across the country and provides fiduciary support to Ducks Unlimited, a non-profit wetlands and waterfowl conservation organization. In 2001, Caeli Farms, LLC, which owned a farm in Loudoun County consisting of approximately 400 acres, gave WAT a \"Deed of Gift of Conservation Easement\" (the \"Easement\") covering this property. Caeli Farms, LLC subsequently subdivided the farm into two tracts of approximately equal size and sold one of the tracts to White Cloud (the \"Caeli property\") in 2008. At that time, White Cloud already owned adjacent property leased to Chrysalis Vineyards, LLC (\"Chrysalis\") consisting of approximately 50 acres on which Chrysalis was operating a vineyard and winery (the \"Chrysalis property\"). The same individual, Jennifer McCloud, was then and has continued to be the general partner of White Cloud and the managing and only member of Chrysalis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   White Cloud purchased the Caeli property with the intention of leasing it to Chrysalis to use for expanding the Chrysalis vineyard, grazing milk cows to be milked on the Chrysalis property, and raising wheat. White Cloud further planned to construct a building on the Caeli property in which Chrysalis would operate a creamery and bakery, using the milk and wheat derived from the Caeli property. The building would also be used to store barrels of aging wine made from grapes grown on both the Caeli and Chrysalis properties. In addition, the building would include a tasting room and would be open to the general public for the sampling and sale of the Chrysalis wine and the Chrysalis cheese and bakery products produced on site. Acting on these plans, White Cloud commenced construction of the building on the Caeli property, along with an adjoining parking lot, a new road leading to the parking lot, and a new bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   WAT filed the present action in the Loudoun County Circuit Court seeking a declaratory judgment that White Cloud's construction activities and intended commercial use of the new facility on the Caeli property violated the Easement's restrictive covenants. WAT further requested an order enjoining White Cloud from continuing its construction activities and requiring it to restore the Caeli property to its pre-construction condition. In its answer, White Cloud denied violating the Easement and asserted as affirmative defenses, inter alia, that the Easement was unenforceable because it was impermissibly vague and ambiguous, and that WAT's claims were barred by estoppel and laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During a five-day bench trial, WAT sought to establish that White Cloud had committed 14 separate violations of the Easement. The evidence at trial included expert testimony from both sides on issues pertaining to a number of the alleged violations. One such\n   issue, as relevant to this appeal, pertained to the impact of White Cloud's subject activities on the Caeli property's habitat for which the parties offered the testimony of competing experts in the field of biology. Another such issue involved the erodibility of the soil at the construction site for the new building and parking area for which the parties offered the testimony of competing experts in the field of soil science.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After taking evidence and analyzing the terms of the Easement, the trial court issued a 30-page letter opinion setting forth rulings in White Cloud's favor, with narrow exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a motion for reconsideration, WAT argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in construing the Easement by applying the common law principle that restrictive covenants are to be strictly construed in favor of the free use of land.\n   <em>\n    See Waynesboro Village, LLC v. BMC Props.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"513110\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/255/75/#p80\">\n    255 Va. 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 80,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=496%20S.E.2d%2064\">\n    496 S.E.2d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67-68 (1998)(reciting principle and cited in trial court's letter opinion). The trial court denied WAT's motion and entered a final order incorporating the findings and conclusions in its letter opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, WAT asserts in its assignments of error that the trial court erred by: (1) applying the common law strict construction principle for restrictive covenants to a conservation easement; (2) ruling that the term \"farm building\" in Section 3.3(A)(iv) of the Easement was ambiguous and that White Cloud's disputed building was a permitted farm building under the Easement; (3) ruling that the prohibition under Section 3.3(C)(vi) of the Easement against constructing a building on a \"highly erodible area\" was ambiguous and that the erodibility was to be tested after the construction site had been graded; (4) ruling that the alteration of the topography for the parking lot was \"required\" and did not require WAT's permission under Section 3.6; (5) ruling that the stated purposes of the Easement set forth in Section 1.1 in regard to retaining the predominant condition of the property and preventing significant impairment of the Easement's conservation values were ambiguous and misapplying these stated purposes; and (6) refusing to consider WAT's claim that White Cloud's construction of the new bridge violated the Easement because WAT did not allege the claim in its complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.

Furthermore, the common law strict construction principle applied to restrictive covenants is exactly that-a contract construction principle.

Section 3.3(A)(iv) states: \"No permanent or temporary building or structure shall be built or maintained on the entirety of the Protected Property other than ... farm buildings or structures....\" Neither the term \"farm buildings\" nor the term \"farm structures\" is defined by the Easement. Section 3.3(D), however, refers to the structures listed in Section 3.3(A), including farm buildings, as \"agricultural buildings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Virginia's Uniform Statewide Building Code defines the term \"[f]arm building or structure,\" in relevant part, as \"a building or structure ... located on property where farming operations take place, and used primarily for any of the following uses or combination thereof: 1. Storage, handling, production, display, sampling or sale of agricultural, horticultural, floricultural or silvicultural products produced in the farm; 2. Sheltering, raising, handling, processing or sale of agricultural animals or agricultural animal products....\" Code \u00a7 36-97. This statutory definition is not binding in this case; but that is also true of dictionary definitions, which courts often consult in cases such as this one. We simply regard both to be appropriate sources for consideration in determining the proper meaning of \"farm building,\" or its synonym \"agricultural building,\" in the context of the Easement as a whole, where these terms are undefined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Webster's Third New International Dictionary does not define \"farm building\" or \"agricultural building,\" but does provide the following related definitions which are instructive. The word \"farm\" is defined as \"any tract of land whether consisting of one or more parcels devoted to agricultural purposes generally under the management of a tenant or the owner.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 824 (1993). \"Agricultural\" is defined as \"of, relating to, or used in agriculture.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. \"Agriculture\" is then defined as \"the science or art of the production of plants and animals useful to man and in varying degrees the preparation of these products for man's use and their disposal (as by marketing).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   With the incorporation of production, preparation and marketing as components of agricultural activities, these dictionary definitions are consistent with the above-stated definition of \"farm building\" under Code \u00a7 36-97, all of which support the inclusion of these components in our construction of the term\n   \"farm building\" in Section 3.3(A)(iv) of the Easement. We also find strong support for such interpretation in Section 3.1 of the Easement, which expressly authorizes \"[i]ndustrial\" and \"commercial\" agricultural activities. This can only reasonably mean that the farm/agricultural buildings permitted under Section 3.3(A)(iv) may be used for agricultural activities that are commercial and/or industrial in nature. Notably, WAT simply ignores these authorized activities under the Easement in advocating its own restrictive construction of the term \"farm building.\" Section 4.1 of the Easement also supports our construction of the term \"farm building\" in providing that \"changes in agricultural technologies, including accepted farm and forestry management practices may result in an evolution of agricultural activities on the Protected Property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We thus conclude that White Cloud's intended use for its new building on the Caeli property falls within the range of activities qualifying as a \"farm building\" under Section 3(A)(iv). It would be unreasonable to conclude otherwise. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that the building can be used to store and sell wine derived from grapes grown, at least in part, on the Caeli property; to process and sell cheese made from milk derived from cows that graze on the Caeli property; to make and sell bakery products from wheat grown on the Caeli property; and to market these products to the general public directly from the building, including space dedicated for customers to sample the products on site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   D. \"Highly Erodible Areas\" under Section 3.3(C)(vi)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   WAT next argues that the trial court erred by ruling that the prohibition under Section 3.3(C)(vi) of the Easement against constructing a building on \"highly erodible areas\" was ambiguous and that, under the trial court's interpretation of the Easement, the erodibility was to be tested after the construction site for the new building had been graded. The trial court so interpreted the Easement after \"reconcil[ing]\" Section 3.3(C)(vi) with Section 3.6, which addresses White Cloud's right to grade on the Caeli property. Specifically, Section 3.3(C)(vi) states: \"No building or structure of any nature may be constructed on the Protected Property ... on any highly erodible areas as identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture....\" Section 3.6, on the other hand, states in relevant part: \"Grading, blasting or earth removal shall not materially alter the topography of the Protected Property except ... as required in the construction of permitted buildings, as per Section 3.3....\" Having interpreted these provisions as making post-grading the time for testing the site's erodibility, the trial court ruled that WAT failed to prove White Cloud violated Section 3.3(C)(vi) because WAT presented no evidence concerning the site's erodibility after it was graded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We must give effect to every provision of the Easement, if possible, \"so as to make it harmonious and sensible as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Hinton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201518\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/209/544/#p545\">\n    209 Va. at 545-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20S.E.2d%20386\">\n    165 S.E.2d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Under Section 3.6, White Cloud, as the landowner, has the express right to grade, blast and remove soil for the construction of permitted buildings. This right must be sensibly harmonized with the limitation in Section 3.3(C)(vi) that no building may be \"constructed\" on what are determined to be \"highly erodible areas as identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\" (\"USDA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is reasonable to assume that the parties to the Easement, in choosing the Section 3.3(C)(vi) language, were aware of the essential purpose of the USDA mapping of highly erodible croplands. The mapping was performed pursuant to the USDA's authority under various provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203801\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1through 12.13and \u00a7\u00a7 12.20through 12.33. This statutory and regulatory scheme provides measures and establishes programs designed to address the widespread problem of soil erosion on croplands across the country, which is primarily the result of the impact of wind and rain on farm fields cultivated for growing crops.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R.Rep. No. 99-271, at 77-91(1985). Accordingly, the USDA mapping is not concerned with, and thus does not identify, the soil erodibility level of any specific site such\n   as a construction site, as the trial court found in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The parties to the Easement nevertheless incorporated this USDA mapping scheme into the terms of the Easement at Section 3.3(C)(vi) out of what was, no doubt, a desire to protect the Caeli property from significant soil erosion that might be caused by the construction of permitted buildings. At the same time, however, those same parties also authorized the landowner to grade, blast and remove soil for the construction of permitted buildings under Section 3.6. We thus believe it is only reasonable to conclude, as did the trial court in reconciling these provisions, that if the site for constructing a permitted building is not highly erodible after the grading for the site has been done, there is no violation of Section 3.3(C)(vi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As to the evidence presented on this issue, there was no dispute that USDA mapping identified the Caeli property as containing highly erodible soil. In addition, WAT's expert witness provided detailed information regarding the criteria and calculations for determining soil erodibility under the USDA regulations. However, WAT's expert had never been to the Caeli property and had no information on the soil erodibility of the construction site for the new building after the site had been graded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor did any other witness provide this information. In the absence of any such evidence, the trial court correctly ruled that WAT failed to meet its burden of establishing a violation of Section 3.3(C)(vi) of the Easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   E. Alteration of Topography for Parking Area under Section 3.6\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We continue with our review of Section 3.6 of the Easement in addressing WAT's additional argument that the trial court erred in ruling that this provision was not violated by the grading done for White Cloud's parking area adjacent to the new building. This interpretation and application of Section 3.6 is sensible and correct. It would be completely incongruous and unreasonable to conclude that White Cloud has the authority under the Easement to grade the site for the new building and construct it as a \"farm building\" as that term is interpreted above-which includes the right to allow the general public to visit the building to sample and purchase products on site-and yet hold that White Cloud has no right under Section 3.6 to \"alter the topography\" by grading the site for an adjoining parking area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   WAT also challenges the trial court's rejection of its argument that White Cloud was required under Section 3.12 of the Easement to receive WAT's prior written approval before doing the grading for the parking area. Section 3.12, which is entitled \"Water Resources,\" states in relevant part that \"[t]he Grantor reserves the right to grade, move earth and otherwise alter the topography of the Protected Property, with the prior written approval of Grantee, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld for dam construction and the creation of private ponds, lakes, and/or wetland areas. Such activity shall not impair the conservation values or the Purpose of the Easement.\" We agree with the trial court that this provision does not apply to grading related to permitted buildings, but rather is limited in very specific terms to the permission required for the construction of dams, ponds, lakes and wetland areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   F. Stated Purposes of the Easement under Section 1.1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We now consider WAT's challenge to the trial court's interpretation and application of the Easement's principal restrictions set forth in Section 1.1 in the context of the Easement's expressly stated purpose: \"It is the purpose of this Easement to assure that the Protected Property will be retained\n   <em>\n    in perpetuity\n   </em>\n   predominantly in its natural, scenic, and open condition, as evidenced by the [Baseline Document] Report [BDR], for conservation\n   purposes as well as permitted agricultural pursuits, and to prevent any use of the Protected Property which will impair significantly or interfere with the conservation values of the Protected Property, its wildlife habitat, natural resources or associated ecosystem.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   WAT argues that, even if the individual provisions of the Easement addressed above in Parts II.C., D. and E. have not been violated, the trial court erred in ruling that (a) White Cloud, in the construction and use of its new facilities, has retained the Caeli property in predominantly the condition required by Section 1.1, as construed in the context of the Easement as a whole; and (b) White Cloud has not thereby significantly impaired or interfered with the Easement's \"conservation values\" or the property's environment, as prohibited in Section 1.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, WAT relies on the BDR to make its argument that White Cloud has not retained the property in the condition required under Section 1.1. The BDR was a report prepared by an ecologist on the status of the Caeli property in 2001. The parties to the Easement retained the ecologist to prepare the report concurrently with the drafting and execution of the Easement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The BDR consists of a description of the property, its current and previous uses, and its ecological character. The property's overall use as of 2001 was described therein as \"consist[ing] of a mixture of agricultural (row crop production and cattle pastures), actively managed wildlife habitat areas, and mature deciduous hardwood forest.\" The \"management\" of the property as of that time was then described as \"directed at responsible, low-impact agriculture and promotion of wildlife habitat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   WAT contends that Section 1.1 unambiguously requires that the property be retained\n   <em>\n    in perpetuity\n   </em>\n   in the condition identified in the BDR. \"So if you come back to that property a hundred years from now,\" according to WAT, \"it should look almost exactly like it looked in 2001 ... as evidenced by the [BDR].\" Thus, WAT asserts, \"it cannot possibly be concluded that White Cloud's extensive facilities and activities 'retain' the [p]roperty in the condition identified in the BDR.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Section 1.1 indeed makes plain that the BDR is to serve as a baseline for assessing whether the property is being predominately retained for \"conservation purposes as well as permitted agricultural pursuits.\" While the Easement does not define the term \"conservation purposes,\" it does, however, set forth a number of significant \"permitted agricultural pursuits.\" As already addressed above in our analysis of the meaning of \"farm building\" under Section 3.3(A)(iv), the land owner's permitted agricultural pursuits on the property include, among others, the construction of new farm buildings used for not only commercial agricultural activities, but even industrial agricultural activities, which were clearly not activities conducted on the property in 2001. So while there may be inherent tension between the \"conservation purposes\" and the expressly \"permitted agricultural pursuits,\" the Easement specifically demands retention of the property \"for conservation purposes\n   <em>\n    as well as\n   </em>\n   permitted agricultural pursuits,\" and therefore the character of the property is in no way frozen\n   <em>\n    in perpetuity\n   </em>\n   \"almost as it looked in 2001.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the trial court did not err in ruling that, \"under the Easement, White Cloud was not required to retain its property in the condition established by the [BDR] to the extent it has engaged in permitted uses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, WAT argues that White Cloud's construction and use of its new facilities significantly impair or interfere with the Easement's \"conservation values\" and/or the property's environment, as prohibited under Section 1.1. It is the \"total impact of White Cloud's activities,\" WAT contends, that has resulted in the violation of this restriction. Thus, WAT asserts, the trial court erred in denying this additional claim of an alleged violation of Section 1.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In rejecting this claim, the trial court stated in its letter opinion that it could not find \"based on the evidence presented ... that [White Cloud's] facilities and their uses are inconsistent with and significantly impair and interfere with the conservation values of the Easement and the wildlife habitat, natural resources, and associated ecosystems on the property\" under Section 1.1. Initially, the trial court heard the testimony of Scott Yaich, a director of conservation planning and policy with Ducks Unlimited, who qualified as an expert witness for WAT in the field of wildlife habitat ecology and biology. Yaich testified that, based on his evaluation, White Cloud's construction activities on the Caeli property and projected plans would have a significant adverse impact to the property's wildlife resources. However, the trial court subsequently heard the testimony of White Cloud's expert witnesses, James Edward Irre and Avinash Sareen, who similarly qualified as experts in the field of biology. The trial court summarized these witnesses' testimony as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   White Cloud offered Mr. Irre, a biologist, and he opined that there was no significant impact of the utility crossing, culvert, or road crossing. White Cloud also offered Mr. Sareen, a biologist, who opined that there were marginal effects from the improvements and that only a small percentage of the property was impacted. He noted that the land had already been altered by the agricultural and man-made wetlands and roads and that overall there was a de minimis effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The conflicting testimony among these three experts created a question of fact. As the trier of fact, the trial court was charged with determining the credibility of these witnesses and the weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See Johnson v.

We reviewed the history of negative easements in gross and noted that the common law restrictions on easements in gross were abrogated \"long ago.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632983\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/442/#p447\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We further observed that the significance of the 1962 amendment to\n   Code \u00a7 55-6adding \"easements in gross\" to those property interests that could be transferred by deed or will was \"manifest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632983\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/442/#p447\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, while the VCEA comprehensively addressed the conservation easements of the type at issue here, legislation abrogating the use of negative restrictive easements in gross for conservation purposes was enacted long before the VCEA was adopted in 1988.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Contrary to the majority's conclusion, the common law principle of strict construction in favor of free use of land no longer applies to conservation easements. The strict construction principle was applied under the common law because easements in gross, including negative easements in gross, were disfavored as a matter of public policy. Today, and for at least the last four decades, Virginia public policy strongly favors the conservation of land and open spaces. Since 1971, the Constitution of Virginia has provided in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [I]t shall be the Commonwealth's policy to protect its atmosphere, lands, and waters from pollution, impairment, or destruction, for the benefit, enjoyment, and general welfare of the people of the Commonwealth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   In the furtherance of such policy, the General Assembly may undertake the conservation, development, or utilization of lands or natural resources of the Commonwealth, ... and the protection of its atmosphere, lands, and waters from pollution, impairment, or destruction, by ... leases or other contracts with ... private persons or corporations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Va. Const. art. XI, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. To further the public policy in favor of conservation, the General Assembly in 1988 adopted the VCEA, Code \u00a7\u00a7 10.1-1009through -1016, in accord with policies in place since 1966 under the Open-Space Land Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 10.1-1700through -1705.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Blackman,\n   </em>\n   \"[t]hese statutes evince a strong public policy in favor of land conservation.\" 270 Va. at 79,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632983\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/442/#p447\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Any ambiguities in a conservation easement, including the easement at issue in this case, should be construed to give effect to the intention of the parties, to give effect to the circumstances surrounding the creation of the easement, to carry out the policy in favor of the conservation of land, and to resolve ambiguities in favor of the grantee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In summary, for the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion and conclude that the trial court applied the incorrect standard in interpreting the conservation easement.
