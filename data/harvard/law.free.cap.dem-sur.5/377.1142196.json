He interposed a demurrer. His demurrer was overruled and an interlocutory judgment was entered against him on May 29th, 1886. That judgment granted him leave to withdraw his demurrer and to answer within twenty days, on payment of costs. It directed that in case he should fail to comply with its provisions final judgment should be entered against him, in favor of the plaintiffs, to recover the sum of ^1,500, with interest and costs. Before the expiration of the twenty days, and on the 9th day of June, 1886, Mr. Clark died. Final judgment was, nevertheless, entered against him on June 19th, 1886, pursuant to the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>visions of \u00a7\u00a7 763 and 1021 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The judgment creditors seek, by this present proceeding, to obtain a decree directing the respondent, who is the executrix of the judgment debtor\u2019s estate, to pay the amount of their judgment. The respondent\u2019s answer shows that, unless the claim of these petitioners is entitled to preference over specialty and simple contract debts, no direction for its satisfaction can now be made without imperiling the rights of other creditors entitled to equality of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The order of priority which the representative of an estate must observe in the payment of debts is prescribed by \u00a7 27, tit. 3, ch. 6, part 2, R. S. (3 Banks, 7th ed., 2298). It is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\"><em>\u201cFirst. </em>Debts entitled to a preference under the laws of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\"><em>Second. </em>Taxes assessed upon the estate of the deceased previous to his death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\"><em>Third. </em>Judgments docketed and decrees enrolled <em>against the deceased, </em>according to the priority thereof respectively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">It is judgments \u201cagainst the deceased,\u201d it will be observed, and not judgments \u201cagainst the executor or administrator of the deceased,\u201d that are thus preferred above recognizances, bonds, notes, etc., which make up class <em>fourth. </em>It is indeed expressly declared in the next succeeding section (\u00a7 28) that the obtaining a judgment against a decedent\u2019s executor or administrator upon a debt to the decedent shall not \u201c entitle such debt to any preference over others of the same class.\u201d But it is provided by \u00a7 763 <em>(supra) </em>that \u201cif either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>party to an action dies after an accepted offer to allow judgment to be taken, or after a verdict, report or decision, <em>or an interlocutory judgment, </em>but before final judgment is entered, the court must enter final judgment <em>in the names of the original </em>parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Of such a character was the final judgment whose payment is now sought, following as it- did an interlocutory judgment within the meaning of \u00a7 1021 <em>(supra), </em>which declares that the decision of the court upon the trial of a demurrer must direct the final or interlocutory judgment to be entered thereupon. Where it directs an interlocutory judgment with leave to the party in fault to plead anew or amend . . . . it may also direct that final judgment be entered if the party in fault fails to comply with any of the directions given or terms imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Section 1210 provides that \u201c where a judgment for a sum of money or directing the payment of money is entered against a party after his death .... a memorandum of the party\u2019s death must be entered with the judgment in the judgment book,\u201d etc. \u201c Such a judgment \u201d the section proceeds to say does not become a lien upon the real property or chattels real of the decedent, <em>but it establishes a debt to be paid in the course of </em>administration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Section 763 <em>(supra) </em>is founded upon sec. <em>4, </em>tit. 1, ch. 7, part 3, R. S. (3 Banks, 5th ed., 669), which declares that \u201c after a verdict shall be rendered in any action, and after a plea of confession in a suit brought, if either party die before judgment be actually entered thereon, the court may, within two terms after such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>verdict or plea, enter final judgment in the names of the original parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Section 1210 <em>(supra) </em>is a substantial re-enactment of \u00a7 7, tit. 4, ch. 6. part 3, B. S. (3 Banks, 6th ed., 638). The concluding paragraph of the latter section is almost literally the same as the concluding paragraph of \u00a7 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In Nichols v. Chapman (9 <em>Wend., </em>452, 456) it was held that a judgment entered after the death of the party against whom it had been obtained, was entitled to priority of payment over simple contract debts, being a judgment by relation against the deceased in his lifetime (see also Salter v. Neaville, 1 <em>Bradf., </em>488; Barnes v. Weisser, 2 <em>Bradf., </em>212; Mills v. Jones, 2 <em>Rich. S. C. Law, </em>393).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">I am referred by the respondent\u2019s counsel to Matter of Clark (15 <em>Abb. Pr., 227), </em>which contains an intimation of Clerke, J., at variance with the doctrine of the foregoing cases, but the intimation is <em>obiter </em>and is made without argument or citation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In Burnet v. Holden (1 <em>Lev., </em>277) judgment upon a verdict in <em>assumpsit </em>had been obtained after the defendant\u2019s death and before the day in <em>banc. </em>The plaintiff brought <em>scire facias </em>against the defendant\u2019s executor. The executor pleaded a debt due to himself, and insisted that, by right of his executorship, he could lawfully apply the assets of the estate to the satisfaction of his own claim, in preference to the claim of the plaintiff which had not been pressed to final judgment in the defendant\u2019s lifetime. Judgment was given for the plaintiff. The doctrine of the case just cited was upheld in Colebeck v. Peck (2 <em>Ld. Raym., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>1280), and in Saunders v. McGowran (12 <em>M. &amp; W., </em>221).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In Ainslie v. Radcliff (7 <em>Paige, </em>489), Chancellor Walworth declared that the direction usually contained in decrees for the distribution of a decedent\u2019s personal assets among his <em>creditors\u2014i. e., \u201c </em>to pay the debts in due course of administration \u201d\u2014was a direction, <em>not </em>to disregard legal priorities, but rather to respect them, and to satisfy the debts accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">I have no hesitation in holding that the judgment here in question, if it has been duly docketed as the statute directs, has precisely the same force and effect that it could claim if this decedent had died on the day after its entry.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
