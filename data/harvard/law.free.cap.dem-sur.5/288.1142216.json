D. G.

Moderno, <em>deceased.</em></parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b308-6\">Under L. 1860, ch. 360, declaring that no person leaving a husband, wife, child or parent shall devise or bequeath to any benevolent, etc., society more than one half of his estate, after the payment of debts, the value of the whole estate owned by a testator at the time of his death is to be reckoned, including property of which the will expressly states that it omits to dispose.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b308-7\">As to whether a Surrogate\u2019s court has authority to direct an executor to expend funds of his decedent\u2019s estate, to discover facts, the disclosure whereof is necessary to enable the court to construe the will as prescribed in Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 <em>2624\u2014qucere.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-8\">Construction of will upon application for probate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-9\">D.

Before the court can determine whether the bequest to the societies in question is to any extent invalid, the value of the whole estate owned by the testator at his death must be ascertained, and the nature of the testamentary disposition of the real property in Madeira. The court must also be advised as to the value of the trust provision for the widow\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>I can give no direction respecting the costs of making the suggested presentation of facts. I doubt my authority to direct the executor to expend moneys in this regard; and, even if the authority were beyond dispute, it would not be proper under the circumstances disclosed by the papers before me to require the representative of the estate, at the petitioner\u2019s instance, to incur expenses which events may possibly prove to be justly chargeable to the petitioner herself.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
