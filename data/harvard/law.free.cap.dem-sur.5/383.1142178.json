D. G. ROLLINS, Surrogate.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AU9\">March, 1887.</decisiondate>\n<parties data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"parties\" id=\"b403-7\">Matter of Eisner. <em>In the matter of the estate of </em>Eliza Eisner, deceased.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b403-9\">A Surrogate\u2019s court has the same authority to determine a disputed claim by or against the accounting party, upon the settlement o\u00ed the account of a temporary administrator, as upon that of an executor or administrator in chief.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b403-10\">This includes the competency to adjudicate upon a claim of a debt alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>to be due to the estate of the decedent, from the temporary administrator, <em>and others jointly.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b404-4\">A temporary administrator appointed, trader Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 266S, subd. 1, \u201cwhere delay necessarily occurs in the granting of letters testamentary,\u201d etc., goes out of office, of course, upon the issuance of permanent letters, but his official bond is not <em>ipso facto functus officio.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">Pending a controversy over the probate of this decedent\u2019s will, one of her sons was appointed temporary administrator of her estate. Upon this accounting, after the will had been admitted to probate and letters testamentary had been issued to its executors (one of whom was the temporary administrator himself), the contestants sought to introduce before the referee to whom the issues of the accounting had been .submitted, certain testimony tending to show that a firm whereof the temporary administrator was a member was indebted for rents due upon property of the estate which such firm occupied under a lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">It appeared that the firm admitted its liability in a certain sum, but that the objectors to the account insisted that it was liable in a larger sum. The referee held that the Surrogate had no jurisdiction to determine the question of the firm\u2019s indebtedness. Motion was now made to confirm the referee\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-7\">George W. Care, <em>for administrator.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-8\">Benno Loewy, <em>and </em>Geo. P. Avery, <em>for objectors.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-9\">S. Oppenhbim, <em>special guardian.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b404-10\">The Surrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"Azp\">Section 2739 of the Code provides that whenever, upon the judicial settlement of the account of an <em>executor or administrator, u </em>a contest arises between the accounting party and any of the other parties . . . respecting a debt alleged to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>due by the accounting party to the decedent or by the decedent to the accounting party, the contest must be tried and determined in \"the same manner as any other issue arising in the Surrogate\u2019s court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">This section applies, I think, to temporary administrators as well as to executors and administrators in chief. Article 2d., tit. 4, chap. 18 of the Code of Civil Procedure contains the only statutory provisions regulative of executors\u2019 and administrators\u2019 accountings, and unless those provisions are broad enough to cover accountings of temporary administrators, there is a <em>casus omissus </em>in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Section 2724 provides the procedure for the compulsory accounting of an <em>\u201c </em>executor or administrator.\u201d Section 2725 declares that a \u201cSurrogate\u2019s court may compel a judicial settlement of the account of a temporary administrator <em>at any </em>time.\u201d This section contains no reference whatever to executors or to administrators in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Section 2726 provides that \u201c a petition praying for the judicial settlement of an account, and that the <em>executor or administrator </em>may be cited to show cause Avhy he should not render and settle his account, may be presented in the case prescribed <em>in either of the last </em>two sections,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">It is, therefore, apparent that so far as compulsory accountings are concerned, the term <em>\u201c </em>administrator \u201d is broad enough to include the term \u201c temporary administrator.\u201d I cannot doubt that the authority of the Surrogate upon the accounting of a temporary administrator is substantially the same as his authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>upon the accounting of an executor or administrator in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Now it was held by the Court of Appeals, in the case of Shakspeare v. Markham (72 <em>N. Y., </em>400), that under the provisions of the Revised Statutes relating to the mode of proving the claim of an executor or administrator against his decedent\u2019s estate (\u00a7 33, tit. 3, ch. 6, part 2, R. S.; 3 Banks, 5th ed., 175), the Surrogate had jurisdiction to hear and determine \u201c all claims in which an executor was interested \u201d and that the \u201c circumstance that he is <em>jointly </em>interested in the demand does not affect the authority of the Surrogate to adjudicate with regard to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">I have found no decision as to the jurisdiction of the Surrogate, upon the accounting of an executor or administrator, to pass upon the claim of the estate of the accounting party\u2019s decedent against a firm of which the accounting party had been a member; but it seems to me that since the taking effect of \u00a7 2739, the reasoning of Shakespeare v. Markham is as applicable where the accounting party is a debtor as where he is a creditor of his decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Exception is taken to the referee\u2019s fourth conclusion of law to the effect that the temporary administrator, upon making the payments which shall be directed by the decree settling his account, and upon delivering the property of the estate to the executors, is entitled to his discharge and to the revocation of his letters. It is claimed that his responsibility will not determine until the administration of the estate shall be completed, unless before that time his letters shall be revoked in a proceeding brought expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>for such revocation by some person interested in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">I think that this position is unsound. Section 2684 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that where, after the issuance of letters of administration on the ground of a decedent\u2019s intestacy, his will shall be admitted to probate and letters testamentary thereon shall be granted, the decree according probate must revoke the former letters. I doubt whether any reason can be suggested why this provision should have been limited to letters of administration granted on the ground of intestacy, except this: that there is involved in the very term \u201c temporary administrator\u201d the notion that the authority of such an officer is extinguished by the issuance of letters testamentary or letters of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Section 2685 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for the compulsory revocation of the letters of an <em>\u201c </em>executor or administrator.\u201d In the eighth subdivision of that section there is an express reference to temporary administrators. This reference serves to indicate that such officers are included within the general term \u201c administrators.\u201d But this subdivision provides only for the case, of temporary administrators appointed under the <em>second </em>subdivision of \u00a7 2668\u2014 that is, of temporary administrators upon the estates of absentees.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">This circumstance confirms me in the opinion that temporary administrators appointed under the <em>first </em>subdivision of \u00a7 2668 go out of office as of course upon the issuance of permanent letters (Matter of Lewis, 17 <em>Week. Dig., </em>311).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>I decline, however, to cancel the administrator\u2019s bond (Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 2596).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
