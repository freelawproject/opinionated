He died in August, 1876. His mother died in March of the year following ; the notes in question thereupon came to the hands of her executor, one Keese. At various times, prior to April, 1880, Keese received from this decedent\u2019s executor (Armstrong) sums of money amounting in all to $200, in part satisfaction of the claims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the estate of the testator\u2019s mother against the estate of the testator himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Subsequently Keese and Armstrong had with each other certain personal business transactions, upon the settlement of which, on May 31st, 1883, it was ascertained that the former was indebted to the latter in the sum of $13.44. Instead of discharging this indebtedness by the actual payment of money, Keese, with Armstrong\u2019s approval, credited this estate with payment of a like sum in part satisfaction of the aforesaid claim of the testator\u2019s mother. On October 14th, 1886, Armstrong filed in this court an account of -his administration. Certain objections were interposed, and the issues thus raised were submitted to a referee, whose report is before me for confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The referee finds that the provision in the third clause of the will <em>(supra) </em>is in the nature of a legacy, and that, even if this were not the case, the claim of Sarah Thompson\u2019s estate, as\" a creditor of this decedent, would not be barred by the Statute of Limitations. The latter finding involves the notion that the transaction between Armstrong and Keese above referred to must be treated as, in substance, a <em>payment </em>of $13.44 by the former as decedent\u2019s executor to the latter as executor of the decedent\u2019s mother. I think that the referee has reached a correct conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">It is not essential to the validity of his bequests that a testator should use the word \u201c give \u201d or the word \u201c bequeath \u201d or any other word of similar significance. The very terms employed by this testator, in the article of his will now under consideration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>were held in Miars v. Bedgood (9 <em>Leigh, </em>361) to constitute a legacy. Parker, J., pronouncing the opinion of our Court of Appeals in Orton v. Orton (3 <em>Keyes, </em>486), approves the definition of a legacy, which is to be found in Bacon\u2019s Abridgement\u2014.viz.: a \u201cgift or bequest by testament\u201d\u2014and declares that \u201c the word gift is not limited in its meaning to a gratuity, but has the more extended signification of <em>a thing given, </em>either as a gratuity or as a recompense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">I think that the provision here in dispute is a legacy in satisfaction of a debt and that, in view of \u00a7 1819 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Statute of Limitations has not as yet begun to run against the representative of the deceased legatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Nor is the enforcement of the claim of Sarah Thompson\u2019s estate barred by the Statute of Limitations, even though the claim be regarded not as a legacy but as a debt. In May, 1883, it would have been entirely proper for Armstrong to have satisfied it in whole or in part, whether he had or had not been at that time in possession of funds belonging to the estate; and if he had made payments out of his own pocket he would thereby have entitled himself to reimbursement out of the estate moneys thereafter coming to his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">If Keese had actually paid Armstrong the sum of $13.44 and Armstrong had handed back to Keese the identical money on account of the Sarah Thompson claim, it cannot be doubted that the transaction would have taken the claim out of the operation of the Statute of Limitations. And this was in effect what actually took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Section 395 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which makes an acknowledgment or promise contained in a writing, signed by the party to be charged thereby, the only competent evidence of a new or continuing contract, whereby to defeat the Statute of Limitations, expressly declares that <em>this section does not alter the effect of a payment of </em>principal or interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u201cPayment of a debt,\u201d says the Court of Appeals of Virginia, in Huffmans v. Walker (26 <em>Gratt., </em>314), \u201c is not necessarily a payment of money, but that is payment which the parties contract shall be accepted as payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">It was held in Maber v. Maber <em>(L. R., </em>2 <em>Exch. Cas., </em>153), that in determining whether a transaction claimed to be a payment has had the effect of taking the case out of the Statute of Limitations, the true test is this: Would the transaction have supported a plea of payment if the creditor had brought an action ? Tried by this test, the present case seems to me a plain one. In its essential features it closely resembles the last one cited. See, also, Hooper v. Stephens (4 <em>Ad. &amp; El., </em>71); Bodger v. Arch (10 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>333); Amos v. Smith (1 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>238).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">I do not think it necessary to discuss any of the other exceptions to the report of the referee. The report is in all things confirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
