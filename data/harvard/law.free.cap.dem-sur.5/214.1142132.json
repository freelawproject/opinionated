Reid, 4 <em>Bradf., </em>334; Rieck v. Fish, 1 <em>Dem., </em>79; Matter of Moody, 2 <em>id., </em>624; Toler v. Landon, <em>3 id., </em>337).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Now the infants, in behalf of whom this application is made, have no general guardian. The testatrix has attempted, by her will to constitute their father the guardian of their estates. This she was unable to do in law. The power of appointing the guardian of an infant can only be exercised by the courts having authority in such cases, or by the infant\u2019s father or mother (Fullerton v. Jackson, 5 <em>Johns. Ch., </em>278; Hoyt v. Hilton, 2 <em>Edw. Ch., </em>202; R. S., part 2, ch. 8, tit. 3, \u00a7 1; 3 Banks, 7th ed., 2346).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">I am disposed, however, to think that the provision above quoted from the will, though abortive as an appointment of a guardian, has in effect made this petitioner a trustee of the property bequeathed to his children; and that that property may properly be turned over to him without his obtaining letters of guardianship. But in view of the fact that less than a year has elapsed since the executor received his let<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ters testamentary, he cannot be directed to pay the legacies in question except upon the filing of a bond as prescribed in such cases by \u00a7 2I719 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
