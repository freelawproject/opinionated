Jube, named in the will of the decedent, presented the same for probate. The will was prepared by the executor Secor, who was a physician, a blank form being used for that purpose, in which the usual formal parts were printed, as was also the attestation clause, with a blank space for the name of the testatrix to be inserted. Before any attempt at execution was made, the draftsman read it aloud to decedent, who declared it was as she desired it. She then took a pen to subscribe her name, and was told, by him, that the proper place to do it, was in the blank space in the attestation clause between the printed words <em>\u201c </em>Subscribed by\u201d -- and <em>\u201c </em>the testa-\u201d ; and she accordingly wrote her name there, in the presence of both of the subscribing witnesses. All the other formalities necessary to a complete execution were complied with.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-8\">The Executors, <em>in person.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b40-9\">The Surrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"A1k\">This will must be regarded as sufficiently executed, in all respects. The only question relates to the subscription. That the place where she wrote her name was intended by her to be a subscription of her will, there can be no doubt, and it was that signature which the witnesses attested. That it was written in a blank space in the attestation clause, can make no difference, when it distinctly appears that it was intended bjr her, and so understood by the witnesses, as her subscription of the will, and it is, sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>stantially, at the end thereof. There is nothing in the case of Sisters of Charity v. Kelly (67 <em>N. Y., </em>409) which conflicts with this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">The will is, therefore, admitted to probate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
