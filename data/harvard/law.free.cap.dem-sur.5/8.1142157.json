Havens, <em>deceased.</em></parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b28-8\">In Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 2713, last sentence, requiring a special proceeding for the discovery of a decedent\u2019s assets to he dismissed upon the presenta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>tion of a proper bond, and the payment of costs, if any, awarded to petioner, \u201c <em>within such a time </em>as the Surrogate or other officer fixes for that purpose,\u201d the clause quoted relates solely to the payment of costs, the time for which cannot be fixed except upon presentation of such a bond.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-4\">An award of $50, costs, against an unsuccessful respondent in a contested special proceeding instituted, under Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 2706, <em>et seq., </em>for the discovery of concealed assets, <em>etc.,\u2014held </em>a reasonable exercise of the Surrogate\u2019s discretion (id., \u00a7 2561).</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">Motion made by Edward F. McCaskie to modify the decree entered pursuant to the opinion in this matter, reported in 4 <em>Dem., </em>549, in regard to the transfer of the securities therein mentioned, and by striking out the fifty dollars costs allowed against him in the proceeding. The only ground on which the application was based was, that he had no notice to appear on the 21st day of July, 1886, fixed for the purpose of the hearing.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-6\">F. Larkin, <em>for the motion.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-7\">W. H. Haldane, <em>opposed.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b29-8\">The Surrogate.</author>\n<p id=\"AB\">Treating the affidavit of McCaskie in this matter as a petition, he states no ground for the application, other than that he had no notice to appear on the 21st day of July. His ^counsel now admits that he had such notice, and there is on file proof of the due service thereof. If he made default, he offers no excuse therefor, and states no reason why the decree should be modified. There appears, therefore, no sufficient ground for this application. His counsel, however, seeks relief on matters <em>dehors </em>the record, and insists that the decree was irregularly entered. Although not essential to the determination of the motion, I will consider it briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The answer having been decided not to be such as is permitted by \u00a7 2710 of the Code, either party had a right to give further evidence as provided by \u00a7 2711. After the decision referred to, notice was given by the attorney for the executrix to McCaskie, on the 16th day of July, to appear before the Surrogate on the 21st day of the same month, when he had an opportunity to exercise such right. Not appearing pursuant thereto, and having admitted the possession of the property in question, and not offering to give the security permissible under the provisions of \u00a7 2713, the decree complained of was entered. I can see nothing irregular in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Counsel for McCaskie claims that it was the duty of the Surrogate, before making the decree, to enter an order fixing the time within which the bond should be presented, under the last clause of \u00a7 2713. In that respect he is, doubtless, mistaken. The fixing of the time there referred to relates solely to the payment of costs, and that time cannot be fixed except\u00a3\u00a3 upon the presentation of such a bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">On the subject of the allowance of fifty dollars costs in that proceeding against the moving party here, it is plain that the matter was in the discretion of the court, to the extent of seventy dollars. Under the circumstances, it does not seem that he has any just ground of complaint in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
