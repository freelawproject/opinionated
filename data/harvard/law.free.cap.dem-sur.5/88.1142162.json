She left, her surviving, (1) brothers, (2) nephews and nieces, children of deceased brothers, and (3) grandnieces and grandnephews, offspring of deceased children of deceased brothers. The question was whether the more remote issue took under the will.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-5\">J. W.

Y., </em>295), and I think, therefore, that it is a true construction of the will, and that it was the intention of the testatrix that her estate should be distributed, <em>per stirpes, </em>among her brothers and the descendants of deceased brothers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
