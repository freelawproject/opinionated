Rudes, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-10\">Singer, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">{\u00b6 1} This is an appeal from a judgment of conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol, following a no-contest plea in the Erie County Court. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">{\u00b6 2} On July 25, 2003, appellant, Rickie Smith, was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant had rear-ended another vehicle while traveling on the causeway bridge on Route 2 in Erie County. The damage to both cars was slight, according to appellant, and appellant and the other driver exchanged information. Both appellant and the other driver then drove from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-14\">{\u00b6 4} The driver of the other vehicle then called the Ohio State Highway Patrol on a cellular phone, stating that he believed appellant might have been under the influence of alcohol. The driver stayed on the cellular phone, continuing to follow appellant\u2019s vehicle. When troopers pulled over appellant, the caller identified appellant\u2019s vehicle as the one that struck his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-15\">{\u00b6 5} Ohio State Highway Patrol Troopers Brian DePizzo and Brett Gockstetter pulled appellant off the highway into a rest area along Route 2 in Ottawa County. DePizzo testified that he noted an odor of an alcoholic beverage inside the vehicle and that appellant had slurred speech and responded slowly to questions. DePizzo then asked appellant to exit the vehicle so that Gockstetter could administer field sobriety tests. Gockstetter testified that appellant had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>strong alcoholic odor about him and spoke slowly with slurred speech and, when appellant removed his sunglasses for the administration of the field sobriety tests, appellant\u2019s eyes were red, glassy, and bloodshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">{\u00b6 6} Gockstetter administered the field sobriety tests: the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, the walk-and-turn test, and the one-leg-stand test. Gockstetter testified that appellant displayed six out of six clues on the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, seven out of eight clues on the walk-and-turn test, and four out of four clues on the one-leg-stand test, all of which indicated that appellant was under the influence of alcohol. Gockstetter placed appellant under arrest, advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and drove him to the Ohio State Highway Patrol post in Sandusky where Gockstetter administered a breath-alcohol test to appellant. The result indicated an equivalent blood-alcohol level of 0.215 percent. On September 3, 2003, appellant moved to suppress the result of the tests, arguing that the trooper\u2019s administration of the field sobriety tests was inconsistent with the compliance of standardized testing procedures demanded in <em>State v. Homan </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 421, 424, 732 N.E.2d 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">{\u00b6 7} At the hearing on the motion to suppress, both troopers testified to their training, their experience in administering the field sobriety tests, and the manner in which field sobriety tests were administered to appellant. Appellant testified that he has had several injuries, including burns over 45 percent of his body, damage to his hands, multiple fractures of his right leg, and several concussions, but he failed to explain the significance of these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court denied the motion to suppress. The court found that \u201cthe manner in which the tests were conducted were consistent with the standards promulgated in <em>Homan.\u201d </em>In addition, the court held that \u201creasonable articulable suspicion existed to stop [appellant]\u201d and probable cause existed for his arrest. Appellant subsequently pleaded no contest and was found guilty of a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), driving under the influence of alcohol. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail, 70 days suspended; a $750 fine; a one-year license suspension; and two years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant now raises the following single assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c1. The court committed prejudicial error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">{\u00b6 11} When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court serves as the trier of fact. <em>State v. Fanning </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 1 OBR 57, 437 N.E.2d 583. The trier of fact evaluates the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972. On review, the trial court\u2019s findings of fact -will not be disturbed, if they are supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>by competent, credible evidence. <em>State v. Guysinger </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 592, 594, 621 N.E.2d 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant asserts that the field sobriety tests in this case should not have been considered as evidence of probable cause for his arrest. Without the results of the field sobriety tests, according to appellant, no other probable cause for his arrest existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant premises his argument on our holding in <em>State v. Nickelson </em>(July 20, 2001), 6th Dist. No. H-00-036, 2001 WL 1028878, asserting that when in a motion to suppress a movant challenges the manner in which an officer conducted field sobriety tests, it is the state\u2019s burden to prove the propriety of the tests. Appellant insists that the state failed to satisfy its burden, presenting only generalized testimony from the trooper who administered appellant\u2019s tests that these tests were in conformity with regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">{\u00b6 14} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201cin order for the results of a field sobriety test to serve as evidence of probable cause to arrest, the police must have administered the test in strict compliance with standardized testing procedures.\u201d <em>State v. Homan, </em>supra, 89 Ohio St.3d 421, 732 N.E.2d 952, at paragraph one of the syllabus. Strict compliance requires following the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s test in the prescribed, standardized manner. Id. at 424, 732 N.E.2d 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">{\u00b6 15} <em>Nickelson, </em>supra, involved the administration of field sobriety tests by a Norwalk, Ohio police officer who did not strictly comply with standardized testing procedures. In <em>Nickelson, </em>the defendant contended in his motion to suppress that, pursuant to <em>Homan, </em>evidence of his field sobriety tests should be suppressed because, in several specific instances, the tests were incorrectly performed. Nickelson cited the National Highway Safety Manual provisions that he believed were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Nickelson, </em>we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe Supreme Court of Ohio has held that when evidence is obtained pursuant to a warrantless search or seizure, the defendant must initially: (1) demonstrate that the search or seizure was warrantless; and (2) state the grounds on which he challenges the search or seizure with enough particularity to put the state on notice of the basis for his challenge.\u201d <em>Nickelson, </em>citing <em>Xenia v. Wallace </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 216, 524 N.E.2d 889, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">{\u00b6 18} In this matter, appellant\u2019s motion to suppress reads \u201c1. There was no * * * probable cause to arrest defendant without a warrant. The officer administered the \u2018standard field sobriety tests\u2019 inconsistent with the manual on said tests, rendering their validity compromised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>{\u00b6 19} In the memorandum supporting the motion, appellant failed to address the issue with more specificity, instead merely stating that \u201c[t]he tests were not administered utilizing the required test conditions, standardized instructions and procedures, nor scored using the standardized scoring.\u201d Particular issues with the testing were not identified, and appropriate sections of the manual were not cited, nor were specific connections made between appellant\u2019s physical injuries and the administration of the field sobriety tests. Appellant thus failed the particularity requirement of the <em>Nickelson </em>test. As a result, the state had insufficient notice of the specific deficiencies in the field sobriety tests that appellant alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"> {\u00b6 20} Moreover, even without evidence of the field sobriety tests, probable cause existed to believe appellant was driving under the influence of alcohol. Probable cause is determined by the totality of circumstances. <em>Homan, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 427, 732 N.E.2d 952; <em>State v. Black </em>(Jan. 16, 2001), 6th Dist. No. F-03-010, 2004 WL 88857. Appellant had an odor of alcohol on him, glassy and bloodshot eyes, and slurred his speech. Appellant admitted drinking alcohol in his vehicle. Another driver, the victim of a rear-end collision with appellant, called the Ohio State Highway Patrol in order to report suspicion of appellant\u2019s intoxication. This caller remained on the phone and later identified appellant\u2019s vehicle when appellant was pulled over by the highway patrol. Accordingly, the troopers had knowledge of facts and circumstances sufficient to warrant a prudent person\u2019s believing that appellant was driving under the influence of alcohol. See <em>Beck v. Ohio </em>(1964), 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">{\u00b6 21} Based on the foregoing, we conclude that appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">{\u00b6 22} On consideration whereof, the court finds that substantial justice was done to the party complaining, and the judgment of the Erie County Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-9\">Handwork and Pietrykowski, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
