McMonagle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellee, Harry S. Clapp, is the former chief financial officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) of defendant-appellant, Mueller Electric Company (\u201cMueller Electric\u201d or \u201cMueller\u201d). After his employment was terminated, Clapp sued defendants-appellants, Mueller Electric, Brighton Manor Corporation (\u201cBrighton Manor\u201d), and E. Scott Emerson (the owner of both companies), for monies owed him as a result of services he provided to Mueller and Brighton Manor for which he was not paid. Clapp\u2019s complaint asserted claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and promissory estoppel; he subsequently dismissed the promissoryestoppel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">{\u00b6 2} Clapp, a certified public accountant (\u201cCPA\u201d), testified at trial that he was hired as Mueller\u2019s CFO in November 1996 at an annual salary of $65,000. In November 1997, Emerson terminated Mueller\u2019s chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) and asked Clapp to perform the CEO duties, in addition to his duties as CFO, while Emerson searched for a permanent CEO. Contemporaneous with his appointment as CEO, Clapp received a raise and a bonus. In November 1998, after his annual performance review, Emerson increased Clapp\u2019s salary to $78,000 per year and gave him a 30 percent bonus. In November 1999, Emerson again reviewed Clapp\u2019s performance, increased his salary to $95,000 per year, and gave him a 30 percent bonus. From the time he was hired by Mueller until December 1999, Clapp performed work only for Mueller.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">{\u00b6 3} Sometime in 1997 or 1998, Emerson terminated the controller of Brighton Manor, which owns and operates four hotels in northern Ohio, and hired an accounting firm to oversee the financial operations of the hotels. In late 1999, however, Emerson became aware that the accounting firm had been having difficulty handling the bookkeeping and accounting functions of Brighton Manor. Emerson approached Clapp and asked him to review the books and bookkeeping procedures and advise him of the extent of the problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">{\u00b6 4} Over a two-week period in January 2000, Clapp familiarized himself with the operation of Brighton Manor. He learned that no bank reconciliations had been performed in the previous 18 months for any of the four hotels owned and operated by Brighton Manor. He also discovered that the controllers working at the various hotels were not properly trained or experienced and that there were not proper bookkeeping procedures in place at any of the four hotels. In short, according to Clapp, \u201cthere was a complete collapse of the accounting system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">{\u00b6 5} Clapp reported to Emerson that Brighton Manor\u2019s books were $800,000 out of balance. He further advised Emerson that to bring the books in balance, hundreds of thousands of transactions had to be traced, but the task would be very complicated because all the transactions from the four hotels were intermin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>gled in one joint bank account. Clapp further advised Emerson that accounting procedures would have to be designed and implemented and the accounting staff at the hotels would need to be trained or replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">{\u00b6 6} Clapp and Emerson then discussed various options for solving the problems. Clapp advised Emerson that he could either hire an outside accounting firm to create a new accounting system and train new personnel at each of the four hotels at a cost of approximately $200,000 or hire an experienced CFO for Brighton Manor, at an approximate salary of $125,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">{\u00b6 7} Instead, in February 2000, Emerson approached Clapp and asked him if he would \u201cbe interested in taking on this task and coming into this organization and fixing these problems.\u201d Clapp testified that he had told Emerson that taking on the additional duties at Brighton Manor would involve a lot more work and had asked him what he would be compensated for these substantial extra duties. According to Clapp, Emerson told him:</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cHarry, if you get this, if you come in and do what you tell me you can do, if you fix this problem, I will \u2014 if you handle the books of Brighton for me and do what you tell me you can do, I will pay you fairly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">{\u00b6 9} From February 2000 until he was terminated in May 2001, Clapp continued to perform his CEO and CFO duties at Mueller Electric, and, additionally, he worked as CFO at Brighton Manor. Clapp testified that in addition to his normal hours at Mueller Electric, he spent an average of 30 hours per week in the evenings and on weekends designing and implementing a new accounting and bookkeeping system for Brighton Manor. Further, he hired and trained personnel to operate the new system and supervised the individuals who were working at balancing the books. Clapp initially gave Emerson frequent updates regarding his progress, but after Emerson told him that he was not interested in Clapp\u2019s schedule, he gave Emerson less frequent updates.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">{\u00b6 10} By February 2001, Clapp had completed the task of balancing Brighton Manor\u2019s books and implementing a new bookkeeping system. When he approached Emerson regarding the promised payment, however, Emerson told Clapp that he would pay him only after an outside accounting firm reviewed the procedures that Clapp had put into place and \u201csigned off on it.\u201d After the accounting firm completed its audit and signed off on Clapp\u2019s work, Clapp again approached Emerson regarding payment. This time, Emerson told Clapp that he wanted an outside consultant by the name of Ala Deen to review Clapp\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">{IT 11} Although Clapp correctly surmised that Emerson had actually hired Deen to replace him at Brighton Manor, Clapp advised and trained Deen regarding the procedures he had spent the past year implementing.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>{\u00b6 12} On May 1, 2001, after Clapp had completed Deen\u2019s training, Emerson advised Clapp that he was terminated effective immediately. In light of Clapp\u2019s senior position at Mueller, however, Emerson asked Clapp to report on various issues and strategies, including the company\u2019s union, insurance, and vendor contracts, and the company\u2019s decision to move its Cleveland operation to China. Because his employment had been terminated, Clapp informed Emerson that he wanted severance pay in exchange for the reports. Clapp testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cWell, at this point, I had been burned a couple times. I was finally waking up a little bit. And I said: Look it, let\u2019s talk about a severance package first.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cSo we started talking about a severance package. And I very clearly, right up front, I said: Look it, I\u2019m looking for a six-month package. * * * The bottom fine is, I said: Scott, I expect a six-month. Is that what we\u2019re talking about? He nodded his head. That\u2019s where we left it at.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">{\u00b6 15} Thereafter, Clapp spent several days developing a list of key issues regarding Mueller Electric. He then met with Emerson for several hours regarding the report. At the conclusion of the meeting, Clapp asked Emerson about his severance package. Emerson \u201chemmed and hawed\u201d and then told Clapp that he had not yet had time for his lawyers to draw up the agreement but that it would be forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">{\u00b6 16} Over the next several days, Clapp called Emerson several times. He did not speak with Emerson directly, but left several messages for him on his voicemail. Emerson did not return the messages, but then several days later, he called Clapp and, in an angry tone, accused him of unspecified wrongdoing and told him that he would not be paid for his work at Brighton Manor and would not be receiving any severance pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">{\u00b6 17} Emerson testified for the defense and said that he had given Clapp the responsibility of fixing the problems at Brighton Manor because Clapp had \u201cgotten things working very smoothly at Mueller\u201d and that Emerson had believed that Clapp had time to take on other responsibilities. According to Emerson, he and Clapp never had any discussions regarding additional compensation for Clapp\u2019s work at Brighton Manor.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">{\u00b6 18} Emerson testified that Clapp initially told him that the books at Brighton Manor were several hundred thousand dollars out of balance, and he was surprised to learn from Clapp in December 2000 that the books were actually $800,000 out of balance, after Clapp had been working on the project for nearly a year. Emerson testified further that he had told Clapp that he wanted him to \u201croll up his sleeves\u201d and get the books balanced and the cash accounts reconciled by the year-end close.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>{\u00b6 19} According to Emerson, he told Clapp that he \u201cwould think about it and get back to him\u201d when Clapp asked him about a severance payment, and he denied nodding his head in agreement when Clapp stated that he was entitled to six months\u2019 severance pay. Emerson testified that he talked about \u201copen issues\u201d at Mueller Electric with Clapp after he was terminated, but could not recall receiving a memo from Clapp about those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">{\u00b6 20} Upon cross-examination, Emerson testified that upon learning of the enormity of the accounting problems at Brighton Manor, he knew that he would need to hire either an outside accounting firm or a CFO to fix the problems, but instead he had asked Clapp to do the work. Emerson testified further that he had been upset when he learned, after Clapp was terminated, that Clapp had written off approximately $72,000 to balance the books at Brighton Manor. Emerson admitted, however, that during his deposition, he had testified that Clapp had written off approximately $35,000 to balance the books. Emerson further admitted that the outside accounting firm that reviewed Clapp\u2019s finished work at Brighton Manor had no criticisms regarding his work. Emerson also admitted that he had lied when he told Clapp that Deen was an outside consultant at Brighton Manor when, in fact, Emerson had already hired him as the new CFO for the company. Finally, Emerson testified that he had decided not to pay Clapp any severance pay after he learned from Judith Little, his assistant, on May 2, 2001, that Clapp had loaned her company money in violation of company policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">{\u00b6 21} John Phillips, a former controller for Mueller Electric, testified that he and Little helped reconcile the books at Brighton Manor. According to Phillips, Clapp supervised the project and got involved in the actual reconciliation work only after December 2000, when it was determined that the books were approximately $800,000 out of balance. Phillips testified that he had worked on the Brighton Manor project approximately two days per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">{\u00b6 22} Little, called on cross-examination by the plaintiff, testified that she had first told Emerson in February 2002, after Clapp filed his lawsuit and nearly a year after his termination, that Clapp had authorized a personal loan to her from the company. Little emphatically denied telling Emerson about the loan in May 2001, when Clapp was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">{\u00b6 23} On the next day of trial, defense counsel called Little on direct examination. Little then suddenly changed her testimony regarding when she first told Emerson that Clapp had authorized a company loan to her. Little testified that she actually told Emerson about the company loan in May 2001, when she became involved in preparing Mueller Electric\u2019s response to a document entitled \u201cRequest for Information\u201d from the Ohio Department of Job and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Family Services regarding Clapp\u2019s request for unemployment compensation. Little noted that the document was mailed to Mueller on May 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">{\u00b6 24} In light of this dramatic and unexplained change in testimony, upon cross-examination, appellee\u2019s counsel asked Little whether she had discussed the document, Clapp\u2019s personnel file, or her testimony with defense counsel between the time of her previous testimony and her altered testimony. Little responded \u201cno\u201d to each question. When appellee\u2019s counsel then asked, \u201c[W]ell, what did you discuss with these lawyers?\u201d the trial court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court denied defense counsel\u2019s motions for a directed verdict, both at the conclusion of appellee\u2019s case-in-chief and at the conclusion of all the evidence. The jury returned a general verdict in favor of Clapp, awarding him $115,000. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">CLAPP\u2019S TESTIMONY REGARDING THE VALUE OF HIS SERVICES</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">{\u00b6 26} Clapp testified on direct examination that he had been a CPA for over 15 years. He testified further that in light of his experience working with and reviewing the bills from public accounting firms over the past 20 years, he was aware of what the hourly rate for a licensed CPA with 15 years of experience was. Clapp then opined that the value of his services as a licensed CPA was anywhere from $125 to $175 per hour and that, calculating his rate at $150 per hour, the value of the services he had provided to Brighton Manor was $232,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">{\u00b6 27} In their first assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court committed reversible error in allowing Clapp to testify, over their objection, to the value of his services because he was not qualified as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">{\u00b6 28} The admission or exclusion of evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343. In order to find an abuse of that discretion, we must find that the trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude the evidence was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable and not merely an error of judgment. <em>State v. Xie </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 584 N.E.2d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">{\u00b6 29} A witness need not be qualified as an expert to testify regarding the value of his own services. In <em>Mid-States Dev. Co. v. Celotex Corp. </em>(Aug. 29, 1983), Montgomery App. No. CA 7469, 1983 WL 4943, for example, a witness testified regarding the reasonable value of services rendered for repair and replacement of a roof. Appellant objected that the testimony was improper because the witness had not been qualified as an expert. In affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling that the witness need not be an expert to testify as to the value of services he had provided, the Second District stated, \u201c[V]alue of services requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>a familiarity with the subject and does not require, as implied here, the qualification of a witness designated as an expert.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">{\u00b6 30} Similarly, in <em>Rose v. Brandewie </em>(1950), 101 N.E.2d 219, the court held that witnesses who were not qualified as experts had properly testified regarding the value of board, lodging, and laundry services provided to defendant\u2019s decedent. The court noted that knowledge of the value of the services rendered did not depend on professional or special skill that would qualify the witnesses as experts, but could be had and testified to by persons who had gained their knowledge through experience and observation. See, also <em>Frank v. Frank </em>(Dec. 23, 1930), 9th Dist. No. 542, 1930 WL 2302 (plaintiff not required to be qualified as an expert to testify regarding the value of the services he provided on defendant\u2019s farm).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">{\u00b6 31} There is no question that, in this case, Clapp had sufficient experience to testify regarding the value of services he rendered as CFO to Brighton Manor. The testimony at trial demonstrated that Clapp had been a CPA involved in accounting and financial work for many years, that he had performed such services at Mueller Electric for nearly five years, and that he had performed similar services at Brighton Manor. Thus, Clapp clearly was familiar with the services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">{\u00b6 32} Appellants contend that Clapp\u2019s testimony was improper, however, because he actually gave expert testimony without being qualified as an expert or submitting an expert report. They assert that because Clapp testified that the hourly rate for a CPA with 15 years of experience is anywhere from $125 to $175 per hour, he actually testified regarding the market rate for his services, which is a subject for expert testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">{\u00b6 33} The record reflects that Clapp testified that in light of his extensive experience, <em>Ms services </em>as a CPA were worth anywhere from $125 to $175 per hour. Although he testified that he knew what the hourly rate of a licensed CPA in Ohio with 15 years of experience was, he did not testify as to what that rate was because appellants\u2019 counsel objected to his answer. Thus, Clapp testified as to his own value, not the market value for every CPA with 15 years of experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">{\u00b6 34} Moreover, even if the admission of Clapp\u2019s testimony regarding the value of his services were in error, we would find the error to be harmless. Emerson testified that Clapp advised him it would cost approximately $200,000 for an outside accounting firm to fix the problems at Brighton Manor, or $125,000 for a CFO to do the work. The jury returned a verdict of $115,000, below this range. Accordingly, Clapp\u2019s testimony that the value of the services he rendered to Brighton Manor was $232,000 does not appear to have influenced the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Clapp to testify regarding the value of his services, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">APPELLANTS\u2019 MOTIONS FOR DIRECTED VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">{\u00b6 36} In their second assignment of error, appellants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motions for directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">{\u00b6 37} According to Civ.R. 50(A)(4), a motion for directed verdict is granted if, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, \u201creasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party.\u201d The \u201creasonable minds\u201d test mandated by Civ.R. 50(A)(4) requires the court to discern only whether there exists any evidence of substantive probative value that favors the position of the nonmoving party. Civ.R. 50(A)(4); <em>Ruta v. Breckenridge-Remy Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 66, 69, 23 O.O.3d 115, 430 N.E.2d 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\"> {\u00b6 38} \u201cA motion for directed verdict * * * does not present factual issues, but a question of law, even though in deciding such a motion, it is necessary to review and consider the evidence.\u201d <em>O\u2019Day v. Webb </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 215, 58 O.O.2d 424, 280 N.E.2d 896, paragraph three of the syllabus. See, also, <em>Wagner v. Roche Laboratories </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 116, 119, 671 N.E.2d 252. Because we are presented with a question of law, we apply a de novo standard of review. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 512, 2002-Ohio-2842, 769 N.E.2d 835, at \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">{\u00b6 39} Appellants argue that both of Clapp\u2019s claims were deficient for various reasons. They contend that there was insufficient evidence to support Clapp\u2019s breach-of-contract claim because Emerson\u2019s statement that he would pay Clapp \u201cfairly\u201d for his work at Brighton Manor fails to establish the contract price, one of the essential elements of a claim for breach of contract. Likewise, they claim that there was insufficient evidence to support Clapp\u2019s claim for severance pay because a nod of the head is insufficient to establish an agreement, and even if it were sufficient, Emerson\u2019s nod of the head indicated only an agreement to make an agreement in the future regarding Clapp\u2019s severance, which appellants claim is unenforceable under these circumstances. Finally, they argue that Clapp\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment fails because he did not confer any benefit on Brighton Manor.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">{\u00b6 40} We address Clapp\u2019s unjust-enrichment claim first. This court set forth a synopsis of the law of unjust enrichment in <em>Donovan v. Omega World Travel, Inc. </em>(Oct. 5, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 68251, 1995 WL 588721:</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>{\u00b6 41} \u201cGenerally speaking, a claim for unjust enrichment lies whenever a benefit is conferred by a plaintiff upon a defendant with knowledge by the defendant of the benefit and retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances where it would be unjust to do so without payment. * * * Civil liability may be imposed where one party retains a benefit from another\u2019s labors. This implied obligation (i.e., quasi contract) is derived from the equitable principle \u2018based on the moral obligation to make restitution which rests upon a person who has received a benefit which, if retained by him, would result in inequity and injustice.\u2019 In order to prevent such unjust enrichment, the law implies a promise to pay a reasonable amount for services in the absence of a specific contract.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">{\u00b6 42} In order to recover under a theory of unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must demonstrate the following: 1) a benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the defendant, 2) knowledge by the defendant of the benefit, and 3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances where it would be unjust to do so without payment. <em>Guardian Technology v. Chelm Properties </em>(Sept. 19, 2002), Cuyahoga App. No. 80166, 2002 WL 31087415, citing <em>Hambleton v. R.G. Barry Corp. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 179, 183, 12 OBR 246, 465 N.E.2d 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">{\u00b6 43} Appellants contend that there is no evidence that Clapp conferred a benefit on Brighton Manor. They argue that \u201cinstead of rolling up his own sleeves, and putting pencil to paper\u201d to perform the actual bank reconciliations, he delegated those responsibilities to two subordinates. They further contend that Clapp did not tell Emerson until December 2000 that the books were $800,000 out of balance, after the Brighton Manor project had been ongoing for nearly one year. Finally, they contend that Clapp did not confer any benefit on Brighton Manor, because he wrote off $165,394.27 in 2001 to bring the accounts into balance. Accordingly, they assert, there was no evidence to justify a payment to Clapp.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">{\u00b6 44} Appellants conveniently ignore Clapp\u2019s testimony, however. Clapp testified that he told Emerson in January 2000, after he had spent several weeks investigating Brighton Manor\u2019s operation, that the accounting system at Brighton Manor was in shambles, and that the books were $800,000 out of balance. He further testified that in addition to his normal work hours at Mueller Electric, from January 2000 to May 2001, he spent an average of 30 hours per week designing and implementing a new accounting and bookkeeping system at Brighton Manor. Clapp admitted that he had delegated much of the \u201cgrunt work\u201d associated with the bank reconciliations to his subordinates, but testified that he had supervised those persons and had hired and trained personnel at each of the four hotels to operate the new system. Clapp further admitted that he wrote off some monies to bring the books into balance, but testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>write-offs were based on his professional judgment that it was not cost effective to spend more time searching for the lost dollars. Appellants also ignore Emerson\u2019s own testimony that the independent accounting firm that reviewed Clapp\u2019s work raised no concerns about the processes he had put into place or the books themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">{\u00b6 45} Construing this evidence in a light most favorable to Clapp, as required by Civ.R. 50(A)(4), it is apparent that reasonable minds could conclude there was evidence of substantive probative value that Clapp conferred a benefit upon Brighton Manor. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied appellants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict regarding Clapp\u2019s unjust-enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">{\u00b6 46} As part of this assignment of error, appellants also contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Judgments that are supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by the reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">{\u00b6 47} With respect to Clapp\u2019s unjust-enrichment claim, we note that, for the reasons discussed above, there was sufficient evidence that Clapp had conferred a benefit on Brighton Manor. In addition, there was evidence that Emerson had asked Clapp to perform the services at Brighton Manor and, thus, that he knew of the benefit being conferred. Finally, there was evidence that Emerson promised to pay Clapp \u201cfairly\u201d for the services he performed at Brighton Manor, and, therefore, the jury could have reasonably concluded that it would be unjust for Emerson to retain that benefit without paying for it. Each element of Clapp\u2019s unjust-enrichment claim was supported by competent credible evidence, and, therefore, the jury verdict in favor of Clapp on this claim was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">{\u00b6 48} Because the jury rendered a general verdict, without any interrogatories, we are not able to discern from the record whether the jury found in favor of Clapp on his breach-of-contract claim, unjust-enrichment claim, or both. However, because there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Clapp regarding his unjust-enrichment claim for the services he rendered at Brighton Manor and the verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, we need not address appellants\u2019 arguments regarding Clapp\u2019s breach-of-contract claim or his claims for severance pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">{\u00b6 49} Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">{\u00b6 50} In their third assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court committed reversible error in allowing Clapp\u2019s counsel to question Little, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>upon her change in testimony regarding when she first told Emerson that Clapp had loaned her company money, as to whether she had discussed Clapp\u2019s personnel file, the \u201cRequest for Information\u201d letter from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, or her testimony with defense counsel between the time of her previous testimony and the time of her altered testimony. Appellants contend that because Little was their employee, any conversations she had with defense counsel were protected by attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">{\u00b6 51} Generally, communications between an attorney and his or her client are privileged. See R.C. 2317.02(A). The term \u201cclient,\u201d as used in R.C. 2317.021(A), includes:</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cA person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other association that, directly or through any representative, consults an attorney for the purpose of retaining the attorney or securing legal service or advice from him in his professional capacity, or consults an attorney employee for legal service or advice, and who communicates, either directly or through an agent, employee, or other representative, with such attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">{\u00b6 53} In <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 383, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584, the United States Supreme Court addressed the attorney-client privilege as it applies to a corporate client and determined that the attorney-client privilege protects and prevents the disclosure of communications between a company\u2019s attorney and that company\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">{\u00b6 54} Appellants argue that in light of <em>Upjohn </em>and its progeny, any conversations between Little and defense counsel were privileged, and, therefore, the \u201ctrial court lacked the authority to compel Ms. Little to waive her employer\u2019s privilege and answer those questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">{\u00b6 55} It is the <em>contents </em>of the communications that are privileged, however, not the mere fact that a communication took place. <em>Upjohn, </em>supra. Thus, the trial court properly allowed Clapp\u2019s counsel to inquire as to whether or not there had been any opportunity by appellants\u2019 counsel to influence Little\u2019s testimony, which had clearly undergone a radical transformation overnight. However, when appellee\u2019s counsel sought to inquire regarding the contents of any communications between Little and appellants\u2019 counsel, the trial court properly sustained counsel\u2019s objection. Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">{\u00b6 56} Appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b856-12\">Celebrezze Jr., P.J., and Kilbane, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
