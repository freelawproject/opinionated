(\u201cWaterwheel\u201d) filed a petition with the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners for annexation to the city of Union of 79.840 acres of its property and of a portion of Jackson Road, situated in Butler Township. The petition was filed under R.C. 709.023, which allows for an expedited annexation proceeding if all of the owners of the property sought to be annexed sign the petition. On July 14, 2004, Butler Township and the excluded owners filed an objection to the annexation. The property owners claimed that because they had not signed the petition, the petition was not signed by all of the owners of the property to be annexed in accordance with R.C. 709.023.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">{\u00b6 3} On July 22, 2004, Butler Township and the excluded owners filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>along with a motion for preliminary injunction in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court overruled the motion for preliminary injunction, reasoning that the motion was not ripe until the Montgomery County Commissioners acted on the annexation petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">{\u00b6 4} On August 3, 2004, the Montgomery County Commissioners approved the annexation petition. Butler Township filed a motion to enjoin the petition from being approved by the Union City Council, as well as a motion for a nonoral hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction and to consolidate the hearing with the trial on merits. On September 17, 2004, the trial court overruled the motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that the excluded owners were not \u201cowners\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 709.02(E) and, thus, they had failed to establish that they had a right to be included in the annexation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 5} Butler Township and the excluded owners (collectively, \u201crelators\u201d) raise two assignments of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 6} I. \u201cThe trial court erred in ruling that, because property owned in fee was subject to a right-of-way interest by another, the fee owners of said property are not \u2018owners\u2019 for purposes of an annexation pursuant to R.C. Chapter 709 and, accordingly, their properties may be annexed against their will and without them being counted as owners on an annexation petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 7} In their first assignment of error, relators contend that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the excluded owners were not \u201cowners\u201d for purposes of the annexation procedures set forth in R.C. 709.023.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">A. <em>Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c[AJnnexation is strictly a statutory process.\u201d <em>In re Petition to Annex 320 Acres to the Village of S. Lebanon </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 585, 591, 597 N.E.2d 463. Consequently, the procedures for annexation and for challenging an annexation must be provided by the General Assembly. Id. at 591, 597 N.E.2d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">{\u00b6 9} Since 2001, R.C. Chapter 709 has provided four procedures for the annexation of property. 2000 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 5 (\u201cSenate Bill 5\u201d). Three of those procedures are expedited procedures that may be used when all of the owners of property within the annexation territory sign the petition for annexation. See R.C. 709.021, 709.022, 709.023, and 709.024. Under each of these procedures, the owners of real estate contiguous to a municipal corporation may petition for annexation to that municipal corporation. R.C. 709.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 709.023 establishes an expedited procedure when the land to be annexed into the municipal corporation is not to be excluded from the township under R.C. 503.07. To proceed under R.C. 709.023, an application for annexation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>must be signed by all of the owners of the property to be annexed and filed with the clerk of the board of county commissioners of the county in which the property is located. R.C. 709.021(B). Upon receiving the petition, the clerk must cause the petition to be entered upon the board\u2019s journal at its next regular session. R.C. 709.023(B). Within five days of filing the petition, the agent for the petitioners must notify, among others, the owners of property adjacent to the territory proposed for annexation or adjacent to a road that is adjacent to that territory and located directly across that road from that territory. Id. Within 25 days after the petition is filed, the municipal corporation and any township in which the property is located must adopt and file with the board of county commissioners an ordinance or resolution consenting or objecting to the proposed annexation. R.C. 709.023(D). If the municipal corporation or any township objects to the annexation, the board of county commissioners must review the petition to determine whether it meets the requirements of R.C. 709.023(E). If the conditions set forth in R.C. 709.023(E) have been met, the board of county commissioners must grant the annexation; if the conditions have not been met, the petition must be denied. R.C. 709.023(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThere is no appeal in law or equity from the board\u2019s entry of any resolution under [R.C. 709.023], but any party may seek a writ of mandamus to compel the board of county commissioners to perform its duties under this section.\u201d R.C. 709.023(G). R.C. 709.07, which provides for appeals under R.C. Chapter 2506, does not apply to expedited annexations. R.C. 709.021(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">B. <em>Ownership under R.C. 709.02(E)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 12} At the heart of this appeal is relators\u2019 contention that the petition at issue was defective because the petition was not signed by all of the owners of property to be annexed. Prior to Senate Bill 5, R.C. 709.02 defined an owner as \u201cany adult individual seized of a freehold estate in land who is legally competent and any firm, trustee, or private corporation that is seized of a freehold estate in land; except that individuals, firms, and corporations holding easements are not included within such meanings.\u201d 1978 Am.H.B. No. 732, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3313.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 13} The current version of R.C. 709.02(E) defines \u201cowner\u201d or \u201cowners\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cany adult individual who is legally competent, the state or any political subdivision * * *, and any firm, trustee, or private corporation, any of which is seized of a freehold estate in land; <em>except that easements and any railroad, utility, street, and highway rights-of-way held in fee, by easement, or by dedication and acceptance are not included within those meanings </em>* * *. For purposes of sections 709.02 to 709.21, 709.38, and 709.39 of the Revised Code, the state or any political subdivision shall not be considered an owner and shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>be included in determining the number of owners needed to sign a petition unless an authorized agent of the state or the political subdivision signs the petition.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 15} The trial court found that the language of this statute was clear and unambiguous. It reasoned: \u201c[E]asements are excluded from the definition of owner for purposes of annexation. Although Relators hold the land extending to the centerline of Jackson Road in fee simple, the land subject to the annexation is an easement granting the county a right-of-way for use of the road. This type of easement is specifically excluded under the new statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 16} Relators challenge the trial court\u2019s interpretation. They assert that the excluded owners own in fee simple the property over which the portion of Jackson Road at issue lies. They thus assert that they are seized of a \u201cfreehold estate in land\u201d for purposes of R.C. 709.02(E). They further state that the county, in contrast, holds a nonfee highway right of way over the excluded owners\u2019 lands for the purpose of maintaining and improving Jackson Road. .Accordingly, relators argue, it is the \u201ctownship or county or other entity that has a right-of-way or an easement over the same property [that] is excluded as an \u2018owner.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 17} In response, Waterwheel and the city of Union argue that the trial court correctly found that R.C. 709.02(E) is clear and unambiguous and that it expressly excluded any interest in street and highway rights of way. \u25a0 Waterwheel contends that \u201cright of way in R.C. 709.02 means a strip of land <em>used </em>for \u2018any railroad, utility, street and highway\u2019 purpose.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Waterwheel further states that relators\u2019 interpretation would render meaningless the express provision of R.C. 709.02 that excludes the state or any political subdivision as an owner in every annexation unless it signs the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 18} We disagree with the parties and the trial court that the definition of \u201cowner\u201d set forth in R.C. 709.02(E) is unambiguous. Upon review of the language of the current version of the statute \u2014 without reference to the preSenate Bill 5 version or interpretations of the prior version, there are clearly two equally reasonable available interpretations. First, as relators argue, R.C. 709.02(E) can be read to exclude as owners those entities that hold merely an easement or right-of-way interest in property. Alternatively, as the city and Waterwheel assert, R.C. 709.02(E) can be read to exclude easements and all ownership interests in land used for rights of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">{\u00b6 19} When a statute is ambiguous, courts may determine the intent of legislature by considering (1) the object sought to be attained, (2) the circumstances under which the statute was enacted, (3) the legislative history, (4) the common law or former statutory provisions, including laws regarding the same or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>similar subject, (5) the consequences of a particular construction, and (6) the administrative construction of the statute. R.C. 1.49.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">{\u00b6 20} Although the trial court initially concluded that R.C. 709.02(E) was clear, it found, in the alternative, that even if the statute were ambiguous, a comparison of the current version of R.C. 709.02(E) with the pre-Senate Bill 5 version supported its interpretation. The trial court concluded, \u201c[I]t is clear that excluding those who hold land easements was the object sought to be attained by the legislature. The focus of the new statute- is on the type of ownership interest in the land to be annexed, not on the entity who own[s] it. This reading of the statute gives it meaning when compared to the old language of R.C. 709.02.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 21} In support of the trial court\u2019s interpretation, Waterwheel indicates that the former version of R.C. 709.02 \u201cgave rise to controversy upon both whether the state or a political subdivision could be an owner for annexation and how to treat streets and highways included within an annexation territory, which may vary depending upon how the right-of-way fee was owned (by abutting owners subject to an easement for right of way or by a political subdivision who was not included within the statutory definition of owner).\u201d Waterwheel states:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe practical result of the definitional and ownership inconsistencies was for annexation petitioners to exclude roadway[s] from annexation territories to avoid these ownership issues. Courts became divided upon how to treat the \u2018ownership\u2019 of roads and county commissioners throughout the state developed policies on whether only portions of roadway included in annexation territories would be approved. Streets or highways that should logically be included in annexation territory were left out to avoid possible ownership issues sometimes leaving long sections of streets in a township that was surrounded on both sides by a city except for a small municipal crossing. [Senate Bill 5] was enacted to eliminate these issues and to encourage the annexation of roadways to the cities that would be serving the annexation territory and to allow for the logical inclusion of roads without regard to the nature of the varying ownership interests in them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 23} The relators do not disagree with the trial court\u2019s statement that \u201cexcluding those who hold land easements was the object sought to be attained by the legislature.\u201d They argue, however, that they do not hold an easement over their portions of Jackson Road- \u2014 they own the property in fee; it is the township or county that holds an easement to use their property as a right of way. As to the reasons for amending R.C. 709.02, relators state:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cUltimately, the statutory exception of \u2018highway [and other] rights-of-way\u2019 (held in fee or by easement or dedication) had to have been inserted into R.C. 709.02 to clarify that holders of such interest did not need to be counted as owners. Prior to the annexation law amendments, there was conflict on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>issue, for example, as to whether the state of Ohio should be counted as an owner, when it held a right-of-way in either fee or by easement for highway purposes. * * * In short, there is not support for the proposition that the amendment was intended to divest property owners of full property rights, including the right to participate in the annexation process when their properties (or any portion thereof) are being annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cWith the above in mind, it makes sense to exclude from the definition of owner those persons or entities that hold limited interests in property. Inclusion of holders of lesser interests as owners would have the absurd result of having a given piece of property have both the fee owner and a holder of a lesser [interest] being both counted as owners. The Excluded Property Owners are not merely holders of one of these limited interests but owners with the power to grant \u2018rights of way\u2019 and \u2018easements.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 26} The parties are correct that several controversies arose regarding which entities were owners of property for purposes of annexation and whether the state could be considered an owner. However, we have found no legislative history \u2014 and the parties have cited none \u2014 to clarify the intent of the legislature in modifying the definition of \u201cowner.\u201d The Final Bill Analysis provided by the Ohio Legislative Service Commission merely states, \u201cThe act modifies former law\u2019s definition of an \u2018owner\u2019 to <em>include </em>the state and any political subdivision, and to <em>exclude </em>railroad, utility, street, and highway rights-of-way held in fee, by easement, or by dedication and acceptance.\u201d This review merely tracks the language of the statute and does not resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 27} As noted by the trial court, the former version of R.C. 709.02 excepted certain entities that \u201cheld easements.\u201d Thus, the focus of the exception was to exclude from the definition of \u201cowner\u201d certain entities that held a particular interest that was less than a freehold estate in land. We agree that a comparison of the former and current versions of R.C. 709.02 indicates that the current exception is not drafted to exclude certain holders of property interests from the meaning of \u201cowner.\u201d Rather, by eliminating the language that certain individuals or entities \u201cholding easements are not included\u201d and excluding instead easements and rights of way, the exception focuses on eliminating certain property interests from the meaning of \u201cfreehold estates.\u201d In other words, as now constructed, R.C. 709.02 essentially states that owners are those who hold freehold estates in land, except if those freehold estates are easements or certain rights of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 28} Waterwheel and the city would have us conclude that this interpretation is clear and resolves the issue. It does not. Even with this construction, ambiguity exists because rights of way and easements are not necessarily similar terms. R.C. 4511.01(UU)(2) defines \u201cright-of-way\u201d as \u201c[a] general term denoting land, property, or <em>the interest therein, </em>usually in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>configuration of a strip, acquired for or devoted to transportation purposes. When used in this context, right-of-way includes the roadway, shoulders or berm, ditch, and slopes extending to the right-of-way limits under the control of the state or local authority.\u201d (Emphasis added). In contrast, an easement is \u201ca property interest in the land of another which entitles the owner of the easement to a limited use of the land in which the interest exists.\u201d Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (2005), Easements and Licenses, Section 1. Thus, while \u201ceasement\u201d refers to the right to use land in a particular way, the term \u201cright of way\u201d may refer to either the land itself <em>or </em>the right to use the land for the purpose of a transportation right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 29} In our view, to read R.C. 709.02\u2019s exception consistently, it must be read to exclude either the land that is subject to the excluded property interest or the property interest. Although the current version deleted language related to \u201cholders of easements,\u201d we read R.C. 709.02 to mean that \u201cowner\u201d excludes those whose freehold estate consists of an easement but not those whose property is subject to an easement. Reading the exclusion of rights of way in a similar vein, the statute excludes those whose freehold estate consists of the right-of-way interest, but not those with a different freehold estate in that same land.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 30} In sum, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the excluded owners are not \u201cowners\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 709.02. Because the excluded owners had a non-right-of-way freehold interest in a portion of property to be annexed, they do not fall within the statutory exception. Rather, R.C. 709.02 excludes the owner of the right-of-way interest, which in this case is the township.</p>\n<p id=\"A_k\">{\u00b6 31} Waterwheel asserts that this interpretation renders meaningless the provision that state and political subdivisions are not \u201cowners\u201d unless they sign the petition. We disagree. Although the state and political subdivisions would necessarily hold public street or highway rights of way, other interests that are subject to the exception \u2014 railroad rights of way, for example \u2014 are not necessarily owned by the state. See <em>Rieger v. Penn Cent. Corp. </em>(May 21, 1985), Greene App. No. 85-CA-11, 1985 WL 7919. Accordingly, the exclusion of the state and political subdivisions as owners is not inconsistent with our interpretation of R.C. 709.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 32} Waterwheel has also asserted that because relators are not owners within the meaning of R.C. 709.02(E), they lacked standing to challenge the county commissioner\u2019s decision granting the annexation. Because the excluded owners fall within R.C. 709.02(E)\u2019s definition of \u201cowners,\u201d they clearly have standing. Waterwheel has also asserted that Butler Township lacks standing. While we question whether the township has standing to seek an injunction, declaratory judgment, or mandamus concerning annexations under R.C. 709.023, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>we need not resolve this issue at this time. Butler Township and the excluded owners have jointly appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling. Because the excluded owners have standing to assert the assignments of error, the township\u2019s status has no bearing on the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">{\u00b6 33} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 34} II. \u201cThe trial court erred in denying relators-appellants\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction on the ground that the property owners were not \u2018owners\u2019 for purposes of annexation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 35} In their second assignment of error, relators contend that the trial court improperly denied their motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 36} An injunction is an equitable remedy that should be used only when an adequate remedy at law is not available. <em>Garono v. State </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 171, 173, 524 N.E.2d 496. A trial court may, in its discretion, grant an injunction to prevent a future wrong that the law cannot. Id. \u201cThe purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo.\u201d <em>Westco Group, Inc. v. City Mattress </em>(Aug. 15, 1991), Montgomery App No. 12619, 1985 WL 144712. In determining whether to grant injunctive relief, the court considers the following factors: (1) the likelihood or probability of a plaintiffs success on the merits, (2) whether the issuance of the injunction will prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiff, (3) what injury to others will be caused by the granting of the injunction, and (4) whether the public interest will be served by the granting of the injunction. <em>Corbett v. Ohio Bldg. Auth. </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 44, 49, 619 N.E.2d 1145; <em>Premier Health Care Servs., Inc. v. Schneiderman </em>(Dec. 28, 2001), Montgomery App. No. 18795, 2001 WL 1658167.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 37} In our judgment, the trial court erred in its conclusion that a preliminary injunction should not be granted in this case. First, because the excluded owners are owners within the meaning of R.C. 709.02(E), they have demonstrated that fewer than 100 percent of the owners of property to be annexed had signed the petition, and, thus, there is a strong likelihood that they would succeed on their challenge of Waterwheel\u2019s R.C. 709.023 annexation petition. Second, as owners of property to be annexed, there is a strong likelihood that the excluded owners would be harmed by permitting the annexation of their property, without their consent, where an expedited procedure is being employed. Third, although an injunction would delay the annexation of Waterwheel\u2019s property by the city of Union, this harm has minimal weight if Waterwheel\u2019s use of R.C. 709.023 was inappropriate or improperly employed. Finally, it is apparent that the public interest would be served by preserving the status quo while the excluded owners challenge the annexation petition to which they did not consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>{\u00b6 38} The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">{\u00b6 39} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-6\">Brogan, P.J., and Donovan, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-13\">.
