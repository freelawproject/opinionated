In granting this request, the court denied Kerlakian\u2019s request for a protective order as to these same documents. The order, in truth, directs Kerlakian\u2019s co-defendant Good Samaritan Hospital to produce the disputed records, as the hospital maintains custody of the disputed documents. Good Samaritan is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">{\u00b6 2} Sandra Richards, individually and as the executor of the estate of her late son, Brett Thomas Richards, brought a wrongful-death action against Kerlakian after Brett died following gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y) surgery performed by Kerlakian at Good Samaritan Hospital. In the amended complaint, Richards alleged medical malpractice against various defendants and negligent credentialing against Good Samaritan Hospital. She and her husband also pursued loss-of-consortium claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">{\u00b6 3} During the discovery phase of the pending litigation, Richards requested that Kerlakian produce redacted copies of all operative reports for Roux-en-Y surgeries he had performed at Good Samaritan Hospital. Kerlakian moved for a protective order, arguing that disclosure would violate the physician-patient privilege and that the records were unnecessary for the plaintiffs to pursue their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court compelled production of the documents, specifying in its order that Kerlakian deliver to plaintiffs all \u201coperative reports for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures performed by Dr. Kerlakian on or before April 16, 2000.\u201d The court added language designed to protect the identities of the former patients: \u201cThe operative reports shall be redacted to exclude patient\u2019s name, address, telephone number, social security number, physician/patient discussions and/or any other personally identifiable information,\u201d and \u201c[t]his information is not to be shared with any outside source or filed with the Court, except under seal and with prior agreement of all parties and/or order of the Court. This information may be shared in confidence with only those individuals who are or may be expected to be witnesses at the trial of this matter.\u201d The court also included a provision for the plaintiffs\u2019 return of the redacted operative-report copies at the conclusion of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">{\u00b6 5} In his appeal, Kerlakian relies on R.C. 2317.02, which sets out the testimonial privilege of patient and physician communications. There is little dispute that the operative reports requested fall under the statute\u2019s definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>the term \u201ccommunication,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the records fall under the scope of R.C. 2317.02. But the privilege afforded under R.C. 2317.02 is not absolute. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the discovery of such protected communications may be appropriate under certain circumstances, such as to further a countervailing interest that outweighs the nonparty patient\u2019s interest in confidentiality.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ohio courts have allowed discovery of confidential information under these circumstances, as long as the nonparty patient\u2019s identity is sufficiently protected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Likewise, courts in other jurisdictions have concluded that the medical records of a nonparty patient may be discovered where identifying information is deleted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">{\u00b6 6} In this case, the plaintiffs requested the medical documents to develop a primary claim against Good Samaritan on the issue of negligent credentialing. It is difficult to imagine how else the negligent-credentialing claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>could have been investigated without the disputed documents. The plaintiffs presented a second purpose for the operative reports: to impeach portions of Kerlakian\u2019s deposition testimony. They presented this argument with specificity, indicating how the operative reports could be used as impeaching documents. We note that we are not deciding whether the information requested would ultimately be admissible, but whether the information sought is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">{\u00b6 7} Kerlakian argues that this case cannot be distinguished from <em>Wozniak v. Kombrink,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where this court reversed the trial court\u2019s order allowing the production of privileged medical documents. In <em>Wozniak, </em>the plaintiff wanted a large amount of nonparty medical records solely for the purpose of impeaching expert-witness testimony. The trial court ordered redaction of the names of the nonparty patients prior to production, but the reports still contained sufficient identifying information to compromise the privacy of the nonparty patients. In reversing the trial court, we held that the risk of disclosing a patient\u2019s identity outweighed the benefit to Wozniak in impeaching the testimony of an expert witness, especially where Wozniak had less intrusive means to obtain the same information.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">{\u00b6 8} Here, the plaintiffs sought the records to impeach a <em>party defendant </em>and to develop a primary claim. The trial court crafted adequate protection for the identity of the nonparty patients and included language to protect against indiscriminate dissemination of the information sought to be discovered. The court specifically weighed the risk of disclosure of this information otherwise protected by R.C. 2317.02 against the plaintiffs\u2019 compelling need for the information. Under these circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Kerlakian\u2019s request for a protective order and in ordering production of the redacted records.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">{\u00b6 9} The assignment of error is overruled and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b860-9\">Gorman, P.J., and Painter, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-6\">.
