Roudebush had leased retail space for Stephenson\u2019s Apparel from Madden, but disappeared after the business closed, leaving rent and utilities unpaid. Madden pursued its claim for unpaid rent and utilities against DiPasquale, claiming that he and Roudebush were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>partners in Stephenson\u2019s Apparel and, therefore, jointly and severally liable on Madden\u2019s claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">{\u00b6 3} The matter was referred to a magistrate, who entered a decision against DiPasquale on Madden\u2019s claim for relief on a finding that Roudebush and DiPasquale were partners in Stephenson\u2019s Apparel. DiPasquale filed objections. The trial court sustained his objections, finding that no partnership existed, and entered judgment for DiPasquale. Madden appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe trial court erred in focusing on two \u2018essential elements\u2019 of a partnership rather than considering the totality of the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred in concluding that Dr. DiPasquale was not a partner of Stephenson\u2019s Apparel because he had not intended to share in the losses of the partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">{\u00b6 6} The threshold issue was whether Roudebush and DiPasquale were partners, because DiPasquale had neither negotiated nor signed the lease with Madden and DiPasquale\u2019s liability for unpaid rent and utilities due under the lease could exist only if he and Roudebush were partners in Stephenson\u2019s Apparel.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">{\u00b6 7} There was no written partnership agreement between Roudebush and DiPasquale, who insisted that he was not a partner but only a creditor of Roudebush and Stephenson\u2019s Apparel. The trial court did not expressly find that DiPasquale was a creditor, but it rejected Madden\u2019s contention that DiPasquale and Roudebush were partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\"> {\u00b6 8} A partnership is \u201can association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.\u201d R.C. 1775.05(A). The existence of a partnership may be express, as by an agreement, or implied from the conduct of the persons concerned. An implied partnership must be found to exist from the totality of the attendant facts and circumstances. <em>Ehrhardt v. Abbate, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 79679, 2002-Ohio-2716, 2002 WL 1265569.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 1775.06 sets out three rules to determine the existence of a partnership. The only one of those relevant to these facts and circumstances is division (D), which states: \u201cThe receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business, but no such inference shall be drawn if such profits were received in payment: (l)[a]s a debt by installments or otherwise * *</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>{\u00b6 10} The trial court rejected Madden\u2019s claim that DiPasquale was a partner of Roudebush, relying, in substantial part, on a finding that though DiPasquale \u201cmay have expected to share in the profits of Stephenson\u2019s Apparel, he did not expect to share in its losses. In other words, he intended to be there in good times, but not in bad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">{\u00b6 11} It is doubtful that anyone who opens a retail business does so with an expectation of losses. R.C. 1775.17(A) imposes a duty on partners to \u201ccontribute toward the losses * * * sustained by the partnership according to the partner\u2019s share in the profits.\u201d The duty to share in losses is therefore a product of statute, not the subjective expectations of the persons concerned. Whether a partnership exists must be otherwise determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">{\u00b6 12} DiPasquale purchased $40,000 in inventory for Stephenson\u2019s Apparel. He opened a business checking account for Stephenson\u2019s Apparel, indicating that it was a partnership business. Otherwise, there was no evidence of his authority to bind the business and none that he had any control over its day-to-day operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">{\u00b6 13} The only return DiPasquale received on his investment was two checks in the amount of $1,000 each made payable to him by Roudebush. The two canceled checks indicated on the memo line that they were for \u201cLoan Repayment,\u201d but it was unclear who had made that entry. DiPasquale was unable to say what interest rate or repayment terms attached to his alleged loan to Roudebush. He said that he expected to recoup any losses from the inventory he had purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">{\u00b6 14} The two \u201cessential elements\u201d of a partnership to which the first assignment of error refers were, apparently, the authority to bind the partnership and a duty to share in any losses. We cannot find that the court limited its consideration to them and ignored other relevant circumstances. The first assignment of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">{\u00b6 15} With respect to the second assignment of error, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s consideration of the circumstances was directly and prejudicially affected by its erroneous finding that because DiPasquale had no subjective expectation to share in losses, he was not a partner. The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that there was insufficient evidence of the amount of utilities due under the lease between Madden and Stephenson\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Madden offered evidence, which was uncontradicted, that Stephenson\u2019s Apparel and Roudebush agreed to pay utility charges for the rented space at the rate of $900 per month. The trial court made no award on the claim, but neither did it make a finding denying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">{\u00b6 18} If DiPasquale is not liable to Madden, as the trial court held, then the particular error herein assigned is moot. If, on remand, the court finds for Madden and against DiPasquale, the court may proceed to grant or deny the claim for unpaid utility charges on the evidence before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">{\u00b6 19} The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">{\u00b6 20} Having sustained the second assignment of error, we reverse the judgment from which this appeal was taken and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b89-9\">Brogan, P.J. and Wolff, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
