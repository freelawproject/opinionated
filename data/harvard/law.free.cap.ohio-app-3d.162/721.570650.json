Rocco, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Mark Ducic, appeals from his convictions on two counts of aggravated murder with specifications and the sentences subsequently imposed upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">{\u00b6 2} Ducic asserts that his convictions are based upon insufficient evidence. He further asserts that his convictions are the result of the admission during trial of improper \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. Lastly, Ducic claims that the trial court failed to comply with statutory requirements in imposing consecutive terms for his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">{\u00b6 3} After a thorough review of the lengthy record, however, this court cannot agree with Ducic; therefore, his convictions and sentences are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">{\u00b6 4} Ducic\u2019s convictions result, in part, from his own inability to remain quiet about his role in the deaths of two of his friends. Although both deaths originally seemed accidental, his boasts that he had caused the deaths reopened investigation into them.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">{\u00b6 5} The first death occurred on August 5, 2001. That morning, Ducic informed Marie Miller, his ex-wife, over the telephone that he and his current girlfriend, Barbara Davis, had spent the night at Donald Ehrke\u2019s house and that he had awoken to find Davis not breathing but foaming at the mouth. Miller responded frantically; she ordered Ducic to call 911. Ducic indicated he would. Nearly an hour later, Ducic made the call, but by that time, Davis was beyond medical aid; she was pronounced dead at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>{\u00b6 6} The subsequent autopsy indicated that Davis had died from a drug overdose, since she had ingested alcohol, Valium, hydrocodone (found in Vicodin), and lethal amounts of oxycodone (found in OxyContin), and cocaine. David Borez, the Euclid police detective assigned to investigate Davis\u2019s death, thought some circumstances surrounding it seemed suspicious. First, Ducic did not appear to be upset by his girlfriend\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 7} Indeed, Miller and another female friend arrived on the scene just after Davis\u2019s body had been transported and found Ducic unaffected. He even confided to them he wanted a prostitute. Ehrke, in contrast, seemed panicked while he sought to clean his house of drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 8} Since the circle of friends in which Ducic, Davis, and Ehrke moved was highly involved in drug use, Davis\u2019s death by overdose was not out of the realm of possibility. Ducic, in particular, seemed to enjoy insisting that his friends indulge in various drugs. Nevertheless, Davis\u2019s friends did not know her to use OxyContin, which was one of the drugs found in a lethal amount in her system.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 9} Ducic, on the other hand, used OxyContin often. Thus, Davis\u2019s brother was not alerted when Ducic called him on August 4, 2001, seeking to purchase a highly potent form of the drug. Ducic made the purchase just before he and Davis left for Ehrke\u2019s house that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">{\u00b6 10} Second, Borez knew that Ducic had waited for some time after discovering Davis\u2019s condition before summoning emergency services. Upon speaking with several acquaintances of the couple, Borez found that their relationship was not only violent, but strained.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">{\u00b6 11} For instance, during a recent fight, Ducic struck Davis with a car, injuring her legs. Miller knew that Davis was tired of Ducic\u2019s taking her money and letting her take the blame for his drug activities. Moreover, the night before Davis\u2019s death, as friends gave them a ride to Ehrke\u2019s house, Davis and Ducic argued in the back seat of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">{\u00b6 12} Without any particular evidence of foul play, however, the county coroner ruled Davis\u2019s death accidental, and Borez closed the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">{\u00b6 13} The second death occurred on December 17, 2002. It occurred in the same home as the first; Donald Ehrke was discovered sitting dead in an easy chair in his living room with a remote control in his hand, facing a blank television screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">{\u00b6 14} This death also looked suspicious for several reasons. Although Ehrke was obsessive about locking his doors, they were open that morning. His gun collection was missing. Moreover, although Ehrke\u2019s medical history indicated that he took several prescription medications and he died from a drug overdose, his stomach contained no tablets, and his system did not contain his prescription <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>medications. Instead, Ehrke\u2019s blood contained significant amounts of codeine, the antidepressant mirtazapine, the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine, cocaine, and Vicodin.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 15} Only one person, Kenny Watson, admitted visiting Ehrke the previous night; Watson noticed that Ehrke was not acting like himself. However, Ducic told his drug supplier, Kenny Frost, before the body was discovered that Ehrke was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 16} Prescription cough medicine is composed largely of codeine. A few days prior to Ehrke\u2019s death, Ducic telephoned Miller to ask her to fill her prescription for Hydromet cough syrup because Ehrke was ill. Miller complied and took the bottle to Ehrke\u2019s house. When Ducic later returned the bottle, it was empty. Ducic told her Ehrke drank it, but Miller noticed that Ehrke did not appear to have done so. The autopsy of Ehrke\u2019s body indicated that his lungs were infected with pneumonia at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">{\u00b6 17} Significantly, Ehrke was the only other person present in his house besides Ducic when Davis died. Also significantly, approximately a month before Ehrke\u2019s death, Ducic learned that an indictment had been issued against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">{\u00b6 18} Ducic initially did not know the exact offense with which he was charged; he told his current girlfriend that he assumed Ehrke had \u201cbetrayed\u201d him. However, the charge actually was one of stalking his girlfriend. Ducic was arrested for this offense and was released on bond on December 5, 2002. Soon thereafter, Ehrke began to argue with him over a $500 debt. Within days, Ehrke died.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">{\u00b6 19} Ehrke\u2019s death raised no immediate investigation; therefore, the county coroner ruled it accidental. Ducic went on with his life at his mother\u2019s home, partying with friends and supplying drugs to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">{\u00b6 20} One of the friends who reconnected with Ducic in late 2002 was Brad Weiss. Weiss knew Ducic from a previous time in prison together. At the time Weiss rekindled his acquaintance, he worked as a confidential reliable informant to the Cleveland Police Department. Weiss helped law enforcement personnel obtain evidence against some well-respected businessmen who engaged in drug trafficking. Weiss felt no obligation to inform on his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">{\u00b6 21} His situation, however, changed in the spring of 2003. By that time, Weiss had committed several traffic offenses and had unwittingly become involved in a theft of jewelry. These events placed his parole status in jeopardy. Seeking to forestall a return to prison, Weiss told Cleveland Police Detective Greg Whitney, along with Ohio State Pharmacy Board agent Lynn Mudra, that he had heard Ducic bragging about killing two people. Ducic had indicated that no one knew that the murders had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Whitney and Mudra checked into Weiss\u2019s information. After reviewing the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Davis and Ehrke, they implemented a plan with Weiss. Since Ducic trusted Weiss as a drug user, Weiss was sent to make a series of controlled buys at Ducic\u2019s home. Additionally, the jewelry theft was used to make Weiss look desperate for a way to maintain his freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 23} An electronic device placed on Weiss\u2019s person recorded each of his visits to Ducic\u2019s house. Weiss made drug purchases there several times during the summer months of 2003. Whitney and Mudra thus not only discovered that Ducic had access to and could provide each of the controlled substances that the victims\u2019 bodies contained, but further that Ducic had devised an unsuspected method to kill persons who were known drug users.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 24} In his conversation with Weiss recorded on June 11, 2003, Ducic advised that all that was necessary was \u201cto plan ahead a little bit.\u201d Since Weiss confided that the woman who was going to prosecute him for the theft used OxyContin, Ducic told him that about a month before her desired death, Weiss should \u201cgive [her] some Peres, couple some Oxys, then, Bam! All of a sudden, you know, she does a \u2018hot shot\u2019 \u2014 bam, she is through \u2014 they\u2019ll say man, she has been partying for six months; man, it was just an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">{\u00b6 25} Ducic explained that a \u201chot shot\u201d was an overdose and that he had \u201cthis sh- that was included in it.\u201d Ducic questioned whether Weiss believed \u201call these people around me are OD\u2019d by accident?\u201d He went on to boast that \u201ctwo people around me * * * had it coming\u201d and that he was suspected of causing their deaths, but that \u201cone of the hardest charges to prove is OD.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 26} The following day, Ducic advised Weiss to introduce him to the woman who planned to prosecute for the theft, so he could have \u201caccess to her.\u201d Ducic reassured Weiss he could \u201cdo her,\u201d saying, \u201cI know I can do it. I can do it anytime. I can do something that has been done twice in the last year and a half. I did two of them and they cannot touch me.\u201d Ducic made a similar boast on June 17 in a conversation with Weiss, stating that \u201cBarb\u201d and \u201cDon\u201d both died in \u201cDon\u2019s house,\u201d and that, although he briefly had been in jail, the \u201ccops * * * can\u2019t do anything to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">{\u00b6 27} On June 28, Ducic repeated his skepticism that Weiss could commit murder, saying, \u201c[T]his is hard core, man; there is [sic] not too many people who can * * * [get] away with two murders in the last year and a half in Euclid and they cannot touch me.\u201d Ducic warned Weiss that after committing the act, \u201cthey question you,\u201d and a person had to know how to act. Ducic \u201cwas crying, [he] played it off so good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">{\u00b6 28} By July 7, 2003, Ducic told Weiss he would do the \u201chit\u201d for \u201cfive thousand.\u201d During a conversation recorded on August 1, Ducic asked Weiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>when he wanted it done, told him it was \u201cgood\u201d that the intended victim took \u201cOxys\u201d because an overdose of the \u201cwhole bottle\u201d of the \u201cwould-be Oxy\u201d he had in storage would not be traceable, and reassured Weiss that if OxyContin were already in the victim\u2019s system, her death would not be \u201csuspicious.\u201d Ducic encouraged Weiss to think of it as \u201cjust an OD.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">{\u00b6 29} Whitney and Mudra took the recordings to the county coroner. After listening to portions of them, she changed her rulings in both Davis\u2019s and Ehrke\u2019s deaths from accidental to homicide. The detective and the agent also obtained a search warrant for Ducic\u2019s home and an arrest warrant for him. Before he knew what the charges against him were, Ducic protested that the death was \u201cnot a murder but a manslaughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">{\u00b6 30} The grand jury issued an indictment against Ducic that charged him with the following offenses: two counts of aggravated murder, R.C. 2903.01, the first with a course-of-conduct specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and the second with three additional death-penalty specifications;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> attempted aggravated murder, R.C. 2903.01/2929.02; conspiracy to commit aggravated murder, R.C. 2903.03/2923.01; and 16 counts of drug trafficking, R.C. 2925.03. Ducic remained in jail pending trial. Even there, he lacked the ability to remain quiet about his role in the deaths of Davis and Ehrke.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 31} Ducic discussed his case with one of his cellmates, Edward Farrell. He stated that he \u201chad killed two people and one person he had chased down the street with a knife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">{\u00b6 32} In his conversations with Farrell, Ducic admitted that he \u201cOD\u2019ed [Davis] on a bunch of different types of drugs\u201d because \u201cshe was * * * getting ready to go to the * * * police on him,\u201d and her death contained some irony because \u201che got the OxyContin from her brother.\u201d He elaborated that he gave her \u201ca bunch of different kinds of narcotics, Percocet, OxyContin, a mixture of stuff,\u201d with \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">{\u00b6 33} Ducic admitted Ehrke\u2019s death was \u201cdone the exact same way\u201d because \u201che was afraid that Don was going to go to the police about him because Don knew about him killing Barb.\u201d Ducic told Farrell he killed Ehrke \u201cabout 16 months later\u201d; Ducic \u201cwent to a basement * * * mixed a bunch of stuff together and * * * some of the stuff * * * didn\u2019t even show up in the coroner\u2019s report.\u201d Ehrke was a good friend, though, so \u201cthe best thing he could do for him * * * was let him die in his favorite chair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>{\u00b6 34} Ducic further told Farrell how he would defend himself in court by confiding that he planned to convince the jury that he was merely a big talker who lied about things. Farrell subsequently became a witness against him. When Ducic discovered the betrayal, he told a corrections officer that he knew where Farrell was and that \u201che was going to have him taken care of\u2019; the corrections officer took his words to be a threat. Ducic\u2019s statement later became the basis for an additional indictment against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The two cases ultimately were joined for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 35} Ducic\u2019s jury trial took nearly a month to complete. After hearing the testimony of the witnesses and reviewing all the evidence presented, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts except one count of drug trafficking. Since the jury subsequently could not reach a unanimous verdict regarding a sentencing recommendation on the two counts of capital murder, the judge sentenced Ducic on these convictions to two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. The terms on the remaining counts were ordered to be served concurrently with each other and with the first two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 36} Ducic presents the following three assignments of error in his appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cI. The trial court erred by failing to grant the defendant-appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29(A), Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure with respect to Counts One and Two of the indictment wherein Mark Ducic was charged with the offenses of aggravated murder with specifications relating to the deaths of Barbara Davis and Donald Ehrke, as the State failed to [present] sufficient evidence that Mark Ducic committed those offenses, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cII. The trial court erred by permitting the introduction into evidence of highly prejudicial \u2018other act\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cHI. The trial judge erred by imposing consecutive sentences and the explanation justifying these sentences was inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">{\u00b6 40} With respect to his first assignment of error, Ducic claims that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Davis\u2019s and Ehrke\u2019s deaths were aggravated murders instead of accidents. He essentially contends that since no one actually witnessed him committing the killings, the trial court should have granted his motions for acquittal on these two counts. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">{\u00b6 41} A defendant\u2019s motions for acquittal should be denied if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could reach different conclusions as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>whether each material element of the crimes has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Dennis </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 421, 683 N.E.2d 1096; <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492; <em>State v. Bridgeman </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 261, 9 O.O.3d 401, 381 N.E.2d 184. The trial court is required to view the evidence in a light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. Thus, circumstantial evidence alone may be used to support a murder conviction. <em>State v. Anderson </em>(May 12, 1994), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 65378, 65379, 1994 WL 189401.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 42} In this case, Weiss and Farrell testified that Ducic admitted committing both murders, explained his motives, told them the means by which he did so, and displayed not regret, but pride in both deeds. Their testimony concerning Ducic\u2019s admissions found support in the autopsy protocols, which detailed the particular drugs found in each victim, the circumstances surrounding each death, and other physical evidence presented in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 43} Based upon the prodigious amount of evidence produced, the trial court correctly concluded that Ducic\u2019s guilt of the crimes was for the jury to determine. <em>State v. Gray, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83097, 2004-Ohio-1454, 2004 WL 584187. Ducic\u2019s first assignment of error, therefore, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 44} Ducic next challenges the admission of evidence that he threatened Farrell. He argues the evidence contravened the stricture of Evid.R. 404(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 45} Apparently, Ducic believes that his failure to appeal his conviction in the second case prevents this court from considering the trial court\u2019s joinder of his indictment on charges of intimidation and retaliation with the charges in the instant case for purposes of trial. Such an assertion, however, is baseless; this court is neither so constricted nor so simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">{\u00b6 46} Ducic\u2019s indictment on those charges was predicated upon the threats he made when he discovered that Farrell had reported his admissions about the murders. Since the evidence Ducic now challenges was presented to establish the elements of those charges and inextricably related to the charges made in the instant case, his argument with respect to Evid.R. 404(B) is not persuasive. <em>State v. Santiago, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 78678, 78715, 2001 WL 1141381.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">{\u00b6 47} Accordingly, Ducic\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">{\u00b6 48} Ducic challenges in his third assignment of error the trial court\u2019s decision to impose consecutive life sentences for his two aggravated murder convictions. He complains that the trial court failed to comply with \u201cR.C. 2929.13(E)(4).\u201d Presumably, Ducic means R.C. 2929.74 (E)(4), which is the section that actually applies to consecutive sentences. Ducic\u2019s challenge is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>{\u00b6 49} Together, R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and R.C. 2929.19(B)(2) require the trial court to state certain findings and reasons before imposing consecutive sentences upon a defendant. The decision set forth in <em>State v. Comer, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-4165, 793 N.E.2d 473, further requires those findings and reasons to be delivered at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 50} In <em>State v. Porterfield, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 5, 2005-Ohio-3095, 829 N.E.2d 690, at paragraph two of the syllabus, the Supreme Court expressly stated that R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) applies to sentences for aggravated murder. A review of the transcript of Ducic\u2019s sentencing hearing demonstrates that the trial court fully complied with its statutory duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">{\u00b6 51} The court stated that consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the public and to punish Ducic, that they were not disproportionate to the seriousness of his conduct and the danger he posed to the public, that Ducic had an extensive criminal record, and that anything other than consecutive terms would diminish the seriousness of his crimes. The trial court additionally reasoned that Ducic\u2019s lack of remorse, willingness to commit yet another murder after accepting $500 as a down payment, and demonstration that he was \u201c[s]till the con man\u201d justified the consecutive terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 52} Based upon the trial court\u2019s compliance with R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), Ducic\u2019s third assignment of error also is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 53} Ducic\u2019s convictions and sentences are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b764-10\">Blackmon, P.J., and Gallagher, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-10\">. These were as follows: a specification that the second aggravated murder was committed to prevent detection of the first, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), a course-of-conduct specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and the purposeful-killing-of-a-witness specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-12\">. Although this case is not the subject of Ducic's appeal and is therefore not included in the record, the file in the instant case demonstrates that Ducic was charged with one count of intimidation and one count of retaliation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
