Subsequently, on January 22, 2001, Kreischer was convicted of felonious assault and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $9,163.16 to appellee. Pursuant to an opinion filed on January 23, 2002, in <em>State v. Kreischer, </em>Perry App. No. 01-CA-04, 2002-Ohio-357, 2002 WL 106683, this court affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction, but held that the evidence did not support a restitution award of $9,163.16. The matter was then remanded to the trial court for a new hearing on restitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">{\u00b6 3} On August 27, 2003, appellee filed a complaint against appellant and James Ponsart in the Perry County Court of Common Pleas. Appellee, in his complaint, alleged that after appellant was charged, but before he was convicted of felonious assault, he transferred his interest in specific real property to James Ponsart, a friend, and that the transfer was a fraudulent conveyance. Appellee sought relief pursuant to R.C. 1336.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Thereafter, the following evidence was adduced at the bench trial on April 21, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">{\u00b6 5} At trial, James Ponsart testified that, in 1995, he and appellant purchased approximately 18.4 acres of vacant land in Perry County, Ohio, from Howell Investments for the purchase price of $10,000. At the time of the purchase, the April 7, 1995 deed for the property was put in appellant\u2019s name only, although Ponsart considered himself half owner of the property. On or about April 6, 1995, Ponsart had given Mary Kreischer, appellant\u2019s wife, a $5,000 cashier\u2019s check made payable to her for his half of the property. Ponsart obtained the money after taking out a loan with Metropolitan Savings Bank of Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 6} Both Ponsart and appellant then started building cabins on the property. The two had an understanding that if either one decided to sell his interest in the property, he would offer it to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 7} On May 28, 2000, appellant assaulted appellee and, as a result, was charged with felonious assault in the Perry County Court of Common Pleas. Pursuant to a quitclaim deed dated September 18, 2000, appellant conveyed his interest in the property to Ponsart for $10,000 in cash, which he considered a fair price. Appellant testified, via a trial deposition, that he decided to sell his interest in the property at his wife\u2019s suggestion because he needed money for legal fees. While appellant hated to get rid of the property, he testified that neither his wife nor his kids wanted to go to the property anymore because of the assault, so it made sense to sell it. When asked how he arrived at the $10,000 sale price, appellant indicated that he \u201cwanted to get out of it what I put into it, $5,000 for the property and $5,000 for the materials in the cabin.\u201d Appellant did not include labor in the purchase price, since Ponsart, an experienced carpenter, had helped him build the cabin and he did not believe that it would be fair to charge Ponsart for his own labor. Appellant testified that he had not become insolvent or bankrupt as a result of selling the real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 8} At the bench trial, Ponsart testified that he believed that he had received a bargain, since he paid appellant only $10,000 for the property and believed the property was worth $34,000. Ponsart further testified that he placed an ad in the local paper and tried to sell 6.42 acres, which is approximately a third of the original 18.4 acres, and his original cabin to Gary McNulty for $20,000. According to Ponsart, the cabin was nearly completed and only needed carpeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant further testified in his trial deposition that after he signed the deed over to Ponsart on September 18, 2000, he returned to the property in June 2003 with a reporter and a photographer from the <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer </em>to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>pictures<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that he went one other time to get his belongings. Appellant also testified that he was on the property a third time in September 2003. Appellant denied attempting to control the land after signing the deed over to Ponsart. On cross-examination, appellant testified that as of the date of his conviction for assault on January 22, 2001, he owned only a pickup truck worth approximately $3,000 and a trailer worth $500. Appellant answered in the affirmative when asked whether the truck and trailer were the only two assets in his possession as of January 22, 2001. Appellant further testified that at the time he signed the deed to Ponsart, he was employed and earning $1,000 a week and was current on all of his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant further testified that he had a marital residence that was acquired in 1996. However, appellant\u2019s name was not on the title, because when appellant and his wife refinanced the house early in 2000 to get a lower interest rate, the house was put in only his wife\u2019s name. Although appellant, on January 22, 2001, the date of his conviction, was employed by G.Q. Contracting Company and participated in its 401(K) plan, he testified that he had not vested as of January 22, 2001, and did not know the balance in his account. Appellant testified that he believed the plan had been started in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 11} On cross-examination, appellant further testified that he believed he received a fair value when he transferred the property to Ponsart in September 2000 and that his wife signed a deed in March 2001 transferring an interest to Ponsart because when \u201cJim [Ponsart] went down there to try to transfer the property * * * they wouldn\u2019t let him without her signature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 12} Mary Kreischer, appellant\u2019s wife, testified that appellant had received $10,000 for selling the property and that Ponsart paid for it in $100 and $50 bills in a white envelope. She testified that she put the money in a lockbox secured to the floor of her house and used the money for lawyer fees, bonds, and general household needs. The following testimony was adduced when Mary Kreischer was asked whether she had any other assets as of September 2000, after appellant transferred the property to Ponsart:</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cQ. * * * Did you have any other assets as of September of 2000, after the transfer of the property?</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA. Did I?</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cQ. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA. Yes, I did. My home.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cQ. Okay. Did your husband have any other assets?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>{\u00b6 18} \u201cA. He had a pickup truck and a trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ. Okay, Do you recall the testimony at your husband\u2019s restitution hearing, where he said this guy does not deserve restitution, referring to Mr. Wooten? He then went on to say, I\u2019ve spent our entire life savings and had to sale [sic] everything I own and still tens of thousands of dollars in debt because of his lies. Do you remember that?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA. Uh-huh. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cQ. As of September of 2000 did your husband have any funds?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA. As of September of 2000?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. Uh-huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. But didn\u2019t you just tell me you didn\u2019t know what he had? Where he keep [sic] his money?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. We had a joint checking account and we had the fire box.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cQ. The fire box where the 10,000 was?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cA. Uh-huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cQ. Do you have any receipt for this 10,000?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-16\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cA. Do I have a receipt?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-17\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cQ. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-18\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-19\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ. Okay. There was never any 10,000, was there?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-20\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA. There was $10,000. It\u2019s not every day you get handed $10,000, Mr. P\u00e1nico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-21\">{\u00b6 35} On cross-examination, Mary Kreischer testified that she and appellant owned a house in September 2000 and that they had equity in the house. She further testified that she owed a small amount of credit-card debt in September 2000 and had no other fixed debts other than the house mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-22\">{\u00b6 36} Marsha Wilson, a friend of appellee\u2019s, also testified at the bench trial. Wilson testified that she had met appellant, who appellee had pointed out to her on previous trips to Perry County, in June or July 2001 when he came up to her, told her that he was the property owner, and told her that she was trespassing on his land. Wilson testified that she knew that this occurred in June or July 2001 because her friend who had helped her put the quail down there with her had died the previous year, so that was the first year that she had gone by herself. Wilson showed appellant a permission slip signed by appellee, giving her permission to be on Wooten\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>{\u00b6 37} Testimony also was adduced that, prior to September 18, 2000, appellee asked appellant to reimburse him for medical expenses and lost wages related to the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">{\u00b6 38} At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court, as memorialized in an entry filed on June 18, 2004, held as follows: \u201c[T]his Court finds that the intent of the transfer [to Ponsart] was to hinder, delay or defraud Wooten [appellee] out of his claim, determines said transfer to be fraudulent and hereby orders the same to be set aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 39} Appellant now raises the following assignments of error on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cThe court erred in finding the transfer of Kreischer\u2019s interest in the real estate to Ponsart to be fraudulent so as to require that the transfer be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe trial court erred in its findings of fact relating to the \u2018badges of fraud\u2019 set forth in R.C. 1336.04(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe court erred in concluding Wooten was a creditor within the meaning of the Fraudulent Transfer Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">I, II</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">{\u00b6 43} Appellant, in his first two assignments of error, argues that the trial court erred in holding that appellant\u2019s transfer of the property to Ponsart was fraudulent and in ordering it to be set aside. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">{\u00b6 44} Appellant\u2019s assignments of error challenge the trial court\u2019s decision as being against the manifest weight of the evidence. A judgment supported by some competent, credible evidence will not be reversed by a reviewing court as against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. An appellate court must not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court when there exists some competent and credible evidence supporting the judgment rendered by the trial court. <em>Myers v. Garson </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 610, 614 N.E.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">{\u00b6 45} The Ohio Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, R.C. Chapter 1336, creates a right of action for a creditor to set aside an allegedly fraudulent transfer of assets. R.C. 1336.04 states, \u201c(A) A transfer made or an obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the claim of the creditor arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation in either of the following ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>{\u00b6 46} \u201c(1) With actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c(2) Without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation, and if either of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c(a) The debtor was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c(b) The debtor intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that he would incur, debts beyond his ability to pay as they became due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 50} The issue concerning fraudulent intent is to be determined based upon the facts and circumstances of each case, and \u201c[t]he burden of proof in an action to set aside a fraudulent conveyance must be affirmatively satisfied by the complainant.\u201d <em>Stein v. Brown </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 305, 308, 18 OBR 352, 480 N.E.2d 1121. However, in order \u201c[t]o succeed on a fraudulent-transfer claim, the creditor need not prove the elements of common-law fraud.\u201d <em>Lesick v. Medgroup Mgt., Inc. </em>(Oct. 29, 1999), Hamilton App. No. C-990097, 1999 WL 979136, at *4. Because of the difficulty in obtaining direct proof of fraudulent intent, \u201ccourts have recognized certain \u2018badges\u2019 or indicia of fraud, circumstances which usually or frequently attend a conveyance designed to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor, which in concert with other suspicious circumstances, are considered sufficient to prove fraudulent intent.\u201d <em>Barbee Concrete Constr. v. Bachinski Builders, Inc. </em>(Nov. 20, 1997), Franklin App. No. 97APE03-397,1997 WL 723195, at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 51} R.C. 1336.04(B) sets forth several of the well-established badges of fraud, and states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cIn determining actual intent under division (A)(1) of this section, consideration may be given to all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c(1) Whether the transfer or obligation was to an insider;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c(2) Whether the debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c(3) Whether the transfer or obligation was disclosed or concealed;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c(4) Whether before the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, the debtor had been sued or threatened with suit;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c(5) Whether the transfer was of substantially all of the assets of the debtor;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c(6) Whether the debtor absconded;</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>{\u00b6 59} \u201c(7) Whether the debtor removed or concealed assets;</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c(8) Whether the value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred or the amount of the obligation incurred;</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c(9) Whether the debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred;</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 62} \u201c(10) Whether the transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred;</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 63} \u201c(11) Whether the debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienholder who transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 64} If a creditor established a sufficient number of badges of fraud with regard to a transfer, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to show that the transfer was not fraudulent. See <em>Cardiovascular &amp; Thoracic Surgery of Canton, Inc. v. DiMazzio </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 162, 166, 524 N.E.2d 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 65} Appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that the transfer was fraudulent, since there is no evidence that appellant was insolvent at the time of the transfer or that he became insolvent due to the transfer. We agree. R.C. 1336.02 states, \u201c(A)(1) A debtor is insolvent if the sum of the debts of the debtor is greater than all of the assets of the debtor at a fair valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">{\u00b6 66} \u201c(2) A debtor who generally is not paying his debts as they become due is presumed to be insolvent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">{\u00b6 67} A plaintiff bears the burden of proof with respect to the issue of insolvency under Ohio\u2019s Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. <em>In re Gabor </em>(Bkrtcy.N.D.Ohio 2002) 280 B.R. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">{\u00b6 68} Upon our review of the evidence, we find that there was no evidence that appellant was insolvent at the time of the transfer of the property to Ponsart or that he became insolvent due to the transfer. Testimony was adduced at the bench trial that appellant owned a truck and trailer with a combined value of $3,500, as well as furniture, tools, and other household items. Testimony also was adduced that, other than their home mortgage, appellant and his wife had little credit-card or other debt. Appellant\u2019s wife testified that the couple had equity in their house, which they had recently refinanced. The amount of equity is unknown from the record. Appellant\u2019s wife testified that the couple had made their house payments in 2001, as well as their car payment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both appellant and his wife testified that they had not become insolvent as a result of selling the property to Ponsart. Testimony was also adduced that appellant earned $45,244 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>in 2001 and $54,114 in 2002. Based on the foregoing, we find that appellee did not meet his burden of showing that appellant was insolvent. In short, there was no evidence that at or around the time of the transfer, the sum of appellant\u2019s debts was greater than all of his assets or that appellant was not paying his bills as they became due.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 69} Based on the foregoing, we hold that the trial court erred in finding that the transfer of the property to Ponsart was substantially a transfer of all of appellant\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 70} We further find that there was not competent and credible evidence that the transfer was made to an insider. R.C. 1336.01 states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 71} \u201c(G) \u2018Insider\u2019 includes all of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 72} \u201c(1) If the debtor is an individual, any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 73} \u201c(a) A relative of the debtor or of a general partner of the debtor;</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">{\u00b6 74} \u201c(b) A partnership in which the debtor is a general partner;</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">{\u00b6 75} \u201c(c) A general partner in a partnership described in division (G)(1)(b) of this section;</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">{\u00b6 76} \u201c(d) A corporation of which the debtor is a director, officer, or person in control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">{\u00b6 77} The trial court specifically cited R.C. 1336.01(G)(1)(a) in finding that the transfer to Ponsart was to an insider. However, there is no evidence in the record that Ponsart was appellant\u2019s relative. Furthermore, at the bench trial, Ponsart testified that it was never his intention to form a partnership<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for profit with appellant with respect to the land, and appellant testified that the two never bought the land intending to make a profit. As noted by appellant, there was no evidence to the contrary. While the trial court stated that at the criminal restitution hearing on September 3, 2002, appellant identified Ponsart as his \u201cpartner,\u201d upon our review of the transcript of the hearing, we find no such statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>{\u00b6 78} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court erred in setting aside the conveyance as fraudulent, since there were not sufficient badges of fraud establishing that the transfer was fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">{\u00b6 79} Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are, therefore, sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 80} Based on the foregoing, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 81} Accordingly, the judgment of the Perry County Common Pleas Court is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b578-9\">Farmer, P.J., and Wise, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-15\">. Upon remand, the trial court ordered appellant to pay a total of $37,369.99 in restitution ($17,046.07 to appellee Wooten and $20,323.92 to Blue Cross/Blue Shield). Pursuant to an opinion filed on December 16, 2004, in <em>State v. Kreischer, </em>Perry App. No. 03CA20, 2004-Ohio-6854, 2004 WL 2958339, this court remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to enter an award of restitution of $20,323.92 to Blue Cross/Blue Shield and $2,481.31 to appellee for out-of-pocket medical expenses.
