GCCS contends that the order is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the record contains evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s determination that a PPLA is the appropriate disposition at this time. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">{\u00b6 3} Stephan Miller, who was born in 1990, suffers from Down syndrome. In 2002, Stephan was adjudicated dependent. Temporary custody was awarded to GCCS. During the time he was in the temporary custody of GCCS, Stephan had to be removed from two separate foster homes due to allegations of neglect and abuse. He was then placed with his current foster family, where the record indicates that he is doing well.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">{\u00b6 4} In 2004, GCCS filed a motion seeking permanent custody of Stephan. The guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) filed a motion seeking a modification of temporary custody to a PPLA, pursuant to R.C. 2151.353. After a hearing, the trial court entered an order modifying temporary custody to a PPLA and made the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>{\u00b6 5} \u201cStephan Miller, born January 4, 1990, is a child with special needs. He has a severe form of Down\u2019s Syndrome. Stephan\u2019s IQ has been measured at 40. His communication skills are extremely limited. Stephan needs a lot of direction from those who supervise him (foster parent, teacher) but has some self-help skills: dressing, eating and using the bathroom. He has a pacemaker, has suffered two strokes, has asthma, and often uses a wheelchair.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cSince being in the agency\u2019s custody, Stephan has been in three foster homes. He was removed from the first two placements due to the caretakers\u2019 mistreatment of other children in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cStephan has been in his current foster home since April, 2004. He has grown attached to his foster parents, especially the wife in this couple, who Stephan calls \u2018Mom\u2019. There are five other foster children in this placement and Stephan has developed a bond with the three older ones. [The foster mother has] several nephews and a niece who have \u2018taken to Stephan\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c[The natural mother] has had contact with Stephan through visitation arranged by CSB and at hospitals when Stephan has needed medical care. For the most part, the visits are positive experiences. Stephan does recognize his mother and is happy to see her.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cStephan\u2019s foster parents have adopted children with learning disabilities. [The foster mother] has received special training from Stephan\u2019s physicians to respond to Stephan\u2019s serious medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cNo adoptive placement has been identified. [The foster parents] have not made a decision on that issue. Stephan\u2019s multiple disabilities will make it more difficult to find an adoptive placement. CSB intends to contact outside sources (private adoption agencies, internet search, Down\u2019s Syndrome Association of Cincinnati) to locate prospective adoptive parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe guardian ad litem has recommended that Stephan be placed into a Planned Permanent Living Arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cBecause of Stephan\u2019s physical, mental and medical problems and needs, he is unable to function in a family-like setting and must remain in residential or institutional care.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIt is in Stephan\u2019s best interest to be placed into a Planned Permanent Living Arrangement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">{\u00b6 15} GCCS appeals from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">{\u00b6 16} The sole assignment of error follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s determination that the child is unable to function in a family-like setting and must remain in residential or institutional care is against the manifest weight of the evidence. There is absolutely no competent or credible evidence in the record to demonstrate those facts. As such, the trial court\u2019s decision could not be based upon either some competent and credible evidence, and thus, obviously cannot be based upon substantial competent and credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b6 18} Additionally, the absence of sufficient competent and credible evidence on the whole record constitutes a lack of clear and convincing evidence and constitutes an abuse of case discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 19} This assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to place Stephan in a PPLA in lieu of permanent custody. GCCS maintains that the trial court\u2019s determination that Stephan falls within the statutory criteria for permitting long-term foster care is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 20} A planned permanent living arrangement, formerly called long-term foster care, \u201cis an alternative form of custody in which the child is placed in a foster home or institution, with the intention that the child will remain in that home or institution until he is no longer in the county child services system.\u201d <em>In re D.B., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81421, 2003-Ohio-3521, 2003 WL 21511310, \u00b6 6. \u201cA PPLA does not sever the parental bonds as permanent custody does, but it also does not provide the child with a legally permanent placement.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">{\u00b621} Pursuant to R.C. 2151.353(A)(5), a PPLA is appropriate if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interest of the child and one of the following conditions is met:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">{\u00b6 22} (1) the child is unable to function in a family-like setting because of physical, mental, or psychological needs that necessitate that the child remain in residential or institutional care. R.C. 2151.353(A)(5)(a);</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">{\u00b6 23} (2) the parents have significant physical, mental, or psychological problems that prevent them from caring for the child, adoption is not in the best interest of the child, and the child retains a significant and positive relationship with a parent or relative. R.C. 2151.353(A)(5)(b); or</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">{\u00b6 24} (3) the child is 16 years of age or older and is unwilling or unable to adapt to a permanent placement. R.C. 2151.353(A)(5)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">{\u00b6 25} When a trial court determines the best interest of a child, it is required by R.C. 2151.414(D) to consider all relevant factors, including:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(1) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any other person who may significantly affect the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201c(2) The- wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(3) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period ending on or after March 18,1999;</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(4) The child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the agency;</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(5) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section apply in relation to the parents and child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cAn appellate court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s determination concerning parental rights and child custody unless the determination is not supported by sufficient evidence to meet the clear and convincing standard of proof.\u201d <em>In re Dylan C. </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 115, 121, 699 N.E.2d 107. \u201cClear and convincing evidence is that level of proof which would cause the trier of fact to develop a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be proven.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 32} The trial court\u2019s decision to place Stephan in a PPLA was based upon its finding that Stephan is not capable of living in a family-like setting and that it is therefore in his best interest to remain in long-term foster care. R.C. 2151.353(A)(5)(a). GCCS argues that this decision is against the weight of the evidence. In support, the agency argues that Stephan is currently living in a family-like setting with his foster family and is doing well.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">{\u00b6 33} The issue of what constitutes a family-like setting for this purpose has been addressed by the Eighth District Court of Appeals. <em>In re Tanker </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 159, 754 N.E.2d 813. In <em>Tanker, </em>the children were residing with a foster family in a residential setting. The court rejected the agency\u2019s claim that this fact established that the children were capable of residing in a family-like setting. Id. at 165-166, 754 N.E.2d 813. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c[T]his argument misses the point \u2014 -the foster parents are specifically trained to deal with the type of emotional and behavioral problems these children possess, so it cannot be said that the current foster home is akin to a true \u2018family-like\u2019 setting. Hence while it is certainly true that the foster parents have successfully established a \u2018family,\u2019 it does not follow that their success suggests that these troubled children could live in any \u2018home.\u2019 The court could rationally consider that these foster parents have established a family-like home for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>children precisely because they have special skills that potential adoptive parents might lack.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 35} This court has adopted the reasoning of the Eighth District. See <em>In re Priser, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19861, 2004-Ohio-1315, 2004 WL 541124. <em>Priser </em>involved a child with \u201ca variety of very serious and debilitating mental and psychological problems and special needs.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 54. The child was living with a foster family that provided a \u201csupportive, stable home environment,\u201d and the foster parents had \u201cspecial training in dealing with the type of mental, emotional and behavioral problems with which [the child] is afflicted.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 36} However, we noted that the fact that a child is residing in a home with a foster family is not dispositive of whether he is living in a family-like setting. Id. We specifically stated that the mere fact that the child was \u201cthriving and making progress in the family-like setting established by his current foster parents\u201d did not mandate a finding that he could \u201cfunction in any ordinary family-like home where the potential adoptive parents might lack the special skills possessed by [his] current foster parents.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 37} With these standards in mind, we turn to the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s findings and decision are supported by the evidence. The record contains evidence that Stephan has a profound disability with severe attendant health problems. It is clear from the testimony that his special needs would make it difficult to place him in an ordinary adoptive household. Indeed, the testimony presented by GCCS indicates that the agency, in searching for adoptive parents, would need to make inquiries regarding families that are specifically interested in children with Down syndrome. The witnesses for GCCS admitted that it will be difficult to place Stephan in an adoptive home and that any adoptive parents will need to be able to handle his special needs. The record indicates that Stephan must be placed with a family that has some sort of training or experience with his disability and health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">{\u00b6 38} Furthermore, it is clear from the record that the current foster mother has had some training from Stephan\u2019s doctors with regard to Stephan\u2019s care. For example, she has had occasion to administer shots to Stephan following surgery. Additionally, the foster mother has some training as a medical assistant. She has also worked in the rehabilitation section of a local hospital for five years, during which time she attended patients with brain injuries, including strokes. The foster mother has a certificate in special education and has experience in caring for children with special needs. In sum, there is credible evidence that the foster mother has specialized training that enables her to care appropriately for Stephan.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 39} Stephan has been in foster care for more than 12 months. The record indicates that the foster family has not made any decision with regard to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>it will adopt Stephan, given that the foster father is deployed in the military. It further appears that the foster family is willing to continue as a long-term foster family for Stephan. Stephan is attached to his foster family, but still maintains a relationship with his natural mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">{\u00b6 40} We conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that placing Stephan in a PPLA is in his best interest and that this determination does not constitute an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, the sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 41} The sole assignment of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-8\">Grady and Donovan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
