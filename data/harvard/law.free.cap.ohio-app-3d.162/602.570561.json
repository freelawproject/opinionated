Specifically, the complaint alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">On or about May 2, 2004 through on or about May 4, 2004, the child\u2019s maternal grandmother and custodian, Sandy Lawrence, left the child in the care of an individual with whom the Agency has serious concerns and prior involvement, namely Tristen Mendenhall, in Hardin County, Ohio and further Sandy Lawrence left the child without giving any person any means of contacting her. Further the Agency has had previous involvement with this child and Sandy Lawrence due to similar circumstances in the past. The Agency has taken permanent custody of children in the care of Sandy Lawrence previously. Further, the Mother has a drug and/or alcohol dependency problem which she has not sought treatment for. The putative Father is not present to care for the child. Due to the issues involved herein, it is not possible for the child to be placed with either of the child\u2019s parents within a reasonable time and/or he should not be placed with either of the child\u2019s parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">On September 1, 2004, the court ordered a hearing to be held on September 22, 2004, to determine whether C.H. was a dependent child. Furthermore, C.H. was placed in temporary custody of the Department of Job and Family Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">{\u00b6 3} On September 21, 2004, the Hardin County Sheriff attempted to serve a summons on Morrison for a hearing on placing C.H. in temporary custody with the Department of Job and Family Services, but the attempt failed. Accordingly, the hearing was postponed because of failure of service. Pursuant to a motion filed by the Department of Jobs and Family Services, the court ordered that the notice of an adjudicatory hearing be published in a newspaper of general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>circulation in and around Hardin County, Ohio, on September 22, 2004. The adjudicatory hearing was scheduled for October 21, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 4} On October 4, 2004, the Hardin County Deputy Clerk of Courts sent a legal notice to the newspaper of general circulation for publication. The notice included, inter alia, that a hearing was going to be held on October 21, 2004, to review whether C.H. should be placed in custody of the Department of Job and Family Services. The notice also informed Morrison and Lee H., C.H.\u2019s father, that they had the right to an attorney during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">{\u00b6 5} At this point, the record is unclear as to whether Morrison previously appeared in this case or had notice of the adjudicatory hearing. The hearing transcript indicates that at some point prior to the October 21, 2004 hearing, Morrison requested and received an attorney. At the hearing on October 21, 2004, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">The Court: Matter is assigned for an adjudicatory hearing and you did indicate that you did have service by publication, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">[The State:] You Honor, we filed a motion for publication back on September 22nd. The entry was approved by the Court and I believe that there has been publication on both parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">The Court: We don\u2019t have the \u2014 anything back from the newspaper yet, but assume that that\u2019s coming. Is that right? We don\u2019t have anything from the newspaper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">[The State:] Oh, I thought we had. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-11\">The Court: The legal notice that was prepared indicated that it was set for October 21st * * * in this court. Misty Morrison and Lee [H.]. And the Court previously had appointed David Goodin to represent Misty Morrison at her request. And had you appeared in Court previously\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-12\">Mr. Goodin: Yeah, I believe\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-13\">The Court: \u2014 on this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-14\">Mr. Goodin: Well, we continued the hearing last month, I believe, because of her failure to appear. I think that\u2019s what initiated publication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-15\">[The State:] (Inaudible) an initial hearing on her and Misty Morrison failed to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-16\">The Court: Didn\u2019t she appear once though?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-17\">[The State:] She appeared in the old case if the Court would recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-18\">The Court: Oh, in an old case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-19\">[The State:] We had \u2014 we had a prior filing in which she showed up\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-20\">The Court: All right. So you\u2019ve never had any service on her in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>[The State:] In this case we published. On the last case we \u2014 she was here and she was planning on admitting to dependency, but she got confused. She asked for an attorney. We were at the 90th day or close to that, so we had to dismiss and refile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">The Court: I see. So you\u2019re getting service on her by publication as well. All right. Well, we can proceed but, of course, we\u2019ll have to follow up and make sure that the notice was properly published. Mr. Goodin, have you had any contact from Ms. Morrison?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">Mr. Goodin: No, Your Honor. I made one letter \u2014 one attempt to contact her through written letter and numerous attempts through the phone calls. I would ask the Court to allow me to withdraw for failure to even contact her or to even try contacting her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">The Court: Where did we get a phone number for her? Was that \u2014 how did we get that? Was that from her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">[The State:] I don\u2019t know if the Court has a phone number. She previously was staying with her * * * [s]tep-greatgrandfather, but she is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">The Court: Is that who you were calling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">Mr. Goodin: I\u2019m really not sure where I got the phone number from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-11\">[The State:] In any event, she\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s here in Kenton * * * but she is no longer there to the best of our knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-12\">The Court: Is \u2014 was he \u2014 let\u2019s see. Looks like technically that when they filed a new complaint you were notified, but there really wasn\u2019t any \u2014 or any reappointment that I see. All right. I\u2019ll allow you to withdraw then as counsel for her and you\u2019re free to go then, Mr. Goodin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">The court then heard testimony from C.H.\u2019s case workers about Morrison\u2019s drug addiction, unemployment, and unstable living environment. The testimony also reflected that Morrison has not seen C.H. since August 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">{\u00b6 6} On October 27, 2004, the court adjudged C.H. a dependent child pursuant to R.C. 2151.04 and ordered that C.H. remain in temporary custody of the Department of Job and Family Services. A dispositional hearing was scheduled for November 17, 2004. Again, Morrison was not served, because she could not be located; therefore, another publication was placed in the newspaper of general circulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">{\u00b6 7} A dispositional hearing was held on November 17, 2004. Morrison was present at the hearing. At the hearing, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-16\">The Court: When did the Agency\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-17\">Ms. Morrison: I know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-18\">The Court: first get custody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>[The State:] May 5th of this year, Your Honor. We\u2019ve dismissed and refiled one time because of the 90 day. Ms. Morrison showed up the last time at the 90th day and we had to dismiss and refile, which we did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">The Court: Well, I would be more inclined to consider your request. Although, the Court had appointed an attorney to represent you and he indicated he had no contact with you. And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">Ms. Morrison: I\u2019ve tried to get a hold of him a couple of times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">The Court: \u2014 we allowed him to withdraw. Whereabouts of the mother were unknown.* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">The Court: All right. Previously, and this was in the publication, the Court has told you that you do have the right to have an attorney represent you, a Court appointed attorney if indigent and that explained to you how you would have an attorney. The Court, in fact, did appoint an attorney to represent you. He had no contact from you, he therefore asked to withdraw.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The court then proceeded to hear testimony from caseworkers from the Department of Job and Family Services, as well as testimony from Morrison regarding C.H.\u2019s situation. The dispositional hearing did not conclude that day and was continued until December 20, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">{\u00b6 8} Morrison failed to attend the December 20, 2004 continuance of the dispositional hearing to determine permanent custody because she was in the Allen County jail. The hearing continued that day, and on December 30, 2004, the court ordered that Morrison\u2019s and Lee H.\u2019s parental rights be permanently terminated. Moreover, the court awarded permanent custody of C.H. to the Department of Job and Family Services. Morrison appeals alleging one assignment of error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-11\">The trial court erred when it proceeded to conduct the permanent custody hearing when the appellant/mother was unrepresented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">{\u00b6 9} This case concerns the permanent termination of parental rights of a child, which is \u201cthe family law equivalent of the death penalty.\u201d <em>In re Hitchcock </em>(1996), 120 Ohio App.3d 88, 101, 696 N.E.2d 1090; <em>In re Rachal G., </em>6th Dist. No. L-02-1306, 2003-Ohio-1041, 2003 WL 863556, at \u00b6 12. A parent\u2019s interest and rights in protecting their relationship with a child undeniably warrant constitutional protection. <em>Lassiter v. Dept. of Soc. Serv. </em>(1981), 452 U.S. 18, 27, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640, citing <em>Stanley v. Illinois </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551. Accordingly, R.C. 2151.352 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-13\">A child, or the child\u2019s parents, custodian, or other person in loco parentis of such child is entitled to representation by legal counsel at all stages of the proceedings under this chapter or Chapter 2152. of the Revised Code and if, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>an indigent person, any such person is unable to employ counsel, to have counsel provided for the person pursuant to Chapter 120. of the Revised Code. If a party appears without counsel, the court shall ascertain whether the party knows of the party\u2019s right to counsel and of the party\u2019s right to be provided with counsel if the party is an indigent person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">See, also, Juv.R. 4(A) (\u201cEvery party shall have the right to be represented by counsel and every child, parent, custodian, or other person in loco parentis the right to appointed counsel if indigent\u201d). Furthermore, Juv.R. 4(F) states that \u201c[a]n attorney * * * may withdraw only with the consent of the court upon good cause shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">{\u00b6 10} Despite the protections that parents have when facing the possibility of permanent parental termination, parents \u201cmust exhibit cooperation and must communicate with counsel and with the court in order to have standing to argue due process was not followed in a termination proceeding. In cases in which a parent has communicated with the trial court or with counsel to explain a problem attending a scheduled hearing, Ohio court\u2019s have recognized that the failure of a trial court to take extra care to ensure the parent\u2019s presence is an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, where a parent fails to maintain contact with counsel, fails to appear for scheduled hearings despite receiving notice of such, and fails to cooperate with counsel and the court, the court may infer that the parent has waived his or her right to counsel and may grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw. To ascertain whether a waiver may be inferred, the court must take into account the total circumstances of the individual ease, including the background, experience and conduct of the parent.\u201d <em>In re Rachal G., </em>2003-Ohio-1041, at \u00b6 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">{\u00b6 11} In the instant case, Morrison requests that we follow the holding of the Eighth District Court of Appeals in <em>In re M.L.R., </em>150 Ohio App.3d 39, 2002-Ohio-5958, 779 N.E.2d 772. In <em>M.L.R., </em>the Cuyahoga County Department of Child and Family Services (\u201cCCDCFS\u201d) took emergency custody of M.L.R. and filed a complaint that the child was dependent. Id. at \u00b6 3. The juvenile court awarded temporary custody to the CCDCFS in May 2000. Id. In July 2000, the juvenile court continued the order of temporary custody and appointed counsel to represent the father. Id. Eventually, the juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence that M.L.R. was a dependent child. Id. at \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">{\u00b6 12} A dispositional hearing was held in July 2001. Neither the mother nor the father was present when the hearing was scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m. Id. at \u00b6 5. After waiting nearly an hour for the parents to arrive, the juvenile court started the hearing without them. Id. At the outset, the father\u2019s appointed counsel told the court that he had had no contact with the father since the adjudication hearing three months earlier. Id. Father\u2019s appointed counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>requested to withdraw from the case, and the juvenile court granted his request. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">{\u00b6 13} The father eventually arrived at the hearing and was advised that his attorney had been allowed to withdraw because the father failed to contact him. Id. at \u00b6 6. The father informed the court that he did contact his attorney on several occasions, and the court responded, \u201cYou may be seated, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">{\u00b6 14} Ultimately, the juvenile court awarded permanent custody to CCDCFS, and the father appealed, alleging that the court erred by allowing his attorney to withdraw at the outset of the dispositional hearing. Id. \u00b6 2. The Eighth District agreed and remanded the cause to the juvenile court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">{\u00b6 15} In reaching its conclusion, the Eighth District opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">As the basis for his motion to withdraw, the attorney stated simply that \u201c[he] had no contact with [his] client\u201d since the adjudication hearing and \u201c[his] client has not been available or cooperative,\u201d without further explanation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">* * *M</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">This is not a case in which appellant can be deemed to have waived his right to counsel. First, there is no evidence that appellant asked his attorney to withdraw. Second, appellant demonstrably participated in the proceedings. He appeared at all of the prior hearings with his attorney. Although he was late for the dispositional hearing, he appeared for that as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">Based only on counsel\u2019s assertion that appellant was uncooperative, the court could nqt assess whether it was appropriate to allow counsel to withdraw and, if so, whether to appoint new counsel.* * * Before the court can decide whether the alleged uncooperativeness has made it unreasonably difficult for an attorney to represent the client effectively, it must ascertain the source of the uncooperativeness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">For example, by lack of cooperation, the attorney may actually mean lack of communication. This appears to be the case here, given counsel\u2019s assertion that he had not been in contact with his client since the adjudication hearing. However, communication is a two-way street. An attorney\u2019s assertion that his or her client has not contacted the attorney does not demonstrate that the client has been \u201cuncooperative\u201d unless the attorney has also affirmatively attempted to contact the client and has been unable to reach him or her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADO\">Id. at \u00b6 15-17. Ultimately, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">To allow counsel to withdraw from representation on the day of the dispositional hearing, in his client\u2019s absence, without prior motion or notice of his client, without a demonstration to the court that the client had rendered it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>unreasonably difficult for the attorney to represent him, and without appointing new counsel and/or continuing the hearing, and to require the client to proceed immediately without representation, was both erroneous and prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Id. at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">{\u00b6 16} For additional guidance, we turn to the Sixth District\u2019s decisions in <em>In re Savanah M., </em>6th Dist. No. L-03-1112, 2003-Ohio-5855, 2003 WL 22462478 and <em>In re Rachal G., </em>2003-Ohio-1041. In <em>Savanah M., </em>the Lucas County Department of Children Services (\u201cLCCS\u201d) took emergency custody of Savanah immediately after her birth because the mother tested positive for marijuana. Id. at \u00b6 2. When Savanah was released from the hospital, she was placed in foster care. Id. Upon the filing of the case under which LCCS first obtained temporary custody of Savanah, the juvenile court appointed counsel to represent the mother; however, that case could not be completed within the time frame required by law, so LCCS refiled the complaint seeking dependency and permanent custody. Id. at \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">{\u00b6 17} In December 2002, the mother was personally served with a summons and complaint notifying her that LCCS was seeking permanent custody of Savannah. Id. at \u00b6 4. The summons also notified her of the date of the proceedings. Id. The mother failed to appear at the pretrial and the adjudication and disposition hearings. Id. at \u00b6 5-6. The mother\u2019s appointed counsel requested to withdraw, and her request was granted. Id. at \u00b6 21, 26. The case proceeded to disposition and LCCS was granted permanent custody of Savannah. Id. at \u00b6 27. The mother appealed, alleging that the juvenile court erred by allowing her counsel to withdraw prior to the adjudication and disposition hearings. Id. at \u00b6 30. The Sixth District affirmed the juvenile court\u2019s decision. Id. at \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">{\u00b6 18} Like the case before us, the mother in <em>Savanah M. </em>requested that the Sixth District follow the Eighth District\u2019s holding in <em>M.L.R. </em>Id. at \u00b6 35. The Sixth District rejected the mother\u2019s request and distinguished the case by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">In the present case, the source of uncooperativeness is clear. Appellant was personally served with notice of the scheduled hearings at her address of record. It is noteworthy that this address is the same address appellant listed when she filed a pro se notice of appeal. Accordingly, it is undisputed that she received notice of the scheduled hearings. [Her appointed attorney] stated that she had made continued attempts to contact appellant by letter and telephone at her last known address to no avail and that no mail had been returned to her as undelivered. In addition * * * the LCCS caseworker * * * stated that she would be very surprised to see appellant appear at the hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Subsequent evidence submitted at the hearings revealed that appellant had been disinterested in Savannah from the time of her birth, had been uncooperative with regard to case plan services, refused drug treatment, refused recommended psychiatric counseling, and failed to keep regularly scheduled meetings with her caseworkers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Id. at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">{\u00b6 19} Finally, in <em>In re Rachal G., </em>LCCS filed a complaint in dependency action in July 2001. Id., 2003-Ohio-1041, at \u00b6 2. The complaint asked that custody of the twins be awarded to their aunt. Id. After a hearing, which both parents attended, the court awarded temporary custody to the aunt and appointed separate counsel for both the mother and the father. Id. Furthermore, a case plan was established that would enable the parents to regain custody. Id. at \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">{\u00b6 20} In December 2001, LCCS reviewed the parents\u2019 progress and noted that their drug habits and the living conditions at home never changed. Id. at \u00b6 5. Accordingly, the aunt that had been awarded temporary custody sought to adopt the children; both the mother and father agreed to this plan. Id. at \u00b6 6. In order for this plan to work, however, LCCS had to acquire permanent custody to facilitate the adoption; therefore, LCCS filed an amended case plan. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">{\u00b6 21} At a hearing in March 2002, both parents appeared and agreed to the stipulated plan. The plan indicated, inter alia, that the mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights should be terminated because that was in the best interest of the children. Id. Subsequently, both parents were served with notice to appear at a pretrial conference regarding permanent custody. Id. at \u00b6 7. Neither parent appeared and only the mother\u2019s counsel was present. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">{\u00b6 22} Thereafter, the case proceeded to a dispositional hearing in August 2002. Id. At this hearing, both parents\u2019 counsel appeared, but neither parent did, and both counsel sought to withdraw from the case. Id. The father\u2019s counsel stated that she had not heard from the father since the March hearing. Id. Furthermore, the father\u2019s counsel stated that at that time, the father \u201cwas vacillating about his wishes with regard to the case,\u201d and, therefore, counsel \u201cdid not know what [the father] wanted her to do and asked that she be allowed to withdraw.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">{\u00b6 23} The juvenile court granted their requests, and the Sixth District affirmed its decision. The court, after reviewing the <em>M.L.R. </em>holding, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT_\">In the present case, appellant demonstrated a disinterest in the matter from the beginning. His filing of a notice of appeal is the first affirmative step he has taken to regain custody of his children since the complaint was filed. Although he did appear at hearings early on, he ultimately failed to cooperate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>with the court and made no other appearances in the case after the March 14, 2002 hearing at which he agreed that LCCS should seek permanent custody of the girls.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">{\u00b6 24} In the instant case, the record reveals that Morrison was present at a hearing when the Department of Jobs and Family Services initially filed a complaint alleging dependency. That first case was dropped pursuant to Morrison\u2019s request, and the record indicates that once the second complaint was filed, Morrison failed to appear for the adjudication hearing. At the hearing, Morrison\u2019s attorney stated that he had sent one letter and made numerous phone calls in an attempt to contact her about the case, but all attempts failed. At his request, the juvenile court granted his motion to withdraw from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">{\u00b6 25} Finally, at the first dispositional hearing, Morrison did appear and noted that she made several attempts to contact her attorney. Furthermore, the court denied her request for a continuance and proceeded to hear testimony of whether the Department of Jobs and Family Services should be ordered permanent custody of C.H. The dispositional hearing was continued, and Morrison failed to appear again because she was incarcerated in Allen County.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">{\u00b6 26} Based on the facts of this case, we conclude that Morrison displayed the kind of \u201cuncooperativeness\u201d that the father in <em>M.L.R. </em>did not display. Primarily, we note Morrison\u2019s lack of interest in the case. First, we note the difficulty the state had in serving Morrison with notice about the second complaint. The fact that the Department of Jobs and Family Services initiated the first case, and Morrison knew about the first case, placed Morrison on notice that future action by the Department of Jobs and Family services to obtain custody of C.H. could occur. Nevertheless, the record indicates that Morrison made no attempt to involve herself in the action or at least update her personal information so that she could be personally served notice when a second complaint was filed by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">{\u00b6 27} Second, we note Morrison\u2019s failure to attend the pretrial and adjudication hearings. The record indicates that notice of both the adjudication and disposition hearings was published in a newspaper of general circulation. With this notice, Morrison attended the adjudication hearing, but failed to show for the dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">{\u00b6 28} Finally, we highlight Morrison\u2019s counsel\u2019s attempts to contact Morrison once by mail and numerous times by phone. Again, because of Morrison\u2019s lack of interest in this case, she failed to provide her attorney, the state, or the Department of Jobs and Family Services with any contact information despite being on notice of the state\u2019s attempt to seek custody of C.H. when it filed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>first complaint. Moreover, despite Morrison\u2019s alleged attempts to contact her attorney, the record does not indicate that her appointed counsel moved offices or locations, which, if true, could have made it more difficult for her to reach him.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">{\u00b6 29} In sum, we conclude that the instant case is similar to <em>Savanah M. </em>and <em>Rackal G. </em>Specifically, based on Morrison\u2019s failed attempts to maintain contact with counsel, her failed attempts to appear at scheduled hearings, and her failed attempts to cooperate with counsel, we infer that Morrison waived her right to counsel. Moreover, Morrison\u2019s attorney\u2019s assertion that his client has not contacted him does demonstrate that Morrison has been uncooperative because the attorney also affirmatively attempted to contact Morrison on numerous occasions and failed to reach her. Therefore, the assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the juvenile court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b646-6\">Cupp, P.J., and Rogers, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
