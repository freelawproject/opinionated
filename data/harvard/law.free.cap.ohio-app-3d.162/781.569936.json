Callaway </em>(2005), 160 Ohio App.3d 229, 2005-Ohio-1471, 826 N.E.2d 879. The court, having vacated its prior decision and journal entry, reconsiders its decision and journal entry upon the record in the trial court. Each error assigned has been reviewed and the following disposition is made. Appellant, William E. Callaway, appeals from his conviction in the Akron Municipal Court for obstructing official business and resisting arrest. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">{\u00b6 2} On July 18, 2004, the Akron Police Department received a nonemergency call from Alan Bailey of the Summit County Adult Protective Services, requesting law enforcement and EMS to conduct a \u201cwelfare check\u201d at 718 Sylvan Avenue in Akron, Ohio, regarding the health of an elderly, bedridden male at that residence, namely, William\u2019s father, Walter Callaway. Bailey informed the police department that he had received information from a physician\u2019s office that several calls had been made from the Callaway residence. At no time during his conversation with the police dispatcher did Bailey mention that the calls from the physician\u2019s office suggested a medical emergency, and the dispatcher never mentioned to the officer who was to follow up on this call, Officer Alan Hamidi, that this phone call indicated an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">{\u00b6 3} When asked to confirm whether he just wanted someone to check to make sure Walter was all right, Bailey explained the predicament as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Yeah, it\u2019s one step above that. I don\u2019t think (inaudible) because this is secondhand. We have a history of some kind of situation. [Walter] is, oh he\u2019s 81, but he does have need at times for IV. He has dementia and is not compliant with either his diet, he could be dehydrated, he could be in need of an IV. He has a son that seems quite, admit there\u2019s a history of some overreacting. He\u2019s been calling a health agency, actually a Dr. Scroggins is his attending physician. He\u2019s been calling there about every few hours to say his dad needs help. He won\u2019t take his father to a hospital for fear his father will be put in a nursing home. Okay. I think this is (inaudible) my opinion, but it\u2019s shared, it\u2019s shared. The son may not be accurate as concerned because he\u2019s a little (inaudible). But there are medical situations the father is in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">}\u00a1\u00ed sfs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">There\u2019s an adult there with Walter, that\u2019s the son. He just called minutes ago to the doctor while I was talking to the doctor\u2019s receptionist requesting medical attention again for his father. We\u2019re not medical professionals who go out there. So that\u2019s why I thought I\u2019d call to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">{\u00b6 4} Without a warrant, Officer Hamidi went to the Callaway residence, dressed in uniform, and knocked on the side door of the house. William looked out the window but did not notice a marked police car near the house. William then opened the door to see who was there, at which point the officer identified himself and informed William that he was sent there by Adult Protective Custody to follow up on a call. At his trial, William testified that the officer had told him that the call had indicated that an elderly man at that location was being abused, that both the police and the EMS were being sent to the house and that they actually needed to physically see Walter to make sure that he was all right. William responded that Walter was fine and that the officer was misinformed regarding any sort of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">{\u00b6 5} The officer testified at trial that William \u201cseemed to get really agitated\u201d and that he began to pace back and forth behind the door. The officer testified that William then told the officer that he had not called the police and that the officer was not welcome there and \u201cturned around abruptly to go back towards the door to go back inside the house.\u201d Before William could reenter the house, the officer insisted that he needed to come in the house to see Walter and warned William that if he resisted his entrance, that he would arrest him for obstructing official business. The officer testified that William then \u201cclipped [the officer] on the right shoulder, and [said], no police coming in here and do nothin\u2019.\u201d The officer testified that he then informed William that he was under arrest for obstructing official business and instructed William to put his hands behind his back. At trial, William denied hitting the police officer and asserted that the officer never actually started to place him under arrest outside of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Nevertheless, both William and the officer testified that William then darted toward the partially opened door to go inside the house and attempted to shut the door behind him. The officer testified that he held onto the partially fastened handcuffs, following William into the house. The entire time, the officer used pressure points on William\u2019s elbow to make him comply, but to no avail; William proceeded into the house, the officer holding on to him, and moved towards the kitchen. The officer then began to strike William\u2019s thigh with his knee, which did not make William acquiesce, either. The officer maintained that he continued to tell William that he was under arrest and that he needed to stop moving.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">{\u00b6 7} William proceeded into the kitchen towards the telephone. He dialed 911, insisting that he was going to call the officer\u2019s supervisor, all the while the officer striking him with his knee. The officer stated that he then noticed that William was holding the phone above his head, a pose that apparently indicated to the officer that he was about to be struck with the phone. The officer pulled back from William, but then attempted to immobilize him with a Taser-gun shot to the chest. After a second shot, the Taser successfully immobilized William and brought him to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">{\u00b6 8} After the officer successfully apprehended William, he called for backup. Then, EMS arrived on the scene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The officer did eventually go upstairs to check on Walter; he found him lying on a hospital bed. Walter told the officer that he was fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">{\u00b6 9} William was charged with one count of obstructing official business, in violation of Akron Codified Ordinances 136.11, a second-degree misdemeanor, and one count of resisting arrest, in violation of Akron Codified Ordinances 136.13, an first-degree misdemeanor. William pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">{\u00b6 10} The case proceeded to a jury trial. At the close of the city\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence, William\u2019s counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A). The court denied the motions. A jury found William guilty of both charges, and the trial court sentenced him accordingly. The trial court stayed William\u2019s sentence pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">{\u00b6 11} William filed a pro se notice of appeal to this court from his conviction and sentence. Thereafter, appellate counsel was appointed to represent him, and William asserts by counsel two assignments of error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">The city of Akron failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of the crime of obstructing official business. Specifically, the city failed to prove that appellant Callaway acted \u2018without privilege\u2019 in refusing police entry to his home when the police had no warrant and no exigent circumstances. The city also failed to prove an authorized act and a lawful duty. The failure of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on all elements violated appellant Callaway\u2019s right to due process of law under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">{\u00b6 12} In his first assignment of error, William contends that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of the offense to obstructing official business. Thus, William maintains that his conviction for obstructing official business was not supported by sufficient evidence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe test for \u2018insufficient evidence\u2019 requires the court to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and ask whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Leggett </em>(Oct. 29, 1997), 9th Dist. No. 18303, at 4, 1997 WL 775688. We must determine, as a matter of law, whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support a conviction. Id. at 4. \u201cIn essence, sufficiency is a test of adequacy.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">{\u00b6 14} William maintains that the state failed to establish that he acted without privilege in refusing police entry into his father\u2019s home and that the police officer was engaged in an authorized act and lawful duty at the time. William was convicted of obstructing official business in violation of Akron Codified Ordinances 136.11, which provides, \u201cNo person, without privilege to do so and with purpose to prevent, obstruct, or delay the performance by a public official of any authorized act within his official capacity, shall do any act which hampers or impedes a public official in the performance of his lawful duties.\u201d The police officer in this case appeared at the residence without a warrant. The Fourth Amendment confers the constitutional right upon a defendant to refuse to consent to a warrantless entry, and the assertion of this right cannot be a crime. <em>Camara v. Mun. Court </em>(1967), 387 U.S. 523, 530-540, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">{\u00b6 15} The state responds that William cannot assert a privilege because he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his father\u2019s home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>and because the evidence does not establish that he was an overnight guest or otherwise had any proprietary interest in the home. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable intrusions into an area in which the person attempting to invoke the Fourth Amendment protection has an actual subjective expectation of privacy that, when viewed objectively, is justifiable under the circumstances of the case. <em>State v. Robinson </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 490, 494, 659 N.E.2d 1292, citing <em>Smith v. Maryland </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 735, 740, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220. William maintains that he was an invited guest at his father Walter\u2019s home and that he has sufficient contact and control over Walter\u2019s residence to create a legitimate expectation of privacy in the home. A host\u2019s ultimate control of his home does not obviate the possibility that a guest in his home may have a legitimate expectation of privacy even though the guest does not have a legal interest or authority to determine who enters the home. <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>(1990), 495 U.S. 91, 99, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85. \u201cA subjective expectation of privacy is legitimate if it is \u2018 \u201cone that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at 95, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85, quoting <em>Katz v. United States </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (Harlan, J., concurring). William maintains that his expectation of privacy in his father\u2019s home is one that society would be willing to recognize as legitimate and is thus protected by the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">{\u00b6 16} William does not live with his father, Walter. However, the nature of the time he spends at Walter\u2019s home is closer in character to that of an overnight guest. William has the responsibility of providing Walter\u2019s home care. William comes to the home to take care of Walter, with whom he has a strong relationship. Furthermore, William\u2019s care-giving responsibilities to Walter and Walter Jr. necessitate that he spend frequent and lengthy periods at the home. Walter has dementia, is bedridden and cannot walk, and has difficulty feeding and cleaning himself. Additionally, William watches over his brother Walter Jr., who has a mental disorder and lives with their bedridden father. William was not at the home to pursue some sort of business venture or for his own use; rather, he was there because he played an integral role in Walter\u2019s well-being and survival. Cf. <em>Minnesota v. Carter </em>(1998), 525 U.S. 83, 91, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373. Thus, we disagree with the state\u2019s position and conclude that William did indeed have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his father\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">{\u00b6 17} Although William did not protest the officer\u2019s presence at his front door, his subsequent attempt to close the door constituted an exercise of his privilege to refuse entry and the termination of any consensual encounter. See, e.g., <em>State v. Cummings </em>(Jan. 16, 2002), 9th Dist. No. 20609, 2002 WL 57979, at *11. Without a warrant, the officer needed more than the mere possibility of harm to justify entry over William\u2019s objection. The police officer conceded at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>trial that he did not know whether the phone call received by the dispatcher had been verified for legitimacy. There was no indication that an inquiry had been made into the reliability of the informant who had made the call. William insisted that he was not the one who had called EMS or the police initially; he noted that there was a possibility that either Walter or Walter Jr. might have tried to contact EMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">{\u00b6 18} It is clear that an emergency did not exist at the residence; the call did not suggest that there was an imminent need to save a life or avoid serious injury. See <em>State v. Applegate </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 348, 349, 626 N.E.2d 942. While the EMS was dispatched to the scene as well, they did not arrive until after the police officer had already encountered William and engaged him in what became an argumentative conversation and physical struggle. While the police officer did eventually make his way up to the second floor to see Walter, once he got to Walter he could do no more than simply <em>ask </em>Walter whether he was all right. The police officer did not examine him or ask him any medical questions, and rightly so; that task was appropriately left to the EMS to handle. Given the information relayed to the officer, there was no emergency medical need that he could satisfy. Furthermore, other than William\u2019s nervous pacing back and forth in front of the door while contemplating how to handle the police officer\u2019s presence, there is nothing in the testimony to indicate that anything suspicious or criminal was occurring at the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">{\u00b6 19} Another officer who arrived at the scene testified as to the commonness of answering calls to check someone\u2019s welfare. Certainly, if a call is made that indicates a medical emergency or even the possibility of imminent death, that situation might warrant any action necessary to enter the home and check the person. However, that is not the case here. Walter was not alone. He was being attended by William, who attested to his father\u2019s physical state and, as even the caller stated, had made calls to Walter\u2019s physician to seek medical help and spent much time at the residence. Cf. <em>State v. Russell </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 414, 418, 713 N.E.2d 56 (no response when law enforcement knocked on the door of a missing person). William testified that the family frequently made calls to Walter\u2019s physician for medical assistance. William did testify that no one in the family made a call to the doctor the day the officer came to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">{\u00b6 20} Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the state failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that William was acting without a privilege and that the police officer\u2019s entry into the home was lawful. See <em>Leggett, </em>9th Dist. No. 18303, at 3-4; Akron Codified Ordinances 136.11. Therefore, we find that William\u2019s conviction for obstructing official business is not supported by sufficient evidence. Accordingly, William\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-6\">The city of Akron violated Section 3, Article XVIII, of the Ohio Constitution when it enacted Akron Codified Ordinance \u00a7 136.13 [resisting arrest], as it conflicts with R.C. \u00a7 2921.33 in permitting convictions where the arrest was not proven to be lawful. Since the Akron ordinance under which appellant Callaway was convicted is unconstitutional, his conviction was void.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">{\u00b6 21} In his second assignment of error, William asserts that Akron Codified Ordinances 136.13 is unconstitutional because it is in conflict with R.C. 2921.33, resisting arrest, and that therefore, his conviction for resisting arrest is void. In particular, William argues that Section 136.13 is inconsistent in application and effect with R.C. 2921.33. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">{\u00b6 22} William did not raise this constitutional challenge before the trial court. Generally, an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, and a reviewing court has the discretionary authority to decline to address an issue that was not brought initially before the lower court. <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 122, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277. However, the Supreme Court of Ohio has proclaimed that a reviewing court may choose to address a constitutional challenge to the application of a statute although it was not initially raised in the trial court, \u201cin specific cases of plain error or where the rights and interests involved may warrant it.\u201d See <em>In re M.D. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 149, 527 N.E.2d 286, syllabus. Because of the specific circumstances of the instant case, we have elected in our discretion to address William\u2019s conflict argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">{\u00b6 23} The constitutionality of a statute or ordinance presents a question of law and is therefore reviewed under a de novo standard. <em>Andreyko v. Cincinnati, </em>153 Ohio App.3d 108, 2003-Ohio-2759, 791 N.E.2d 1025, at \u00b6 11; <em>Hiatt v. S. Health Facilities, Inc. </em>(Oct. 13, 1992), 4th Dist. No. 91CA2025, 1992 WL 308299. In determining the constitutionality of an ordinance, we are mindful of the fundamental principle requiring courts to presume the constitutionality of lawfully enacted legislation. <em>Akron v. Molyneaux </em>(2001), 144 Ohio App.3d 421, 426, 760 N.E.2d 461, citing <em>Univ. Hts. v. O\u2019Leary </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 130, 135, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>22 O.O.3d 372, 429 N.E.2d 148. The legislation being challenged will not be invalidated unless the challenger establishes that it is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Molyneaux, </em>144 Ohio App.3d at 426, 760 N.E.2d 461. However, sections of the Revised Code defining offenses or penalties are to be strictly construed against the state but liberally construed in favor of the defendant. R.C. 2901.04(A); <em>State v. Hiatt </em>(1997), 120 Ohio App.3d 247, 254, 697 N.E.2d 1025, citing <em>State v. Quisenberry </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 556, 634 N.E.2d 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">{\u00b6 24} In interpreting an ordinance or statute, words and phrases must be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. R.C. 1.42; <em>Indep. Ins. Agents of Ohio, Inc. v. Fabe </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 310, 314, 587 N.E.2d 814. Courts do not have authority to ignore the plain and unambiguous language of a statute, but must give effect to the words used. <em>Czubaj v. Tallmadge, </em>9th Dist. No. 21389, 2003-Ohio-5466, 2003 WL 22339267, at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">{\u00b6 25} As a chartered municipal corporation, Akron is authorized by the Home Rule Amendment \u201cto exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within [its] limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws.\u201d <em>FOP v. Akron, </em>9th Dist. No. 20646, 2002-Ohio-2649, 2002 WL 1263956, at \u00b6 16, quoting Section 3, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution. The test for determining whether an ordinance violates the Home Rule Amendment by conflicting with general law is \u201cwhether the ordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids and prohibits, and vice versa.\u201d <em>Struthers v. Sokol </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 263, 140 N.E. 519, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201c \u2018Where there is a direct conflict, the state regulation prevails.\u2019 \u201d <em>E. Ohio Gas Co. v. Akron </em>(1978), 60 Ohio App.2d 21, 32, 14 O.O.3d 10, 395 N.E.2d 511, quoting <em>Canton v. Whitman </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 62, 66, 73 O.O.2d 285, 337 N.E.2d 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">{\u00b6 26} Akron Codified Ordinances 136.13, resisting arrest, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">(A) In the absence of excessive or unnecessary force by an arresting officer, no person, recklessly or by force, shall resist or interfere with an arrest of himself or another, <em>whether or not the arrest is illegal under the circumstances, </em>provided that such person knows, or has good reason to believe, that the arresting officer is a law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of his duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">{\u00b6 27} The Ohio Revised Code section governing resisting arrest, R.C. 2921.33, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-11\">(A) No person, recklessly or by force, shall resist or interfere with a <em>lawful arrest </em>of the person or another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>(B) No person, recklessly or by force, shall resist or interfere with a <em>lawful arrest </em>of the person or another person and, during the course of or as a result of the resistance or interference, cause physical harm to a law enforcement officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-5\">(C) No person, recklessly or by force, shall resist or interfere with a <em>lawful arrest </em>of the person or another person if either of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-6\">(1) The offender, during the course of or as a result of the resistance or interference, recklessly causes physical harm to a law enforcement officer by means of a deadly weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-7\">(2) The offender, during the course of the resistance or interference, brandishes a deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">{\u00b6 28} As distinguished from R.C. 2921.33, Akron Codified Ordinances 136.13 proscribes the resistance of any arrest, whether legal or illegal under the circumstances. The Revised Code requires the arrest to be lawful to sustain the charge of resisting arrest and thereby imposes a burden on the prosecution to prove this element. William argues, \u201cWhen the City of Akron prosecutes resisting arrest under its Ordinance it is relieved of this burden resulting in an unconstitutional conflict with the elements required to convict an individual of Resisting Arrest elsewhere in the State of Ohio.\u201d See <em>Elyria v. Tress </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 5, 9, 595 N.E.2d 1031 (\u201cThe legislature has elected to make a \u2018lawful arrest\u2019 an element of R.C. 2921.33(A),\u201d so \u201cthe Ohio statute does not prohibit resisting unlawful arrest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">{\u00b6 29} Upon review, we find that the statute in effect permits that which the ordinance <em>expressly </em>prohibits. While R.C. 2921.33 in effect allows a person to resist an unlawful arrest, Akron Ordinances 136.13 explicitly proscribes such resistance. Therefore, we must conclude that Akron Codified Ordinances 136.13 is in conflict with the general law of the state of Ohio, R.C. 2921.33, and therefore amounts to a constitutional violation. See Section 3, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution. See, also, <em>Schneiderman v. Sesanstein </em>(1929), 121 Ohio St. 80, 87, 167 N.E. 158 (\u201cIt surely would be absurd to claim that an ordinance which attempted to prohibit an act which a statute has thus declared shall not be prohibited is in harmony with such statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">{\u00b6 30} William brings to this court\u2019s attention the precedent we established in <em>Akron v. DeLorenzo </em>(Sept. 27, 1984), 9th Dist. No. 11647, 1984 WL 3957, in which this court held that the former Akron Codified Ordinances section governing resisting arrest, Section 606.16, which is identical to the current ordinance, does not unconstitutionally conflict with R.C. 2921.33. This court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Neither authority positively permits an act which is prohibited by the other. The Akron ordinance makes it a criminal offense to resist an unlawful arrest. This conduct is not proscribed by R.C. 2921.33; however, the state statute does not say that persons have a right to resist an unlawful arrest. Thus, there is no actual conflict. The ordinance merely fills a gap in the law where the General Assembly has not spoken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">{\u00b6 31} Because of our conclusion in this case that the ordinance is in conflict with the statute, we must overrule <em>DeLorenzo </em>to the extent that it concluded to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">{\u00b6 32} Therefore, we find that Akron Codified Ordinances 136.13 is unconstitutional and therefore void. William\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained, and his conviction for resisting arrest under the ordinance is also void.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">{\u00b6 33} William Callaway\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained. The conviction in the Akron Municipal Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b827-11\">Moore, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b827-12\">Whitmore, P.J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-10\">. The officer also encountered William Callaway\u2019s brother, Walter Callaway Jr., during this series of events inside the residence. The two engaged in a scuffle, and Walter Jr. was also eventually charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b824-10\">. Upon our grant of William\u2019s application for reconsideration of this assignment of error in a journal entry dated May 17, 2005, this court allowed both parties to submit briefs or file supplemental briefs on this issue, within 20 days of the date of the entry. On May 25, 2005, William\u2019s counsel filed a notice to rely on the original briefs filed in the case. The state then filed a supplemental brief. On June 14, 2005, William filed a reply brief. Thereafter, the state filed a motion to strike the reply brief on the basis that it was filed well past the 20-day prescribed time limit and without leave of court. The state's motion is granted, and William's reply brief is stricken.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b827-13\">Whitmore, P.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AsR\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">{\u00b6 34} I respectfully dissent from the second portion of the majority\u2019s opinion. While I agree that William Callaway\u2019s obstruction-of-official-business conviction must be reversed, I disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that Akron Codified Ordinances 136.13 conflicts with R.C. 2921.33 and is therefore unconstitutional and void. Though this case presents troubling facts, the dispositive issue is what occurred when Officer Hamidi informed appellant that he was under arrest. Once told he was under arrest, Callaway had a duty to cooperate and not impede the officer in the performance of his perceived duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-15\">{\u00b6 35} Specifically, I disagree with the majority\u2019s opinion that \u201cR.C. 2921.33 in effect allows a person to resist an unlawful arrest.\u201d That finding is fraught with potential problems including confusion in the minds of police officers and citizens and the possibility of encouraging citizens to resist arrests because they subjectively believe the arrest to be unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>{\u00b6 36} Moreover, I would not overrule <em>Akron v. DeLorenzo </em>(Sep. 27, 1984), 9th Dist. No. 11647, 1984 WL 3957. I agree with this court\u2019s previous determination in <em>DeLorenzo </em>that no conflict exists between the Akron resisting-arrest ordinance and R.C. 2921.33. I agree with our previous finding that \u201c[njeither authority positively permits an act which is prohibited by the other.\u201d Id. at 7.1 agree with the <em>DeLorenzo </em>opinion that the Akron ordinance \u201cmerely fills a gap in the law where the General Assembly has not spoken.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">{\u00b6 37} The <em>DeLorenzo </em>opinion discussed <em>Columbus v. Fraley </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 173, 70 O.O.2d 335, 324 N.E.2d 735, which I believe directly contradicts the majority\u2019s position that Ohio law permits resistance to an unlawful arrest. The <em>Fraley </em>court discounted the common-law position that one had a right to resist an unlawful arrest. In fact, the court directly disagreed with the appellant\u2019s position that because her arrest was unlawful she had a right to resist it. <em>Fraley, </em>41 Ohio St.2d at 178, 70 O.O.2d 335, 324 N.E.2d 735. Further, the <em>Fraley </em>court abandoned the rule allowing forcible resistance to arrest. Id. at 180, 70 O.O.2d 335, 324 N.E.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">{\u00b6 38} I also note that the word \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of the statute does not conflict with the Akron ordinance. In determining whether an arrest was lawful, it must be determined \u201cwhether there was a \u2018reasonable basis\u2019 for the arrest and not whether the elements of the underlying charge were or could have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. McCrone </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 831, 835-36, 580 N.E.2d 468. \u201cA reasonable basis means whether a reasonable police officer under similar circumstances would have concluded that the defendant had committed a crime.\u201d Id. at 836, 580 N.E.2d 468. Such a definition has also been found to define legal arrest. See <em>State v. Thompson </em>(Nov. 9, 1993), 4th Dist. No. 92CA1906, 1993 WL 472907, at *3. In my opinion, \u201clawful arrest\u201d as used in R.C. 2921.33 does not conflict with the Akron ordinance. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion on the constitutionality of the Akron ordinance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
