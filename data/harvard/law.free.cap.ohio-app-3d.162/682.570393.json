D\u2019Agostino argues that the trial court erred in striking his objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and in disqualifying his attorney. For the following reasons, we reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">{\u00b6 2} D\u2019Agostino is an officer of W &amp; D Partners I, L.L.C. (\u201cW &amp; D\u201d), a company doing business as a bar known as \u201cEve.\u201d The bar occupies a building that is owned by the Legal Aid Society and is located at 1229 West Sixth Street in Cleveland, Ohio. Prior to the filing of this action, W &amp; D had entered into a lease with Legal Aid to rent the space occupied by the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">{\u00b6 3} In August 2003, attorney David Leneghan, on behalf of Robert Zeidler, a construction contractor, filed a complaint against W <em>&amp; </em>D and D\u2019Agostino in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, case No. CV-03-507297. Zeidler made a claim of membership in W &amp; D when he filed suit. Leneghan filed a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) and also sought damages from D\u2019Agostino and W &amp; D for breach of contract and misrepresentation. In response to the filing, D\u2019Agostino asked attorney Robert DiCello to represent him and W <em>&amp; </em>D in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>an attempt to prevent his removal from the company and the takeover of W &amp; D by Zeidler.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">{\u00b6 4} Before responding to the complaint, D\u2019Agostino, on behalf of W &amp; D, signed a waiver of conflict-of-interest/waiver-of-representation agreement asking Leneghan to represent W &amp; D \u201cin connection with certain matters, including issues concerning a lease and a liquor license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">{\u00b6 5} In September 2003, DiCello appeared and advocated on behalf of D\u2019Agostino and W <em>&amp; </em>D with regard to the TRO. In an order dated September 19, 2003, the common pleas court enjoined D\u2019Agostino from acting on behalf of or representing W <em>&amp; </em>D in any capacity and further enjoined D\u2019Agostino from being on the premises of 1229 West Sixth Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">{\u00b6 6} On November 3, 2003, Legal Aid filed a forcible-entry-and-detainer action against W &amp; D, D\u2019Agostino, and Zeidler for failure to pay rent and damages. DiCello represented D\u2019Agostino, and Leneghan represented both Zeidler and W &amp; D at the first hearing before the Cleveland Housing Court magistrate. The magistrate dismissed D\u2019Agostino from the first cause of action and found that because W &amp; D and Zeidler had failed to pay rent for the month of September 2003, Legal Aid was entitled to restitution of the premises. The magistrate ordered W &amp; D to vacate the premises on or after January 9, 2004, and scheduled a hearing on Legal Aid\u2019s claims for monetary damages. The trial court judge later adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">{\u00b6 7} As to Legal Aid\u2019s claim for monetary damages, D\u2019Agostino filed a cross-claim against Zeidler. Prior to the hearing, Leneghan withdrew his representation of W &amp; D in Cleveland Housing Court and also withdrew representation of W &amp; D as well as Zeidler in common pleas court. Leneghan then filed a motion to disqualify DiCello because of DiCello\u2019s alleged former representation of W &amp; D. DiCello, in response, filed a motion to disqualify Leneghan because of Leneghan\u2019s alleged current as well as former representation of W &amp; D. After a hearing, the magistrate recommended disqualification of both attorneys for conflict of interest and set the case for further hearings. The trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, disqualified both- attorneys, and ordered both D\u2019Agostino and Zeidler to obtain new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">{\u00b6 8} D\u2019Agostino appeals, raising the four assignments of error contained in the appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">{\u00b6 9} In his first assignment of error, D\u2019Agostino argues that \u201c[t]he trial court erred when it struck Appellant\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court struck D\u2019Agostino\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision for failure of service. Pursuant to Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(a), a party may file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>written objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision within 14 days of the filing of the decision, regardless of whether the court has adopted the decision. If the trial court has previously adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision, \u201cthe timely filing of written objections operates as an automatic stay of execution of that judgment until the court disposes of those objections and vacates, modifies, or adheres to the judgment previously entered.\u201d Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b6 11} In the case at bar, the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision, which became journalized and therefore effective on September 28, 2004. D\u2019Agostino filed his objections to the decision on October 12, 2004, within the 14-day time requirement of Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(a). Because D\u2019Agostino timely filed his objections, the filing automatically stayed the execution of the trial court\u2019s judgment disqualifying attorney DiCello and attorney Leneghan. Therefore, by serving attorney Leneghan with the objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, D\u2019Agostino perfected service under Civ.R. 5(A) because as of October 12, 2004, Leneghan still represented Zeidler.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">{\u00b6 12} Accordingly, the trial court erred in striking D\u2019Agostino\u2019s objections for failure of service. Nonetheless, the trial court addressed D\u2019Agostino\u2019s objections and found them unpersuasive. Furthermore, because D\u2019Agostino did not propose an alternate assigned error addressing the trial court\u2019s decision to overrule his objections, this court shall not address the merits of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court\u2019s journal entry striking and then ruling on D\u2019Agostino\u2019s objections lifted the automatic stay imposed by Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c), making the magistrate\u2019s decision, as adopted by the trial court, final as of October 27, 2004. Accordingly, though this assigned error has merit, it does not give us grounds to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">{\u00b6 14} Because D\u2019Agostino\u2019s second, third, and fourth assignments of error address the same issue, they will be addressed contemporaneously. D\u2019Agostino argues that the trial court abused its discretion in adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation to disqualify his attorney for several reasons: Zeidler did not have standing to move for DiCello\u2019s disqualification, the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred DiCello\u2019s disqualification, Zeidler did not prove that disqualification was necessary, and the magistrate misapplied the substantial-relationship test.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">{\u00b6 15} The standard of review for an appellate court\u2019s reviewing an attorney-disqualification order entered by a trial court is one of abuse of discretion. <em>155 N. High Ltd. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 423, 650 N.E.2d 869. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. When applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, a reviewing court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 170, 559 N.E.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">{\u00b6 16} We agree with D\u2019Agostino and find that the trial court abused its discretion in adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation to disqualify attorney DiCello.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 17} Disqualification of an attorney is a drastic measure that should not be imposed unless it is absolutely necessary. <em>Spivey v. Bender </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 17, 22, 601 N.E.2d 56. Ohio has adopted the three-part test for disqualification of counsel because of a conflict of interest set forth in <em>Dana Corp. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Mut. of N. Ohio </em>(C.A.6, 1990), 900 F.2d 882. See <em>Morgan v. N. Coast Cable Co. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 156, 159, 586 N.E.2d 88; <em>Hollis v. Hollis </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 481, 485, 706 N.E.2d 798; <em>Kitts v. U.S. Health Corp. of S. Ohio </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 271, 275-276, 646 N.E.2d 555. The test is as follows: (1) a past attorney-client relationship must have existed between the party seeking disqualification and the attorney he or she wishes to disqualify, (2) the subject matter of the past relationship must have been substantially related to the present case, and (3) the attorney must have acquired confidential information from the party seeking disqualification. <em>Dana, </em>900 F.2d at 889; <em>Morgan, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 162, 586 N.E.2d 88, fn. 1. If a party moving to disqualify an attorney cannot meet the first prong of the <em>Dana </em>test, that party lacks standing to seek the disqualification. <em>Morgan, </em>63 Ohio St.3d 156, 586 N.E.2d 88, at syllabus.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">[A] motion to disqualify an attorney gives rise to two areas of examination: (1) the nature of the relationship between the litigants; and (2) the nature of the relationship between the attorney\u2019s past and present duties, as those duties relate to the litigants. The court must first scrutinize the relationship that existed between the moving party and the attorney that the moving party seeks to disqualify. If there is no current or past attorney-client relationship, then the motion should be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-7\"><em>Henry Filters, Inc. v. Peabody Barnes, Inc. </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 255, 260, 611 N.E.2d 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">{\u00b6 18} In the present case, the magistrate found that there was no attorney-client relationship between Zeidler and attorney DiCello. The magistrate then noted that Zeidler appeared to argue that as an alleged member of W <em>&amp; </em>D, he had standing to bring the motion to disqualify on behalf of W &amp; D Partners. The magistrate correctly noted that Zeidler did not file a derivative action on behalf of W &amp; D and, therefore, Zeidler did not have standing to bring the motion to disqualify. Based on the case law cited above, the magistrate should have denied Zeidler\u2019s motion to disqualify for lack of standing. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>therefore agree with D\u2019Agostino and find that his second assigned error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">{\u00b6 19} However, after finding a lack of standing, the magistrate went on to rule that even in the absence of a motion to disqualify counsel, the trial court had the authority to prevent a violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility involving conflicts of interest. Because the magistrate analyzed the elements of the <em>Dana </em>test, we must respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 20} When looking at the Code of Professional Responsibility, the trial court must keep in mind that disqualification is a drastic measure and that \u201ca violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility alone should not result in a disqualification, unless such disqualification is found to be absolutely necessary.\u201d <em>Centimark Corp. v. Brown Sprinkler Serv., Inc. </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 485, 489, 620 N.E.2d 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 21} In applying the first prong of the <em>Dana </em>test to the facts of this case, the magistrate erroneously applied the test to DiCello\u2019s previous relationship with D\u2019Agostino and W <em>&amp; </em>D. A review of the first prong of the test shows that it actually requires a prior attorney-client relationship between the party seeking disqualification and the attorney he or she wishes to disqualify. Here, Zeidler is the movant seeking to disqualify attorney DiCello. In his decision, the magistrate determined that no past attorney-client relationship existed between Zeidler and DiCello.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">{\u00b6 22} The magistrate erred further in applying the third prong of the test when it again focused on the relationship of DiCello to W <em>&amp; </em>D. The magistrate concluded that DiCello did indeed acquire confidential information from W &amp; D during his former representation of W &amp; D, whereas the third prong of <em>Dana </em>requires disqualification if the attorney acquired confidential information from the party seeking disqualification. The magistrate never addressed whether DiCello acquired confidential information from Zeidler and, in fact, ruled out such a possibility when concluding that there was no past attorney-client relationship between Zeidler and DiCello.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">{\u00b6 23} Furthermore, the magistrate never established that Zeidler had demonstrated that disqualification was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">{\u00b6 24} For the reasons stated above, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">{\u00b6 25} This court\u2019s ruling on D\u2019Agostino\u2019s second and fourth assigned errors renders D\u2019Agostino\u2019s third assignment of error moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">Judgment reversed and case remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b722-12\">Celebrezze, P.J., and J.J. Sweeney, J., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Assignment of Errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">I.
