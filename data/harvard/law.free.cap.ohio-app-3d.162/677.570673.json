The calls were harassing and nonsensical in nature. Sergeant James Greenawalt and Patrolman Jeffrey Thurston were dispatched to appellant\u2019s home to investigate. During their questioning of appellant, appellant became agitated and swore at the officers. Thereafter, appellant spit at and bit Sergeant Greenawalt. Appellant is a hemophiliac afflicted with human immunodeficiency virus (\u201cHIV\u201d) and Hepatitis C.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">{\u00b6 2} As a result of this encounter, on April 25, 2003, the Fairfield County Grand Jury indicted appellant on one count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11, one count of attempted felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2903.11, and one count of assault on a peace officer in violation of R.C. 2903.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">{\u00b6 3} A jury trial commenced on February 24, 2004. The jury found appellant guilty as charged. By judgment entry filed March 5, 2004, the trial court sentenced appellant to a total aggregate term of six years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant filed an appeal and this matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe conviction of the defendant-appellant on count one of the indictment is not supported by sufficient evidence to sustain the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe conviction of the defendant-appellant on count two of the indictment is not supported by sufficient evidence to sustain the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">I, II</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant claims that his convictions for felonious assault and attempted felonious assault are not supported by sufficient evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">{\u00b6 8} On review for sufficiency, a reviewing court is to examine the evidence at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would support a conviction. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492. \u201cThe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">FELONIOUS ASSAULT</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant was convicted of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), which states, \u201cNo person shall knowingly * * * [clause or attempt to cause physical harm to another or to another\u2019s unborn by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance.\u201d The deadly weapon was alleged to be appellant himself because he is afflicted with HIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant does not contest the allegation that he spit into Sergeant Greenawalt\u2019s mouth and bit him on the arm, causing abrasions. He does contest that he was the deadly weapon. Appellant argues that the evidence does not support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2923.11(A) defines \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as \u201cany instrument, device, or thing capable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon, or possessed, carried, or used as a weapon.\u201d In support of his argument, appellant cites <em>State v. Bird </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 582, 586-587, 692 N.E.2d 1013 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting), wherein Justice Pfeifer stated the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cAn indictment for felonious assault must contain a description of the \u2018deadly weapon\u2019 used in the commission of the assault. It only follows that the object described must, in fact, be a deadly weapon. Whether something is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>deadly weapon is at least in part a legal issue. The indictment in this case charges Bird with attempting to harm Officer Shirk \u2018by means of a deadly weapon, to wit: spit and/or saliva.\u2019 By pleading no contest, Bird admitted only the facts in the indictment, that he spat on the officer in the attempt to do him harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA person who makes a plea of no contest does not become his own judge. The trial court still has a job to do \u2014 determining whether the facts admitted constitute a crime outlined in the indictment. The trial court in this case abused its discretion in convicting Bird. There is nothing suggesting that the saliva of an HIV-positive person can transmit the disease to another. The trial court would necessarily have made the finding that saliva is a deadly weapon before convicting Bird. Either by making the determination that saliva is a deadly weapon or by failing to make any determination at all, the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">{\u00b6 15} The unequivocal evidence established that appellant knew he was a hemophiliac and was afflicted with HIV and Hepatitis C. Kenneth Griffiths, M.D., appellant\u2019s treating physician, opined that if an individual with hemophilia and HIV spit into the mouth of another individual or bit the individual, causing abrasions but not puncture wounds, the individual would be \u201cat risk for HIV transmission.\u201d The risk would be low or remote (saliva and sweat) as opposed to high (blood and semen). Thomas Vajen, M.D. also treated appellant on occasion. Dr. Vajen stated that because appellant was a hemophiliac, appellant\u2019s saliva contained microscopic blood, which in turn contained the HIV virus. Dr. Vajen explained that \u201cif you have saliva which would have some virus, and then you would have blood, which would have lots of virus, that would be a very high potentially concentration of HIV virus.\u201d Dr. Vajen opined that appellant probably had blood in his saliva 95-100 percent of the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">{\u00b6 16} We find the cited testimony to be sufficient to establish that given appellant\u2019s knowledge of his illnesses, he knew that his saliva was a deadly weapon capable of inflicting physical harm to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">{\u00b6 17} The encounter between appellant and Sergeant Greenawalt establishes that appellant purposely advanced on him and spit on him within a range of two feet with a sufficient amount of saliva to cover Sergeant Greenawalt\u2019s glasses and enter his mouth. In the past, appellant had infected another police officer with Hepatitis C.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">{\u00b6 18} Upon review, we find sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction for felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ATTEMPTED FELONIOUS ASSAULT</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant was convicted of attempted felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and 2903.11(A)(1), which state the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cNo person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cNo person shall knowingly * * * [clause serious physical harm to another or to another\u2019s unborn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant argues that the evidence does not support an attempt to commit \u201can act that, if successful, would result in the causing of serious physical harm to the alleged victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">{\u00b6 23} Sergeant Greenawalt testified that \u201cthere was blood in the spit that he left on me.\u201d As we stated, appellant had previously infected an officer with Hepatitis C. Sergeant Greenawalt received medical treatment for the prevention of HIV and Hepatitis C. He was placed on a drug treatment plan that was \u201c[e]xtraordinarily unpleasant.\u201d He had blood drawn on numerous occasions from April until December. The drug treatment made Sergeant Greenawalt extremely nauseous for 30 days. He had to limit his family interactions out of a concern that he had contracted HIV or Hepatitis C and would transfer them to his wife and children. Although Sergeant Greenawalt has not tested positive for HIV or Hepatitis C, the risk of becoming infected with either disease is still present. As Dr. Griffiths stated, HIV can lead to AIDS, which in turn, if left untreated, can lead to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">{\u00b6 24} The attack in this case is similar to an individual\u2019s holding another individual under water to injure him or her when the victim does not appear to suffer any ill effects. The attempt was made, and despite the fact that it was unsuccessful, a criminal act occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">{\u00b6 25} Upon review, we find sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction for attempted felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">{\u00b6 26} Assignments of Error I and II are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">{\u00b6 27} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Fairfield County, Ohio, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b715-15\">Boggins, P.J., and Edwards, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
