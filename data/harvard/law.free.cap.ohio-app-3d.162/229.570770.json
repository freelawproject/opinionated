Because we conclude that the mother\u2019s consent was not voluntarily or knowingly given, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">{\u00b6 2} In February 2004, the Lucas County Children Services Board (\u201cLCCSB\u201d) was awarded temporary custody of Terrence S. after he was adjudicated a dependent and neglected child. In August 2004, the juvenile court approved the LCCSB case plan, which indicated that the mother was making progress and reunification was the goal. In September 2004, LCCSB filed a motion for permanent custody. At that time, the mother was incarcerated because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>alleged probation violations. Pursuant to mediation, on October 22, 2004, the father consented on the record to the award of permanent custody to LCCSB. The mother participated in the mediation discussions via telephone and, on October 26, 2004, was conveyed to the juvenile court to place her agreement on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">{\u00b6 3} At the hearing, an agreement was read into the record by the mother\u2019s counsel indicating that the mother was to stipulate that \u201cthe child cannot and should not be returned to the care of either parent and that the award of permanent custody [to LCCSB] is in the best interest of the child.\u201d The mother was also to stipulate that \u201cthe parents have failed to remedy the problems which caused the [child] to be removed * * * and * * * that Children Services Board has made a reasonable effort to finalize a permanent plan for the child.\u201d The mother\u2019s counsel also asked to put on the record that \u201cthe parent did make * * * what we understand to be, an unenforceable agreement, but sort of a moral agreement with the potential adoptive parents stating that there would be some ability to \u2014 for them to send photographs back and forth, probably to a post office box, so that they could have some sense as [the father\u2019s] family and we understand [the mother] understands that that' is not something that the Court can enforce but also hoping that that will take place and that is part of the mediation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">{\u00b6 4} When counsel then inquired of the mother regarding her consent to the mediation agreement, the following exchanges took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[Counsel] Q. Okay. Did you feel that you were able to participate accurately in that mediation?</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c[Mother] A. I guess, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cQ. Okay. And did you agree to this, did you agree to this agreement that we\u2019ve read into the record?</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cA. Your Honor, may I ask you a question first?</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cTHE COURT: Sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIf\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cTHE COURT: If I can answer it, I will answer it. If not\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cOkay, if I wanted to fight, do me and his dad go together?</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t hear that.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIf I fought with [the father], would [the father] have to fight too? Does both of our stuff go together?</p>\n<p id=\"b266-17\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s a question I can\u2019t answer. Your Attorney can answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>{\u00b6 16} The mother and her attorney then had a discussion off the record and counsel then again addressed the mother on the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cQ. So you heard the agreement. Are you willing to agree to this agreement as it\u2019s been read on the record?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cI said I could give him presents and letters? That\u2019s in there?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ. Yes, it is, and then again, that\u2019s part of that informal agreement. You understand that you \u2014 you understand the idea of permanent custody, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cQ. Okay. And you \u2014 do you understand that you would be giving up permanent custody of your son to Children Services with the plan of adopting him, having him find adoptive parents?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. Okay. Have you made this agreement of your \u2014 voluntarily?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. Okay. And I have talked to you about this, I have given you legal advice. Are you satisfied with the legal advice I have gave you?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. Uhum.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cQ. Okay. Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-16\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cTHE COURT: Miss [S], do you know why you\u2019re here today?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cYes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-18\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cTHE COURT: Tell me why you\u2019re here today.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-19\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cBecause I\u2019m \u2014 they want \u2014 because I\u2019m in jail. I can\u2019t have \u2014 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b267-20\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cTHE COURT: I didn\u2019t hear you.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-21\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cBecause I\u2019m in jail and they want my baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-22\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And they\u2019re asking for permanent custody of your child. Do you know what permanent custody means? What does it mean to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-23\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThat he\u2019s not my baby anymore.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-24\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And you\u2019re severing, giving up all rights to your baby, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-25\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cI don\u2019t want to.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-26\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear you.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-27\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>{\u00b6 40} The court then recessed and conducted an off-the-record sidebar. Counsel and the mother also discussed the agreement. After further exchanges with counsel about the agreement were placed on the record, the court again spoke with the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cTHE COURT: I know it\u2019s a hard agreement to make, but I have to make sure Mrs. [S], that you are doing this intelligently and voluntarily of your own free will. No one has forced you to enter into this agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cNo.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cTHE COURT: No one has threatened you or promised you anything by entering into this agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cHoping that I could keep contact with him, but no. What did you ask me? I\u2019m sorry.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cTHE COURT: There\u2019s no, you know, there is no guarantee \u2014 there is no guarantee that you can stay in contact with this child, you understand that.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c[Nods head.] Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cTHE COURT: You knew \u2014 I mean, Lucas County Children Services doesn\u2019t have to do anything with you today \u2014 after today. The child probably will be placed for adoption, a new, adoptive parents don\u2019t have to do anything regarding communication of this child with you, you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">{\u00b6 48} \u2018Tes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cTHE COURT: The chances are that you probably won\u2019t see this child ever again, you understand that? You\u2019re looking confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cA. I understand what they\u2019re saying. I\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cTHE COURT: The alternative to this is that we\u2019ll go to trial and the Lucas County Children Services will have to prove its case against you by clear and convincing evidence. You understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-16\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-17\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cTHE COURT: You will be brought back here for a trial and you, of course, can cross-examine any witnesses that they may have. They \u2014 take the witness stand on your own behalf \u2014 you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-18\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-19\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cTHE COURT: But you\u2019re giving up permanent custody, you\u2019re giving up those rights, too?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-20\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cA. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-21\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Do you want to give up permanent custody of your child today?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>{\u00b6 58} \u201cA. I don\u2019t want to, but I don\u2019t think that I have any other choice but to do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cTHE COURT: Could I see counsel at Side Bar?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">{\u00b6 60} Yet another off-the-record discussion was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cTHE COURT: Mrs. [S], are you willing to go through with this agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cTHE COURT: And are you willing to permanently give up your child to the Lucas County Children Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cTHE COURT: You are sure you\u2019re willing to do this?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cTHE COURT: \u201cYou\u2019re shaking her head no and you\u2019re answering the question yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cA. Just, my mind is going. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear you.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cA. My mind is just going.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cTHE COURT: I know you don\u2019t want to give up your child. I wouldn\u2019t want to do that either to my child. The Lucas County Children Services Board, if you do not agree to this, will bring a case against you. Whether or not they prevail, I don\u2019t know. Do you \u2014 would you rather go to trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-17\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cA. No. sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-18\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cTHE COURT: Ok. Why not?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-19\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cA. Because I won\u2019t win.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-20\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cTHE COURT: Because what?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-21\">{\u00b6 76} \u201cA. I won\u2019t win.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-22\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cTHE COURT: So in the alternative, you find it is in the best interest that you willingly give up permanent custody of this child?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-23\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-24\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cTHE COURT: Yes, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-25\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cA. (Nods head.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-26\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cTHE COURT: Court will accept the agreement and you \"will prepare the entry with the appropriate language?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-27\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cMS. WILLIAMSON: Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>{\u00b6 83} Based upon the mother\u2019s statements, the court entered judgment severing parental rights and awarded permanent custody of Terrence to LCCSB. The mother now appeals that judgment, arguing the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting permanent custody of the minor child to LCCSB as mother\u2019s consent to permanent custody was not voluntarily made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">{\u00b6 85} Pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1), a court may grant permanent custody of a child to a state agency if the court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interest of the child to grant permanent custody to the agency and that any of several enumerated factors apply, including that \u201c(a) [t]he child is not abandoned or orphaned or has not been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period ending on or after March 18, 1999, and the child cannot be placed with either of the child\u2019s parents within a reasonable time or should not be placed with the child\u2019s parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">{\u00b6 86} The standard for appellate review in a permanent-custody case is whether the trial court had clear and convincing evidence to make an award of permanent custody. <em>In re Hiatt </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 716, 725, 621 N.E.2d 1222. The \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard is a higher degree of proof than the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard generally used in civil cases, but is less stringent than the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard used in criminal cases. <em>State v. Schiebel </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 564 N.E.2d 54. On appeal from an order terminating parental rights, an appellate court will not reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment if, upon a review of the record, it determines that the trial court had sufficient evidence to satisfy the clear-and-convincing-evidence standard. <em>In re Wise </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 619, 626, 645 N.E.2d 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">{\u00b6 87} In reaching its determinations regarding permanent custody, the trial court must safeguard certain fundamental rights of parents. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized this fundamental liberty interest to include the interest of parents to make decisions concerning the care, education, custody, and control of their children. See, e.g., <em>Meyer v. Nebraska </em>(1923), 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042; <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters </em>(1925), 268 U.S. 510, 534-535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070. See, also, <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 157, 556 N.E.2d 1169 (parent\u2019s right to raise a child is an essential and basic civil right).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>{\u00b6 88} Where parental rights are permanently terminated, \u201cit is of utmost importance that the parties fully understand their rights and that any waiver is made with full knowledge of those rights and the consequences which will follow.\u201d <em>Elmer v. Lucas Cty. Children Serv. Bd. </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 241, 245, 523 N.E.2d 540. \u201c \u2018The rights to conceive and to raise one\u2019s children have been deemed \u2018essential,\u2019 * * * \u2018basic civil rights of man,\u2019 * * * and \u2018[r]ights far more precious * * * than property rights.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Stanley v. Illinois </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551. \u201cA termination of parental rights is the family law equivalent of the death penalty in a criminal case. The parties to such an action must be afforded every procedural and substantive protection the law allows.\u201d <em>In re Smith </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 1, 16, 601 N.E.2d 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">{\u00b6 89} We acknowledge that Juv.R. 34 and R.C. 2151.35 do not specifically require a full colloquy for admissions on disposition. See <em>In re Erich L., </em>6th Dist. No. L-04-1340, 2005-Ohio-2945, 2005 WL 1389086; <em>In re Lakes, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 128, 2002-Ohio-3917, 776 N.E.2d 510. Nevertheless, fundamental due process requires that when a parent is waiving the fundamental right to care for and have custody of a child, the trial court must have a meaningful dialogue with that parent to be certain that the consent is truly voluntary. See <em>Elmer v. Lucas Cty. Children Serv. Bd., </em>supra. If a parent expresses uncertainty or misunderstandings about his or her decision to waive parental rights, the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the a waiver is improper. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">{\u00b6 90} In this case, the mother was more than a little reluctant about her decision. When first asked whether she was there to give up custody of her child, she twice said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d She also said she felt she had no other choice, rather than that she believed the choice she was making was in her child\u2019s best interest. After 45 minutes, with three separate off-the-record discussions, the mother eventually acquiesced verbally in the relinquishment of her rights. Even the court, however, recognized her ambivalence during the last interchange, noting that while she was answering \u201cyes,\u201d she was shaking her head \u201cno.\u201d These responses together with the length of time it took to convince the mother to consent demonstrate that the mother\u2019s waiver of her rights to custody of her child was made under duress at best, or was coerced, at worst.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">{\u00b6 91} While we do not address the issue of the use of mediation in permanent-custody cases, we must comment because its use here does concerns us, especially as it relates to the voluntariness of the mother\u2019s consent to waive her parental rights. In mediation in termination cases, the ultimate goal is for the parent to give up custody of the child. But that can be accomplished anyway if there is sufficient evidence pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1), so, what is the inducement for the parent to participate in mediation? What benefits will inure to the parent? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Mediating with the government, which has far more resources than an individual, must be carefully scrutinized, as the parties come with unequal bargaining positions. Here, even though the mediation might have been with the prospective adoptive parents, LCCSB was the governmental authority seeking termination of the natural parents\u2019 rights. The mother had nothing real to gain and everything to lose. LCCSB had everything to gain and nothing to lose. Mediation is more beneficial to the state, as consent is more efficient than trial. LCCSB can achieve its goal in less time and at less expense, while the mother has nothing more than phantom promises. Here, the circumstances surrounding the mediation are even more troubling. The mother was in jail when the mediation occurred and had to participate by telephone. The record shows that the mother was confused and, in considering whether to give consent, clearly relied on the \u201cmoral\u201d agreement by one of the prospective adoptive parents to permit limited contact with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">{\u00b6 92} The waiver of one\u2019s parental rights should not be based upon misunderstandings, duress, coercion, or the lack of zealous legal representation. Although a parent may express some regret when consenting to the termination of her rights to raise a child, the waiver should be given because the parent acknowledges that it is in her child\u2019s best interest to do so. When considered in its entirety, the record in this case clearly indicates that the mother decided to relinquish her parental rights because she believed she had no other choice and because she had been told that further contact with the child would be possible, not because she believed it was in her child\u2019s best interest. Thus, the waiver was not truly voluntary or knowing. Since the mother\u2019s uncertainty was apparent from her first responses, the trial court should have simply stopped the proceeding and rescheduled the hearing. A continuance could have provided an opportunity under less stressful conditions for the mother to discuss her options with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">{\u00b6 93} We conclude, therefore, that the trial court erred in accepting the mother\u2019s waiver of her rights to custody of her child and in granting permanent custody to LCCSB. As a result, this case must be remanded for appropriate proceedings as to the motion for permanent custody, either a full hearing with evidence presented by the parties regarding the permanent-custody issues or for further inquiry into the mother\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">{\u00b6 94} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">{\u00b6 95} The judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this decision. Appellee is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal, for which sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>judgment is rendered against appellee on behalf of Lucas County and for which execution is awarded. See App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-6\">Skow, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b273-7\">Parish, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b273-8\">Dennis M. Parish, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASl\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">{\u00b6 96} I concur with the majority\u2019s ultimate decision in this matter. However, I cannot agree with the comments found in \u00b6 91 of the opinion, concerning the use of mediation in permanent-custody cases, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">{\u00b6 97} First, after stating that the use of mediation in terminating appellant\u2019s parental rights is not an issue in this appeal, the majority offers speculative comments, such as \u201cthe ultimate goal [of mediation] is for the parent to give up custody of the child\u201d and \u201cMediating with the government * * * must be carefully scrutinized, as the parties come with unequal bargaining positions,\u201d which are immaterial to an analysis of the issues in this case. Second, as noted by the majority, termination of parental rights can be accomplished through the state\u2019s presentation of sufficient evidence pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1). We agree that sufficient evidence does not exist in this case. Accordingly, our decision would be better reasoned without the inclusion of \u00b6 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">{\u00b6 98} If, or when, the issue of mediation in the juvenile-justice system is ever properly before this court, I am prepared to participate in a well-reasoned analysis, based on the facts and existing case law. However, it is not the function of this, or any, appellate court to provide sneak previews of coming attractions by issuing what amounts to an advisory opinion on a matter we have not been asked to address.
