For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of Sprouse and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of M/I. We also remand the matter to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On March 29, 2001, as plaintiff, an employee of an electrical subcontractor, ascended basement stairs in a residential structure that was under construction, the stairs failed. As a result, plaintiff fell to the ground and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">{\u00b6 3} At the time of plaintiffs fall, M/I owned the property that was under construction. Besides owning the property, M/I also served as the general contractor for the construction project and subcontracted parts of the construction project to various subcontractors. According to the evidence, M/I contracted with Contract Lumber, Inc. for lumber and labor for the construction project. Contract Lumber, in turn, subcontracted with Contract Framing, Inc., which hired Robert Coakley to frame the residential structure and install the basement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>stairs that later failed. Sprouse was a subcontractor that was hired to install drywall in the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">{\u00b6 4} In an amended complaint in common pleas case No. 02CVC-05-5678, plaintiff sued Contract Framing, Contract Lumber, M/I, Contract Lumber South, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sprouse, Robert Coakley, d.b.a. R.C. Builders, and anonymous defendants, alleging various theories of liability, including (1) lack of adequate warnings and defects in the manufacture and design of the stairway, (2) negligence, (3) breach of express warranties or implied warranties, or both, (4) breach of contractual obligations, and (5) willful, wanton, and reckless misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">{\u00b6 5} Upon plaintiffs motion, the trial court consolidated common pleas case No. 02CVC-05-5678 with <em>Cole v. J.S. Rails, Inc., </em>common pleas case No. 03CVC-03-3069.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, in common pleas case No. 02CYC-05-5678, Contract Framing, Contract Lumber, M/I, and Sprouse separately moved for summary judgment concerning all claims made against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court denied the summary judgment motions of Contract Framing and Contract Lumber. However, in separate judgments, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of M/I and Sprouse. In its judgments in favor of M/I and Sprouse, the trial court expressly determined that there was no just reason for delay. See, generally, Civ.R. 54(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">{\u00b6 7} From the judgments in favor of Sprouse and M/T, plaintiff timely appeals. By journal entry, this court sua sponte consolidated the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">{\u00b6 8} From the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of Sprouse, plaintiff assigns a single error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-10\">The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to appellee Sprouse &amp; Sons Drywall, Ltd.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">{\u00b6 9} From the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of M/I, plaintiff assigns a single error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-13\">The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to appellee M/I Schottenstein Homes, Inc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">{\u00b6 10} Appellate review of a lower court\u2019s granting of summary judgment is de novo. <em>Mitnaul v. Fairmount Presbyterian Church, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 769, 2002-Ohio-5833, 778 N.E.2d 1093, at \u00b6 27. \u201c <em>\u2018De novo </em>review means that this court uses the same standard that the trial court should have used, and we examine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>evidence to determine whether as a matter of law no genuine issues exist for trial.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Brewer v. Cleveland City Schools </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 701 N.E.2d 1023, citing <em>Dupler v. Mansfield Journal Co., Inc. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 116, 119-120, 18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">{\u00b6 11} Summary judgment is proper when the movant demonstrates that (1) no genuine issue of material fact exists, (2) the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence most strongly construed in its favor. Civ.R. 56; <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 677 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">{\u00b6 12} Under Civ.R. 56(C), a movant bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the record demonstrating the absence of a material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. Once a movant discharges its initial burden, summary judgment is appropriate if the nonmoving party does not respond, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Civ.R. 56, with specific facts showing that a genuine issue exists for trial. Id. at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264; <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 430, 674 N.E.2d 1164; Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">{\u00b6 13} In his appeal from the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Sprouse, plaintiff asserts that the trial court erred when it concluded that the opinions of his expert witness, Stephen Galli, a licensed architect, were speculative. Plaintiff asserts that Galli\u2019s opinion was based upon reasonable inferences from the evidence, not speculation. Sprouse contends that Galli\u2019s opinion rests upon speculation, conjecture, and guesswork, and, consequently, it fails to create a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIt has been observed that there is no simple litmus test for determining whether a material issue of fact is presented.\u201d <em>Duke v. Sanymetal Products Co. </em>(1972), 31 Ohio App.2d 78, 80-81, 60 O.O.2d 171, 286 N.E.2d 324, citing <em>Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Am. Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. </em>(C.A.2, 1967), 388 F.2d 272, 279. \u201cIn determining whether a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 exists, a court must inquire \u2018whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wall v. Firelands Radiology, Inc. </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 313, 322, 666 N.E.2d 235, quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 251-252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202; <em>Turner v. Turner </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 337, 617 N.E.2d 1123. A genuine issue of material fact may arise \u201cwhere the facts presented in the moving papers are uncertain or indefinite; in other words, the picture that is painted in the moving papers either is clear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>but incomplete, or is obscured by imprecise facts.\u201d <em>Duke, </em>31 Ohio App.2d at 81, 60 O.O.2d 171, 286 N.E.2d 324, citing <em>Braniff v. Jackson Ave. Gretna Ferry, Inc. </em>(C.A.5, 1960), 280 F.2d 523, 526-528.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">{\u00b6 15} A vital material issue in this case is whether a drywall installer removed braces from the basement stairs while installing drywall in the basement stairwell, thereby allegedly proximately causing the basement stairs to fail when plaintiff ascended the stairs. According to plaintiffs theory, during drywall installation, a drywall installer would have been required to cut around the braces and later repair the drywall or, alternatively, remove some braces before installing the drywall. Plaintiff theorizes that an absence of drywall repair suggests that braces were removed during drywall installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cEvid.R. 702 permits experts to testify as to their opinion, and even their opinion as to the ultimate issue under Evid.R. 704. Evid.R. 703 and 705, however, require that the expert establish the basis from which they draw the inferences for their expert opinion.\u201d <em>Estate of Holley v. Am. Family Life Assur. Co. of Columbus, </em>Pickaway App. No. 04CA5, 2005-Ohio-2281, 2005 WL 1097799, at \u00b6 24; see, also, Evid.R. 703 and 705. Furthermore, \u201can expert witness may have an opinion based on inferences drawn from facts as provided for in Evid.R. 703.\u201d <em>Estate of Holley, </em>at \u00b6 25. However, an expert witness cannot reach a conclusion where one inference is based upon another inference. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Donaldson v. N. Trading Co. </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 476, 612 N.E.2d 754, an appeal from a directed verdict, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">Though widely denounced by both courts and legal commentators, the rule prohibiting the stacking of one inference upon another is still recognized in Ohio. Nevertheless, the rule has very limited application. It prohibits only the drawing of one inference solely and entirely from another inference, where that inference is unsupported by any additional facts or inferences drawn from other facts. But the rule does not forbid the use of parallel inferences in combination with additional facts. Nor does it prohibit the drawing of multiple inferences separately from the same set of facts. Because reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence are an essential element of the deductive reasoning process by which most successful claims are proven, the rule against stacking inferences must be strictly limited to inferences drawn exclusively from other inferences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">(Citations and footnote omitted.) Id. at 481, 612 N.E.2d 754. See, also, <em>State v. Miller </em>(Mar. 7, 1990), Medina App. No. 1822, 1990 WL 27166.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">{\u00b6 18} Applying <em>Donaldson, </em>the Fourth District Court of Appeals in <em>Blevins v. Begley Tree Serv. </em>(Oct. 10, 1997), Adams App. No. 96CA632, 1997 WL 624317, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>considered an appeal from a directed verdict in favor of Begley Tree Service. In <em>Blevins, </em>James Blevins, who was accompanied by his wife and daughter, was traveling in his pickup truck when a large limestone rock entered the driver\u2019s open window, striking Blevins in the head, neck, and shoulder area. The impact temporarily rendered Blevins unconscious. Believing that the rock that struck him had been hurled by a heavy-duty mowing machine operated by an employee of Begley. Blevins and his wife sued Begley, among others, alleging that Begley\u2019s employee negligently operated a mower. After the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of Begley, Blevins and his wife appealed, claiming that the matter should have been presented to the jury for their consideration of liability. Begley, however, argued that (1) there was no testimony that the mower hit a rock and (2) there was no testimony that the rock that had struck Blevins came from the mower. Begley further argued that to link the rock that caused Blevins\u2019s injury to the mower impermissibly required stacking an inference upon an inference. On appeal, the <em>Blevins </em>court found that the issue on appeal concerned whether the plaintiffs failed to produce any evidence that would link Begley\u2019s alleged breach of duty to the proximate cause of Blevins\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 19} The <em>Blevins </em>trial court found that direct uncontroverted evidence showed that (1) a rock hit Blevins, (2) Begley\u2019s machine was working within 200 to 300 feet of Blevins when Blevins was struck, (3) Begley\u2019s machine was at a 45-degree angle to the roadway where Blevins\u2019s truck was being driven in the opposite direction, (4) Begley\u2019s machine was capable of throwing a rock like the one that hit Blevins for 500 feet, and (5) to operate the machine within 200 to 300 feet of vehicles without stopping either traffic or the operation of the machine constituted a breach of the standard of care. There was no direct evidence that Begley\u2019s mower had thrown a rock. Furthermore, there was conflicting evidence whether (1) the mower\u2019s operator could always notice an impact with a rock and (2) the mower always pulverized rocks instead of throwing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 20} Reversing the trial court, the <em>Blevins </em>appeals court agreed that the case rested upon an inference that Begley\u2019s mower actually struck a rock and that this rock, in turn, struck Blevins. However, the <em>Blevins </em>court did not find that these two inferences were impermissible and solely drawn from each other. The <em>Blevins </em>court observed that Blevins\u2019s daughter testified that she had seen the mower across the creek from the truck and that she saw a gray streak traveling toward the vehicle. From these facts and Blevins\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony, the <em>Blevins </em>court found the jury logically could infer that the mower had thrown the rock that Blevins\u2019s daughter saw. Blevins\u2019s daughter also stated that after she saw the rock approach the truck, she saw her father slump over the wheel, the truck went into a ditch, and the rock lay on the floorboard of the truck. From these additional facts, the <em>Blevins </em>court found that the jury logically could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>inferred that the rock that Blevins\u2019s daughter had seen was the rock that hit Blevins. The <em>Blevins </em>court concluded that \u201c[r]egardless of whether these inferences are characterized as being \u2018parallel\u2019 or \u2018multiple inferences from the same facts,\u2019 they are sufficient to allow reasonable minds to differ on the issue of causation.\u201d Id. Furthermore, the <em>Blevins </em>court concluded that the testimony of Blevins\u2019s expert witness that it was unreasonable to operate the mower within 200 to 300 feet of the road without stopping traffic or stopping the mower satisfied the plaintiffs\u2019 burden concerning the element of duty. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 21} Here, there is no direct evidence that a drywall installer removed braces while installing drywall. Cf. <em>Blevins </em>(wherein there was no direct evidence that Begley\u2019s mower threw a rock that struck Blevins). Plaintiffs case against Sprouse rests upon an inference that a drywall installer removed braces, and this, in turn, proximately caused the basement stairs to fail. Essential to establishing a claim against Sprouse is a determination of whether Galli\u2019s opinion, which establishes a causal nexus between the drywall installation and the stairs\u2019 failure, is based upon permissible inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 22} In deposition testimony, Galli testified that photographs taken subsequent to the accident showed that the drywall had not been repaired. Later, in an affidavit, Galli also averred that he did not see evidence of cut-outs and repairs during an inspection of the drywall. From these facts, Galli inferred that a drywall installer removed two braces because, according to Galli, \u201c[n]o other person or tradesman would have the motive to remove those studs, nor would it fall within the scope of their work to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 23} Here, there is a factual basis underlying Galli\u2019s opinion that the drywall had not been repaired, e.g., Galli\u2019s inspection of the drywall and his assessment of photographic and video evidence. Absent a finding that the drywall had been repaired, Galli logically could infer that a drywall installer removed the braces during the installation of drywall based upon his professional experience that \u201c[n]o other person or tradesman would have the motive to remove those studs, nor would it fall within the scope of their work to do so.\u201d See, generally, <em>Donaldson, </em>82 Ohio App.3d at 481, 612 N.E.2d 754 (stating that the rule prohibiting the stacking of one inference upon another \u201cprohibits only the drawing of one inference solely and entirely from another inference, where that inference is unsupported by any additional facts or inferences drawn from other facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 24} Construing the evidence in favor of plaintiff, because there is evidence that suggests the drywall had been repaired, which, in turn, could support an inference that the braces may not have been removed, we conclude that Galli\u2019s opinion creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a drywall installer removed the braces.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Having concluded that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether a drywall installer removed braces supporting the basement stairs during drywall installation, we hold that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Sprouse. We therefore sustain plaintiffs assignment of error as to the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Sprouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 26} In its appeal from summary judgment in favor of M/I, plaintiff asserts that the trial court erred when it found M/I owed no duty to plaintiff. Plaintiff further asserts that because M/I actively participated in the construction of the residential structure, then liability properly should attach to M/I.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 27} Here, M/I was the general contractor for the construction project, and it was the owner of the property under construction. According to the evidence, M/I contracted with Contract Lumber to provide labor and materials for the construction project. Contract Lumber, in turn, subcontracted with Contract Framing, which subcontracted with Coakley to frame the residential structure and install the basement stairs that later failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 28} The Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that \u201c[a] construction site is inherently a dangerous setting.\u201d <em>Bond v. Howard Corp. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 332, 336, 650 N.E.2d 416. The Supreme Court of Ohio has further stated that \u201ca subcontractor who works at a construction site is engaged in inherently dangerous work.\u201d <em>Michaels v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 475, 479, 650 N.E.2d 1352, fn. 4. Moreover, this court previously has found that \u201c[i]t is well-settled that a construction site is an inherently dangerous work environment. * * * In addition, a subcontractor who works at a construction site is engaged in inherently dangerous work.\u201d <em>Collier v. Borror Corp. </em>(Nov. 5, 1998), Franklin App. No. 97APE12-1624, 1998 WL 767324; see, also, <em>McClary v. M/I Schottenstein Homes, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-777, 2004-Ohio-7047, 2004 WL 2980561, at \u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 29} Here, treading upon stairs is not, in and of itself, a dangerous activity. However, treading upon stairs at a construction site, which is an inherently dangerous setting, <em>Bond, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 336, 650 N.E.2d 416, and treading upon stairs which seemingly were supported by braces does provide plaintiff who was treading upon such stairs with some notice that real or potential dangers existed. See <em>Frost v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 182, 740 N.E.2d 734 (Evans, J., dissenting; Harsha, J., concurring in judgment only), amended by <em>Frost v.

Co. </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 110, 21 OBR 416, 488 N.E.2d 189, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">A general contractor who has not actively participated in the subcontractor\u2019s work, does not, merely by virtue of its supervisory capacity, owe a duty of care to employees of the subcontractor who are injured while engaged in inherently dangerous work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">{\u00b6 34} Thereafter, in <em>Bond, </em>supra, construing and applying <em>Cafferkey, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">For purposes of establishing liability to the injured employee of an independent subcontractor, \u201cactively participated\u201d means that the general contractor directed the activity which resulted in the injury and/or gave or denied permission for the critical acts that led to the employee\u2019s injury, rather than merely exercising a general supervisory role over the project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">Id., 72 Ohio St.3d 332, 650 N.E.2d 416, at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">{\u00b6 35} Almost three years after <em>Bond, </em>in <em>Sopkovich, </em>supra, after carefully reviewing its own judicial precedents, the Supreme Court of Ohio further determined that \u201cactive participation giving rise to a duty of care may be found to exist where a property owner either directs or exercises control over the work activities of the independent contractor\u2019s employees, or where the owner retains or exercises control over a critical variable in the workplace.\u201d <em>Sopkovich, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 643, 693 N.E.2d 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">{\u00b6 36} Here, even construing the evidence most strongly in favor of plaintiff, we cannot conclude that M/I directed or exercised control over the work activities of Contract Framing\u2019s employees or its subcontractors. Neither can we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>that M/I directed or exercised control over the work activities of Sprouse\u2019s employees or its subcontractors. Moreover, based upon the evidence in the record, we cannot conclude that M/I directed or exercised control over the work activities of other subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 37} Furthermore, we cannot conclude that M/I retained or exercised control over a critical variable in the workplace. In the present case, M/I provided blueprints for the home that was under construction, but it did not direct or interfere with the work of Contract Framing or its subcontractor, Coakley. Even construing the evidence in favor of plaintiff, we conclude that M/I exercised general supervision over the construction project. However, absent active participation in a subcontractor\u2019s work, a general contractor, merely by virtue of its supervisory capacity, does not owe a duty of care to employees of a subcontractor who are injured while engaged in inherently dangerous work. <em>Cafferkey, </em>21 Ohio St.3d 110, 21 OBR 416, 488 N.E.2d 189, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 38} Furthermore, although there is evidence that employees of the electrical subcontractor complained about the safety of the basement stairs to the electrical subcontractor one day prior to plaintiffs fall, and this information was later made known to representatives of M/I, construing this evidence in favor of plaintiff, this evidence does not suggest that M/I had notice about these electricians\u2019 concerns prior to plaintiffs fall. If M/I had known of these safety concerns about the basement stairs prior to plaintiffs fall, such knowledge may have served to create a genuine issue of material fact. See <em>Cyr v. Bergstrom Paper Co. </em>(1982), 3 Ohio App.3d 299, 301, 3 OBR 345, 444 N.E.2d 1349 (stating that \u201can employer may be liable to an independent contractor, as an invitee, for injuries caused by a dangerous condition, but only if he knew or reasonably should have known of the condition\u201d); see, also, <em>Hirschbach, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 208, 6 OBR 259, 452 N.E.2d 326, fn. 2, quoting <em>Parsons v. Blount Bros. Constr. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1960), 281 F.2d 414, 417 (stating that \u201c \u2018[t]he existence of hazards which could be eliminated by the exercise of ordinary care by those in custody and control of the premises cannot be considered inherent hazards necessarily present because of the character of the work to be done\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 39} Accordingly, absent any evidence that M/I had prior knowledge of the electricians\u2019 safety concerns about the basement stairs and, absent any evidence that M/I directed or exercised control over the work activities of subcontractors or that it retained or exercised control over a critical variable in the workplace, we hold that there is no genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment in favor of M/I. Therefore, plaintiffs assignment of error concerning the judgment in favor of M/I is not well taken, and we therefore overrule this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>{\u00b6 40} Accordingly, having sustained plaintiffs assignment of error as to defendant Sprouse and having overruled plaintiffs assignment of error as to defendant M/I, we therefore reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in favor of Sprouse and affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in favor of M/I. We further remand this cause to that court for further proceedings in accordance with law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b658-6\">French and McCormac, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b658-7\">John McCormac, J., retired, of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-16\">.
