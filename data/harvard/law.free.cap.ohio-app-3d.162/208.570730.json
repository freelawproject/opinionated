Both Counts II and III carried a \u201cschoolyard\u201d specification. Counts I, II, and III also carried one-year firearm specifications. Defendant was also convicted for possession of criminal tools<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Count IV), in violation of R.C. 2923.24. Defendant was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment. By subsequent journal entry, the trial court additionally imposed community control sanctions. Defendant also appeals the imposition of those sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">{\u00b6 2} On February 6, 2003, a Garfield Heights Police detective, James Mendolera, and a police informant<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> met in a school parking lot just before they executed a controlled drug buy. Detective Jeffrey Cook and another detective assisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Mendolera in effectuating the buy. Cook was instructed to conduct surveillance on a house in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">{\u00b6 3} On Mendolera\u2019s instruction, the informant called defendant and left a message. When defendant returned the call, he agreed to sell the informant 100 ecstasy pills for $1,050. The drug buy was to occur at a local gas station. These calls were recorded on a police audio tape. Before his meeting with defendant, the informant was outfitted with a wire transmitter to record the drug buy on the same police tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 4} The informant was dropped at the gas station. A gold Honda pulled into the station with driver Edmound Courtney<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and defendant inside. After the informant entered the back seat of the vehicle, the conversations between the three men were monitored by police through the informant\u2019s wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">{\u00b6 5} When the buy was completed, the informant, on Mendolera\u2019s instruction, verbally identified the ecstasy pills. As he counted the marked money out loud, he gave a verbal code signal to police. When Mendolera heard the signal, police approached the Honda, arrested Courtney and defendant, and recovered from the informant the marked money, along with the 100 ecstasy pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 6} Defendant proceeded to a jury trial in which Courtney testified against him in exchange for a reduced sentence. Following his convictions and sentencing, defendant filed this timely appeal in which he presents the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">I. Appellant was improperly prohibited from challenging a witness in violation of his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine the witness against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">{\u00b6 7} Defendant argues that the trial court erred by allowing the jury to hear the police tape. He argues that under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, the informant\u2019s taped statements are \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature and therefore should have been excluded by the trial court as inadmissible hearsay.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, because the informant did not testify at trial, defendant was denied his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine and \u201cchallenge the informant\u2019s credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">{\u00b6 8} As noted in <em>Crawford, </em>the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment states, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 38, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The question of whether a criminal defendant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause have been violated is reviewed under a de novo standard. <em>United States v. Robinson </em>(C.A.6, 2004), 389 F.3d 582, 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Crawford, </em>defendant\u2019s wife, exercising her marital privilege, did not testify at his trial. Before trial, however, in a tape-recorded statement to police, defendant\u2019s wife described the stabbing her husband was charged with. The statement conflicted with defendant\u2019s claim that the stabbing was in self-defense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant argued that the wife\u2019s statement not only was inadmissible hearsay, but violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. The district court determined that the statement, though hearsay, was reliable and trustworthy, and the jury was allowed to hear it. Defendant was subsequently convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 10} On appeal, the United States Supreme Court scrutinized the reliability of the wife\u2019s testimonial hearsay statement under the Confrontation Clause. The court described the myriad forms a testimonial statement might take. Testimonial statements may include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201c[E]x parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent \u2014 that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,\u201d Brief for Petitioner 23; \u201cextrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions,\u201d <em>White v. Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 365, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Id. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">{\u00b6 11} The Supreme Court emphatically declared: \u201cWhere testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Id. at 69, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The court determined that the wife\u2019s taped statement was testimonial and that its admission during defendant\u2019s trial violated his constitutional right to confrontation. Id. The court reversed defendant\u2019s conviction, but not before determining that the Confrontation Clause \u201cdoes not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Id. at 60, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 at fn. 9</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 12} Following <em>Crawford, </em>the case of <em>United States v. Sexton </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 119 Fed.Appx. 735, is factually identical to the case at bar. In <em>Sexton, </em>several defendants were arrested and charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Prior to the arrests, police used confidential informants to conduct controlled drug buys from the defendants. Each of the drug transactions was audiotaped. One of the police informants, Eddie Goins, made several of the controlled buys from different defendants. As recounted in <em>Sexton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">Under police supervision, the conversations were transmitted in real time with a hidden transmitter. This method allowed police to monitor Goins simultaneously as he spoke. It also allowed a recording to be made with a body recorder. * * * Most of the tapes, along with accompanying transcripts, were admitted into evidence over the objections of defendants, but Goins did not testify for the government when it was discovered that he lied to police and fabricated two tape-recorded conversations relating to the investigation. Goins was not named as a coconspirator. The government introduced the tapes through the participating police officers and questioned the officers about the circumstances surrounding the tape recordings. Defendants called Goins as a witness, but he refused to testify, asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Id. at 741. Each of the defendants was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">{\u00b6 13} On appeal, the court determined that the taped statements were not hearsay because they were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The statements were used to \u201cgive meaning to the admissible responses of [defendants].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id. Further, Goins\u2019s statements did not violate the defendants\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights under the Confrontation Clause because they were not testimonial statements as described in <em>Crawford, </em>supra. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">When an out-of-court statement is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, as with Goins\u2019 statements, the Confrontation Clause is not implicated. * * * The statements were clearly admissible under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (Mar. 8, 2004).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>Sexton, </em>citing <em>Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 413, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985); see, also, <em>United States v. Cromer </em>(C.A.6, 2004), 389 F.3d 662, 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">{\u00b6 14} As in <em>Sexton, </em>the informant\u2019s taped statements in the case at bar were not offered for their truth, but simply to provide a context within which to understand defendant\u2019s otherwise admissible statements. In his description of the events leading up to defendant\u2019s arrest, Mendolera used the informant\u2019s statements at different points on the tape to explain the progression of the drug buy. He identified the \u201clouder\u201d voice as that of the informant and the \u201clower\u201d voice as that of the defendant. After a segment of the tape was played, Mendolera was asked to describe the circumstances surrounding different portions of the tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 15} When the jury heard the informant verbally identify the pills and count the $1,050 in marked money, Mendolera confirmed that he and the informant had agreed on these verbal acts so that police could prepare to arrest the occupants of the car. Mendolera further explained that \u201clooking good, looking good\u201d was the signal for police to move in on the Honda.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 16} The informant\u2019s taped statements, therefore, are not hearsay under Evid.R. 801(C).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the informant\u2019s statements are not hearsay, moreover, they are not testimonial statements, and <em>Crawford </em>is not applicable. We conclude that the challenged statements do not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.-</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, the trial court did not err in allowing the jury to hear the informant\u2019s taped statements. Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">II. Appellant\u2019s convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">{\u00b6 18} Defendant argues that the state failed to produce evidence that he was in possession of any drugs when he was arrested. \u201cWhen a court of appeals reverses a judgment of a trial court on the basis that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court sits as a \u2018 \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d \u2019 and disagrees with the factfinder\u2019s resolution of the conflicting testimony.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, citing <em>Tibbs v. Florida </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 31, 42, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 72 L.Ed.2d 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, at \u00b6 54, citing <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 20} In the case at bar, defendant was convicted of possessing the drug MDMA in violation of R.C. 2925.11. The statute defines the offense of possession of drugs and provides that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance.\u201d R.C. 2925.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 21} Persons act knowingly, regardless of their purpose, when they are aware that their conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. R.C. 2901.22(B). A trial court must consider \u201call the attendant facts and circumstances in order to determine if a defendant knowingly possessed a controlled substance.\u201d <em>State v. Greene, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82948, 2004-Ohio-2008, 2004 WL 858749, at \u00b6 16, citing <em>State v. Teamer </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 490, 492, 696 N.E.2d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 22} Possession is defined as having \u201ccontrol over a thing or substance.\u201d It may not be inferred, however, from a defendant\u2019s \u201cmere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(K). \u201c[Possession can be actual or constructive.\u201d <em>Greene, </em>2004-Ohio-2008, 2004 WL 858749 at \u00b6 18, citing <em>State v. Wolery </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 316, 329, 75 O.O.2d 366, 348 N.E.2d 351. \u201cConstructive possession exists when an individual knowingly exercises dominion and control over an object, even though that object may not be within his immediate physical possession.\u201d <em>State v. Hankerson </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 87, 24 O.O.3d 155, 434 N.E.2d 1362, syllabus. When a defendant is in close proximity to drugs, \u201ca rational trier of fact can conclude that it was within the appellant\u2019s dominion or control.\u201d <em>Green </em>at \u00b6 18, citing <em>State v. Pruitt </em>(1984), 18 Ohio App.3d 50, 58, 18 OBR 163, 480 N.E.2d 499; <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 272-73, 574 N.E.2d 492, (circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove constructive possession).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">{\u00b6 23} In the case at bar, defendant had possession of drugs. Mendolera and the informant met before the drug buy. From that point until the defendant\u2019s arrest, Mendolera continuously monitored the events and the informant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Before the informant met with defendant, police made sure the informant had no drugs on him; he had only the marked drug money.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 24} Detective Cook maintained continuous visual contact with the motor vehicle in which defendant was a passenger when the drug buy was being executed. Cook had been assigned to conduct surveillance at Courtney\u2019s house before the informant was taken to the gas station. Cook was in contact with Mendolera through a cell phone and a police radio. Cook observed Courtney\u2019s gold Honda pull up to the house and then leave. He was not sure whether anyone got in or out of the car. When the car left, however, Cook identified two males as the occupants. Cook followed the vehicle to the gas station where the informant was waiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 25} The detectives continued their uninterrupted visual contact. When the informant was dropped at the station, Mendolera saw him move into the Honda\u2019s backseat. Both Mendolera and Cook identified two of the voices as that of the informant and the defendant. When Mendolera heard the code signal, the take-down order was given, and police arrested defendant and Courtney. The informant was in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 26} Courtney described his own role in the drug transaction of February 6th:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">Q: Now, I\u2019m going to ask you to turn your attention to February 6th of 2003. Do you recall that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">Q: Relative to this case, what if anything happened prior to the arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">A: Could you be more specific?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">Q: Okay. Did there come a time when you received a telephone call from Mr. Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-13\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-14\">Q: Explain about when that happened, where you were and the conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-15\">A: Yes, I was at home. I was in bed that day and Mr. Smith called me and he told me he needed a hundred rumpers is what we call them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-16\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-17\">Q: Is there, well, and when you talk about rumpers, what is it that you\u2019re referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-18\">A: Ecstasy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-19\">\u2756 <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-20\">q. * * * You received a call from Mr. Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>A: I received a call from Mr. Smith. He let me know that he needed a hundred rumpers, pills. I told him to get the money together for it, and when he got the money together for it, he could come over to my house and get it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">Q: Now how much would you charge him for 100 rumpers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">A: It was either 900 or 950. $950.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">Q: Describe for us the conversation that you had with Mr. Smith at your bedroom door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">A: Well, he asked me, well, he told me he was ready and I asked him did he have the money. He said no, so I told him I wasn\u2019t going to let him take the pills up there or wherever he needed to go because I didn\u2019t know who he was dealing with so I explained to him I would take him up there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">Q: Describe for us the route, well, did you bring anything else with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">A: Yeah, before we left I got the hundred pills he needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">Q: I\u2019m going to show you what\u2019s been marked for purposes of identification as State\u2019s Exhibit No. 6. Would you please retrieve what\u2019s in that bag?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-13\">A: (Indicating)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-14\">Q: Do you recognize what those are? Have you seen those before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-15\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-16\">Q: When was the last time you saw those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-17\">A: February 6th, 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-18\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-19\">Q: Now, all right, so you get your 100 pills and you\u2019re in the car with Sherman. Describe to us please what then happens, where you are going and do you know to go there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-20\">A: Well, as we were pulling out my driveway I give him the hundred pills because he\u2019s doing the deal with this guy that we\u2019re going to meet and I\u2019m taking the route he tells me. He tells me what gas station to go to, so I knew which way to go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-21\">Q: What happens next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-22\">A: I pull up to the gas pump. I stop. This guy gets in the back seat of my car on the passenger side in the back. When he gets in, Sherman introduces us and they begin to do the deal. I\u2019m sitting there. I needed gas anyway so that\u2019s why I pulled up by the pump. I reached down and was opening my gas lever. That\u2019s when I seen the detectives coming.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Courtney further stated that before he left the house, he placed 100 ecstasy pills in a plastic bag. He gave the bag to defendant once they were inside the Honda.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 27} Cook confirms that when the Honda left Courtney\u2019s house, the car went directly to the gas station. There is no conflicting evidence on this point. After Courtney and defendant were arrested, the ecstasy pills and the marked money were retrieved from the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 28} There is no evidence refuting Courtney\u2019s account that defendant set up the drug deal with the informant, contacted Courtney, and then took possession of the plastic bag when Courtney handed it to him as they entered Courtney\u2019s vehicle. Defendant had possession of the drugs as well as control over when they would be given to the informant. The evidence establishes that while defendant was inside Courtney\u2019s car, he had possession of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 29} From the testimony of Courtney, Mendolera, and Cook, this court cannot conclude that the jury lost its way or that defendant\u2019s conviction for possession is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">III. The postrelease control term must be vacated because it was not imposed at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">{\u00b6 30} Defendant argues that the trial court erred by not informing him at his sentencing hearing that he would be subject to mandatory postrelease control pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(3).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He further argues that the court\u2019s subsequent journalization of an order imposing postrelease sanctions was error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 31} As recently stated by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v. Jordan, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-6085, 817 N.E.2d 864:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-12\">[A] trial court has a statutory duty to provide notice of postrelease control at the sentencing hearing, [and] any sentence imposed without such notification is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>contrary to law. As a general rule, if an appellate court determines that a sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law, it may remand for resentencing. See R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). Furthermore, where a sentence is void because it does not contain a statutorily mandated term, the proper remedy is, likewise, to resentence the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Id. \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 32} In the case at bar, the state concedes that the trial court erred by failing to inform defendant at his sentencing hearing about postrelease control. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained, and this matter is remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>Jordan, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-8\">Gallagher and Calabrese, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-15\">.
