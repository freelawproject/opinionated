Small, moves this court to reconsider its decision in <em>State v. Small, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 325, 2005-Ohio-2291, 833 N.E.2d 736. The state agrees with defendant that we should reconsider our decision. However, the state contends that, even after further analysis, we should still render judgment in the state\u2019s favor. For the reasons that follow, we grant defendant\u2019s application for reconsideration, modify the judgment in our decision, affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss an indictment, and sua sponte vacate our previous order remanding the cause to the trial court to consider defendant\u2019s equal-protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">{\u00b6 2} App.R. 26 does not include guidelines to be used when determining whether a decision should be reconsidered or changed. <em>Matthews v. Matthews </em>(1982), 5 Ohio App.3d 140, 143, 5 OBR 320, 450 N.E.2d 278. Nevertheless, in <em>Matthews, </em>this court stated, \u201cThe test generally applied is whether the motion for reconsideration calls to the attention of the court an obvious error in its decision or raises an issue for our consideration that was either not considered at all or was not fully considered by us when it should have been.\u201d Id. at 143, 5 OBR 320, 450 N.E.2d 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">{\u00b6 3} In his application, defendant contends that we erred because we failed \u201cto distinguish the sort of rights \u2018deeply rooted in our history,\u2019 such as the expectation of a reasonable degree of privacy, that give rise to cognizable due process interests, and fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech or religion, the infringement of which require application of a strict scrutiny test when ruling on due process claims.\u201d Defendant further claims that we relied too heavily on <em>State v. Williams </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 513, 728 N.E.2d 342, certiorari denied sub nom. <em>Suffecool v. Ohio </em>(2000), 531 U.S. 902, 121 S.Ct. 241, 148 L.Ed.2d 173, when we concluded that absent any infringement of a fundamental constitutional right, there lacked a substantive-due-process ground for defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss an indictment. <em>Small, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 325, 2005-Ohio-2291, 833 N.E.2d 736, at \u00b6 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Defendant\u2019s interest in his statutory classification is not insignificant. However, \u201cto determine whether due process requirements apply in the first place, we must look not to the \u2018weight\u2019 but to the nature of the interest at stake.\u201d <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 564, 570-571, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548. See, also, <em>Reno v. Flores </em>(1993), 507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1, quoting <em>Collins v. Harker Hts. </em>(1992), 503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (\u201c \u2018Substantive due process\u2019 analysis must begin with a careful description of the asserted right, for \u2018[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">{\u00b6 5} In <em>Williams, </em>supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio was asked \u201cto determine whether R.C. Chapter 2950 violate[d] constitutional rights guaranteed by the Double Jeopardy, Bill of Attainder, and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions, and whether R.C. Chapter 2950 violate[d] rights enumerated in Section 1, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d Id., 88 Ohio St.3d at 516, 728 N.E.2d 342. The Supreme Court concluded that R.C. Chapter 2950 did not implicate a fundamental constitutional right that had been recognized by the United States Supreme Court. Id. at 531, 728 N.E.2d 342. The Supreme Court ultimately held that R.C. Chapter 2950 was constitutional on the grounds raised in the appeals. Id. at 516, 534, 728 N.E.2d 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 6} Here, the Supreme Court of Ohio has already concluded that R.C. Chapter 2950 does not implicate a fundamental constitutional right that has been recognized by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Williams, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 531, 728 N.E.2d 342. Therefore, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether defendant\u2019s classification as a sexually oriented offender pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2950 implicates a fundamental constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 7} Furthermore, because the Supreme Court of Ohio has concluded that R.C. Chapter 2950 does not implicate a fundamental constitutional right that has been recognized by the United States Supreme Court, <em>Williams, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 531, 728 N.E.2d 342, and because we cannot ignore the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s interpretation, see, e.g., <em>State v. Cox, </em>Adams App. No. 02CA751, 2003-Ohio-1935, 2003 WL 1889479, at \u00b6 12, we conclude that our determination that defendant\u2019s classification as a sexually oriented offender does not implicate any fundamental constitutional right under either the state or federal constitutions was not error. See <em>State ex rel. Heller v. Miller </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 6, 8, 15 O.O.3d 3, 399 N.E.2d 66 (stating that the Ohio Constitution\u2019s guarantees of due process and equal protection are substantially equivalent to the United States Constitution\u2019s guarantees); see, also, <em>Small, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 325, 2005-Ohio-2291, 833 N.E.2d 736, at \u00b6 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Accordingly, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s contention, we do not find that our reliance upon <em>Williams </em>was misplaced. Neither do we conclude that we relied too heavily on <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 9} The state argues, however, that our conclusion that defendant\u2019s classification involves no fundamental right merely determines that strict-scrutiny review is not implicated. Because nonfundamental rights can be cognizable under a due-process analysis, the state contends that our analysis was truncated, and therefore we still need to consider defendant\u2019s due-process claim under a rational-basis level of scrutiny. Defendant also claims that our decision is lacking because it failed to address \u201cwhether there is a rational basis for classifying those who commit a non-sexually motivated kidnapping as sexually oriented offenders, thus subject to registration requirements and prosecution for failures to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Ingraham v. Wright </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">\u201c[T]he range of interests protected by procedural due process is not infinite.\u201d <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, </em>at 570, 92 S.Ct., at 2705 [33 L.Ed.2d 548], We have repeatedly rejected \u201cthe notion that any grievous loss visited upon a person by the State is sufficient to invoke the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. at 224, 96 S.Ct., at 2538 [49 L.Ed.2d 451]. Due process is required only when a decision of the State implicates an interest within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. And \u201cto determine whether due process requirements apply in the first place, we must look not to the \u2018weight\u2019 but to the nature of the interest at stake.\u201d <em>Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S., at 570-571, 92 S.Ct., at 2705, 33 L.Ed.2d 548.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Id. at 672, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711. See, also, <em>Hampton v. United States </em>(1976), 425 U.S. 484, 490, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 48 L.Ed.2d 113 (\u201cThe limitations of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment come into play only when the Government activity in question violates some protected right of the Defendant\u201d); <em>Perry v. McGinnis </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 209 F.3d 597, 609 (\u201cThe violation of a fundamental right * * * is necessary for a successful substantive due process claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 11} The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">Substantive due process, a much more ephemeral concept, protects specific fundamental rights of individual freedom and liberty from deprivation at the hands of arbitrary and capricious government action. The fundamental rights protected by substantive due process arise from the Constitution itself and have been defined as those rights which are \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d * * * While this is admittedly a somewhat vague definition, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>generally held that an interest in liberty or property must be impaired before the protections of substantive due process become available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><em>Gutzwiller v. Fenik </em>(C.A.6, 1988), 860 F.2d 1317, 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 12} Subsequent to <em>Ingraham, </em>430 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711, in <em>Reno, </em>507 U.S. 292, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1, the United States Supreme Court considered a substantive-due-process claim that alien juveniles suspected of being deportable had a fundamental right to freedom from physical restraint. Id. at 301-306, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1. In its discussion, the Supreme Court explained that \u201cnarrow tailoring is required only when fundamental rights are involved. The impairment of a lesser interest * * * demands no more than a \u2018reasonable fit\u2019 between governmental purpose * * * and the means chosen to advance that purpose.\u201d Id. at 305, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 13} Later, in <em>Washington v. Glucksberg </em>(1997), 521 U.S. 702, 722, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">In our view * * * the development of this Court\u2019s substantive-due-process jurisprudence * * * has been a process whereby the outlines of \u201cliberty\u201d specially protected by the Fourteenth Amendment \u2014 never fully clarified, to be sure, and perhaps not capable of being fully clarified \u2014 have at least been carefully refined by concrete examples involving fundamental rights found to be deeply rooted in our legal tradition. This approach tends to rein in the subjective elements that are necessarily present in due-process judicial review. In addition, by establishing a threshold requirement \u2014 that a challenged state action implicate a fundamental right \u2014 before requiring more than a reasonable relation to a legitimate state interest to justify the action, it avoids the need for complex balancing of competing interests in every case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">{\u00b6 14} Thus, by implication, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Reno </em>and <em>Glucksberg </em>suggests that a nonconstitutional guarantee or a nonfundamental right may also implicate a due process interest. Cf. <em>Ingraham, </em>430 U.S. at 672, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711; <em>Hampton, </em>425 U.S. at 490, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 48 L.Ed.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">{\u00b6 15} Indeed, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that a \u201cviolation of a fundamental right * * * is necessary for a successful substantive due process claim.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>209 F.3d at 609. See, also, <em>Gutzwiller, </em>860 F.2d at 1328. But the Sixth Circuit has recently observed the following when undertaking a substantive-due-process analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">The first (and often last) issue in this area is the proper characterization of the individual\u2019s asserted right. <em>Reno v. Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). Governmental actions that infringe a fundamental right receive strict scrutiny. <em>Seal v. Morgan, </em>229 F.3d 567, 574 (6th Cir.2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Otherwise, they receive rational-basis review, which requires them only to be \u201crationally related to a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"><em>Blau v. Fort Thomas Pub. School Dist. </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 401 F.3d 381, 393. See, also, <em>United States v. Brandon </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 158 F.3d 947, 956 (observing that if the government\u2019s action does not burden a fundamental right, it will survive a substantive-due-process challenge if it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest); <em>Valot v. Southeast Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(C.A.6, 1997), 107 F.3d 1220, 1228 (\u201cWhere government action does not deprive a plaintiff of a particular constitutional guarantee or shock the conscience, that action survives the scythe of substantive due process so long as it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest\u201d); <em>Pearson v. Grand Blanc </em>(C.A.6, 1992), 961 F.2d 1211, 1216 (stating that the term \u201csubstantive due process\u201d has been used in the context of application of rights enumerated in the United States Constitution to a state and in. the application of a right unenumerated in the United States Constitution to a state).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 16} Moreover, in <em>Desenco, Inc. v. Akron </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 535, 706 N.E.2d 323, the Supreme Court of Ohio stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">In <em>Fabrey v. McDonald Village Police Dept. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 351, 354, 639 N.E.2d 31, 34, we set out the standards for substantive due process under each Constitution, when a fundamental right is not involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">\u201cUnder the Ohio Constitution, an enactment comports with due process \u2018if it bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public and if it is not unreasonable or arbitrary.\u2019 <em>Benjamin v. Columbus </em>(1957), 167 Ohio St. 103, 110, 4 O.O.2d 113, 117, 146 N.E.2d 854, 860, citing <em>Piqua v. Zimmerlin </em>(1880), 35 Ohio St. 507, 511. Federal due process is satisfied if there is a rational relationship between a statute and its purpose. <em>Martinez v. California </em>(1980), 444 U.S. 277, 283, 100 S.Ct. 553, 558, 62 L.Ed.2d 481, 488.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Id. at 545, 706 N.E.2d 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, based upon our review of relevant case authority, we find well taken the state\u2019s argument that our resolution of its second assignment of error merely implicated that strict-scrutiny review was not applicable. Therefore, we now modify our resolution of the state\u2019s second assignment of error and overrule it, wherein the state asserted that, absent a cognizable due-process interest, the trial court erred in finding a due-process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">{\u00b6 18} Having already found that defendant\u2019s classification as a sexually oriented offender does not implicate a fundamental constitutional right and that strict-scrutiny review is not implicated, we therefore must consider whether the state\u2019s classification of defendant is rationally related to a legitimate state interest or whether there is \u201creasonable fit\u201d between the state\u2019s purpose and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>means chosen to advance that purpose. See, e.g., <em>Reno, </em>507 U.S. at 305, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1; <em>Blau, </em>401 F.3d at 393; and <em>Desenco, Inc., </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 545, 706 N.E.2d 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 19} In our decision, we concluded that defendant was denominated a \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d by operation of law following his 1997 conviction. <em>Small, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 325, 2005-Ohio-2291, 833 N.E.2d 736, at \u00b6 16. Because defendant was denominated a sexually oriented offender in 1997, a plausible argument can be raised that defendant should have challenged his classification as a sexually oriented offender in a direct appeal following his 1997 conviction instead of raising this challenge in a motion to dismiss a later indictment, wherein it was alleged that defendant failed to provide notice of change of address and verify his address as required by R.C. 2950.05 and 2950.06. However, in its 1997 judgment, the trial court indicated only that defendant was not a sexual predator. Absent from this judgment was a judicial determination that defendant was a sexually oriented offender. Because the 1997 judgment failed to provide judicial notice to defendant that he was classified as a sexually oriented offender, we conclude that defendant\u2019s challenge of his classification as a sexually oriented offender through a motion to dismiss a later indictment was properly raised and not untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 20} In his motion to dismiss before the trial court, defendant asserted, among other things, that the state\u2019s prosecution violated due process under both state and federal constitutions as applied to him. \u201c \u2018If a statute is unconstitutional as applied, the State may continue to enforce that statute in different circumstances where it is not unconstitutional ***.\u2019\u201d <em>Small, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 325, 2005-Ohio-2291, 833 N.E.2d 736, at \u00b6 19, quoting <em>Women\u2019s Med.

The state maintains that protection of children and society is a legitimate state interest, and a system of registration for child abductors and child kidnappers rationally furthers that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 24} In determining that R.C. Chapter 2950 was neither impermissibly retroactive nor an ex post facto law, the Supreme Court of Ohio provided a history and overview of R.C. Chapter 2950. <em>Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 405-409, 700 N.E.2d 570. The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">The General Assembly, in repealing and reenacting R.C.

The General Assembly stated that \u201c[i]f the public is provided adequate notice and information about sexual predators, habitual sex offenders, and certain other offenders who commit sexually oriented offenses, members of the public and communities can develop constructive plans to prepare themselves and their children for the sexual predator\u2019s, habitual sex offender\u2019s, or other offender\u2019s release from imprisonment, a prison term, or other confinement. This allows members of the public and communities to meet with members of law enforcement agencies to prepare and obtain information about the rights and responsibilities of the public and the communities and to provide education and counseling to their children.\u201d R.C. 2950.02(A)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">Further, the General Assembly declared that \u201c[s]exual predators and habitual sex offenders pose a high risk of engaging in further offenses even after being released from imprisonment, a prison term, or other confinement and that protection of members of the public from sexual predators and habitual sex offenders is a paramount governmental interest.\u201d R.C. 2950.02(A)(2). Finally, the General Assembly stated that \u201c[a] person who is found to be a sexual predator or a habitual sex offender has a reduced expectation of privacy because of the public\u2019s interest in public safety and in the effective operation of government.\u201d R.C. 2950.02(A)(5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Id. at 406-407, 700 N.E.2d 570; see, also, <em>Williams, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 530, 728 N.E.2d 342; R.C. 2950.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Based upon <em>Cook, Williams, </em>and the plain language of R.C. 2950.02, we conclude that the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting R.C.

Barksdale, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19294, 2003-Ohio-43, 2003 WL 77115 (\u201cThe statute is intended to alert the public to the presence of sex offenders in their midst\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>Barksdale, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to four counts of kidnapping that involved minors as victims. The parties stipulated that the offenses were committed without any sexual motivation or purpose. Thereafter, the trial court classified the defendant as a sexually oriented offender. On appeal, the defendant asserted a violation of due process under state and federal constitutions and a violation of equal protection under the law under state and federal constitutions. The Second District Court of Appeals found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">[T]he requirement that [the defendant] be classified as a sexually oriented offender, and that he comply with the registration and reporting requirements pertaining to sexually oriented offenders, bears no rational relationship to the purposes of the statute and is unreasonable and arbitrary; we agree with [the defendant] that the requirement violates the Due Process clauses of the Ohio Constitution and of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Id. at \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">{\u00b6 27} The Second District reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aybp\">[W]e have little doubt that the legislature could, if it wished, impose registration and reporting requirements for all convicted felons; or, the General Assembly could provide for registration and reporting requirements for felons who have committed offenses against children, upon the theory that children require additional measures to protect them; but it would be unreasonable and arbitrary to denominate these felons as \u201csexually oriented offenders\u201d when their offenses involve no sexual motivation or purpose. The General Assembly might logically designate convicted felons whose offenses have been committed against minor victims as \u201cchild predators,\u201d and impose registration and reporting requirements upon them. This would be neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. Alternatively, the General Assembly, in its desire to provide additional protection for child victims of crime, might impose harsher sentences for offenses committed against children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">Our problem with the application of the automatic, per se designation of certain offenses, which do not involve any inherent sexual motivation or purpose, as \u201csexually oriented offenses,\u201d in the absence of any sexual motivation or purpose, is that the labeling of these offenses as \u201csexually oriented offenses\u201d is unreasonable and arbitrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">In the case before us, the phrase \u201csexually oriented offense,\u201d is one that the average person can be expected to understand as referring to an offense that is committed with a sexual motivation or purpose. The labeling of certain offenses having no sexual motivation or purpose as \u201csexually oriented offenses\u201d confounds this ordinary understanding of the words used, and is therefore unreasonable and arbitrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\"><em>Barksdale, </em>2003-Ohio-43, at \u00b6 21, 22, and 24; see, also, <em>State v. Reine, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19157, 2003-Ohio-50, 2003 WL 77174.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Reine, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to four counts of kidnapping that involved minors as victims. The parties stipulated that the offenses were committed without any sexual motivation or purpose. Thereafter, the trial court classified the defendant as a sexually oriented offender. On appeal, the defendant asserted a violation of due process under the state and federal constitutions. Employing language and reasoning that was nearly identical to its decision in <em>Barksdale, </em>which was decided on the same day, the Second District Court of Appeals concluded that the requirement that the defendant be classified as a sexually oriented offender and the mandatory registration and reporting requirements under R.C. Chapter 2950 as applied to the defendant violated due process under the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">{\u00b6 29} Upon further consideration, finding the reasoning in <em>Barksdale </em>and <em>Reine </em>to be persuasive, we agree with defendant that, absent evidence that he committed the kidnapping of the minor victim with sexual motivation, denominating defendant a \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest as applied to defendant under former R.C. Chapter 2950. Moreover, absent evidence that defendant committed the kidnapping of the minor victim with sexual motivation, there is no rational basis to subject him to registration requirements and prosecution for failure to register under former R.C. Chapter 2950.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, upon reconsideration, we hold that the trial court did not err in determining that the denomination of defendant as a \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d lacked a rational basis under substantive due process as applied to defendant. Having made that determination, we therefore overrule the state\u2019s third assignment of error, wherein it asserted that the trial court erred by determining that the label \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d lacked a rational basis under due process as applied to defendant. Furthermore, for the reasons discussed earlier, we modify our disposition of the state\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">{\u00b6 31} In our decision, because we concluded that our resolution of the state\u2019s second assignment of error was dispositive, we did not consider the state\u2019s first, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>third, and fourth assignments of error. <em>Small, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 325, 2005-Ohio-2291, 833 N.E.2d 736, \u00b6 26. Here, however, upon reconsideration, we have concluded that our resolution of the state\u2019s second assignment of error was not dispositive, and we have overruled the state\u2019s third assignment of error. Accordingly, we now address the state\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">{\u00b6 32} In its first assignment of error, the state asserts that (1) the trial court erred when it found that defendant \u201casserted\u201d a lack of sexual motivation involving his 1997 conviction and (2) the trial court erred when it concluded that the parties entered into a stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 33} In its findings of fact, the trial court stated: \u201cDefendant has asserted that he neither removed the child from the vehicle nor caused him harm, sexual or otherwise.\u201d The state correctly points out that defendant did not testify at the hearing wherein defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was considered. However, the gravamen of defendant\u2019s argument is that the facts underlying his 1997 conviction do not indicate that he kidnapped the minor child with intent to inflict harm of a sexual nature. Accordingly, we find that no prejudicial error occurred here. See, generally, Crim.R. 52(A) (providing that \u201c[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 34} In its conclusions of law, the trial court stated: \u201cIn the case sub judice, counsel for Defendant and counsel for the State have stipulated that the offense was not committed with the purpose of sexual gratification and that there was no sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cStipulation\u201d may be defined as \u201ca voluntary agreement, admission, or concession, made in a judicial proceeding by the parties <em>or their attorneys </em>concerning disposition of some relevant point so as to eliminate the need for proof or to narrow the range of issues to be litigated.\u201d <em>Baum v. Baum </em>(Nov. 26, 1997), Wayne App. No. 97CA0022, 1997 WL 775770. (Emphasis sic.) See, also, <em>Fairborn v. Oost </em>(Jun. 26, 1998), Greene App. No. 97 CA 107, 1998 WL 336775, quoting Black\u2019s-Law Dictionary (Abridged) (6th Ed.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">{\u00b6 36} Based upon our review of the record, we find that the parties did not enter into a stipulation. Therefore, to this limited extent, the state\u2019s^ contention is well taken in that the trial court erroneously concluded that the parties had entered into a stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">{\u00b6 37} However, during the state\u2019s argument at the hearing to consider defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, wherein the state discussed the statutory scheme then in effect, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">MR. BOKELMAN [Assistant Prosecutor]: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The state could have easily titled that differently and created a new subsection for people who kidnap children, or abduct children, or any of the other offenses that are listed there as a sexually-oriented offender. They just chose to give it that label to still get that protected goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">THE COURT: The difficulty with the argument in this case is this. 2950 is entitled: Sexual Predators, Habitual Sexual Offenders, Sexually Oriented Offenders. Those individuals or offenders are described in here very clearly. The thrust of the statute is to make sure that the public knows the whereabouts of people who commit sexually-oriented or sexual offenses. Mr. Small didn\u2019t commit a sexual offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">MR. BOKELMAN: That we know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">THE COURT: There is nothing on this record that would entitle me to make a determination that he committed a sexual offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 38} Here, the trial court extended an invitation to the state to provide argumentation to support a contention that defendant\u2019s 1997 kidnapping conviction was sexually motivated. The assistant prosecutor\u2019s statement that defendant did not commit a sexual offense \u201c[t]hat we know of\u2019 falls short of demonstrating that defendant\u2019s 1997 conviction was sexually motivated, especially in view of the state\u2019s representations to the trial court at the time of defendant\u2019s sentencing in 1997 wherein the assistant prosecutor discussed no sexual motivation or sexually offensive conduct by defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">{\u00b6 39} Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s erroneous conclusion that the parties entered into a stipulation, under the specific facts of this case, we conclude the trial court\u2019s error was harmless. See Crim.R. 52(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">{\u00b6 40} Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the state\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">{\u00b6 41} In its fourth assignment of error, the state asserts: \u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing the indictment, since the application of registration and verification laws to even non-sexual child kidnappers is constitutional, the \u2018sexually oriented offender\u2019 label notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">{\u00b6 42} Here, the state suggests that, rather than dismissing the indictment against defendant, the trial court could have corrected any potential confusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>regarding defendant\u2019s denomination as a \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d by issuing a disclaimer that indicated that defendant\u2019s 1997 kidnapping conviction qualified as a \u201csexually oriented offense,\u201d even though there was no evidence that defendant committed the kidnapping with a sexual purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 43} Because we have already held that absent any evidence that defendant kidnapped his minor victim with a sexual purpose, defendant\u2019s denomination as a \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d and the requisite registration requirements based upon defendant\u2019s status as a \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d violated substantive due process as applied to defendant, the state\u2019s fourth assignment of error is not persuasive, as it presupposes that defendant\u2019s \u201cas applied\u201d constitutional challenge is not meritorious. In <em>Barksdale, </em>2003-Ohio-43, the Second District Court of Appeals observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">[T]he phrase \u201csexually oriented offense,\u201d is one that the average person can be expected to understand as referring to an offense that is committed with a sexual motivation or purpose. The labeling of certain offenses having no sexual motivation or purpose as \u201csexually oriented offenses\u201d confounds this ordinary understanding of the words used, and is therefore unreasonable and arbitrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">See, also, <em>Reine, </em>2003-Ohio-50 at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">{\u00b6 44} Issuing a disclaimer that indicates defendant\u2019s 1997 kidnapping conviction qualified as a \u201csexually oriented offense\u201d absent any evidence that defendant committed the kidnapping with a sexual purpose is inconsistent with the purpose of the statutory scheme of R.C. Chapter 2950, which was intended to alert the public to the presence of sex offenders in their midst.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 45} The Supreme Court of Ohio has stated, \u201cIn the absence of a constitutional concern * * * the judiciary\u2019s function is to interpret the law as written by the General Assembly. \u2018 \u201c[T]he legislature is the final arbiter of public policy, unless its acts contravene the state or federal Constitutions.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Beagle v. Walden </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 59, 62, 676 N.E.2d 506, quoting <em>State v. Kavlich </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 240, 246, 515 N.E.2d 652 (Markus, C.J., concurring). Here, we have found a constitutional concern regarding the denomination of defendant as a \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d absent any evidence that defendant committed the kidnapping of a minor with a sexual purpose or motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">{\u00b6 46} Indeed, the General Assembly in 2003 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 5 appeared to have recognized the inconsistency of denominating persons who kidnap child victims absent any evidence of sexual motivation or purpose as \u201csexually oriented offenders\u201d by creating a new category in R.C. 2950.01, \u201cchild-victim oriented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>offense,\u201d which includes violations of division (A)(1), (2), (3), or (5) of R.C. 2905.01<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when the victim is under 18 years of age and by defining a \u201csexually oriented offense\u201d as including a violation of division (A)(4) of R.C. 2905.01 when the victim is under 18 years of age. See sections 1 and 3 of 2003 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 47} Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, we overrule the state\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">{\u00b6 48} Accordingly, having overruled the state\u2019s first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error, we therefore (1) grant defendant\u2019s application to reconsider our decision and (2) affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss an indictment. Furthermore, having affirmed the trial court, we sua sponte vacate our previous order remanding the cause to the trial court to consider defendant\u2019s equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Application for reconsideration granted, judgment affirmed, and order vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-8\">Klatt and Deshler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b424-9\">Deshler, J., retired of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting by assignment of the Chief Justice of the Suprehie Court of Ohio.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-13\">. To a supplemental memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss, defendant attached an unauthenticated copy of the transcript of the 1997 sentencing hearing. In the trial court, the state did not object to this evidence, nor did it move to strike this evidence. Accordingly, absent any objection, we hold that the trial court in its discretion properly could consider the transcript of the 1997 sentencing hearing, and this court properly may consider this evidence.
