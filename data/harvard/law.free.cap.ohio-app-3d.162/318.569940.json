Grendell, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Craig A. McAdams, appeals from the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas sentencing him to four years in prison for his conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (\u201cDOT\u201d), a felony of the third degree, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">{\u00b6 2} On January 3, 2003, a Buick was reported to be driven erratically on State Route 2 in Eastlake, Ohio. Police responded and subsequently arrested McAdams for DOT. On July 15, 2003, McAdams pleaded guilty to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">{\u00b6 3} On March 3, 2004, a sentencing hearing was held. McAdams was sentenced to a four-year prison term, with credit for two days served, and ordered to pay an $800 fine. In addition, his driving record was assessed six points, and his driver\u2019s license was permanently revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">{\u00b6 4} McAdams timely appeals, raising a single assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court violated the defendant-appellant\u2019s right to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution when it sentenced him contrary to R.C. 2929.12.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">{\u00b6 6} An appellate court reviews a felony sentence under a clear-and-convincing-evidence standard of review. R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). In doing so, we conduct a meaningful review of the imposition of sentence. <em>State v. Comer, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-4165, 793 N.E.2d 473, at \u00b6 10. \u201c \u2018Meaningful review' means that an appellate court hearing an appeal of a felony sentence may modify or vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the trial court for resentencing if the court clearly and convincingly finds that the record does not support the sentence or that the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\u201d Id., citing R.C. 2953.08. Clear and convincing evidence is that quantum of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief regarding the facts sought to be established. <em>State v. Bradford </em>(June 1, 2001), 11th Dist. No. 2000-L-103, 2001 WL 589271.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">{\u00b6 7} Pursuant to Ohio\u2019s sentencing guidelines, there is no established presumption either in favor of or against the imposition of a term of imprisonment for a third-degree felony. <em>State v. Morales, </em>11th Dist. No.2003-L-025, 2004-Ohio-7239, 2004 WL 3090188, \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Little, </em>12th Dist. No. CA200206-138, 2003-Ohio-1612, 2003 WL 1689605, \u00b6 6. \u201cUnless a mandatory prison term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>is required, a trial court has discretion to determine the most effective method to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11.\u201d <em>State v. Fails </em>(Nov. 9, 2001), 11th Dist. No. 2000-P-0119, 2001 WL 1402002. See, also, <em>State v. Nutter </em>(Aug. 24, 2001), 3rd Dist. No. 16-01-06, 2001 WL 961748; R.C. 2929.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 8} Under R.C. 2929.12, a court, in exercising this discretion, must consider all applicable factors that would indicate that the offense was \u201cmore serious than conduct normally constituting the offense,\u201d factors that would indicate that the offense was \u201cless serious than the conduct normally constituting the offense,\u201d and factors that would indicate the offender\u2019s likelihood of recidivism. <em>Fails; State v. Cook, </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-L-009, 2004-Ohio-793, 2004 WL 323151, \u00b6 14; R.C. 2929.12. \u201cA trial court may also consider any other factor relevant in achieving the above-stated purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>Fails. </em>However, when considering the seriousness and recidivism factors of R.C. 2929.12, a trial court is not required to \u201cmake specific findings on the record in order to evince the requisite consideration of the applicable seriousness and recidivism factors.\u201d <em>State v. Arnett </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 208, 215, 724 N.E.2d 793; <em>State v. Matthews, </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-L-043, 2004-Ohio-1849, 2004 WL 765579, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 9} At the sentencing hearing, McAdams made the following statement to the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cYou are looking at the shell of a man who is very sick. Alcohol has definitely taken a toll on me physically, if not mentally, and I would like to just build my life again if I can. I would like to go somewhere and get help * * *. I have also been checking into, the last month and a half or so, * * * hospitals for programs * *</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 11} Relying on <em>State v. McLemore </em>(2000), 136 Ohio App.3d 550, 737 N.E.2d 125, McAdams contends that the trial court\u2019s finding that there was a pattern of abuse that was unacknowledged and untreated was unsupported by the record. In <em>McLemore, </em>the Third District Court of Appeals held, under R.C. 2929.12(D)(4), that the factor indicating a greater likelihood of recidivism based on a pattern of drug and alcohol abuse has two components that must be satisfied: \u201c(1) * * * there is a pattern of abuse that is related to the offense, and (2) that pattern of abuse is unacknowledged <em>or untreated at the time of sentencing.\u201d </em>Id. at 552, 737 N.E.2d 125. (Emphasis added.) McAdams concedes that there is a pattern of abuse related to the offense; however, he argues that the court improperly failed to take into account his statement to the court that he was seeking treatment. McAdams further argues that the trial court erred in finding that he exhibited no genuine remorse for his actions. McAdams\u2019s reliance on <em>McLemore </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>{\u00b6 12} In <em>McLemore, </em>the appellate court overturned the trial court\u2019s judgment of sentence, noting that contrary to the trial court\u2019s findings, McLemore had not only admitted that his drug-abuse problem related to the offense, but he had also shown that he had taken steps to address his problem by submitting evidence of a series of voluntary urinalysis tests he had taken that showed that he had tested negative for the use of marijuana and cocaine. Id. at 552-553, 737 N.E.2d 125. Despite McAdams\u2019s bald assertion that he had been checking into programs for the past month and a half, he did not demonstrate that he had taken any affirmative steps to get his problem under control, as evidenced by the fact that he tested positive for both marijuana and cocaine at the time of his referral to the probation department, and again tested positive for marijuana at the time of his presentence interview. Furthermore, McAdams\u2019s explanation that he had tested positive for cocaine because someone put it in his drink places his claim that he has taken responsibility for his substance-abuse problem into serious doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 13} We find equally unconvincing McAdams\u2019s claim that the court erred in concluding that he exhibited no genuine remorse. This court has repeatedly held that \u201cthe trial court is in the best position to address the genuineness of a defendant\u2019s statement at the sentencing hearing since it has the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Lewis, </em>11th Dist. No. 2001-L-060, 2002-Ohio-3373, 2002 WL 1400591, \u00b6 18; see also, <em>State v. Chike, </em>11th Dist. No.2001-L-120, 2002-Ohio-6912, 2002 WL 31813015, \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Eckliffe, </em>11th Dist. No. 2001-L-105, 2002-Ohio-7136, 2002 WL 31862652, \u00b6 32; <em>State v. Tennyson </em>(Nov. 21, 2001), 11th Dist. No. 98-L-219, 2001 WL 1497209. Based on the fact that the court referred to not only McAdams\u2019s positive drug tests following this arrest, but also to his 11 prior convictions for DUI, we cannot find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the court erred in concluding that McAdams lacked genuine remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 14} For the foregoing reasons, we find McAdams\u2019s assignment of error to be without merit and affirm the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">{\u00b6 15} By leave of this court, granted on May 25, 2005, McAdams raises the following supplemental assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe trial court erred when it sentenced the defendant-appellant to a more-than-the minimum prison sentence based upon a finding of factors not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant-appellant in violation of the defendant-appellant\u2019s State and Federal Constitutional rights to trial by jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">{\u00b6 17} As previously mentioned, McAdams was convicted of a third-degree-felony DUI and ordered to serve a term of four years. The prescribed sentencing range for a third-degree felony is one to five years, R.C. 2929.14(A)(3). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>However, R.C. 2929.14(B) provides that \u201cthe court shall impose the shortest prison term authorized for the offense * * * unless one or more of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(1) The offender was serving a prison term at the time of the offense, or the offender previously had served a prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(2) The court finds on the record that the shortest term will demean the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct or will not adequately protect the public from future crime by the offender or others.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 20} McAdams argues that since he has not previously served a prison term, the court, in making its \u201cfindings\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B) that \u201cthe shortest term will demean the seriousness\u201d of his conduct and will \u201cnot adequately protect the public,\u201d violated the dictates of <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, which held that, \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in a jury verdict or admitted by the </em>defendant.\u201d Id. 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. at 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. (Emphasis sic.) The holding in <em>Blakely </em>refined the rule of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, which held, \u201cOther than the fact of a <em>prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b6 21} Our review of the sentencing transcript indicates that the trial court made findings on the record based upon McAdams\u2019s indictment and his presentence investigation report and found that on February 2, 1992, defendant was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Shock probation was denied June of 1992. The court further found that on September 15, 2001, \u201cthe defendant was sentenced to one year in prison\u201d for DUI. During oral argument before this court, defense counsel withdrew McAdams\u2019s supplemental assignment of error, in recognition of the trial court\u2019s recognized capacity under <em>Blakely </em>and R.C. 2929.14(B) to take judicial notice of McAdams\u2019s prior prison terms when imposing a greater-than-minimum sentence. See <em>State v. Taylor, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 597, 2004-Ohio-5939, 821 N.E.2d 192, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b357-10\">O\u2019Toole, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b357-11\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>William M. O\u2019Neill, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Auj\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 22} I concur in the well-reasoned majority opinion, for I believe this matter presents a good opportunity to speak with clarity on the narrow question of the circumstances that permit a trial court to impose more than a minimum sentence in a manner that is consistent with <em>Blakely v. Washington.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This court has consistently held that a trial court\u2019s reliance on a previous prison term as evidenced in the record would still be permissible for the purpose of imposing a sentence greater than the minimum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As stated by this court in <em>State v. Taylor:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cUnder R.C. 2929.14(B)(1), the court is entitled to depart from the shortest authorized prison term if the \u2018offender had previously served a prison term.\u2019 Under <em>Apprendi, </em>the fact of a prior conviction may be used to enhance the penalty for a crime without being submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial court\u2019s imposition of a four-year prison term in this case is \u201cconstitutionally permissible under <em>Apprendi </em>and, by extension, Blakely.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 24} In addition, this court has recently held:</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cIt is clear that, for <em>Blakely </em>purposes, a trial court is permitted to take judicial notice that a defendant has served a prior prison term, for that is not a \u2018finding.\u2019 It is a judicial acknowledgement of an indisputable fact. The trial court merely acknowledges the prior prison term and does not have to weigh conflicting evidence to make a factual finding. As such, a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights are not compromised by the exercise.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">{\u00b6 26} As so eloquently stated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Blakely, </em>\u201c[t]his case is not about whether determinate sentencing is constitutional, only about how it can be implemented in a way that respects the Sixth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">{\u00b6 27} In this matter, the record clearly demonstrates that appellant served a prior prison term. Therefore, the trial court appropriately imposed more than the minimum sentence. Therefore, I concur with the majority.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-11\">. <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-12\">. <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 597, 2004-Ohio-5939, 821 N.E.2d 192.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-13\">. <em>Apprendi v.
