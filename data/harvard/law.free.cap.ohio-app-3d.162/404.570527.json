Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 2} On October 22, 2004, the Stark County Grand Jury indicted appellant on one count of illegally manufacturing or processing explosives in violation of R.C. 2923.17(B), a felony of the second degree, and one count of inducing panic in violation of R.C. 2917.31(A)(3), a misdemeanor of the first degree. The charges arose after appellant and his codefendant, Anthony Young, created a \u201cbottle bomb\u201d by putting aluminum foil and toilet-bowl cleaner in a plastic bottle, capping the bottle, and then shaking it. The two then threw the bottle onto a sidewalk near a school, where it exploded. At his arraignment on October 29, 2004, appellant entered a plea of not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">{\u00b6 3} Thereafter, on November 18, 2004, appellant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that \u201cthe facts do not warrant an indictment under R.C. 2923.17(B).\u201d Appellant specifically asserted that the bottle bomb was not an \u201cexplosive device\u201d as defined by R.C. 2923.11(H). Appellant also referred the trial court to R.C. 2923.1KM).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">{\u00b6 4} After the trial court denied his motion, appellant, on December 6, 2004, entered a plea of no contest to both charges contained in the indictment. As memorialized in a judgment entry filed on December 13, 2004, appellant was sentenced to four years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">{\u00b6 5} On December 17, 2004, appellant filed a motion to reconsider, asking the trial court to reconsider its decision denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Appellant argued that the bottle bomb was not an \u201cexplosive\u201d as defined by R.C. 2923.11(M). According to a judgment entry filed on December 21, 2004, the trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant now raises the following assignment of error on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error when it overruled defendant/appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant, in his sole assignment of error, argues that the trial court committed reversible error in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 9} As is stated above, appellant was indicted on one count of illegally manufacturing or processing explosives in violation of R.C. 2923.17(B). That section states as follows: \u201cNo person shall manufacture or process an explosive at any location in this state unless the person first has been issued a license, certificate of registration, or permit to do so from a fire official of a political subdivision of this state or from the office of the fire marshal.\u201d In turn, R.C. 2923.11(M) defines an \u201cexplosive\u201d as \u201cany chemical compound, mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to function by explosion. \u2018Explosive\u2019 includes all materials that have been classified as class A, class B, or class C explosives by the United States department of transportation in its regulations and includes, but is not limited to, dynamite, black powder, pellet powders, initiating explosives, blasting caps, electric blasting caps, safety fuses, fuse igniters, squibs, cordeau detonant fuses, instantaneous fuses, and igniter cords and igniters. <em>\u2018Explosive\u2019 does not include \u2018fireworks,\u2019 as defined in section 374.3.01 of the 'Revised Code, or any explosive that is not subject to regulation under the rules of the fire marshal adopted pursuant to section 3737.82 of the Revised Code.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 10} We concur with appellant that the bottle bomb does not fit within the definition of \u201cexplosive\u201d contained in R.C. 2923.11(M). R.C. 2923.11(M) states that, as used in R.C. 2923.17, the term \u201c \u2018Explosive\u2019 does not include \u2018fireworks,\u2019 as defined in section 3743.01 of the Revised Code, or any explosive that is not subject to regulation under the rules of the fire marshal * * Appellee does not dispute that none of the materials in this case that were used to make the bottle bomb, including toilet-bowl cleaner containing hydrochloric acid, are subject to the rules and regulations of the fire marshal. Nor, as noted by appellant, are they classified as an \u201cexplosive\u201d by the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Rather, the materials used in the case sub judice were all common household items readily available at a grocery store.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 11} We further note that at least one court has held that a bottle bomb created by placing toilet-bowl cleaner containing hydrochloric acid and aluminum foil into a bottle was a \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d as defined by R.C. 2923.11(K)(2). See <em>In re Travis </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 684, 675 N.E.2d 36. In <em>Travis, </em>the appellant was charged with possession of a dangerous ordnance in violation of R.C. 2923.17(A). R.C. 2923.11(E)(2) defines a \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d as including \u201c[a]ny explosive device.\u201d The appellant in <em>Travis </em>specifically argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>bottle bombs were not \u201cexplosive devices\u201d as defined by R.C. 2923.11(H). That section defines an \u201cexplosive device\u201d as \u201cany device designed or specially adapted to cause physical harm to persons or property by means of an explosion, and consisting of an explosive substance or agency and a means to detonate it. \u2018Explosive device\u2019 includes without limitation any bomb, any explosive demolition device, any blasting cap or detonator containing an explosive charge, and any pressure vessel that has been knowingly tampered with or arranged so as to explode.\u201d In <em>Travis, </em>the court held that a bottle bomb was an \u201cexplosive device\u201d and thus a \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 12} Under the Revised Code, \u201cexplosive device\u201d does not have the same definition as \u201cexplosive;\u201d rather, each has a separate and distinct definition. We find that the bottle bomb in this case was not an \u201cexplosive\u201d as defined by R.C. 2923.1KM).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 13} We find, therefore, that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is, therefore, sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 15} Accordingly, the judgment of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b441-10\">Farmer and Wise, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
