The Cincinnati Enquirer (\u201cGannett\u201d), Jane Prendergast, the city of Cincinnati, and John Does 1 through 5, who are Cincinnati police officers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the trial court in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On September 28, 2002, the Cincinnati Enquirer published an article written by Jane Prendergast. The article was about the arrests of two men and two juveniles. One of the men arrested was Deangelo Williams. The article stated, \u201c[Deangelo Williams] is the son of former Cincinnati officer, Clarence Williams, a former president of the Sentinels black-officers group. He is legally prohibited from having a gun because he has a previous conviction for selling drugs.\u201d Deangelo Williams is not the son of Clarence Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 3} Clarence Williams III, his son Clarence Williams IV, his ex-wife, Caralyn Williams, and his mother, Evelyn Williams, filed defamation and intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress claims against Gannett, Prendergast, the city, and five unnamed police officers who allegedly told Prendergast that Deangelo Williams was the son of Clarence Williams III. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 4} A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is properly granted when it appears beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to recovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All factual allegations made in the complaint must be presumed true, and all reasonable inferences must be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">{\u00b6 5} Williams\u2019s brief assigns error concerning only the trial court\u2019s conclusion about his defamation claim. In order to survive a motion to dismiss, Williams <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>had to allege the elements of defamation: (1) a false and defamatory statement concerning Williams, (2) publication of the statement, (3) fault, and (4) harm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The appellees did not dispute that the statement concerning Williams was false or that the statement was published \u2014 first by the police officers to Prendergast and then by the Gannett appellees to the general public in the newspaper article. At issue in this appeal is the degree of fault and the harm or damages that Williams needed to allege in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 6} Although framed as whether the statement was \u201cof and concerning\u201d Clarence Williams IV, Williams\u2019s first assignment of error addresses the issue of the harm alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 7} A defamatory statement can be one of two types \u2014 defamatory per quod or defamatory per se. A defamatory-per-quod statement is one that is determined to be defamatory by the interpretation of the listener.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If a complaint alleges defamation per quod, the plaintiff must allege special damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Williams did not allege special damages. Instead, he alleged that the statement was defamatory per se, or defamatory on its face. When a complaint alleges defamation per se, damages are presumed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the statement in question was not defamatory per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 8} In order to be considered defamatory per se, the words used in the statement must fall in one of three categories: (1) the imputation of a charge of an indictable offense involving moral turpitude or infamous punishment, (2) the imputation of some offensive or contagious diseases calculated to deprive the person of society, or (3) having the tendency to injure the plaintiff in his trade or occupation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When, as here, the words are unambiguous, whether the words are defamatory per se is a matter of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 9} Gannett and the city focused on the first category \u2014 imputation of a charge of an indictable offense. The parties cite multiple cases from jurisdictions outside Ohio for the proposition that a mere allegation that a person is related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>a criminal is not generally defamation per se.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We need not determine whether an allegation of a relationship to a criminal can never be defamation per se. Instead, we conclude that the analysis is properly focused on whether the statement in this case fell within the third category \u2014 whether the statement would tend to injure Williams in his trade or occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 10} A statement that a police officer\u2019s son is a criminal reflects negatively on the police officer\u2019s professional ability. That Williams\u2019s son was arrested carrying a weapon while under a disability and that his son had a previous conviction for selling drugs would tend to affect Williams\u2019s opportunity for advancement. Gannett and Prendergast clearly believed that Williams\u2019s positions as a former Cincinnati police officer and former president of the Sentinels were relevant to a story that was otherwise about the arrest of four individuals. The trial court stated that any effect the statement may have had on Williams\u2019s career advancement was purely speculative. But in order to be found defamatory per se, the statement needed only to <em>tend </em>to injure Williams in his trade or occupation. To require that he have alleged actual career harm would be to require the proof of special damages associated with defamation per quod.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 11} Because the trial court erred in concluding that the statement was not defamatory per se, the first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 12} Williams\u2019s second assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Williams was a public figure. If Williams was a public figure, he had to allege actual malice to survive a motion to dismiss. The trial court concluded that Williams was a public figure, but it also concluded that Williams had properly alleged actual malice. Thus, the claim was not dismissed on this ground. Because our conclusion with respect to the first assignment of error is sufficient to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment, its decision that Williams was a public figure is not moot. Whether Williams has to prove actual malice will affect his claim going forward, as it may be difficult to prove that Gannett knew the statement was false but published it anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Soke v. The Plain Dealer, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court considered whether a police officer who testified during the trial of his nephew was a public official for defamation purposes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court recognized that the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that police officers are public officials.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>court went on to determine whether, in light of the conclusion that the police officer was a public official, statements made about him were constitutionally protected. Because the statements made might have reflected on his fitness for office, the court held that they were constitutionally protected and that the police officer needed to prove actual malice.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 14} Similarly, as we determined with respect to the first assignment of error, the statement made about Williams tended to reflect on his fitness for office. Under the reasoning of <em>Soke, </em>to succeed on his defamation claim, Williams had to prove actual malice on the part of Gannett and the unnamed police officers. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 15} Williams\u2019s final assignments of error concern whether the statement in the article was \u201cof and concerning\u201d Williams, Clarence Williams IV, Caralyn Williams, and Evelyn Williams. There is no question that the statement was about Williams. He was mentioned by name in the statement. The trial court did not conclude otherwise. But the trial court concluded that the article was not \u201cof and concerning\u201d Clarence Williams IV, Caralyn Williams, and Evelyn Williams. Because only Clarence Williams III has appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment, the assignments of error with respect to the other defendants are not properly before us. Therefore, we overrule the third and fourth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 16} Because we conclude that the first assignment of error is well taken with respect to Williams\u2019s defamation claim, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment only as to that claim and remand this cause for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Judgment reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b635-9\">Painter, P.J., and Hendon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\">. Although Williams\u2019s brief raises assignments of error concerning plaintiffs Clarence Daryl Williams IV, Caralyn Williams, and Evelyn Williams, we note that the notice of appeal states that only Clarence Daryl Williams III is appealing the trial court\u2019s judgment. The arguments of the other plaintiffs are therefore not before us. See <em>Seipelt v. Motorist Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 81 Ohio App.3d 530, 611 N.E.2d 917.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-11\">. The case was before this court earlier under case No. C-030480. We dismissed that appeal, pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B), because the trial court had not entered judgment in favor of Cincinnati and the police officers.
