Solio, </em>4 <em>Penn. </em>138, the court were unanimous in opinion that the indictment should be quashed because it did not set out with sufficient certainty the nature and character of the offense charged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-20\">In <em>State v. Polk, </em>6 <em>Penn. </em>456, the court considered <em>Section </em>12, <em>page </em>419, <em>Revised Code </em>(1893), but it does not appear that counsel for the defendant supported his contention with any authorities that said provision was unconstitutional or that the court considered that question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-21\">In <em>State v. Fagan, </em>1 <em>Boyce </em>45, a motion was made to quash the indictment because it failed to aver the sale without a license.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-22\">The court merely stated that it was of opinion that the case of <em>State v. Polk </em>governed and the application- to quash was refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-23\">It is impossible to comprehend that the Legislature intended in the face of the Constitution to relieve the state from fully informing the defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. There is nothing before the court to show whether these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>defendants are charged with selling intoxicating liquor without a license or within two miles of any campmeeting, held for religious worship, in violation of <em>Section </em>3 of <em>Chapter </em>131, <em>Revised Code, p. </em>952.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\">The defendant denies the right of the Legislature to prescribe a form which, in fact, charges no crime. <em>State v. Learned, </em>47 <em>Maine </em>426.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">The accused has the right to know the charge in the whole form and substance against him, to contest it, and, if not proved to the satisfaction of a jury, to demand an acquittal. <em>Saco v. Wentworth, </em>37 <em>Maine </em>172; <em>Approved in State v. Mace, </em>76 <em>Maine </em>64 (66); <em>State v. Learned, </em>47 <em>Maine (supra); Enders v.

Olmstead, </em>30 <em>Mich. </em>431 (437).</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">The evils to be removed by the various acts concerning indictments consisted in redundant verbiage, and in minute charges which were not required to be proven as alleged. And these difficulties were chiefly confined to common-law offenses. Statutory offenses were always required to be set out with all the stautory elements: <em>Koster v. People, </em>8 <em>Mich. R. </em>431; <em>Enders v. People, </em>20 <em>Mich. R. </em>233.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\">In this state the courts have unanimously held that the indictment should fully inform the defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. <em>State v.

Revised Code, </em>419, provides: \u201cIn prosecutions against any vendor of intoxicating liquors, it shall not be necessary to aver or allege in any form that the defendants had no license; but the fact of license shall be matter of defense under the plea of not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-18\">Against this claim of the state the defendants\u2019 counsel contends that <em>section </em>12 is unconstitutional in that it violates the provisions of <em>Section </em>7, <em>Article </em>1, of the <em>Constitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">The questions for our consideration in, this case have been passed on by this court in three reported cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-20\">In the case of <em>State v. Solio, </em>4 <em>Penn. </em>138, 54 <em>Atl. </em>684, the court on motion quashed the indictment on the ground that it did not set out with sufficient certainty the nature and character of the offense charged. In the <em>Solio case </em>the attention of the court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>not called to <em>section </em>12, and its provisions, but in the next case considered, which is the case of <em>State v. Polk, </em>6 <em>Penn. </em>456, 69 <em>Atl. </em>1006, the state made the same contention in respect to <em>section </em>12 as it makes in the present case, and at that time it was urged on behalf of the defendant that the said section of the <em>Code </em>was not constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">The court held <em>section </em>12 to be constitutional and refused to quash the indictment. This decision was followed by this court in the case of <em>State v. Fagan, </em>1 <em>Boyce </em>45, 74 <em>Atl. </em>692, when it refused to quash the indictment, the court saying at the time that it was governed by the decision of the court in the <em>Polk case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AAM\">Thus while this court in the early case held the indictment to be insufficient, yet in the two later cases, and the only cases in' which the constitutionality of <em>section </em>12 was raised, the court held the indictments in the respective cases to be good.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">This court is of the opinion that it should adhere to the decisions of the same court in the later cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">We therefore overrule the motion and refuse to quash the indictment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
