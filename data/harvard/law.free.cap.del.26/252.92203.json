While the replication did raise other questions, the important question then argued and considered was the plea and its sufficiency in law. In overruling the replication the court distinctly held the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>plea sufficient, and it could do nothing more in deciding the question raised by the present demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The court will not hear and determine a question that has been already decided in the same case, and for that reason we order the demurrer filed by the plaintiff to the defendants\u2019 fifth plea stricken out.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
