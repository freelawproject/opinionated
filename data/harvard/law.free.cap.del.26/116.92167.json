The cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations on May 27, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-12\">At the trial when the plaintiff rested, counsel for defendant stated that they desired to ask the court to instruct the jury to bring in a verdict for the defendant, and inquired whether if such an application were declined by the court, the defendant would then be allowed to put in his testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-13\">Boyce, J.:\u2014If your application should be declined you would of course proceed with your case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-14\">The defendant\u2019s counsel thereupon moved that the court instruct the jury to find for the defendant, because the summons was not issued until June 2, 1910, at which time the action was barred by the statute of limitations, and in the meantime there had been no promise of payment to raise the bar of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-15\">Counsel for plaintiff contended that the filing of the <em>praecipe </em>on May 24, 1910, which was three days before the statute of limitations began to run, was the commencement of the action and that therefore it was not barred by the statute.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b127-16\">Boyce, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-K\">delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">We recognize that in this court the use of the <em>praecipe </em>prevails. The office and effect of the <em>praecipe </em>in this court is not before us, and we express no opinion in relation thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The question now before us is whether a <em>praecipe </em>filed before a justice of the peace commanding that a summons or attachment issue is the commencement of an action such as will arrest the operation of the act of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The justice\u2019s court is a court of special and limited jurisdiction. It is without terms or rules and we know of no practice prevailing in a justice\u2019s court for the use of the <em>praecipe </em>in bringing an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The statute giving jurisdiction to justices of the peace in civil actions provides for two kinds of process; one is by summons and the other by attachment. Whether a person desiring to bring an action before a justice shall demand a summons or attachment orally or in writing, we think the action is not begun until the process is actually issued by the justice. It is not the order for the summons or attachment, but the issuance thereof, in a justice\u2019s court, that operates in arresting the act of limitations. In this case, the summons not having issued until the second day of June, 1910, more than three years from the time the cause of action accrued, to wit, twenty-fourth day of May, 1910, the act of limitations had run before the action was brought. And the act of limitations having been pleaded, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action, and the request of the defendant for binding instructions in favor of the defendant should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Gentlemen of the jury, you are directed to return a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Verdict for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
