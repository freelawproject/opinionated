Before actually commencing the work on the contract, it awarded a contract to Joseph H. Ward\u2019s Sons of the Crum Creek Quarries, Pa., for riprap of the same character and specifications. Stewart claimed that he was induced to enter into the contract by fraudulent misrepresentations, and that on the same day he dictated a letter to Prescott, in which he stated that \u201cWe have looked into the financial end of the Monad Engineering Company, and find that your Company is rather dilatory in paying bills, especially within the last year, therefore we will be justified in not living up to the terms of our letter of this P. M. unless you can give us good securities. Your order for one thousand tons has been canceled until we hear from you further.\u201d On December fifteenth plaintiffs notified Stewart of their readiness to accept the stone, and that on his failure to comply with his contract, they would be compelled to get it elsewhere; and on the thirty-first of December notified Stewart that they were purchasing the stone on his account. <em>t</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-9\">The fraud practiced upon the defendant, according to his contention, consists of two things: (1) That he was deceived as to the purpose for which the Monad Engineering Company desired to use the stone; and (2) that Prescott stated to him that they had paid their bills for all material received by them on the present job within thirty days, and that the credit of the Monad Engineering Company was A No. 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-10\">As to the first ground of fraud Stewart testified that he asked Prescott, \u201cIs this the same job that I bid on in the month of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>June? Oh, no, he says, it is another job. The specifications are practically the same. I said if it was, I would give him no figure. I would not furnish him a pound of stone. He satisfied me that it was not for the same job.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-5\">As to the second ground of fraud Stewart testified \u201cWe then went into the question of his financial standing. I asked him what was his Company\u2019s standing in the financial world, and he said it was A No. 1; that they paid all their bills in thirty days. I said, have you paid your bills for all materials received by you on the present job to within thirty days? He says, we have.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\">\u201cQ. If he had not satisfied you that his credit was good, and that he had paid his bills to within thirty days, you would not have given him any credit? A. Not for a pound. Q. And you would not have made the contract? A. I would not. Q. You say he satisfied you as to his credit? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-7\">To establish the fact that they did not pay their bills within thirty days after delivery, one witness was called by the defendant. This witness had a contract to deliver stone to the Monad Engineering Company for the Cross Ledge Light work. He testified-that on December 13,1907, there had been no payment for stone delivered, and that his first delivery was made on August 16, 1907. He didn\u2019t think there were any terms of payment in his contract. On cross examination he was asked whether his contract was not that he was to be paid on the twenty-fifth of the next succeeding month after the rendering of his bill, to which his answer was: \u201cPossibly it was. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d When he was further asked whether there was any overdue account from the Monad Engineering Company to him on the thirteenth of December, 1907, his reply was: \u201cI don\u2019t say that it was an overdue account. I said that I had not received any money on the thirteenth of December.\u201d Again when asked about the same matter as to whether there was an overdue account on the thirteenth of December, 1907, from the Monad Engineering Company, his reply was: \u201cI don\u2019t think I did say that.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-8\">There was evidence by Ward to the effect that he was not paid in full, and had disputes about the final payment of his account.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Argument of Counsel for Plaintiff- in Error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-4\">In the consideration of the effect of fraudulent representations of collateral matters as inducements to the contract, the law is usually stated that the collateral matter must appear from the circumstances of the case to be material to the contract in its direct sense, or be such as has been made by the parties an essential preliminary to the making of the contract in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\">Admitting that the right of disposal is an incident to the ownership of property, it follows that Stewart, in this case, had the absolute right, if he considered it good business policy, to refuse to sell stone to a purchaser who was at that time under contract to purchase stone from another quarry for the same work. <em>Brett v. </em>Cooney, 75 <em>Conn. </em>338, 53 <em>Atl. </em>729, 1124.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-6\">The better rule for deciding whether fraud be material or not is this: If the fraud be such that had it not been practiced the contract would not have been made, or the transaction completed, then it is material to the contract. 2 <em>Pars, on Cont. </em>937; <em>Higbee v.

That this is error, the authorities recognize the very important distinction between fraud as a ground for an action of deceit and as the ground for rescission in a defense to an action on contract. <em>Taylor v.

Topkis, </em>1 <em>Marvel </em>174, 40 <em>Atl. </em>948; <em>Isaacs v. Messick, </em>1 <em>Marvel </em>259, 40 <em>Atl. </em>1109; <em>Reznor v. Maclary, </em>4 <em>Houst. </em>241, 254; <em>King v.

Maclary, </em>4 <em>Houst. </em>241, 254; 2 <em>Parsons on Contracts, p. </em>769; <em>Kent County R. R. Co. v. Wilson, </em>5 <em>Houst. </em>56; <em>Pearce v. Carter, </em>3 <em>Houst. </em>385, 389.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-6\">The only material and substantial relation which the alleged misrepresentations could have had were in so far as they affected the probability of Stewart and Donohue being paid promptly for the goods sold, that is to the credit and financial responsibility of the Monad Engineering Company. Any other relation to this contract must be purely immaterial and have no substance of any kind whatsoever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-7\">Many cases lay down the proposition that what is known as injury is essential to the existence of legal fraud, and it is respectfully submitted that this rule is without exception in the adjudged cases. No one would contend that if the Monad Engineering Company had represented itself to be solvent and had procured this contract on the faith of its being solvent, and it should turn out that it was insolvent at the time, that Stewart would not be justified in immediately rescinding it. In such case, he would have sustained no damage or injury, but the probability, if not the certainty of injury existed, and the court will not determine whether such injury would or would not have happened in the course of events. It is enough for him to show that he might have been injured, and it is in this sense that it is believed that all of the cases hold that either actual injury or possible injury may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>exist, and that they can all be reconciled upon this theory. See <em>Smith on </em>Fraud, \u00a7 126; 1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. </em>\u00a7 187; 2 <em>Parsons on Contracts, </em>769; <em>Pomeroy's Eq. Jur. </em>898; 20 <em>Cyc. </em>8; <em>Whitesides v.

Topkis, 1 Marvel </em>178, 40 <em>Atl. </em>949, Chief Justice Lore states the law as follows: \u201cWhat constitutes fraud is a question for the court, whether the fraud was actually committed is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">[1, 2] When fraud is set up as a defense, the fraud must be proved, and is not presumed, or to be established by slight proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>or trivial circumstances. Actual fraud is always a matter of fact, and must be proved and established as such in any case, but what will constitute an actual fraud as will vitiate and avoid a contract of this kind, is a question of law, and it is therefore the province of the court to say and instruct the jury whether the evidence was sufficient for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In <em>Pearce v. Carter, </em>3 <em>Houst. </em>385, Chief Justice Gilpin very aptly suggests that it is not every false representation, even when made with a full knowledge of its falsity, that will amount, in judgment of law, to such a fraud as will invalidate a contract and deprive a party of his right to enforce it, and Chancellor Bates in <em>Reznor v. Maclary, </em>4 <em>Houst. </em>254, lays down the general principles of law governing contracts that are attacked on the grounds of fraud or misrepresentation in the following language: \u201cIn order to avoid a transaction on account of them (misrepresentations) three things are requisite\u20141st, the misrepresentations must relate to something material and substantial; 2d, the transaction sought to be avoided must appear to have been induced by it. The party aggrieved must have been actually misled by it; and 3rd, his confidence must have been a reasonable one. Except in these cases, even betrayed confidence is not a ground of relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In the case before us the negotiations between the parties seem to have been open and fair. The defendant below and the authorized agent of plaintiff company came together personally and after a conference that necessarily occupied a considerable period of time, agreed upon a sale of one thousand tons of stone. The questions asked by defendant as to the use that was to be made of the stone, and as to the financial standing and responsibility of plaintiff company, seem to have been promptly and satisfactorily answered so that before the conference ended, a proposition as to price, etc., was made in writing by defendant and accepted at once by the agent of plaintiff company. No elements of concealment or unfairness are shown in the negotiations, they appear to have been open and aboveboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The defendant below defends his breach of the contract on three grounds,\u2014that false statements were made by plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>company, first, as to where the stones were to be used; second, as to the credit of plaintiff company, and, third, as to certain work being paid for that had been done theretofore for plaintiff company by another party.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">[3] As regards the first contention, there is some conflict in the testimony as to whether representations were made that the stone bought by plaintiff company from defendant was to be used on the contract at Cross Ledge Light on which defendant was an unsuccessful bidder some months previous. Defendant in his testimony states very positively that he was not willing to furnish stone for that particular job, and he objected to so doing on the ground that to do so would violate a business principle, or policy, which he had established for himself, viz., not to furnish stone for any work to a principal contractor in cases where he, the vendor, had theretofore bid unsuccessfully in competition to supply stone to such principal contractor for the same work. It did not appear to the court below nor does it appear to this court that there was any element of fraud or misrepresentation in any statement made regarding the use of the stone that was vital or material to the contract in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">[4] The defendant evidently relied upon the second and third contentions but as regards both he signally failed to establish fraud of a material or substantial nature. No evidence was adduced that in the least undermined the credit of plaintiff company or that tended to show financial weakness; on the contrary plaintiff company showed by affirmative testimony that it paid its debts and was in good credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The evidence as to payments made on the Cross Ledge contract was not entirely clear but the fact was established that full settlement had been made for all work for which bills had been rendered up to the time of the making of the contract now in dispute, so the evidence on the third point likewise failed in establishing material and substantial fraud such as would avoid the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">These facts appearing from a careful reading of the testimony; and the law as laid down by the court below being in accord with previous decisions of the courts of this state, we find no error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>in the rulings or charge of the court below and so order that the</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Judgment below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
