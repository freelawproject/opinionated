Did you, in your room at 911 Walnut Street, in this city, on the twenty-first of September last, sign a paper containing a statement setting forth what was the truth or falsity in regard to your testimony before the Grand Jury on August twenty-fifth last, in reference to the purchase of beer from William J.

I ask you if you did not, in your room at 911 Walnut Street, this city, before Mr. Lattomus, make an oath that what you had said before the Grand Jury as to your buying beer from William J. Johnson was not true and that you had never purchased any lager beer from William J. Johnson on August 25, 1912, or any other day or time?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-12\">(Objected to by the Attorney General.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-13\">Boyce, J.:\u2014Thus far you have only asked the witness whether the paper which you now hold bears her signature. This course of examination is irregular. The objection is sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-14\"><em>Mr. </em>Ball:\u2014The question is asked the witness solely for the purpose of contradiction, and for no other purpose. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-15\">Boyce, J.:\u2014By the ordinary rules of evidence the contents of a written paper are proved by the paper itself. Your method of examining this witness is irregular. The rules of evidence will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>not permit you to represent, in the statement of your question, the contents of that paper without first showing it to the witness, and asking her (if it is an affidavit) if she made the affidavit. If she is given an opportunity to examine it, and admits making it then there is a regular course of procedure; but different from that which you are pursuing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-4\">Q.

This is practically the same question ruled upon before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-11\">Q. Did you in your room, in this city, on September twenty-fifth last, sign a paper and swear to it, and if so will you look at that paper (handing same to witness) and say whether or not that is the paper that you signed and swore to ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-12\">A. I have seen that paper. I seen it but I did not understand it when I signed it. He begged me to do it and I did it. I will acknowledge that that is my handwriting and my name, and he (Mr. Lattomus) signed something and told Johnson that it was all right now.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-13\"><em>Q. </em>Is that the paper you signed and swore to?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-14\">A. Yes, sir, that is my handwrite. I did that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-15\">Q. I will ask you whether Mr. Lattomus, this gentleman sitting here, did not read over to you this paper at least twice before you signed it and if he did not ask you whether it was true or not?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-16\">A. He did, and I told him I did not understand it, but by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>his begging me to sign it I did it, but I know nothing of it. I don\u2019t know the meaning of it. Mr. Johnson said if I signed it it would clear him, in the presence of that gentleman (Mr. Lattomus), and he handed it to him, and told Johnson it was all right now, but he signed something after I did.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Aen\">See perjury case against same defendant, 84 <em>Atl. (Del.) </em>1040.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\">At the close of the testimony, and arguments of counsel to the jury, the court gave the usual charge to the jury as in similar cases, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Counsel for defendant moved for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, and filed several reasons therefor. The only reason relied upon was that the Attorney General in his argument to the jury, in the presence of the court, made use of the following language: \u201cThe defendant did not go on the stand and deny that he gave the receipt to her, Lizzie Burton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">It was urged that this comment was in direct violation of <em>Chapter </em>777, <em>Volume </em>19, <em>Laws of Delaware, Revised Code </em>798, which extends to accused persons the right to testify in their own behalf, but provides \u201cthat a refusal or failure to testify shall not be construed or commented upon as an indication of guilt.\u201d It was insisted that the remark was prejudicial to the defendant and against the express policy of the statute. The cases of <em>Austin v. The People, </em>102 <em>Ill. </em>261, and <em>Com. v. Scott, </em>123 <em>Mass. </em>222, were relied upon in support of the motions.</p>\n<author id=\"b528-8\">Boyce, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A18\">:\u2014Immediately upon the remark being made, which</p>\n<p id=\"Ake\">is relied upon in support of the motions, one of counsel for the defendant objected, and the Attorney General withdrew the same as an inadvertence, and requested the jury to disregard it wholly in the consideration of the case. The court then and there instructed the jury to the'same effect. Again, in charging the jury after the close of the testimony, and arguments of counsel, the court expressly directed the jurors\u2019 attention to the said statute and instructed them that the failure of the defendant to testify should not influence them in any degree in reaching their verdict, as under the statute a refusal or failure to testify could not be construed or commented upon as an indication of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">We think the cases cited for counsel for the defendant are inapplicable to the facts in this case. We heard the evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>we are clearly of the opinion that it warranted \"the verdict of guilty. The Supreme Court of this state, on the writ of error, in the case of <em>Fisher v. State, </em>1 <em>Penn. </em>388, refused to reverse the judgment of the court below, because they did not find that the admission of the evidence objected to was prejudicial to the defendant below. We think in this case that the remark of the Attorney General, having been expressly withdrawn immediately after it was made and the jury being cautioned not to consider it in their determination of the case, was not prejudicial to the defendant under all the circumstances.\" Being convinced as we hav\u00e9 already stated that the evidence warranted the verdict, we do not think it should be disturbed. The motions are therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
