In the abstract, therefore, the question presented is whether a judgment of a court of one state, rendered in an action of foreign attachment against a nonresident upon constructive service only, is such a final and conclusive adjudication of the questions involved (as distinguished from the disposition of the property attached) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>as will constitute a bar to an action in another state between the same parties and with reference to the same matter of dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">[1-3] The rule is unquestioned that when a court has jurisdiction of the subject-matter of a suit and of the parties to it, its judgment upon the merits of the controversy is conclusive between the parties upon every question of fact directly in issue and determined in the action, and that to such a judgment, whether declared upon as a cause of action or pleaded as a defense, the courts of all the states are bound to give full faith and credit. Equally unquestioned at one time was the rule that when the jurisdiction of a court appeared by its record, it was likewise conclusive upon the parties, and the defendant could not plead against it that the court had not acquired jurisdiction of him <em>(Pritchett v. Clark, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>241,517; <em>Ibid, </em>4 <em>Harr. </em>280; <em>Ibid, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>63); but whatever may at one time have been the impression to the contrary, it is now well and definitely settled, that .to render a judgment recovered in the courts of one state final and conclusive in the courts of another state, under the provision of the Constitution of the United States, the court in which the judgment was recovered must in fact have had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the suit, or of the cause of action, and of the parties to it, and particularly of the defendant; and when it assumes the character of an action or proceeding in <em>rem, </em>that it had jurisdiction of the <em>res </em>or the thing itself; for it has been broadly and distinctly ruled, by the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, that neither the full faith and credit provision of the Constitution nor the act of Congress passed in pursuance thereof, prevents any inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court by which a judgment offered or. to be offered in evidence was rendered <em>(Mitchell, Vance &amp; Company v. Ferris &amp; Company, </em>5 <em>Houst. </em>34; <em>Caldwell v. Armour &amp; Company, </em>1 <em>Penn. </em>545, 43 <em>Atl. </em>517; <em>Earthman's Adm\u2019r v. Jones, </em>2 <em>Yerg. [Tenn] </em>484; <em>Thompson v. Whitman, </em>18 <em>Wall. </em>457, 21 <em>L. Ed. </em>897; <em>Knowles v. Logansport, G. &amp; C. Co., </em>19 <em>Wall. </em>58, 22 <em>L.

S. </em>87, 92, 25 L. <em>Ed. </em>878; <em>Rubber Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>v. Goodyear, </em>9 <em>Wall. </em>807, 810, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>828; <em>Galpin v. Page, </em>18 <em>Wall. </em>350, 367, 21 <em>L. Ed. </em>959); but on the other hand, as a judgment has no greater force or effect abroad than at home, it is the duty of a court that is called upon to give faith to the judgment of another court, to inquire into the jurisdiction of that court and into the scope of its judgment, in order to ascertain exactly what degree of credit, if any, should be accorded it. As the judgment of the court of Tennessee is in this case so pleaded, that, but for this demurrer, it may be offered in evidence, not as a cause of action, but as a matter of defense conclusively estopping the plaintiff from proceeding in his action here, inquiry must be made into the nature of the Tennessee action, the jurisdiction of the Tennessee court and the scope and effect of the Tennessee judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">[4-6] The action in Tennessee was an action in the nature of an action in <em>rem, </em>instituted by process of foreign attachment, which at its inception, seized the property of the nonresident defendant, trading as the machine company, found within that jurisdiction, and held it subject to the determination of the proceeding. The object of the process of foreign attachment in Tennessee, as it is generally under similar laws in other states, was to acquire jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, who because of his nonresidence could not be reached by personal service, by taking from him his property found within its jurisdiction and thereby compelling him to appear and submit himself to the jurisdiction of the court in order to protect or regain it, or in default of his appearance, to acquire jurisdiction of the <em>res </em>or thing attached, so that it might ultimately be appropriated to the satisfaction of the judgment that might be rendered against him. <em>Blaney v. Randel, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>546; <em>Reynolds v. Howell, </em>1 <em>Marv. </em>52, 59, 60, 31 <em>Atl. </em>875; <em>Bellah v. Hilles, </em>2 <em>Penn. </em>34, 43 <em>Atl. </em>89; <em>Wells v. Shreve's Adm\u2019r, 2 Houst. </em>329; <em>Geylin v. De Villeroi, 2 Houst. </em>203. Such an attachment of the defendant\u2019s property without personal service upon him, as well as constructive service by publication, in such cases as the statutes of the states may provide, are held sufficient to enable courts of a state to subject property to their jurisdiction but insufficient as the foundation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>of a personal judgment. <em>Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim. </em>184-186; <em>St. Clair v. Cox, </em>106 <em>U. S. </em>350; 1 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>354, 27 <em>L. Ed. </em>222; <em>Earthman\u2019s Adm\u2019r v. Jones, </em>2 <em>Yerg. (Tenn.) </em>484; <em>Boswell\u2019s Lessee v. Otis, 9 How. </em>348; 13 L. <em>Ed. </em>164; <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>95 <em>U. S. </em>714, 24 <em>L. Ed. </em>565; <em>Caldwell v. Armour, </em>1 <em>Penn. </em>545, 550, 43 <em>Atl. </em>517. Such process is recognized as due process of law within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in so far as it reaches and affects the property of the defendant lawfully attached. By a suit thus instituted, in virtue of the state\u2019s jurisdiction over the property of the nonresident situate within its limits, its tribunals may inquire into the nonresident\u2019s obligations to its own citizens, but \u201cthe inquiry can then be carried only to the extent necessary to control the disposition of the property.\u201d <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>95 <em>U. </em>S. 714, 24 L. <em>Ed. </em>565.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">[7] When a suit is founded upon such process and is not affected by the defendant\u2019s subsequent appearance and the consequent change of its character from an action in <em>rem </em>to an action in <em>personam </em>with all the qualities and characteristics of a personal action begun by personal service <em>(Wells v. Shreve's Adm\u2019r, </em>2 <em>Houst. </em>329, 370), and when it retains to the end its nature of an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding in <em>rem, </em>any judgment rendered therein is a judgment <em>quasi in rem, </em>and being an adjudication upon the status of the particular <em>res </em>of the action (2 <em>Smith's Leading Cases, </em>430), amounts only to a judgment of condemnation against the thing attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Such a judgment, while final and conclusive as to the right, title and judicial disposition of the property attached <em>(Melhop v. Doane, </em>31 <em>Iowa, </em>397, 7 <em>Am. Rep. </em>147; <em>Woodruff v. Taylor, </em>20 <em>Vt. </em>65; <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>95 <em>U. S. </em>714, 24 L. <em>Ed. </em>565; <em>Freeman v. Alderson, </em>119 <em>U. S. </em>185, 7 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>165, 30 <em>L. Ed. </em>372; 2 <em>Smith\u2019s Leading Cases </em>430), is not personally binding upon the defendant, deprives him of none of his rights and leaves him in undisturbed possession of all of his property (save that attached and particularly subjected to the judgment), to be by him used or employed in any manner in which he could have lawfully used or employed them before the proceeding by attachment was begun <em>(Earthman\u2019s Adm\u2019r v. Jones, 2 Yerg. [Tenn.] </em>484; <em>Bliss v. Heasty, </em>61 <em>Ill. </em>338; <em>Fitch v. Huntington, </em>125 <em>Wis. </em>204, 102 <em>N. W. </em>1066).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>One of the property rights claimed by the plaintiff in this action, trading as the machine company, is a chose in action or a right to recover from the defendant oil company for its alleged failure to perform its undertaking in a contract made between them. If the precise question which the plaintiff here submits for determination has before or elsewhere been adjudicated in an action between the same parties, in which the plaintiff, trading as the machine company, had been personally served with process or had voluntarily appeared, then by the decision there rendered and by every issue thereby determined, the defendant therein, trading as the machine company, is bound in this action, and to that decision this court is compelled by the fourth article of the federal Constitution to give full faith and credit. As the judgment pleaded in this action, however, shows that the jurisdiction of the Tennessee court in the case there instituted, was limited to the particular property attached and did not extend personally to the defendant trading as the machine company, or affect his general rights or other property, the extent to which this court is bound to give faith and credit to the judgment of that court is governed and limited by the scope and character of that judgment. Being a judgment <em>quasi in rem, </em>its sole purpose, and effect was to award the oil company a right of condemnation against the property attached, and upon all of the authorities, it is not such a judgment as can be the foundation of a personal action to which the courts of another state are bound to give full faith and credit. For the same reason, when such a judgment is pleaded as an adjudication that precludes the party against whom it was rendered from further proceeding in another action respecting the same subject matter, it possesses as evidence no greater force and is entitled to no greater credit than if offered as the foundation of a personal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The demurrer is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
