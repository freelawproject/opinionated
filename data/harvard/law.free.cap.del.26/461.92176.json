D. 1912, and that the statement was filed on the fifteenth day of August following, being ninety-six days thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The defendant filed several exceptions to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the controlling one being: \u201cThat said statement was not filed within ninety days from the time when the work and labor and the furnishing of the materials were finished by said plaintiff as alleged in said statement, in accordance with the act in relation to mechanics\u2019 liens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In support of this exception, the defendant relies upon the case of <em>Carswell v. Patzowski, </em>4 <em>Penn. </em>403, 406, 55 <em>Atl. </em>342, 1013, in which the court, in construing the provisions of the statute before quoted, held that</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u201cUnder the mechanics\u2019 lien law, a person who may file his statement of claim within thirty days, after the expiration of ninety days, from the completion of his work and labor, must be:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u201c(1) A contractor who has made his contract with the owner or reputed owner of the building. <em>Travis v. Meredith &amp; Ruth, </em>2 <em>Marv. </em>376, 43 <em>Atl. </em>176.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">\u201c (2) A contractor who has furnished both work and labor, and material, in and for the building. <em>Mulrine v. Washington Lodge, </em>6 <em>Houst. </em>350; <em>Curlett v. Aaron, ibid, </em>477.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">\u201cEvery other person entitled to a lien must file a statement within ninety days from the completion of the work and labor performed, or from the last delivery of materials furnished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The defendant claims that the statement shows that, while the plaintiff furnished both work and labor and materials for the building, he did not perform the labor and furnish the materials under contract with the owner or reputed owner, and contends, therefore, that the plaintiff was not a contractor within the meaning of the act and should not have filed his statement of claim within the time prescribed by the statute for filing statements of claims by contractors, and hence his claim should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The plaintiff likewise cites and relies upon the decision in the case of <em>Carswell </em>v. <em>Patzowski, </em>drawing from the language of the court, however, a meaning different from that given it by the defendant. Upon the authority of this decision, as its language is read and interpreted by him, the plaintiff contends that those claimants who are required to file their statements within thirty days after the expiration of ninety days as provided by the act, are not confined to one class with dual qualifications, but are divided into two classes with single qualifications, namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u201c (1) A contractor who has made his contract with the owner or reputed owner of the building,\u201d whether the contract be for both labor and material or for either labor or material, or</p>\n<p id=\"AL5\">\u201c (2) A contractor who has furnished both work and labor and material, in and for the building,\u201d whether the contract be made with the owner or reputed owner, or with some one else.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Having read in the disjunctive the qualifications of a contractor as declared by the court, the plaintiff maintains that he possesses one of these qualifications, in that he furnished both labor and materials, though not mider a contract with the owner or reputed owner, and therefore, in filing his statement of claim within thirty days after the expiration of ninety days, he complied with the act, and filed it within the time prescribed for claims of that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">This case is important only in the event the language of the court in <em>Carswell v. Patzowski </em>is open to the construction placed upon it by the plaintiff. The court in that case availed itself of the facts presented by that case to set at rest the much-disputed question of what constitutes a \u201ccontractor\u201d within the meaning of the act, and who should file their statements of claims within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ninety days and within thirty days after ninety days respectively from the completion of the labor and the furnishing of materials. The effect of the decision in that case was to recognize a class of claimants known as \u201ccontractors,\u201d as established by the statute, and the purpose of the decision was to define and distinguish that class of claimants from the other class contemplated by the statute, and, in doing so, to determine within what periods claimants of the respective classes should file their statements of claims. In doing this, the certain and we think the obvious meaning of the language employed by the court in that decision is that a \u201ccontractor\u201d is one who has furnished both labor and material for the building, under contract with the owner or reputed owner thereof, that is, one who has not only furnished both labor and materials but who has also furnished the same under contract with the owner or reputed owner; that \u201ccontractors\u201d, thus defined, must file their statements of claims within thirty days after ninety days from the completion of the labor and the furnishing of materials, and that \u201cevery other person,\u201d that is, all persons not embraced within the class of \u201ccontractors\u201d as defined, must file their statements of claims within ninety days from the completion of the labor or from the last delivery of the materials furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The exception is sustained and the plaintiff\u2019s claim dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
