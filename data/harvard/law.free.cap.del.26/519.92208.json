Lupton,, husband of the plaintiff, had boarded there for about seven years, prior to his marriage to the plaintiff, on the eighteenth day of March, A. D. 1911, when Lupton and his wife immediately occupied an apartment and lived together until the twenty-ninth day of July following, when a separation occurred and has since continued. Lupton is and has been for several years a real estate broker. While boarding with the defendant and after his marriage, he looked after some properties belonging to the defendant, such as collecting rents, attending to repairs and paying insurance, etc. After his marriage henontinued to visit the defendant\u2019s home, frequently in the night time, sometimes at the request of the defendant, at other times at the suggestion of friends, or as he felt inclined, remaining, at times, as late as eleven or twelve o\u2019clock. His wife objected to this, and differences, from time to time, arose between them by reason of such visits and friendship. Their differences would be adjusted, only to arise again because of subsequent visits, and because of the manifest jealousies which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>existed between the two women and their dislike for each other. With this condition existing, the plaintiff saw the postman deliver a letter to her husband in the handwriting of the defendant, and she asked him what was in the letter, receiving the reply, in effect, you must not inquire of me what the defendant writes to me. Later the wife observed a letter in the handwriting of the defendant sticking out of the pocket of her husband\u2019s coat, which was hanging over the back of a chair in their bedroom. She took the letter, read it and kept it, as she did seven other letters from time to time, written by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s husband. These letters made frequent disparaging references to the plaintiff, never, however, by name, but usually referring to plaintiff as \u201cit\u201d, \u201c that \u201d, or \u201c they \u2019 \u2019. These letters contained many expressions of friendly interest in Lupton. Some few sentences, picked here and there, from the letters will show their disparaging character: \u201cTwo lives wrecked for one. I\u2019m sure you are too good for such a life.\u201d \u201c I never can forgive that for doing as they did.\u201d \u201cAll the good I can say is, I hop.e and trust it may be short.\u201d Mr.-\u201cwhen he called, saw you and what you had, knew it was not your choice.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m loyal and I wish you could have heard him. He asked me when could he see you without seeing her. The face struck him as it did-\u201d \u201cWhen that wants to cart you around with her kind, don\u2019t go, hear?\u201d \u201cDo take care of yourself and make it work or send it where it ought to be.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure your life will never be happy with that class, you look it, and if you both could settle the matter by having her go to her sisters.\u201d * * * Miss-\u201cit is the first time she has said to me you looked crestfallen and it made her sad to see you that way\u201d * * * \u201csaid tell me what you think. I think just as his other friends, the last man on earth to admire a woman like that.\u201d \u201cI hate to know a good man like you having to live and do as you do.\u201d \u201cIf they decide to go you\u2019ll have money to pay some one to do your work and you\u2019ll soon build up your business and be able to live again.\u201d \u201cWe all make mistakes sometimes. Don\u2019t let it write any notes.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be in a hurry to get any more things and don\u2019t move anything until I see you.\u201d It appears that when Lupton discovered, in the early part of June, that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>letters were missing, he had very little to say to his wife. The wife testified that on Sunday, June the fourth, she said to him, \u201cWon\u2019t you please tell me what is the matter with you?\u201d and he replied, \u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t know, do you? You don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve been missing anything out of my pocket?\u201d She evaded his inquiry, and he then said: \u201che had tried to make a home and thought they would be very happy, but he made a miserable failure and she could just get her lawyer and have everything straightened up; that there was no use trying any more; that they could not get along together.\u201d Lupton left the house. Plaintiff took a ride with her brother, returning about six o\u2019clock, finding her husband in the bed. After retiring their difficulties were again discussed. They \u201cmade up\u201d the next morning, but Lupton again wanted to know about the letters, the wife did not inform him, but testified that she said: \u201cThis woman is trying to separate us, and if she does, I will certainly let everybody know who does it.\u201d He said: \u201cOh, no you won\u2019t.\u201d Trouble continued from time to time, over the letters, followed by amicable relations, until the twenty-fifth of July when in bed the husband said: \u201cWell, I must know about them. \u2019 \u2019 The wife said: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you about them.\u201d The husband feigned a fit, fell back on the bed, breathed heavily as though he was dying. The wife called to him. Later he arose and said: \u201cWell, I must go if you won\u2019t tell me about those letters.\u201d The wife refusing to tell him, he packed his suitcase, dressed, took his hat as if to leave, then his wife said: \u201cI will tell you about those letters. I took them.\u201d He replied: \u201cWell, I knew you did, but I wanted you to tell me so.\u201d They then \u201cmade up\u201d. The husband then said: \u201cI want you to give me those letters and let me bum them.\u201d This was not done. The defendant had given Lupton a scarf pin which, at times, he wore. The wife objected to this and requested him not to wear it but the pin which she had given him, and this he did until the day of the separation, when his wife going to the office in the morning, discovered he was wearing the pin given to him by the defendant. The wife testified that she said to him: \u201cI see you are wearing that pin,\u201d and he replied: \u201cYou have no business to say what I shall wear and what I shall not, I shall wear this pin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>whenever I want to.\u201d They quarrelled. The wife was told \u201cshe should go, and go right away.\u201d She got a case from the safe, went to the apartment, packed her clothing, and awaited the return of her husband in the evening. After some conversation between them, the husband said: \u201cAre you going to give me those letters?\u201d She replied: \u201cThose letters are not in my possession.\u201d He said: \u201cYou go right straight home to your father where you belong\u2014 right straight home.\u201d \u201cHe went out and slammed the door and I went home.\u201d Eight days after this separation Lupton called to see his wife at her father\u2019s home. He spent some time there with her. They had a walk together, going to the apartment where he urged his wife to go in and live with him again. She declined. He later wrote her assuring her of his love and beseeching her to come back to him. He kept the apartment open for her return for about two months. He insisted that the letters of the defendant had no alienating influences upon him. Several of these he said he had not read. He insisted that his wife was of a very jealous disposition and that her jealousy was the chief cause of the trouble between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-7\">When the plaintiff was called to the stand, Ball, counsel for defendant, objected to her testifying in relation to any matter connected with the suit so far as it might in any way bind the defendant for the reason that this action is based upon an act, as amended, <em>(Sec. </em>1, <em>Chap. </em>80, <em>Vol. </em>14) to secure to a married woman money or other property held or acquired by her, living separate from and. not supported by her husband, enabling her to sue therefor in her own name and for her own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-8\">It was urged that there is no averment that Ralph C. Lupton was, at the time of the commission of the grievances alleged either in the first, second or fifth counts of the declaration, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, or that he has continued to be her husband up until the present time, or that she was living separate and apart from him at the time the alleged grievances occurred, or that the defendant knew that the plaintiff and Ralph C. Lupton were husband and wife,\u2014the charge being that the defendant knowingly, wickedly, etc., committed the several grievances complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>It was contended that the mere recital in the commencement of the declaration that Gertrude M. Underwood, a <em>femme sole, </em>was summoned to answer Sadie C. Lupton, a <em>femme covert, </em>living separate from her husband, is sufficient to sustain these counts or to show that the plaintiff was living separate from her husband at the time she brought the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-6\">Boyce, J.:\u2014Under a later act, <em>Vol. </em>14, <em>Chap. </em>550, a married woman may prosecute suits in her own name as if unmarried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-7\">The objection is overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-8\">Counsel for defendant in cross examination handed the plaintiff two letters, for the purpose of ascertaining from her whether or not she wrote them to her husband. She having identified the letters as being in her handwriting, and the same having been marked for identification, the witness was asked for the purpose of contradiction: \u201cYou have just stated that you had no feeling against Mrs. Underwood prior to your marriage to your husband. After reading these letters which I have handed you, I will now ask you if you did not say to your husband in a letter to him of November 8, 1910, \u2018I think the best thing would be for girlie to go and take care of Wanca and then she would get him away from that old mischief-maker at 901. I certainly am not pleased with Wanca staying there one bit more than Wanca is pleased with girlie staying here; but Wanca makes girlie put up with that year after year.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-9\">(Objected to by Mr. Hastings, on the ground that it is immaterial whether the plaintiff, prior to her marriage, had ill-feeling against the defendant or not, and is not in cross examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-10\"><em>Mr. Ball: </em>\u2014 This witness testified that on one occasion her husband told her that he had been to this defendant\u2019s house and she said: \u201cI object.

This question is asked for the purpose of affecting the credibility of and contradicting the witness&gt; for she in this same letter called the defendant a mischief-maker and objected to Mr. Lupton boarding at the defendant\u2019s house or remaining there.

I am only attempting to ask if she did not say at a certain time, to a certain person, something in relation to this defendant. This plaintiff has testified in chief that when she came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>home from some place, her husband told her that he had taken Mr. McCorkle out to 901 Delaware Avenue, the home of this defendant, and she said: \u201c I don\u2019t like you to take him out there; you never take me out there.\u201d She was asked the question why he did not take her out there and she said she did not know.

Lupton, husband of the plaintiff, that she and all his friends thought as much of him then as they had prior to his marriage, and to encourage him to be a man; not to do a foolish thing; not to injure himself but to live under the circumstances as best he could. Further, there was no evidence in the case that at the time of the separation anything that the defendant had said or done influenced the separation in any way whatsoever, but on the contrary, all matters of difference theretofore existing between the plaintiff and her husband so far as the defendant was concerned had been adjusted; and that there was no evidence to prove that the letters were the controlling cause of the separation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Boyce, J.We think under the evidence thus far submitted the question at issue is one for the determination of the jury.

D. 1911, and on divers other days between those dates, respectively, and the commencement of this action, wrongfully, wickedly, and unjustly (1) wrote letters to plaintiff\u2019s husband, and thereby counselled, induced, and prevailed upon her husband to disregard the duty which he owed to her, and thereby his affection for her was alienated and destroyed, and by means thereof she has wholly lost and been deprived of the comfort, fellowship, society, aid, and assistance of her husband in her domestic affairs which she ought to have had and otherwise might and would have had; (2) that the defendant, in like manner, became the companion of the plaintiff\u2019s husband at the home of the defendant in this city to the loss and deprivation of the plaintiff; (3) that the defendant in like manner, enticed, persuaded, and prevailed upon the plaintiff\u2019s husband to separate himself from her, by means of which, and on no other account, she lost and was deprived of her husband\u2019s affection, assistance, and rights of consortium; (4) that the defendant, in like manner, enticed, persuaded, and prevailed upon the plaintiff\u2019s husband to frequently meet her, the defendant, at her said home, to the loss and deprivation of the plaintiff; and (5) that the defendant, in like manner, counselled, induced, and persuaded the plaintiff\u2019s husband to violate his marital obligations and to cease loving the plaintiff, his wife, whereby his affection for her was destroyed to the loss and deprivation of the plaintiff. It is then charged that by means of the several grievances the happiness of the plaintiff has been destroyed, her home has been broken up, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>she has been caused great mental pain and suffering, and otherwise greatly injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The defendant has pleaded not guilty by which she absolutely denies the commission of the several complaints of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The defendant admits writing the several letters to plaintiff\u2019s husband, introduced in evidence by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\u2022 It is claimed for the defendant that she had known the plaintiff\u2019s husband, upwards of ten years; that he had boarded with her some seven or eight years prior to and up to the time of his marriage with the plaintiff; and that he had for a long time attended to business matters for the defendant. It is admitted that the plaintiff\u2019s husband visited the home of the defendant after the marriage\u2014at times, it is claimed, at the request of others, and, at other times, for business reasons; and it is insisted that the relations between him and the defendant were proper, at all times. The defendant denies that the said letters were written for the purpose of alienating or destroying the affections of plaintiff\u2019s husband for her, or for the purpose of inducing a separation between them. And it is urged that the plaintiff voluntarily separated herself from her husband; and that, after so doing, he besought her in person and by correspondence to resume marital relations with him. This is, at least, a partial summary of the contentions of the parties. Your recollection of the testimony will enable you to supply any omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">[11] We are not permitted to make any comment upon the testimony; the jury being made the exclusive judges of the credibility of the1 witnesses and of the weight and value of their testimony. Your duty is to carefully consider all the testimony, and to return a verdict in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence, considered in connection with our charge to you upon the law. When the testimony is conflicting, as in this case, the jury should endeavor to reconcile it. If they cannot do so, they should accept that part of it, which they deem worthy of credit and reject that which they deem unworthy of credit, taking into consideration all the testimony adduced and the circumstances surrounding the witnesses respectively, their means of information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>and opportunity of knowing the facts of which they have testified, their interest or bias, if any, and their manner and apparent truthfulness and fairness in giving their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">[12] Under the statutes of this state removing the disability, at common law, of a married woman to sue in respect to her property in her own name alone, a married woman may maintain an action for alienation of her husband\u2019s affections. Marriage gives to the wife the same right of conjugal society as it does to the husband. Each is entitled to the comfort, companionship and affection of the other. The rights of the one and the obligations of the other spring from the marriage relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Any interference with these rights, whether of the one or the other\u2014particularly by a stranger\u2014is a violation, not only of natural right, but also of a legal right arising out of the marriage relation. <em>Bennett v. Bennett, </em>116 <em>N. Y. </em>584, 23 <em>N. E. </em>17, 6 <em>L. R. A. </em>553.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Whoever, therefore, by the alienation of the affections of a wife\u2019s husband, deprives her of his affections, commits a wrong against her property rights for which such wrongdoer is liable to respond in damages. <em>Eliason v. Draper, </em>2 <em>Boyce </em>1, 77 <em>Atl. </em>572.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">[13] The basis of the action is the loss of conjugal fellowship, society and aid of the husband. The actionable consequences of the injury of the \"wrong, whenever committed, is the loss of consortium, and the alienation of affections is a matter of aggravation. And it is not essential, therefore, to the maintenance of the action that there should be any loss of the husband\u2019s services, or any pecuniary loss whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">[14] In the consideration of this case, you may assume that the plaintiff\u2019s husband, who lived and co-habited with his \"wife from their marriage to the time of their separation, had, during that time, an affection for his wife, unless you find testimony rebutting the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">[15] The issue which you are called upon to decide is not whether the plaintiff was justified in leaving her husband but whether the defendant was the cause of the alienation and loss of consortium. It must appear by a preponderance of the evidence that the alienation and loss of consortium were wrongfully, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>justly and effectively caused by the defendant by the means and as charged in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration in order to warrant a verdict for the plaintiff. It is not necessary to entitle the plaintiff to a recovery that it should appear that the defendant\u2019s conduct was the sole cause thereof. It is sufficient if the defendant\u2019s conduct was the controlling cause. [16] If the defendant\u2019s conduct was effective in causing the injury complained of, any unhappi'ness or even separation between the plaintiff and her husband, not caused by the defendant, would not. justify or excuse the defendant for any unlawful interference between the plaintiff and her husband; for even if it should appear that the husband had little or no affection for his wife, another person has no right to interfere to cut off all chance of its springing up in the future. If the alleged conduct of the defendant was not the controlling cause of the alienation, the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Any unhappiness between the plaintiff and her husband, while living together, not being induced by the defendant, would not, in itself, constitute a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action, but would go in mitigation or reduction of damages. In cases of this character, the extent of the actual injury to the plaintiff will of course depend upon the prior relations between the plaintiff and her husband. Evidence in mitigation or reduction of damages will, therefore, be received, which tends to show that the plaintiff has in fact suffered less injury than would otherwise be a probable inference from the act complained of. It is proper therefore, for you to consider, in mitigation of damages, but not in bar of the action, evidence, if any, which shows any unhappy relations between the wife and husband, not caused by the defendant, any want of affection for each other, and the fact that they are living apart, together with the circumstances under which the separation occurred. These and like matters are proper for your consideration, in mitigation of damages, to determine whether on account of such relation, the wife lost much or little by reason of the alleged acts and conduct of the defendant, if you find the defendant committed them and that they induced the injury complained of. <em>Prettyman v. Williamson, </em>1 <em>Penn. </em>224, 39 <em>Atl. </em>731.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">[17] If you find from the evidence that the defendant wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>fully and unjustly, by any, or all of the acts complained of, had a controlling influence in alienating the affections of the plaintiff's husband, your verdict should be for the plaintiff; and the measure of damages would be such as you believe would reasonably compensate the plaintiff for the injury to her feelings; for the loss of her husband's comfort and society; and for the loss of his support.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">[18] If you find from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s conduct was effective in causing the alienation of the affections of plaintiff\u2019s husband and was wanton and malicious to ward the plaintiff, you may, in such event, in your discretion, award exemplary or punitive damages, in addition to compensatory damages. But in order to warrant the awarding of exemplary damages, you must be clearly satisfied by the evidence that the defendant\u2019s conduct was wanton and malicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">If you find from the evidence that plaintiff\u2019s husband alienated his affections from plaintiff without the influence of the alleged misconduct and interference on the part of the defendant, or that the alienation of his affections was the result of some other cause, over which the defendant did not exercise an effective influence, your verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In conclusion, your verdict should be for that party in whose favor the evidence preponderates.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">[19] At the same term motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were made, which were continued to the January Term, when after argument and an expression of opinion by the court that the verdict rendered was excessive, the plaintiff consented to a reduction of the verdict to $2,500. An order was accordingly made by the court, that the verdict should be so reduced, and the motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were refused. After such refusal the defendant made application for an enlargement of time for the drawing and signing a bill of exceptions till the first day of the March Term. There was no exception taken or proposed subsequent to the trial term. Neither was there any application made for an enlargement of time for drawing and signing a bill of exceptions till the January Term. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>plaintiff resists the defendant\u2019s application on two grounds, viz.:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">1. Because the court has no authority to grant the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">2. Because, even if it has the power, the enlargement of the time asked for would nevertheless be in the sound discretion of the court, and in the exercise of such discretion the application could not be granted.</p>\n<author id=\"b552-8\">Pennewill, C. J-,</author>\n<p id=\"AAO\">after stating the motions and contentions as above, delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">There are raised in the present case two questions: the first involving the power of the court and the second involving the discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">[20] The determination of the first question depends entirely upon the construction the court shall place upon a statute of this state found in the <em>Revised Code </em>at 851, as amended by <em>Chapter </em>238, <em>Volume </em>25, <em>Laws of Delaware, </em>which provides that, \u201cthe bill of exceptions must be drawn in form and signed during the term in which the exception is proposed, unless the court shall otherwise order.\u201d The concluding words\u2014\u201cunless the court shall otherwise order,\u201d constitute the amendment, and were inserted in the original act to take the place of the following words: \u2018 \u2018 unless the parties otherwise agree with the assent of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">It is admitted by the defendant that under the original act the application now made could not be granted, but it is insisted that under the act as amended it may be, because the amendment, when fairly construed, means that the court may make an order enlarging the time for drawing and signing exceptions, not only during the term at which they were proposed, but at a subsequent term until final judgment is entered in the case. It is claimed by the defendant that it would be unreasonable to hold that the party must incur the expense and trouble of preparing his exceptions and having them signed before he can possibly know whether the judgment will be against him or not, because he cannot, until there is a decision on his motion for a new trial, know whether he will sue out his writ of error or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">The plaintiff replies that the drawing and signing of the exceptions is an entirely different matter from suing out the writ of error; that while the latter must follow the entry of final judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ment, the former may precede it; and that the requirement of the statute does not necessarily subject the party to trouble and expense because if the exceptions are not drawn and signed during the term when prepared it entails no hardship to make application at such term for an enlargement of time. It is insisted that such an application is in no wise dependent upon the issuance of the writ of error. The plaintiff contends that the effect of the amendment was, not to enlarge the time when the exception might be drawn and signed, but solely to give the court the power to extend the time without agreement of counsel, because prior to the amendment if counsel did not agree the court could not adjourn without giving reasonable time for preparing the bill of exceptions, and it was to obviate that difficulty and embarrassment that the act was amended. The court are of the opinion that this contention is sound and reasonable. It is admitted by the defendant, as we have stated, that prior to the amendment of the statute such an application as she now makes could not have been granted. We think that the only additional authority conferred upon the court by the amendment is to enable them to extend the time without agreement of counsel. The statute contemplated, after amendment, as before, that the exceptions should Be drawn and signed during the term at which they were proposed unless an enlargement of the time was then asked for and granted. If counsel sees fit to move for a new trial, or for an arrest of judgment at the trial term, and such motion is continued, the requirement that he shall at the same term apply for an extension of the time for signing his bill of exceptions to the next term, entails no expense and imposes no hardship. He is not obliged to procure a copy of the record, draw out his exceptions or have them signed, before final judgment is entered in the case, but only to ask the court, before the adjournment of the term at which the exception was proposed, for an enlargement of the time during which his exceptions may be signed. This is, we think, a fair and reasonable construction of the statute based upon its language, and the manifest intent of the amendment, which was simply and solely to authorize the court to enlarge the time without any agreement of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">The application of the defendant is refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
