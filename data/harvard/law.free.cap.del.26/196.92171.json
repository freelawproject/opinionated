P., B. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>1 <em>Boyce </em>5, 75 <em>Atl. </em>962, and <em>Campbell v. Walker, </em>1 <em>Boyce </em>580, 76 <em>Atl. </em>476.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">While we believe that the tests and principles of pleading applied in those cases have very strong bearing upon this case, yet we think the also recent case of <em>Braunstein v. People\u2019s Ry. Co., </em>1 <em>Boyce </em>310, 77 <em>Atl. </em>738, to be more directly in point in respect to the facts pleaded and the manner of pleading them.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">In the case of <em>Hunter v. P., B. &amp; W. R. R., </em>the court said, in quoting from the case of <em>King v. W. &amp; N. C. Ry. Co., </em>1 <em>Penn. </em>452, 41 <em>Atl. </em>975: \u201cApplying the same test, the first count in the declaration is manifestly insufficient.\u201d By referring to the <em>King case, </em>we find the test applied to be this rule quoted from 2 <em>Chitty\u2019s Pleading, </em>231, \u201cA general statement of facts, which admits of almost any proof to sustain it is objectionable,\u201d which quotation follows the statement of other general rules, to the effect that \u201cit is not sufficient to state the result or conclusion of fact, arising from circumstances of the case not set forth in the declaration,\u201d and also, \u201cit is the purpose of pleading to reasonably and fairly disclose the facts of the case, and not to conceal them. Pleadings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>should not be used as the means of concealing the facts by vague and general terms. Time, place and circumstances, so far as relied on and within the knowledge of the party, must be specified; and that, too, with reasonable fullness and fairness. Any other rule would make pleading the medium of concealing the facts of the case, except so far as might be necessary to bring it within the least possible legal certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">From a casual reading of our cases it might appear in some instances that the court has been somewhat lax in applying the above statement as to the certainty with which it is necessary for the plaintiff to plead his case, but we think after a careful study of the decisions we may safely arrive at the conclusion that any seeming generality in pleading the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action has been permitted by the court either on account of the very nature of the accident itself, or the fact that it was impossible for the plaintiff to declare with more particularity or certainty on account of the peculiar facts and circumstances surrounding the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">For determination of the question \u201cwhether the allegations in the present count describe such an accident ,or a statement of facts as will bring it within either of the exceptions mentioned,\u201d we need only refer to the <em>Braunstein case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The fifth count in that case, which was held insufficient, alleged in substance, \u201cthat the defendant * * * so carelessly, improperly, negligently and unskillfully repaired and maintained the trucks and running parts of said passenger car, and has so carelessly * * * allowed the same to be and become unsafe and defective that while negligently and carelessly then and there running and driving said passenger car at a dangerous rate of speed at a certain curve * * * then and there ran off the track,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The court in the case said: \u201cThe first cause of demurrer to the fifth count is that it does not appear in what respect the trucks and running parts of said car were unsafe, etc. We do not think the phrase \u2018the trucks and running parts\u2019 in said count is restricted in its meaning to wheels and axles as suggested, but that it may very properly embrace more like the expression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u2018defective brakes and other appliances,\u2019 and we think the averment is too general.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Jl] Thus, as it has been held that the allegation of negligence in the <em>Braunstein case </em>is too general, we must hold the less particular allegation of negligence in this count to be too general.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">For the reasons given in holding the allegation of negligence in the first count too general, we must also hold as insufficient the allegation in the second count that the defendant \u201cnegligently and carelessly furnished * * * unsafe cars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The third count differs from the first two counts only in that \u201cunsafe tracks\u201d were alleged to have been negligently furnished by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">As we have already held that statements of \u201cunsafe cars and railroad tracks\u201d and \u201cunsafe cars\u201d are too general, we can see very little to distinguish from them the very general statement \u201cunsafe tracks,\u201d and it must be evident that such a general statement of the facts and circumstances of the plaintiff\u2019s claim cannot be of such certain and particular character as the court in the case of <em>Campbell v. Walker, </em>1 <em>Boyce </em>580, 76 <em>Atl. </em>475, stated was necessary for the plaintiff to exercise in this state in a declaration of this character. Judge Woolley, in delivering the opinion of the court in that case, said: \u201cIt has uniformly been held from <em>[Reading\u2019s Heirs v. State] </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>190 and <em>[State, to Use of Godwin, v. Collins, </em>1 <em>Harr.] </em>216, to <em>Hunter v. P., B. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>1 <em>Boyce, </em>5, 75 <em>Atl. </em>962, that while the plaintiff is not required to make a detailed and minute statement of the circumstances of the cause of action, he must nevertheless set forth as his declaration the facts upon which he bases his action, with a particularity and certainty that will reasonably inform the defendant what he proposes to prove at the trial, in order that the defendant may have a fair opportunity to meet and controvert those facts in defense. Any other rule would defeat rather than promote this object of pleading, and would make a declaration an instrument to conceal rather than to disclose facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The word \u201cunsafe\u201d is a very comprehensive word and might mean many things, and when used in connection generally with the word \u201ctracks\u201d, with no other description as to manner in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>they were unsafe, or where the tracks were located other than in and about a certain quarry, is not such a statement of the facts and circumstances of the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the defendant would know, with reasonable certainty, what he would be called on to meet in making his defense, in a trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">We hold the third count to be insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The fourth count which sets\u2019forth \u201cthat the car was loaded with stone and that it was run over a straight stretch of track,\u201d being in other respects similar to the first count, must also be held insufficient for the reasons assigned in sustaining the demurrers to the three other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">[2] In the ninth count the plaintiff states it to be defendant\u2019s duty to furnish cars loaded with stone in a reasonably safe manner and reasonably safe tracks on which to run said cars so loaded, and complains that the defendant furnished cars loaded with stone in an unsafe manner, in that the defendant loaded \u201ca certain car with a large iron box full of stone by placing the same on the top of said car, so that the equilibrium of said car might be easily disturbed, and furnished unsafe tracks upon which said car was then and there moved and operated, of a kind so that there was a slight elevation at the joint of two contiguous rails in said tracks whereby the said car so loaded as aforesaid and so moved was tilted when the wheels of said car moved over said elevation and by reason of said elevation in said tracks and the improper loading of said cars as aforesaid, the equilibrium of said car was thereby disturbed and thereby the front wheels of said car jumped from the tracks,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"A7V\">The first cause of demurrer to this count is that the count is double.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">It is undisputable that good pleading permits of a plaintiff combining in one count a number of circumstances, facts, or defaults, which taken together culminate in the one point.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">In the present count the plaintiff has alleged that the car unsafely loaded as described, jumped the tracks, made unsafe by the elevation as set forth, that while neither in itself caused the accident, yet each contributed to and when taken together did cause the accident. Thus we have the two facts operating to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>gether causing the one point of action, which is that the car jumped from the tracks, resulting in the accident. We think the count is not double.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">[3] The next cause of demurrer is that \u201cit does not appear therefrom that the said tracks therein referred to were not reasonably safe for the purpose for which the same were intended to be used by the said defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We think this cause of demurrer is not well founded, because it may be fairly deduced from the language in the count that the tracks being unsafe in a certain manner were furnished by the defendant to the plaintiff, in and about the defendant\u2019s business, on which to run a certain car unsafely loaded by the defendant, and that such was the intention of the defendant, and that therefore they were not reasonably safe, but were actually unsafe, for the purpose for which they were intended to be used by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">[4] The third cause of demurrer is that \u201cit does not appear therefrom whether the said count is based on the failure of the defendant to furnish reasonably safe tracks, or whether the same is based upon the negligence in loading the said car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">We believe it sufficiently appears in the count that the defendant was in default in two respects\u2014one, that he furnished unsafe tracks; two, that he furnished a car unsafely loaded\u2014 and the plaintiff then in detail described in what particular the car was unsafe, the negligence being in the result of the loading and not in the act of loading.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">[5] \u201cThat it does not appear therefrom that if the said car had been properly loaded by the fellow servants of the said plaintiff, that the said tracks therein referred to were not reasonably safe for the business then and there carried on by the said defendant thereon,\u201d is the fourth cause of demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">To hold this cause of demurrer good it would be necessary for the court to assume that the fellow servants of the defendant loaded the car, which is directly opposed to the charge of the plaintiff that the defendant furnished him the car unsafely loaded. If it should appear from the evidence in the case, at the trial, that the fellow servants of the plaintiff loaded the car, or that the proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>was at variance with the allegation, such matters in themselves would be for the consideration of, and determination by, the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">[6] As to the two additional causes of demurrer, which are the same as the additional reasons filed to the first and other counts, it is not necessary for us to say anything more than we have already said. They are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We hold that the allegation in the ninth count that the defendant furnished \u2018 \u2018 a certain car and certain tracks for the car to run on * * * of so unsafe a character that the said car when running over said tracks did not stay on said tracks and jumped therefrom,\u201d for reasons we have before stated to be too general to be sufficiently well pleaded, to stand when objected to on demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We sustain the demurrers to the first, second, third, fourth and ninth counts, and overrule the demurrer to the eighth count.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
