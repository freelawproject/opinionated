Little and McCallister, </em>7 <em>Penn. </em>217, in which case a demurrer to the indictment on the ground that it failed to allege the commission of the offense in the night time was overruled; and, furthermore, that the evidence showed this particular offense to have been committed while the prosecuting witness was away from home. As to the second ground, the state contended there was evidence that the prosecuting witness had previously had trouble with the defendant, being by him forced out of a house as a tenant, and that after the commission of this offense, when the prosecuting witness met the defendant and asked for an explanation, the defendant \u201cmerely grunted and passed on without responding\u201d. Upon this testimony the state relied for evidence of malice.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-6\">Woolley, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFb\">charging the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">[1] Gentlemen of the jury:\u2014The offense for which this defendant is indicted is not a statutory offense in this state, but it is an offense that had its origin at common law. It possesses several elements which must be proven to secure a conviction, the principal one being the element of malice. In every trespass that amounts to malicious mischief, there must be malice of a certain character, that is, a certain malignity, which, when it inspires mischief, results in damage to the community or tends to a breach of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">[2] We are convinced, from the testimony produced by the state, that this is not a case of malicious mischief; that at most it is a case of private trespass, for which the prosecutrix has her remedy against the defendant in a civil action. Therefore we think that the defendant should not be called upon to defend in a matter in which the state has not proven the elements of the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>charged against him. We therefore direct you and bind you to return a v\u00e9rdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Verdict, not guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
