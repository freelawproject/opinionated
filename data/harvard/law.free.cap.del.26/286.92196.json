That the statute of the State of Pennsylvania then and now in force provided, among other things, that when death should be occasioned by negligence and no suit for damages be brought by the party injured during his life, the widow of any such deceased might maintain an action for and recover damages for the death so occasioned. That no such action was brought by the said George W. Daniels during his life. That on the twelfth day of September, A. D. 1910, at or near Coatesville in the State of Pennsylvania aforesaid, while the said George W. Daniels was so employed as aforesaid, the said defendant operated a certain main track or tracks with certain side tracks connected therewith, and the said defendant used the said side tracks for the purpose of storing or shifting cars in its business aforesaid.

Daniels was then riding along the said main track came in contact with the said car so allowed to remain close to or upon the said main track as aforesaid, and thereby the tender attached to the engine upon which the said George W.
