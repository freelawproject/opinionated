At the time of her death she had cash on deposit SI,750.39, and personal effects such as jewelry and furniture. She also possessed real estate. By her will she directed, inter alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-9\">\u201cFifth. \u2014 I give and bequeath my gold watch and chain and piano to my said daughter, Catherine A.

While it is true the words \u201cpersonal property\u201d prima facie include all except the real estate, it has been held that where such general words are used or placed in the same sentence with other words, describing a peculiar kind of property, such as household furniture, articles of jewelry, etc., and in such a connection as to show that the general words convey to the mind not the intent to give them their widest meaning, but simply as com], ehending the character of things given in the other part of th sentence, their meaning will be so restricted: Lippincott\u2019s App., 173 Pa. 368, cited by the auditing judge; Rawlings v. Jennings, 13 Yesey, 39; Hotham v. Sutton, 15 Vesey, 319; Bouvier\u2019s Law Diet., Title \u201cEffects;\u201d Roper on Legacies, 210.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">Great stress was laid at the argument upon the fact that in the next clause of the will testatrix directed the rest of her property to be sold, and the cash distributed among her four chiidren, and as the fund in dispute was already cash, it could not have been intended to be carried by this language. To our minds, however, these two items of the will taken together show clearly that it was not the intention of the testatrix, in her gift to her daughter, to include money, as it is evident her thought was to turn into money whatever estate she had, except her personal belongings, and to divide the cash thus produced among her children equally. While it is true a conversion was not necessary where a part of the property was already in money, yet it is not inconsistent with the thought that it should all be divided equally; the general intent being to sell that which was required to be sold and to add to it the money already on hand. As was said by Judge Gordon, in Appeal of the Boards of Missions, 91 Pa. 507, \u201cWhat is this after all but a mere direction to sell what is salable? And if part of that estate comes to the executors in the shape of money, what then? It need not be sold, that is all. The testator, for the benefit of his donees, directed that his entire residuary estate Should be converted into money, but if part of it is found in the shape of money, it needs no conversion, and surely not the less does it pass to the legatees.\u201d This case is similar to the present one, in the fact that the fund was realized after the death of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>decedent, and is a complete answer to the argument that testatrix could not have intended to include that part of the estate already in cash.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AAIE\">March 8, 1909:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">The exceptions are dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-7\"><em>Daniel C.

She had, in the fifth paragraph of the will, already used apt words for the disposition of her cash and debts due to her: Hunter\u2019s Est., 6 Pa. 97; German v.
