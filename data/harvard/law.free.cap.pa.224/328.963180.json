The proximate cause of the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband was a combination of circumstances so unusual as to be beyond the contemplation of -the defendant, irrespective of the condition of its wires; the use of the sidewalk for a purpose not to be anticipated, the erection of the pole in an improper and unusual manner, and the failure of the plaintiff\u2019s husband to use ordinary and available means to protect himself from injury: Douglass v.

Tel. Co., 5 Lane. Law Rev. 97; Dillon v. Light Co., 179 Pa. 482; Devlin v. Light Co., 192 Pa. 188; Morgan v. Electric Co., 213 Pa. 151; Electric Light &amp; Power Co. v. Lefevre, 55 S. W.

Gloves would not have protected deceased because he embraced the pole and rode on it: Reel v. Elder, 62 Pa. 308; Illingsworth v. Light Co., 161 Mass. 583 (37 N. E. Repr. 778); Thomas v. Wheeling Electrical Co. (W. Va.), 8 Am. Elect. Cases, 528.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-3\">The question of notice to defendant of the defective insulation is not before this court. No point requesting the trial judge to charge on said question was presented to the trial judge unless it was the fourth point, the answer to which is not excepted to nor assigned for error. Defendant was bound to keep its insulation perfect, which includes a reasonable inspection. No reasonable inspection would permit an insulation to rot off the wire. Rags hanging from a heavily sagging wire were sufficient notice to one knowing the deadly nature of the wire: Baker v. R. R. Co., 95 Pa. 211; Stoltenberg v. R. R. Co., 165 Pa. 377.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AA7\">Me. Justice Fell,</author>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s husband was the foreman of a gang of men employed by a street railway company to erect iron poles to support trolley wires. At the time of the accident that caused his death he was superintending the erection of poles at the side of a street directly under the electric light wires of the defendant, The Suburban Electric Company, which were thirty feet above the sidewalk. In erecting a pole a rope sling was placed near its middle and it was raised by means of a block and tackle attached to a tower wagon, and the lower end, which was kept near the ground, was guided to the hole in which it was to be placed. The sling had been put too near the bottom of a pole and, when the pole was raised, it did not have the right inclination, the lower end being too high. The deceased and one of his assistants put their arms around this end to lower it by their own weight. This brought the top of the pole in contact with the defendant\u2019s wires and it became charged with the electric current. There was testimony on behalf of the plaintiff that tended to show that the insulation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the wire had became defective by long continued exposure and use, and that the defects were so apparent as to charge the defendant with constructive notice of them. And there was testimony from which the jury might have found that the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband was caused by his negligence in not insulating the top of the pole by fastening around it a nonconducting material and in not protecting himself by the use of rubber gloves, with which he was provided by his employer and which he had taken off a few minutes before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Whether the defendant was entitled to binding instructions in its favor because of the failure of proof of any negligence on its part that was the proximate cause of the accident, is a question not raised by the record of the trial. The only instruction asked for on this subject was by a point for charge, which involved also the question of contributory negligence. It could not have been affirmed, nor could judgment have been entered non obstante veredicto without passing on the latter question. This could not have been done in the absence of proofs so certain and direct that the court could have said that the facts alleged were established beyond doubt. The plaintiff\u2019s case as made out did not show contributory negligence. The defendant\u2019s proofs as to it depended on the credibility of its witnesses and the conclusions to be drawn from their testimony. If the deceased had been working with or among highly charged electric wires without the use of gloves, negligence could have been imputed to him. But he was working'on a public highway thirty feet under the wires with which the pole was accidently brought in contact, and he was called upon to act in an emergency suddenly arising, without time for reflection.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
