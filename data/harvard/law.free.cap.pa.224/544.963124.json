All other rates of fare referred to by the city were averred to be in the nature of commutation rates, but it was denied, \u201cthat there was any contract or agreement or binding obligation on the part of the company to give any passenger four rides for eight cents or twelve rides for twenty-five cents.\u201d That the company had established numerous points at which a free transfer was given, entitling the holder to a further ride upon an intersecting line was admitted, but it denied \u201cthere was any right in the holder of an exchange ticket or a package ticket to demand such transfer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>It was further answered, that \u201cby means of various Acts of the Legislature, particularly the Act of May 15, 1895, P. L. 65, the defendant as an operating company was allowed to operate all lines controlled by it as a single system, laying out new routes partly over one line and partly over another.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-4\">Defendant admitted that in order to develop its business and accommodate the public, it \u201cestablished from time to time and changed and took off and re-established transfer points,\u201d but at no time had it agreed \u201cto issue transfers of this character either to the holder of an exchange ticket, who secured the same at the price of eight cents for two rides, or to the holder of a six-for-a-quarter ticket, who got a reduced rate for six rides and not for twelve rides.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">Defendant also averred that these transfers were at all times issued to passengers at the time they left the car and not at the time they paid their fare, and it was therefore impossible for a conductor to know who had paid a full fare and who had given either an exchange ticket or a commutation ticket, and it was averred that no order had ever been made permitting or authorizing the issue of transfers to any parties except those paying the full fare, but admitted certain abuses had crept into the handling of exchange tickets, for the correction of which abuses the order complained of by the city had been made. The nature and character of these abuses is fully set out in the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\">The issuing and enforcement of the order of May 18, 1908, is admitted, but it is averred that the order was not in any respect a change in the orders or regulations of the company although it did result in a change of conditions which had arisen from the said abuse of privileges made possible by the manner in which transfers were previously issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-7\">It was denied that on May 18, 1908, any transfer points were abolished, but admitted in certain cases parties who had theretofore \u201csecured four rides for eight cents or two rides for four-and-one-sixth cents can no longer secure two rides for less than five cents, or at the rate of two-and-one-half cents each.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-8\">It was admitted that the order of May 18,1908, complained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>of was made without the consent of the city of Philadelphia. It was denied that the order was an increase or change in the rate of fare and that \u201cconsent by the city\u201d was necessary to make the order effective. The defendant further denied \u201cany intention to violate either the letter or the spirit of the contract with the city of Philadelphia.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-3\">The case was heard by the court upon bill and answer, there being no proofs submitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-4\">The court entered a decree dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-6\"><em>J.

It is as clearly an incident of the original fare as- is the ride upon an exchange ticket, and the transfer of the passenger to the second car is an incident of the passage which is fully paid for by that original fare.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-7\">In Chicago Union Traction Co. v. Chicago, 199 Ill. 484 (65 N. E. Repr. 451), it was decided that the right to regulate fares includes the right to regulate transfers. Curiously enough, the very word \u201cincident\u201d which we have used without reference to that decision is used by the court and applied in a manner that is the exact reverse of the gist of the opinion of the court below in this instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-8\">One other point raised by defendant is that the tickets are \u201c in the nature of commutation rates.\u201d This may be questionable; but if true, what of it?

Justice Stewart,</author>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Prior to the organization of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, here the appellee, the lines of street railways in the city of Philadelphia were owned and operated by several independent companies. With a view to unify these to the extent of bringing them under a common system and management, the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company by lease and otherwise acquired control of all of them. This control, while it allows each company to retain its separate existence, commits to the traction company the operation, management and regulation of each line of railway. The several companies differed both in their charter rights, and in their municipal privileges and obligations as well. To make these latter fixed, fair and uniform, to supersede former regulations, and to define and regulate the relations thereafter to be observed between the city and the railways \u2014 so reads the agreement\u2014 the contract of July 1,1907, was entered into between the city and the traction company. In its entirety the contract does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>not concern us. It is quite enough to say of it that the advantages derived thereunder are reciprocal. It is only the limitation imposed by a proviso in the contract on the right of the company to change the rates of fare that calls for consideration here. The proviso is as follows: \u201cProvided, however, That the present rates of fare may be changed from time to time, but only with the consent of both parties hereto.\u201d At the time the contract was entered into, the regular fare charged on each line for a continuous ride in the same car, irrespective of distance traveled, whether for a square or to the terminus, was five cents. This fare was uniform throughout the city. For reasons of its own, not that it was compelled by law or ordinance to do so, the traction company had been accustomed to offer to the public cards or slips containing six printed, detachable tickets, each entitling the holder to a single continuous ride, for twenty-five cents. Each ticket was regarded as the equivalent of a five cent fare, and secured to the holder the same privileges. In addition, the company had in force at the date of the contract a system of free transfers which allowed one who paid a single fare, whether in cash or by ticket, to complete his ride on certain connecting roads without further charge. For reasons not necessary to discuss, the traction \u2018company has since the date of the contract discontinued such privilege when the fare is paid by ticket, and' allows it only in cases where a cash fare has been paid. The bill complains that this action of the company is a change in its established rates of fare in force when the contract was entered into, inasmuch as it requires now a cash payment of five cents to secure the same transfer ride which before could be had on a ticket costing but four and one-sixth cents; and since the change was made without the consent of the city, an injunction was asked for to restrain the company from discriminating in the way indicated. The question thus presented is a very narrow one. The expression \u201crates of fare\u201d as used in the proviso is more or less inapt, and therefore lacks definiteness. We are not aided in its interpretation by anything elsewhere appearing in the contract. The proviso is left to speak for itself. Strictly speaking, the traction com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>pany had no established rates of fare when it entered into this contract. A rate is the measure of a thing by its ratio or relation to some fixed standard. When a certain sum is determined for a particular service, unless it is proportional and comparative according to a recognized standard, it is not a rate, but a charge. The compensation which this company was accustomed to receive for the facilities it afforded had relation to no standard. The five cent fare for one continuous ride was not measured by distance traveled or anything else that would suggest proportion; and the same must be said of every other fare it required. None of them was determined by ratio. It is quite evident, however, that the reference in the proviso was to the charges and fares the company was receiving at the date of the contract; it could be to nothing else. Accepting this as the meaning, it is necessary, first, to inquire what these several charges were. We have referred to one\u2014 five cents for a single continuous ride in the same car. Another was, eight cents for a single change from one car to another on certain intersecting lines. It is not denied that these charges fall within the meaning of the proviso. No attempt has been made to change these in any particular. It is contended that there was also a third .charge, distinguishable from those mentioned, which also falls within the proviso, viz.: twenty-five cents for six tickets when purchased together, each ticket being the equivalent of a five cent cash fare, and entitling the holder to equal service. It must be conceded, we think, that if this were a distinct charge within the contemplation of the parties, the change that is complained of with respect to it would be violative of the terms of the contract, since the ticket is no longer the full equivalent of a five cent fare, in that it will not now purchase the same facilities in the way of transfer. The question is \u2014 was it such a charge? The case turns upon the answer. The sum of twenty-five cents distributed upon six tickets makes the cost of each, considered separately, four and one-sixth cents. This simple statement would seem to show such a reduction in cost to the purchaser as would warrant a conclusion that the company had two charges for the same service, that is, the continuous ride, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>five cents, and another four and one-sixth cents. But this method of differentiating does not express the whole truth as we need to know it for a proper determination of the question. Clearly the four and one-sixth cents charge is not all the company exacts in the way of payment when it sells by ticket. One ticket cannot be purchased for that sum. In order to get one the purchaser must buy six, and pay twenty-five cents before he gets any service whatever in return. It results that the company gets the benefit of this advance payment without interest. Where all the six tickets are used promptly, the advantage derived by the company in this respect may be too slight to be considered; but, as everyone knows, all are not used promptly; and it is not mere speculation to say that the general average would show a very substantial benefit enuring to the company from this source, an advantage which could be very fairly regarded as the full equivalent of the amount abated. Whatever the company gains in this way is at the cost of the party purchasing, of course. These considerations would indicate that in adopting this charge for tickets the company had no intention of departing from the five cent standard charge for a continuous ride; but that what was intended, and all that was intended, was an equitable adjustment on the basis of a five cent fare for a continuous ride, which would advantage its patrons in the way of convenience without entailing loss upon the company. If any other purpose controlled, it is not apparent what it was. The company was all the while adhering to this five cent charge for the general public. The ticket arrangement was one of its own devising, adopted not because forced upon it, but at its own pleasure. If the purpose was to reduce the charge, the question at once arises, to what end? It will hardly be contended that it was to gratify a generous impulse prompted by an overabundant income. No more can it be supposed that it was done with a view to increase the company\u2019s revenues through an enlarged traffic. The average individual would not be likely to take more rides during a month or year because of a reduction of five-sixths of a cent upon each ride. It is quite as inconceivable that its purpose was to give in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>dividuals who, without inconvenience to themselves, could spare twenty-five cents at any time, the advantage of a lower fare than was charged those who could conveniently spare no more than five cents each time they traveled. The only reasonable explanation is that in adopting the ticket system the object was to afford an additional convenience for a consideration in the way. of advance payment, which would equal the amount of the abatement in the fare in dollars and cents. Indeed, we think it so evident that the purpose of the company was to adhere to the five cent charge as a basis, that we are unable to see how the complainant in contracting with the company with respect to the matter of its fares, could have had any reason to suppose that the ticket system introduced any other. It is only by supposing that the understanding of the parties with respect to it was wholly different from what the transaction on its face imports as to its meaning and purpose, that we can read this ticket system into the terms of the proviso, and there is nothing in the case as presented that would give us warrant for so doing. If, then, it is not \u201ca rate of fare\u201d within the meaning of the proviso, but a mere regulation for the convenience of the public involving no change in charge \u2014 and this is our conclusion \u2014 it follows that the traction company in restricting its application in the manner complained of was strictly within its rights, and the concurrence of the city was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The decree is affirmed and the bill dismissed at the costs of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
