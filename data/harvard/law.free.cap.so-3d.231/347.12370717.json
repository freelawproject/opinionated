At some point in 2011, the mother graduated from medical school and returned to Alabama to begin a medical-residency program.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">On March 10, 2012, the parties were divorced by a judgment entered by the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court. The circuit court adopted the parties\u2019 mediated agreement and, among other \u25a0 things, awarded the parties joint legal custody of the child, named the father as the sole physical custodian, and ordered the mother to pay child support.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The father, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama, worked and resided in Tuscaloosa; the mother practiced medicine in the Birmingham area, resided in Birmingham, and leased an apartment in Tuscaloosa to facilitate her visitation with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">In September 2014, the father file.d a petition seeking, among other things, a modification of the child\u2019s custody and a recalculation of the mother\u2019s child-support obligation. The father\u2019s action was assigned case number DR-10-761.01 (\u201cthe .01 action\u201d). That same month, the mother filed an answer to the father\u2019s petition and a counterclaim seeking a modification of the child\u2019s custody and a termination of her obligation to pay child support. The mother\u2019s action was assigned c\u00e1se number DR-10-751.02 (\u201cthe .02 action\u201d). On March 13, 2015, the\u2019 mother filed a motion seeking, among other things, consolidation of the .01 action and the .02 action. On March 19, 2015,\u2019 the circuit court entered an order, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aa-dedup-0\">\u201cIt is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that [the .01 action] and [the .02 action] shall be consolidated for trial purposes and that all future pleadings shall be filed under DR-10-751.01.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2AK\">A trial was held on November 4, 2015, and January 12, 2016. On .March 17, 2016, the circuit court entered a judgment, increasing the amount of the mother\u2019s child-support obligation and denying her request for a modification of custody upon its express determination that the mother had failed to provide evidence to meet the custody-modification requirements set out in Ex parte McLendon, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7621463\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/455/863/\">455 So.2d 863</extracted-citation> (Ala. 1984)(\u201cthe McLendon standard\u201d); however, the circuit court increased the mother\u2019s \u201cparenting time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">The record reflects that the mother filed her postjudgment motion on Sunday, April 17, 2016.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit court held a post-judgment hearing, and, on May 20, 2016, it entered an order in which it amended certain custody-exchange and visitation provisions..

In its Form CS-42, the circuit court correctly indicates that the father had reported a monthly gross income of $6,131 and that the moth\u00e9r had reported a monthly gross income of $10,769.24.

App. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The mother does not present any argument to this court regarding changed circumstances or an inability to pay. Instead, in her first sub-argument, the mother refers to \u00a7 30-3-155, Ala. Code 1975, as \u201cthe child support statute,\u201d and she argues that \u00a7 30-3-155 is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 30-3-155 provides, in its entirety: \u201cIn making a determination of child support, the court shall apply Rule 32 of the Alabama Rules of Judicial Administration.\u201d Rule 32(A) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">\u201cGuidelines for child support are hereby established for use in any action to establish or modify child support, whether temporary or permanent. There shall be a rebuttable presumption, in any judicial or administrative proceeding for the establishment or modification of child support, that the amount of the award that would result from the application of these guidelines is the correct amount of child support to be awarded. A written finding on the record indicating that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate shall be sufficient to rebut the presumption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANAq\">According to the mother, the Rule 32 child-support guidelines usurp the authority of fit parents to determine the extent of support that assures that \u201cnecessaries are provided for a child.\u201d The alleged usurpation, according to the mother, violates the separation-of-powers doctrine and her right to equal protection and due process. The mother fails to develop a legal argument or to provide a relevant citation for her assertion that the Rule 32 child-support guidelines usurp the authority of fit parents. The mother cites Young v. Weaver, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9153532\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/883/234/#p235\">883 So.2d 234</extracted-citation>, 235 (Ala. Civ. App. 2003), for her assertion that this court has held .that \u201cchildren do not have a right to more, than the necessities.\u201d However, Young, which examines whether a contract made with a minor is voidable, is inappo-site. It is well settled that \u201c[t]his court will address only those issues properly presented and for which supporting authority has been cited.\u201d Asam v.

If they do not, the arguments are waived.\u201d White Sands Grp., L.L.C. v. PRS II, LLC, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8182899\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/998/1042/#p1058\">998 So.2d 1042</extracted-citation>, 1058 (Ala. 2008). Accordingly, we need not address this sub-argument further.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">In her second sub-argument, the mother contends that the circuit court erred by increasing her child-support obligation because, she says, \u201cit is undisputed that the child\u2019s needs were being met.\u201d The mother\u2019s argument is framed largely within the context of awards of joint physical custody; however, in this case, the circuit court awarded the father sole physical custody. To the degree that the mother\u2019s citation to authority is relevant, we note that Rule 32 contemplates that, a deviation from the child-support guidelines may be appropriate in some cases, and it provides discretion for trial courts to deviate from the guidelines for seven enumerated reasons. Furthermore, Rule 32(A)(1) allows a deviation, when justified in writing, \u201ceven if no reason enumerated in this section exists, if evidence of other reasons justifying deviation is presented.\u201d Clearly, the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>court could have entered any child-support order it deemed appropriate based'upon the evidence presented. The circuit court\u2019s award of child support was properly based upon the evidence presented, including the parents\u2019 reported income. The evidence presented was insufficient to rebut the Rule 32 presumption or to amount to proof of a denial \u00f3f the' mother\u2019s fight to due process or equal protection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the circuit court did riot err by increasing the mother\u2019s child-support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The Propriety of the Custody Modification</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The mother complains that the McLendon standard is based on a misconception, violates public policy, and is a barri\u00e9r to custody awards that are in the best interest of the child.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">\u201cWhen evidence in a child custody case has been presented,ore tenus to the trial, court, that court\u2019s findings of fact based on that evidence are presumed -to, be correct. The trial court is in the beet position to make a custody determination \u2014 it hears the evidence and observes the .witnesses. Appellate courts do not sit in judgment of disputed evidence that was presented ore tenus before the trial court in a custody hearing.

She testified that, for 20 years, she had reviewed and compiled research comparing the outcomes of children who had lived in various types of custody arrangements, including joint-custody arrangements, which she referred to as \u201cshared parenting\u201d and defined as living with each parent \u201cthirty-five percent to fifty percent of the time year round.\u201d Dr. Nielsen explained that a large research study had conclusively shown that children in shared-parenting arrangements, even when their parents had been in \u201chigh-conflict,\u201d had had equal or better \u201coutcomes\u201d than children in other types of custody arrangements in five areas: (1) the quality of their postdivorce relationships with both parents, (2) behavior (i.e., aggression, drug use, alcohol use,, and hyperactivity), (3) mental or emotional health (he., anxiety and depression), (4) physical illness (i.e., stress-related illness), and (5) academic performance. According to Dr. Nielsen, 80% of divorced parents remarry or \u201cre-partner\u201d within three years of a divorce; thus, her opinions had taken into account the effect of \u201cblended\u201d families and stepparents. When asked if studies had proved that moving from a \u201csingle parent situation into a shared parent situation\u201d was inherently disruptive to a child, Dr. Nielsen said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">\u201cIt\u2019s a change, but it does not have a negative outcome, otherwise, you would not find the positive outcomes that you did in the forty studies. All of the forty studies, those children changed from a\u2014 living with one parent to living with both parents. All forty studies, the children made a change, they switched.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Dr. Nielsen said that, even if a child is \u201cfine\u201d or \u201cokay\u201d - in a certain custody arrangement, shared parenting creates a better outcome even when parents do not share the same parenting style. Dr. Nielsen testified: \u201c[I]t\u2019s a universal rule that shared parenting is preferable so long as both of the parents are fit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Dr. Nielsen had never met the child; however, she said that the child could easily adapt to shared parenting because she was well adjusted and loved both parents. Moreover, Dr. Nielsen labeled the parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>as cooperative or, in her words, not \u201ca high-conflict couple.\u201d The mother characterizes Dr. Nielsen\u2019s testimony as \u201cundisputed factual and scientific evidence,\u201d which, she says, \u201cdemands an award of shared parenting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">We do not agree. The circuit court received Dr. Nielsen\u2019s testimony and the testimony of the parents. \u201cWhen the evidence is presented to the trial court ore tenus, it is the trial court\u2019s duty to determine the weight and credibility of the witnesses and their testimony.\u201d Smith v.

Code 1975, and should be considered in every child-custody case, see \u00a7\u25a0 30-3-152(a) Ala. Code 1975, the McLendon standard does not violate that policy by requiring, in child-custody-modification actions, evidence demonstrating that a parent is a fit custodian, that material changes which affect a child's welfare have occurred, and that the positive good brought about by the change in custody will more than offset the disruptive effect of uprooting a child. \"[T]he McLendon standard is not unconstitutional^ and] the McLendon standard has not been superseded by statute.\u201d Gallant v.
