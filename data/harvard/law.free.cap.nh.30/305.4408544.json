And the said defendants come and defend, &amp;c., when, &amp;c., and say that the plaintiffs, their action aforesaid against them ought not to have and maintain, because they say that the close mentioned in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration, long before the committing of said supposed trespasses, to wit: on the twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord, 1830, was the soil and freehold of the inhabitants of that portion of the territory of Chichester and Loudon, known as the Chichester and Loudon Union School District; and the said inhabitants of said school district were then seized thereof in their own demesne as of fee; and the said inhabitants of said school district had then erected upon said close a school-house for the use of said district, as they had a right to do; and said inhabitants of said district have from time to time since that time repaired and maintained said school-house, as they had good right to do; and the said inhabitants of said school district, on the second day of April, A.

D. 1851, at a legal meeting thereof, duly called and holden for that purpose, voted that said school-house should be repaired, and appointed M. G. Lane and D.

And for further plea, &amp;c., said defendants say that the said close, at the time when said trespasses are alleged to have been committed therein, was the soil and freehold of said Chichester and Loudon Union School District, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>still is, and that said district were and still are lawfully and actually seized and possessed thereof.

A. Bellows </em>(with whom were <em>Norris Sf Ciarle,) </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-11\">I. The first plea does not allege that the close was the soil and freehold of the inhabitants, &amp;e., at the time of the trespasses committed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-12\">2. The plea does not give the names of the inhabitants, &amp;e., nor does it show a corporation capable of holding. The names should be stated. Steph. on PI. 300.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-13\">3. The plea is also argumentative. <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>3 N. H. Rep. 12, stating- the close was part of Spinney place, and Spinney place was defendants\u2019 close.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-14\">II. In the second plea, neither the names of the inhabitants are given, nor any body capable of holding the title is shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-15\">2. It is not stated that the inhabitants were seized at the time of the trespasses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-16\">3. No title is stated in the inhabitants, only evidence of it, and that not competent, not stated to be adverse, and so presumed to be in subordination to the owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-17\">4. This plea is also argumentative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-18\">III. As to the third plea in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>2. The names of the inhabitants are not given, and no corporate body is shown capable of holding title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-5\">3. There is no allegation that they continued to be a school district, or continued the school-house, and so for aught that is stated, the lease has expired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-6\">4. There is no direct allegation that the title under the lease was continued to the time of the trespasses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-7\">The fourth and fifth pleas, stated in the case, are subject to the same objections as the others, for want of names, or stating a legal corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-8\">And the sixt]\u00a1\u00a1 amounts to the general issue, and so is bad. Steph. on PI. 418.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-9\">Peabody, with whom were <em>Baker, Per ley, Foioler </em>and <em>Hayes, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-10\">1. The first plea sufficiently alleges soil and freehold in -the inhabitants, &amp;c., at the time of the supposed trespasses. It alleges that on the 29th of March, 1830, they were seized, &amp;c., and had erected a school house, &amp;c., and had from time to time repaired, and had maintained the same, and that on the day of the alleged trespasses the defendants proceeded to repair the same, according to the vote of the inhabitants of the district.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-11\">It may be said that seizin at the time of the alleged trespasses is only argumentatively alleged. But that objection is not taken to any specific part of the plea, and the plea is good until the objection is properly made, and the parts of the plea open to the objections stated. See authorities after referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-12\">2. The allegation of soil and freehold in \u201c the inhabitants of the portion of Chichester and Loudon known as the Chichester and Loudon Union School District,\u201d is sufficient, without giving the names of such inhabitants. They need not be a corporation in order to hold the property. <em>2d Cong. Soc. </em>v. <em>1st Cong. Soc., </em>14 N. H. Rep. 328, 329.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-13\">3. The plaintiffs\u2019 allegation, that athe' plea is argumen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>tative, is not sufficient. He should specify the portion that is argumentative, and state wherein it is so. Gould\u2019s PL 465, \u00a7 16; 1 Chitt. PL 667.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\">II. In the second plea the parties capable of holding the property are sufficiently described. 14 N. H. E,ep. 328, before cited. The plea alleges that the school district had for more than twenty years, &amp;c. The district is a corporation, and can hold land. See authorities after cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-6\">2. As to the plaintiffs\u2019 second objection to this plea, that it does not state \u201c that the inhabitants were seized at the time of the supposed trespasses,\u201d we say such seizin is sufficiently alleged. The plea alleges that for more than twenty years before the committing of said supposed trespasses the said inhabitants, &amp;c., have used, &amp;c. This means that during \u201c more than twenty years before the committing,\u201d &amp;c. There can be no other natural construction of the language. This is the natural meaning, and any other construction is a forced and illegitimate one. A seizin once proved, or admitted, is presumed to continue until a disseizin is proved. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-7\">3. Twenty years adverse user is conclusive evidence of a grant, and not simply evidence, of it. 2 Greenl. Ev. 539; <em>Tyler </em>v. Watkinson, 4 Mason 402; <em>Cooledge </em>v. <em>Learned, </em>8 Pick. 504; <em>Sargeant </em>v. Ballard, 9 Pick. 251.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-8\">The plea alleges that the inhabitants, &amp;c., had used and occupied \u201c without hindrance or objection, or adverse claim on the part of any person or persons whatsoever.\u201d This is a sufficient allegation of adverse user.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-9\">4. The allegation that the plea is \u201cargumentative,\u201d is insufficient. See authorities before cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-10\">III. The first objection to the third plea stated in the case has .been already answered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-11\">2. The allegation that the inhabitants of the school district \u201c had there erected upon said close, in which, &amp;c., a school house, <em>* * </em>and had from time to time repaired the same, and on the 2d of April, 1851, voted that said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>school house be repaired, and appointed * * two of the defendants, to repair said school house, * * (and the defendants,) on the day on which said supposed trespasses, &amp;c., * * entered for the purpose of repairing, &amp;c., * * and proceeded to repair,\u201d &amp;c., is a sufficient allegation of the continuance \u25a0 of the school district and school house. Moreover, the existence of the school district and school house at a certain time being alleged, the legal presumption is that their existence continued ; and such continued existence need not be alleged. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 41.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-6\">3. <em>The </em>allegation that the title under the lease was continued to the time of the trespass,\u201d is sufficiently explicit. It alleges that said inhabitants * * entered upon and took possession of said close, by virtue of said deed, and being so possessed, * * afterwards and before said time, when said supposed trespasses are alleged to have been committed, and during the continuance of said term so demised, * * to wit, on the said day, * * entered into and upon the said close, * * and were thereof possessed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-7\">IV. As to the fourth plea stated in the case, a school district is a public corporation, and can hold land. <em>School District </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, </em>6 N. H. Rep. 197. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-8\">V. As to the fifth plea stated in the case, our answer is as before, that the inhabitants of any district, or locality, though they are not incorporated, may take and hold land, &amp;e., and their names need not be given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-9\">VI. As to the sixth plea in the case, the plaintiff objects on general demurrer, that this plea amounts to the general issue, and is therefore bad. The plaintiff cannot take this objection on general, but only on special demurrer. Bac. Ab. Pleas. G. 3; 1 Chitt. Pl. 528; <em>York </em>v. Jones, 2 N. H. Rep. 454.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-10\">\n<em>Perley.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACz\">The last pleas are rendered necessary by the provisions of the statute. Under the general issue, the defendant cannot introduce evidence of title. Therefore he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>plead a special plea denying title, which would be bad at common law, otherwise he cannot take advantage of any defect of the plaintiff\u2019s title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-5\">Title must be well pleaded, or the case cannot come here. It must be a plea on which the case can be tried. If the defence is not legally stated, so that it can be tried, the case is not removed from the jurisdiction of the justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">The demurrer is not well taken ; there should be a motion to dismiss the action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-7\"><em>Bellows, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-8\">The case comes to the court of common pleas, when. a plea is filed before a justice of the peace, which he cannot try.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-9\">It does not follow that the case is not here, if the plea is bad. The justice is not to try that. When brought here, the pleas are to be treated as other pleas. They are to be judged of as if originally pleaded in the court above.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b315-10\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFk\">No law existed providing for the union of school districts situate in different towns, nor for districts consisting of inhabitants of different towns, until after the passage of the Revised Statutes, in 1842.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">From the facts alleged in the deed, recited in the third plea (of the case,) we infer that in the year 1830 a district was in fact formed by the inhabitants of a part of the town of Loudon and of a part of the town of Chichester. And that the inhabitants of those parts of the two towns were constituted a district or districts by votes of those towns, so far as they had power to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">School districts are now <em>quasi </em>corporations, capable of acquiring and holding real estate, for school houses. Perhaps they might properly be so regarded for some very limited purposes so early as 1830, or earlier. But no law of the State contemplated a district extending into two towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">\u201c The inhabitants of that portion of the territory of Chi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Chester and Loudon, known as the Chichester and Loudon Union School District,\u201d as in the first plea; \u201c The said inhabitants of said Chichester and Loudon Union School District, in their united capacity as said district,\u201d as in the second and third pleas, (of the case,) are not a corporation known to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">If the deed of Mr. Lane was effectual to convey anything, it must have vested the interest in those who for the time being were the persons inhabiting the district, and the title must be set up in them by name. It is not seen that there is any objection to give the deed this effect, nor to a plea alleging title in the inhabitants who came within that description at the date of the deed, or perhaps in the survivors.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">There probably was in each of the towns of Chichester and Loudon a legal district, duly constituted by vote of the town, and each bearing the name of the Chichester and Loudon Union School District, and each capable of taking land by that name. Perhaps, if so, title might be alleged in these districts jointly, and the repairs justified under both. There are not before us, however, sufficient facts, nor is it necessary to decide any question of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">It is enough, for the present, to say that the district named is not alleged to be a corporation known to the law, and the description of the inhabitants, regarded as individuals, is entirely insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The case cited by the counsel from 14 N. H. Rep. 328, only shows that in equity a devise for charitable purposes will not be defeated because the beneficiaries are not a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The demurrer as to these pleas must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The three last pleas of the case are clearly bad at common law, because they amount to the general issue,-being a denial of a part of the facts alleged by the plaintiffs in their declaration, and which they are consequently bound to prove. But as the statute provides that <em>V </em>when any action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>of trespass shall be brought before a justice, and the defendant shall plead the general issue, he shall not be allowed to offer any evidence that may bring the title to real estate in question,\u201d (Rev. Stat. ch. 175, \u00a7 2,) and \u201c if in any such action the defendant shall plead any special plea, by which the title of real estate may be drawn in question,\u201d &amp;c., sec. 3, we have heretofore held that the defendant from necessity, and within the evident intention of the law, may plead specially, denying the plaintiff\u2019s title, if he thinks proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Such pleas by analogy to the pleas of property in the defendant, or property in a stranger, in replevin, may allege the property in a school district, with a traverse of the plaintiff\u2019s property. In that ease the issue must be upon the traverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The objection, that the names of the inhabitants of the school district are not given, applies to the fourth and fifth pleas, by reason of the word <em>said, </em>which refers to the former pleas. But the allegations are hardly sufficient to show the district named a corporation. It may be questionable whether this defect is very material, since the issue, if any, must be on the plaintiffs\u2019 title.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The last plea is a general denial of any property or interest in the plaintiff, in the premises in question, without anything more ; which leaves the burden upon the plaintiff to prove his title, before he can recover, as he would be bound to do upon the general issue. This plea seems to us free from any valid objection, and this opinion is sustained by the case of <em>Janvrin </em>v. <em>Scammon, </em>6 Foster\u2019s Rep. 362, where the same question arose, and by the eases there eited. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Rowell, </em>7 N. H. Rep. 515; 6 Pick. 419; 17 Pick. 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The other pleadings may be 'amended, if desired, on the usual terms.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
