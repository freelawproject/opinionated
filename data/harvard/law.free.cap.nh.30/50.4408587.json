The allowance of various other items in the plaintiff\u2019s specification and the defendant\u2019s set-off, is made to depend upon the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-14\">The main questions which arise upon the auditor\u2019s report are, first, was the plaintiff' so far residuary legatee, by the will of his father, John Tappan, that, upon giving the usual bond of a residuary legatee, his father\u2019s estate would vest in him, and enable him to maintain an action therefor in his own name <em>1 </em>and, second, if he could thus maintain an action, would the mere fact that he did not give the bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>until the action was commenced, prevent his maintaining the same ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-5\">1. John Tappan intended by his will to dispose of all his property, and to make the plaintiff, who was his only child and heir-at-law, residuary legatee. In giving a construction to the will, the court is bound to carry the intention of the testator into effect, if it can be done consistently with the rules of law. Authorities need not be cited upon this point. It appears by the will, that after the testator had made various bequests, and some provision for his wife, he inserted the following clause : \u201c Item \u2014 All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, whether real, personal or mixed, in Claremont aforesaid, wheresoever being, after payment of my just debts, I give, bequeath and devise to my son John W. Tappan.\u201d It will probably be conceded that the clauses, \u201c in Claremont aforesaid,\u201d and \u201c wheresoever being,\u201d standing as they do, without any thing being supplied, are inconsistent with each other. If the latter had preceded the former, they might perhaps have been reconciled, by defeating the intention of the testator. Now, which clause shall be rejected? Shall that clause be rejected which defeats the intention of the testator, or that which makes it effectual? Shall the clause <em>Iasi </em>written in the will be rejected, or the one <em>first </em>written ? An answer to these questions is found in the rules established for the construction of wills. Loose and doubtful words may be rejected as surplusage, when they oppose the broad and manifest intent of the testator, and if there be a latter clause repugnant to a former, so that one must be rejected, the latter clause must prevail, unless the intention of the testator, apparent from other parts of the will, leads to a different construction. See <em>Dawes, Judge, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Swan &amp; al., </em>4 Mass. 208; 1 Roberts on Wills 491, n. 2, and cases there cited. By supplying the word <em>and, </em>however, there would be no occasion to reject either clause, and the intention of the testator would be made good. In the note to Roberts on Wills, last cited, it is laid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>down as a rule of construction, that if a testator expresses himself incorrectly, the court will supply proper words, if the meaning distinctly appears.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-5\">Both parties in this action supposed that the plaintiff was residuary legatee; the probate court for this county so decided, and this, for some sixteen years, was the practical construction of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-6\">But if the court hold that the plaintiff is not legatee of the entire residuum under the will, still the plaintiff insists that being only child and heir-at-law of the testator, he is so far a residuary legatee that, upon giving a bond to pay the funeral charges, debts and legacies, the estate of the testator vested in him. <em>Tarbell </em>v. <em>Whiting, 5 N. </em>H.

If the court hold that the estate of the testator did not vest in the plaintiff, upon his giving bond on the 2d of April, 1851, then the plaintiff will be compelled to go through with all the forms and incur all the expenses of an ordinary administration, in order to obtain a decree in the probate court, authorizing him to pay to himself that residuum which the testator designed he should have by the will. The plaintiff trusts that the court will not make a decision attended With such results, unless forced to do it by the strict letter of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-7\">2. This action was commenced January 16th, 1851, and the plaintiff filed his bond in the probate court April 2d, 1851. It is provided, Compiled Statutes, ch. 170, \u00a7 10, that \u00ab any person interested in the estate of any person deceased, may commence an action as administrator thereof, which shall not be abated nor the attachment lost by reason that such person is not administrator thereof, nor by his decease, if the administrator then or afterwards appointed shall, at the first or second term of the court, indorse the writ, and prosecute the same as plaintiff.\u201d The plaintiff brings his case clearly within the meaning, equity .and necessity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>this provision, and it would operate as a great hardship upon him, if he were to lose his attachment in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-5\">If the plaintiff is correct in his two foregoing positions, the auditor\u2019s report, it would seem, is to be disposed of as follows : The plaintiff is to recover the amount of the three notes first described in his specification, and the interest thereon, the item of $165,19, and the interest thereon from, the date of the writ, and the item of $3716,94, and the interest thereon from January 1st, 1848. The first item of the defendant\u2019s set-off, $36,50, is to be disallowed, as it is barred by the statute of limitations. The three items of $223,02, and the five items of $223, are, of course, to be disallowed, as they were for the yearly interest paid prior to January 1st, 1848, on the item of $3716,94, mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s specification. The item of $25, is to be allowed, also the item of $129,42, and interest thereon from Sept. 11th, 1849; the item of $100, and interest thereon from July llth, 1850, and the two items of $47,75 and $121,50, and interest on the same from the .time of filing the set-off.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARx\">But if the plaintiff is not correct in his positions, then he is simply to recover the amount of the three notes first described in his specification, and the interest thereon, and the balance of interest upon the item of $3716,94, from January 1st, 1848, to the date of the writ. And the defendant is to be allowed the items of $25, $47,75 and $121,50, and interest on the two last from the time of filing the set-off.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-7\"><em>Tappan \u00bff </em>Bailey, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-8\">It is not disputed that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of the three notes mentioned in his first specification, with interest on the same, subject to the defendant\u2019s set-off. The case raises two material points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-9\">1. As to the right of the plaintiff, as executor and residuary legatee of John Tappan, deceased, to recover in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>action, brought in his own name, for debts due the estate of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-5\"><em>2. </em>As to the interest on the sum of $3716,94, in the hands of the defendant, which the auditor finds to be part of the $10,000 bequeathed in trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-6\">The plaintiff having received of the defendant the interest on this amount from January 1,1840, to January 1, 1848, and the sum of $229, for interest accruing subsequent to the latter date, claims in this action to recover the balance of interest from January 1,1848, to the date of the writ; while the defendant, in his set-off, claims that the interest so paid on said amount, from January 1,1840, under the supposition that the plaintiff was residuary legatee, and the defendant co-executor with him, should be paid back to him, (the defendant,) having been paid under a mistake, so much thereof as is not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-7\">To the positions of the plaintiff, we reply:</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-8\">1. That the plaintiff is not residuary legatee. The clause in the will upon which this point must be determined, is as follows: \u201c Item \u2014 All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, whether real, personal or mixed, in Claremont aforesaid, wheresoever being, after payment of my just debts, I give, bequeath and devise to my son John W. Tappan.\u201d It is not conceded that the clauses, \u201cin Claremont aforesaid,\u201d and \u201c wheresover being,\u201d are inconsistent with each other. It was the intent of the testator to restrict the legacy. The superior court, in. the probate' appeal in this case, say, \u201c neither the court of probate nor this court can know that this is the residue of all the estate.\u201d If it had been material, after this decision, the defendant might have shown that there was other property on which, by its peculiar situation, the residuary clause in the will was not designed to operate, thus making the intention of the testator to restrict the clause to his property in Claremont perfectly apparent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-9\">It is a well established rale of law, that in the interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>fion of a will, it is the duty of the court to give effect to all the words, without rejecting or controlling any of them, if it can be done by a reasonable construction, not inconsistent with the manifest intention of the testator.

They are not, in fact, inconsistent with each other, but only with what the plaintiff assumes to have been the intention of the testator. But authorities need not have been cited on this point. It is sufficient for us to remark that this court have already decided that the plaintiff was not residuary legatee. In <em>Tappan </em>v. <em>Tappan, </em>4 Foster\u2019s Rep. 403, the court hold the following language: \u201c The other executor of this will, John W. Tappan, is not residuary legatee. The rest and residue of the estate \u2018 in Claremont aforesaid, wheresoever being,\u2019 was given to him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>but neither the court of probate nor this court can know that this is the residue of all the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-5\">It may be true, as suggested by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that \u201c both parties in this action supposed that the plaintiff was residuary legatee,, and that for some sixteen years this has been the practical construction of the willbut the erroneous suppositions of the parties cannot affect their legal rights. If the parties supposed the plaintiff to be residuary legatee, they also supposed the defendant to be co-executor, and as such, entitled to recompense for his services and expenditures; and upon that supposition the defendant expended large sums of money in behalf of the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-6\">If the plaintiff will be compelled to go through the forms, and incur the expenses, of an administration, in consequence of a failure to recover in this suit the amount claimed in his second specification, we submit that by that process alone can the respective rights of these parties be determined, and exact justice be meted out to each.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-7\"><em>2. </em>But it is said by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that if the court hold that the plaintiff is not legatee of the entire residuum, under the will, still being only child and heir-at-law of the testator, he is so far residuary legatee that, upon giving bond to pay funeral charges, debts and legacies, the estate of the testator vested in him. And several cases from our own reports are cited to sustain this position.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-8\">We have examined these cases with attention, and have been utterly unable to perceive any bearing they can be supposed to have upon the proposition stated. In all of them, wherever a residuary legatee is mentioned, it is a legatee of the entire residuum. The law in relation to \u201c residuary legatees,\u201d is cited by way of illustration merely, in one of the cases, and in neither of them is there the most distant allusion to any residuary legatee <em>sub modo.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-9\">3. But before the plaintiff can avail himself of the doctrine of these cases, he must bring himself within them, and within the statute on which they are founded, by showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>that he is both executor and residuary legatee. On the contrary, when this suit was brought, it is evident, by the decision of the court in the probate appeal, before alluded to, that he was neither the one nor the other. It is only when the executor is also residuary legatee, and gives the required bond, that the estate vests in him, so as to require no further administration. Comp. Stat. ch. 167, \u00a7 13; Batchelder, <em>Admr. </em>v. Russell, 10 N. H. Rep. 39; <em>Clark </em>v. Tufts, 5 Pick. 337.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-5\">II. But conceding that the plaintiff was both residuary legatee and executor, so that the property vested in him, it does not follow, nor do the cases decide, that he could bring a suit in his own name to recover choses in action belonging to the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-6\">The cause of action can, in no sense, be said to accrue to him in his own right. He represents the estate, and the right of action must accrue to him, if at all, in his representative capacity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-7\">In this case, the plaintiff sues for notes due to him in his own right, and also for the notes due to the estate of John Tappan. For the reasons given, it would seem that he could not recover these last in his own name, even if he is to be held to be residuary legatee and executor. Nor can he recover them in this suit, for the reason that it is an attempt to join a demand in his own right with one as representative of another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-8\">The promise must be alleged previous to the death of the testator. Oliver\u2019s Prec. 82; Chitty\u2019s PI. 151, 202; 2 Saund. 117.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-9\">III. But another, and it seems to us, a complete answer to this action, so far as it relates to any thing due the estate of John Tappan, is found in the statute in relation to trustees of estates. Act of June 21, 1820. Rev. Stat. ch. 168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-10\">The defendant, having never given bond as trustee, as required by the act, must be considered as having declined the trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Under the provisions of this statute, the plaintiff or the grandchildren of the deceased, who, by the provisions of the will, are entitled, eventually, to the principal of the $10,000 bequeathed in trust, may procure the appointment of a new trustee or trustees, to whom the defendant will be bound to account and deliver up all the estate which may have come to his hands by virtue of such trust. And by this means, the plaintiff can have a full and complete remedy to recover the unpaid interest which he claims under the provisions of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-5\">Even if the <em>plaintiff </em>and defendant were both co-executors, we do not- see how the plaintiff could sue his co-executor for the interest that might remain unpaid. His rights, as it seems to us, could only be enforced by taking the legal steps upon the defendant\u2019s bond as trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-6\">IV. At any rate, the plaintiff can stand in no better position in regard to this action, than he could if the defendant was legally an executor. As the plaintiff\u2019s counsel suggests, he was appointed executor, and under the authority of the probate court, acted as such for sixteen years, and he cannot be made liable for a legacy in his hands until after demand made. <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>14 Mass. Rep. 428; <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Boyden, </em>3 Pick. 213; <em>Mathes </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>6 N. H. Rep. 105. Here no demand is shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-7\">V. But upon what ground the plaintiff can attempt to recover of the defendant the $3716,94, we are at a loss to conceive. However it may be in regard to other property, vesting Absolutely in him as residuary legatee, upon giving the proper bond, there can be no pretence that this trust fund vested absolutely in him. It belongs to him in no event. He has no more right to hold it as trustee than has the defendant. Nor is he any more than the defendant a trustee under the will. Neither party has ever given bond as trustee, and, in this respect, both stand in the same position. The defendant has just as much right to sue the plaintiff for the balance of the $10,000 in his hands, as the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>has to maintain this suit, in his own name, for that part of it in the hands of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-5\">VI. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel cites section 10 of chapter 170 of the Compiled Laws, and contends that this suit, having been commenced by attachment, January 16, 1851, and the plaintiff, having filed his bond in the probate court, April 2d, 1851, it is within the purview of this provision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-6\">It is sufficient, in reply, to remark that the plaintiff did not \u201c commence his action as administrator thereof,\u201d but commenced an action in his own name and in his own individual right, for debts due to him in his private capacity. The attempt to claim as executor would seem to have been an afterthought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">In the original specification, no mention whatever was made of the debts due in <em>autre droit; </em>and not till a year afterwards were those claims brought forward and a new specification filed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b67-8\">Eastman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ2\">Much of the discussion, in this case, has been upon the question whether the plaintiff was residuary legatee of John Tappan, and most of the claims in controversy depend upon the decision of that question. But that point we regard as having been settled when these parties were before this court at a former time. It was decided in <em>Tappan </em>v. Tappan, 4 Foster\u2019s Rep. 400, that the plaintiff, in this action, was not made residuary legatee by the will of his father. Probably the fact stated in the auditor\u2019s report, that the plaintiff is the only lineal heir of John Tappan, induced the probate court the more readily to recognize John W. Tappan as residuary legatee, and to attempt to take bonds from him accordingly. And it may be that such was the intention of the testator. The language of the will, however, does not so make him, and the clause having once undergone a judicial construction, we are content that it should so remain. The testator may have had reasons, satisfactory to his own mind, for not making his son residuary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>legatee of all his estate, even though as heir he would become possessed of the same property which he would have taken as residuary legatee. He may have thought it best that his estate should be more promptly settled by the return of an inventory and the payment and collection of debts, than by the filing of a bond to pay debts and legacies. But this is only matter of speculation. We know nothing of the case except what appears from the papers, and we treat this point as settled, because it has once been considered and passed upon by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The plaintiff cannot, therefore, recover in this action, brought in his own individual name, (on the ground of being residuary legatee,) several of the sums specified in the auditor\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Whether the giving of bond by a residuary legatee vests the choses in action of the testator so completely in the legatee, as to enable him to collect them in his own individual name, need not be determined. The plaintiff, not being residuary legatee, that question does not necessarily arise in this ease. It seems to have been settled, however, that by the giving of such bond by a residuary legatee, the property, in the estate vests in the legatee, and that the only security for the payment of prior debts and legacies must be derived from the bond. <em>Batchelder, Admr. </em>v. <em>Russell &amp; </em>a., 10 N. H. Rep. 39; <em>Tarbell &amp; a. </em>v. <em>Whiting, 5 </em>N. H. Rep. 63; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Tufts, 5 </em>Pick. 337. In <em>Tarbell </em>v. Whiting, the court say, \u201c as soon as the executor had given bonds to the judge of probate, to pay the debts and legacies, all of the estate of the testator, not specifically devised to others, vested in the executor absolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">But where an executor is not residuary legatee, and the estate is settled in the ordinary course, by returning an inventory, the personal property of the deceased is not distributed among the heirs till after the administrator or executor shall have settled his account in the probate court. It then, and not before, passes into the hands of the heirs, by de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>cree of the judge of probate. Rev. Stat. ch. 166, \u00a7 5. No such decree had been passed when this suit was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">But should we hold the plaintiff to be residuary legatee by the appointment of the will, he was not such by the authority of the probate court, at least till April 2d, 1851, when he gave his new bond. The bond which he gave before clothed him with no power. This was decided in <em>Tappan </em>v. Tappan, 4 Foster\u2019s Rep. 400, before cited; and this suit was commenced before the new bond was given, and before his legal appointment as executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">And even could he hold the personal estate as heir, so as to enable him to collect the choses in action of the deceased, in his own name, after a settlement of his account as executor, without any decree of distribution, he still encounters another difficulty. He settled his account as executor, May 21, 1851, and this suit was instituted January 16,1851. He must recover according to the legal rights and liabilities of the parties existing at the time the action was commenced; and at that time he was not clothed with any legal power as executor, nor had he, as heir, any rights which he could then enforce against the defendant by a suit at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The clause of the statute referred to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, (Rev. Stat. 161, \u00a7 10,) providing that any person interested in the estate of any one deceased, may commence an action as administrator, &amp;c., does not apply to a case of this kind. This action was commenced by the plaintiff, individually, and he seeks to recover in his individual capacity, and not as administrator or executor. In order to come within the provisions of that statute, he should have commenced his suit as executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">According to these views, which might be more enlarged upon if it were necessary, the plaintiff will be entitled to recover only the amount of the three notes fi\u00edst named in the specification, being given directly to him in his individual capacity. The action was brought by him in that capacity, and the only undertaking by the defendant to him, as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>individual, was upon these notes. All the other matters of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, except the interest on the $3716,94, are mainly dependent upon the question of his being residuary legatee and executor, and cannot be recovered in this form of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">As to the interest on the $3716,94, which remained unpaid at the time of the commencement of this suit, that was given directly to the plaintiff by the will, after the decease of the plaintiff\u2019s mother, and was a legacy to him. But a legacy cannot be recovered till after demand made for the same. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>12 N. H. Rep. 34; <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Boyden, </em>3 Pick. <em>213; Prescott </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>14 Mass. Rep. 428. And here was no demand shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">It is unnecessary to decide, therefore, whether this interest can be recovered in this form of action ; but we would suggest a doubt whether, as these parties were co-trustees of the fund producing the interest, any action at common law can be maintained for it; and whether all proceedings in regard to this fund between these parties, or the interest-arising therefrom, must not be in equity. Without examining this point particularly, such is our impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">With regard to the set off, that must be governed by the same principles that have been applied to the claims of the plaintiff. None of the matters growing out of the trustee fund, nor any of the charges connected with the estate of John Tappan, can be allowed in this action. Ail that the defendant is entitled to have set off are the three items of $25, $47,50 and $121,50, as allowed by the auditor. Judgment must, therefore, be entered for the plaintiff, for the amount of the three notes first described in the specification, with interest, deducting therefrom the three items of set-off, with interest on the same, as stated by the auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The other maters in controversy between the parties must be the subject of future adjustment or litigation. They cannot be recovered or allowed in this action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
