The respondent was a tobacconist, and had, as the case finds, a large quantity of tobacco, cigars, snuff, and all the fixtures for the use of the same, (his entire stock of tobacco, being of the value of $1500 or $2000,) which he sold at wholesale and retail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\">The small quantity of beer he kept was incidental to his principal business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-6\">A reference to Webster\u2019s Dictionary, to Boyer\u2019s French Dictionary, and to Spier and Surenne\u2019s Dictionary, shows that \u201c restaurant \u201d means an eating-house and \u201c restaurateur \u201d the keeper of an eating-house. \u201c Refreshment saloon,\u201d as used in the city ordinance, is a synonyme of \u201c restaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-7\">II. Tobacco, in all its production and manufacture, according to Webster, cannot be regarded as a refreshment or invigorating to the human body; but, on the contrary, it is a narcotic, injurious and debilitating. Beer is of a like character, and is used for the same purpose that opium, arsenic, betel nut, and tobacco are used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-8\">It would seem that if the respondent is a restaurateur, the keepers of groceries, apothecary shops, and all other places where narcotic drags are kept and sold, are restaurateurs, and that the name of restaurant may, with propriety, be applied to all kind of stores and shops in which is kept any thing that can be eaten or drank.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-9\"><em>George Sf Foster, </em>for the State.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-10\">The sole question which arises in this case is, whether the shop of the respondent, referred to in the case, is a \u201c refreshment saloon \u201d or \u201c restaurant,\u201d within the meaning of the city ordinance ; the right of the city to pass the ordinance having been determined by this court in <em>The State </em>v. Clark, 8 Foster\u2019s Rep. 176.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-12\">The word \u201crefreshed,\u201d according to Webster\u2019s Dictionary, means \u201c cooled, invigorated, revived, cheered.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-13\">The word \u201c saloon \u201d is by the same authority defined \u201c a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>lofty spacious hall, vaulted at the top, and usually comprehending two stories, with two ranges of windows.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">But we suppose the word \u201c refreshment saloon \u201d has, by common usage, a very different signification from that given by Webster, and that the city authorities of Concord, in passing the ordinance, meant, and were understood to mean, that it should have some practical application, as it could not have now, and probably never could have, were it confined in its application to the definition of refreshment saloon given in the dictionaries. No two-storied, lofty, spacious halls, vaulted at the top, with two ranges of windows, wherein people get \u201ccooled, invigorated, revived or cheered,\u201d are supposed, at this moment, to exist in the city, of Concord, and the erection of such saloons is presumed to be extremely problematical.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvB\">But bar-rooms, oyster shops, cigar shops, beer shops and grog shops, all of which are denominated, in common parlance, as \u201c refreshment saloons,\u201d are supposed to exist in large numbers, and if the city ordinance does not refer to these, it has no practical application whatever. The respondent kept a cigar and beer shop, where people could have been \u201c invigorated and revived \u201d by the influences of a glass of beer, \u201c cheered \u201d with a cigar, or, it is presumed, \u201c cooled \u201d by means of a glass of iced water, if such results accorded with their inclinations; and keeping such a place of public resort, he kept a \u201c refreshment saloon \u201d within the meaning of that expression, as ordinarily used and applied by the community.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A4W\">Eastman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArV\">In <em>The State </em>v. Clark, 8 Foster\u2019s Rep. 176, we held that the Legislature may constitutionally authorize a city to enact, and a city may enact an ordinance that no intoxicating liquors shall be used or kept in any refreshment saloon or restaurant within the city, for any purpose whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"AvR\">The question, in that case, arose upon the second section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>of an ordinance of the city of Concord, and is the same second section as is set forth in the case under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">That decision settles the constitutionality of the ordinance ; so that the only question presented, as has been stated and argued by counsel is, whether the shop of the respondent, in which the beer was sold, was a refreshment saloon or restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Under the general law of the State for selling without license, the respondent could have been indicted, and, if found guilty, could have been fined. Comp. Stat. ch. 123, \u00a7 6. The general law applies to all places and to all persons who shall sell without license. This city ordinance applies to the particular places specified; to refreshment saloons and restaurants, and to no others. Was, then, the shop of the respondent a'refreshment saloon or a restaurant?</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Whatever may be the strict and accurate meaning of these terms, and however loosely, also, they may sometimes be used, it appears to us that they have here a signification so well fixed as to make this a case not one of serious doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">In some sections of our country, a refreshment saloon or restaurant may, perhaps, be understood to embrace all the various places specified by the counsel for the State; and in some sections, also, a saloon, which did not contain a variety of choice liquors, would not be dignified with the name of a \u201crefreshment \u201d saloon. And so, also, with a restaurant. With us, however, such is not the case. A \u201c restaurant \u201d is an eating-house ; a place where something to eat, ready prepared, or which can readily be prepared, may be obtained. \u201c A refreshment saloon \u201d is a room or rooms fitted up for purposes similar to those of a restaurant; and although spirituous liquors are frequently kept in both, \u2022either with or without license, yet they do not necessarily form an element in the definition of either. In the case of <em>The State </em>v. Clark, before referred to, it was held, in addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tion to the decision of the constitutional question, that the keeping of liquor in a cellar, under a refreshment saloon or restaurant, is a violation of the city ordinance, the Chief Justice, who delivered the opinion, saying the cellar was as much a part of the <em>eating-house </em>as any other portion of the building. The learned judge, whose use of language is generally very accurate, appears to have treated the terms \u201crefreshment saloon and restaurant\u201d as synonymous with that of \u201c eating-house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">This ordinance presupposes the existence of refreshment saloons and restaurants, independent of spirits being used and kept therein. It is against their being so used and kept in the places specified, and in contemplation that they might be so kept, that the ordinance was passed. The keeping of beer or any spirituous liquors in such places does not, therefore, make them restaurants or refreshment saloons in the eye of this ordinance; if so, it would be an ordinance against the keeping of spirits in a defined place, which would not be such a place were it not for their being so kept. If the place could not exist without the keeping of the forbidden articles, how can it be said that the articles are kept in such a place ? As well might it be said that the brick and mortar with which a house is constructed, are kept in the house. The places must first have an existence, before an offence can be committed for keeping the forbidden articles therein. And before beer can be kept in a refreshment saloon or restaurant, it must be made to appear that such a place exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The question, then, comes to this; is a shop which is used for the manufacture and sale of tobacco, snuff and cigars, a refreshment saloon or a restaurant ? The reply to the question appears to us quite plain, and the suggestions which we have already made will furnish the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">We entertain no doubt that there should be</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the respondent.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
