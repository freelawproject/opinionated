The common defendant filed a general demurrer to the petition in each action; the demurrers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>were sustained by the court, each plaintiff elected to stand on his petition, and judgment was rendered against him for costs. Each plaintiff brings his case to this court for a review of the ruling, and all p\u00e1rties agree to submit the cases together as one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-4\">After a proper description of his property alleged to have been destroyed by the fire and setting forth the value thereof, the petition in Barry\u2019s case, omitting the prayer for relief and the signatures, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-5\">\u201cThat on the said 30th day of March, 1905, Joe Suchy and John Suchy, jr., minor sons of the said defendant, John Suchy, and under the age of twenty-one years, who resided at home with their father and who worked for him and were under his care, management and control, while engaged in the business of their father, the said minor sons, working for his interests and for his benefit on his farm, situated in said Pleasantdale township, in Rush county, Kansas, some distance from where the plaintiff\u2019s property hereinbefore described was located, while engaged in repairing a fence on the farm owned by their father, the said defendant, while they were engaged in his business and for his benefit and working for him, purposely, carelessly and negligently set out a fire on their father\u2019s farm, and through their failure and neglect in setting out the said fire, and in not taking proper care and means to control the said fire, which they had wilfully, purposely, carelessly and negligently set out on their father\u2019s farm, the said fire spread from their father\u2019s farm to the real estate owned by the said plaintiff and destroyed all of the aforesaid property belonging to the plaintiff and of the value of $870.50.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b736-6\"><em>H. L. Anderson, </em>and <em>G. R. McKee, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b736-7\"><em>S. I. Hale, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b736-9\">Smith, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AE4\">Do the facts as stated render the defendant, the father of the boys, liable for the damage resulting from the fire? The trial court correctly answered, \u201cNo.\u201d It is conceded that the father is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>liable for the tortious acts of his sons by reason simply of the relationship, nor by reason of their minority, nor because they lived at home with him and worked for him and were under his care, management and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">It is contended, however, that the further allegation that the minor sons, \u201cwhile engaged in repairing a fence on the farm owned by their father, the said defendant, while they were engaged in his business and for his benefit and working for him, purposely, carelessly and negligently set out a fire . . . and in not taking proper care and means to control the said fire,\u201d does state facts which render the father liable. An essential ingredient of liability is lacking, viz., that the setting out of the fire was within the scope of their employment \u2014 that the setting out of the fire was the act of the father, by his sons <em>%s </em>his agents, in the same sense as was the building of the fence by them his act. No connection is shown between the father\u2019s work pf building the fen'ce and the act of setting out the fire. Had it been alleged that while building a fence for their father the sons shot the plaintiff\u2019s horse the lack of connection between the two acts would only be more apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">It is urged that the setting of the fire may have been necessary to enable them to build the fence. The argument is good; not so the petition. Had the petition alleged that it became necessary to remove rubbish or brush by burning it before the fence could be built, and for that purpose the sons started the fire and negligently allowed it to escape and spread upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises, etc., the missing link would probably have been supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The liability of a parent for the act of a minor son rests upon the same basic facts as the liability of a master for the acts of his servant, and does not result from the fact of the tort or act being purposely or wilfully done but from its being done in doing the master\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>or parent\u2019s business. If the act complained of be the setting out of a fire, it is not a sufficient pleading of liability to allege that the servant or child was engaged in the business of the master or parent, but it must appear that the setting of the fire was a part of that business or resulted from some act done in the performance of such business. The act must be the result of doing the business of the master or parent, and not of an independent act done during a cessation, even momentary, of the doing of such business. <em>(Hudson v. M.
