Magouirk was convicted after trial by jury of conspiracy to commit bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) &amp; (d). While a motion for a new trial was pending, Magouirk entered into a plea agreement with the government. Ma-gouirk agreed to withdraw his motion and waive his right to appeal in exchange for a sentence recommendation in a pending prosecution for two federal firearms violations stemming from the bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">After sentencing, Magouirk filed a motion to vacate the sentence on the ground that his conviction had been procured through the use of perjured testimony. Specifically, he contends that the government knowingly allowed two prosecution witnesses, codefendants who had entered guilty pleas in the case, to testify falsely about their plea agreements with the government. The district court held that Magouirk\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal his conviction precluded consideration of this contention and therefore denied the motion. A panel of the former Fifth Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for a determination whether Mago-uirk knew the testimony was false at the time he waived his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The district court again denied collateral relief. The court found that one of the two witnesses who had allegedly given false testimony, Joyce Ann Carroll, had actually told the truth about her plea agreement. The district court also found that the testimony of the other witness, R. Shirleen Curd Johnson, had been false and that the government\u2019s attorney had inexcusably allowed such testimony to stand uncorrected. Nonetheless, the district court found that the false testimony would not have affected the outcome of the trial and thus did not warrant the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-20\">We have carefully examined the record in this case and we agree with the district eourt that Carroll did not testify falsely about her plea agreement with the government. While some of Carroll\u2019s answers on cross-examination concerning her plea agreement were a bit confusing, she stated explicitly that her plea agreement called for a guilty plea and a recommended fifteen-year sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, at one point during the cross-examination Carroll\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Ines, informed the court and the jury of the sentence and stated that the sentence had not yet been imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, Magouirk\u2019s argument that he was convicted on the basis of false testimony by Carroll must fail. It is thus unnecessary to determine whether Magouirk waived his right to raise this objection when he waived his right to appeal his conviction directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-21\"> We also agree with the district court that the Assistant United States Attorney inexplicably failed to correct false testimony by Johnson. Although the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>cuting attorney \u201chas the responsibility and duty to correct what he knows to be false and elicit the truth,\u201d <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 270, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 1177, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959) (citation omitted), the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct does not always render a subsequent conviction illegal. We will overturn a conviction resting in part upon the knowing use of false testimony \u201cif there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103-04, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2397-98, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). The false testimony must be material before a conviction will be overturned, and materiality must be evaluated in light of all the evidence adduced at trial. When false testimony is elicited that goes to a witness\u2019 credibility, it will be considered sufficiently material to warrant a new trial \u201conly when the \u2018estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of [the] given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>574 F.2d 1347, 1356 (5th Cir. 1978) (quoting <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 153-54, 92 S.Ct. 763, 765-66, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In this case, Johnson was not an important prosecution witness. Independent evidence, particularly Carroll\u2019s testimony identifying Magouirk as the man with whom she robbed the Indian Springs branch of the First Bank of Alabaster, established Mago-uirk\u2019s participation in the conspiracy and bank robbery. Johnson\u2019s testimony merely corroborated the part of Carroll\u2019s testimony that concerned events occurring <em>after </em>the bank robbery. Johnson\u2019s testimony neither placed Magouirk at the scene of the robbery nor concerned evidence establishing any of the elements of the crimes with which Ma-gouirk was charged. At best her testimony was cumulative. Consequently, Johnson\u2019s credibility was in no way determinative of Magouirk\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Magouirk relies heavily upon <em>United States v. Barham, </em>595 F.2d 231 (5th Cir. 1979), to argue that Johnson\u2019s false testimony was material and therefore warrants reversal of his conviction. <em>Barham </em>does not, however, control this case. In <em>Barham </em>three crucial witnesses were allowed to testify falsely about plea agreements with the government. The court overturned the convictions because \u201ccredibility was especially important .. . [because] two sets of witnesses \u2014 all alleged participants in one or more stages of a criminal enterprise\u2014 presented irreconcilable stories.\" <em>Id. </em>at 242-43. The case before us is fundamentally different because of the nature and quality of Carroll\u2019s testimony. Essentially, Johnson\u2019s testimony supported only the accuracy of Carroll\u2019s memory, for it concerned events subsequent to the robbery and it did not identify Magouirk as one of the bank robbers. Johnson\u2019s credibility, unlike the credibility of the witnesses in <em>Barham </em>or the credibility of Carroll, was not material to the prosecution\u2019s case and Magouirk\u2019s conviction. Had Carroll testified falsely our conclusion would have been drastically different, but we simply are not faced with the kind of situation when a key witness gives false testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s failure to correct Carroll\u2019s misstatements did not infect the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827-828; 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (constitutional error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt). <em>Cf. Smith v. </em>Phillips,-U.S.-,-, 102 S.Ct. 940, 947, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982) (touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is fairness of trial not culpability of prosecutor).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, Magouirk is not entitled to collateral relief from his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">. Ultimately, the district court on its own motion sentenced Carroll to a lighter sentence than was called for in the plea agreement. Carroll was sentenced to a ten year prison term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">. During defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Carroll, the following testimony was elicited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">Q Have you entered any sort of plea here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">Q What is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">A Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-13\">Q You plead guilty to robbing this bank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-14\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-15\">Q What punishment have you gotten?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-16\">A I am not sure.

Magouirk also contends on appeal that he should not be bound by his plea agreement because part of the original sentence was subsequently vacated. Magouirk failed to raise this contention in the district court, and we decline to pass upon it in the first instance here. See <em>Red v. Blackburn, </em>636 F.2d 1027, 1028 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Brown v. Alabama, </em>619 F.2d 376, 378 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
