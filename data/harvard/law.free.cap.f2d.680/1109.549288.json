Jurisdiction is predicated upon various constitutional<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and statutory <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provisions, and diversity of citizenship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court denied appellant\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis due to the perplexing state of her thirty-six page complaint and because of her utter failure to conform to the most elemental provisions of F.R.Civ.P. 8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, and without hesitation or timidity, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">As far as we have been able to determine, appellant asserts six claims against the twenty-five named defendants. First, Harris protests the revocation of her deceased mother\u2019s citizenship which occurred when the latter married a foreign born, non-citizen male circa 1915.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, appellant alleges that \u201cthe government\u201d has deprived \u201cthe Caucasian race or certain of its members ... of basic rights under law\u201d by conferring favored status and special privileges ... on racial and religious groups.\u201d Third, Harris avers \u201cdiscrimination against Caucasian Protestant Christians\u201d because the immigration laws and the use of federal tax dollars have increased the number \u201cof non-Caucasian, non-Protestant Christian and non-Christian residents of the United States. . . . \u201d Appellant next asserts a claim against federal, state and local government officials and agencies for a failure to control the contamination caused by certain chemical and oil refining plants located near her home in southeast Houston. Appellant\u2019s fifth claim is purportedly based upon certain civil rights laws.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She alleges that her sister and various other city of Houston officials conspired to deprive her of her \u201cbasic rights.\u201d The clearest of appellant\u2019s claims on appeal is the final one \u2014 an appeal of the District Court\u2019s deni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>al of her motion to proceed in forma pau-peris.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">This Court has previously held that a District Court may dismiss without prejudice a pro se litigant\u2019s complaint if it is frivolous or malicious. <em>Mitchell v. Beaubouef, </em>581 F.2d 412, 416 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 966, 99 S.Ct. 2416, 60 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1979). The two stage procedure that has been adopted in this Circuit for processing prisoner pro se complaints filed in forma pauperis has full application in the present context for it gives adequate protection to those not represented by attorneys and comports with the explicit provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. The District Court first decides whether the litigant meets the economic requirements to proceed in forma pauperis. Then, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(d), the Court may dismiss the complaint if, upon giving it the liberal reading traditionally granted pro se complaints, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595-96, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), it determines that it is unmeritorious, frivolous or malicious. <em>Woodall v. Foti, </em>648 F.2d 268, 271 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d 886 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">In this case the District Court denied Harris leave to proceed in forma pauperis because her complaint presented a wide variety of confused and confusing claims which violated Rule 8 of F.R.Civ.P. We have given the most liberal reading of Harris\u2019 complaint and put forth sustained efforts at reading her brief on appeal and yet comprehension of both is beyond our grasp. We are mindful of the rule that an in forma pauperis appeal must not be disallowed unless the issues raised are so frivolous that it would be dismissed even if the litigant had financed the appeal himself. <em>Ellis v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 674, 78 S.Ct. 974, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1958); <em>Coppedge v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 438, 82 S.Ct. 917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962). The issues Harris raises are plainly frivolous; consequently, the District Court was not in error by denying her leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We will thus treat this denial as a dismissal without prejudice for it plainly appears that Harris can \u201cprove no set of facts in support of [her claims] which would entitle [her] to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-02, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). As did the District Court, we have labored in vain to find merit amidst the frivolity in appellant\u2019s complaint. That Court\u2019s judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">.
