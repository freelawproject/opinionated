The .court below had granted him use immunity and derivative use immunity. The appellant attacks the order of the district court on two grounds. First, he alleges that any information divulged to the grand jury could lead to him being prosecuted for criminal activity in Colombia notwithstanding the grant of use immunity. Second, he claims that the information which is the basis of the government\u2019s interrogation of him before the grand jury was obtained pursuant to an illegal wire tap as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3504.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-26\">We reject the appellant\u2019s first contention. We affirm the district court on the basis of <em>United States v. Brummitt, </em>665 F.2d 521 (5th Cir. 1981), and the opinion in the same case appearing in 608 F.2d 640 (5th Cir. 1979), in which case it was held that a possibility of prosecution in a foreign country is not a sufficient basis for immunity from testifying before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-27\">As to the appellant\u2019s second contention, we affirm the holding of the district court on the basis of <em>United States v. Ru</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>bin, </em>559 F.2d 975 (5th Cir. 1977), and <em>In re Vigil, </em>524 F.2d 209 (10th Cir. 1975). A witness must say more than he believes that an unlawful electronic surveillance by a government agency led to his interrogation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Rubin, supra, </em>the court adhered to \u201cthe requirement that the assertion of surveillance be a \u2018positive statement that unlawful surveillance has taken place,\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>526 F.2d 279, 282 (5th Cir. 1976)). \u201cAn allegation that it \u2018may\u2019 have occurred will not suffice.\u201d <em>Rubin, supra, </em>at 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Another ground for affirming the district court is that the questions which the witness Baker refused to answer were hardly the fruits of an illegal wire tap. The questions which Baker refused to answer in the grand jury room were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">1. Prior to being incarcerated,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> what was your occupation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-6\">2. Were you \u2014 are you a pilot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">3. Have you ever been a crop duster?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-8\">4. What is your date of birth?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3504, the statute Baker seeks to invoke, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-10\">(a) In any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United States</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-11\">(1) upon a claim by a party aggrieved that evidence is inadmissible because it is the primary product of an unlawful act or because it was obtained by the exploitation of an unlawful act, the opponent of the claim shall affirm or deny the occurrence of the alleged unlawful act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-15\">(b) As used in this section \u201cunlawful act\u201d means any act the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device (as defined in section 2510(5) of this title) in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or any regulation or standard promulgated pursuant thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-16\">Those questions and the answers to them could not be said to be inadmissible \u201cbecause it is the primary product of an unlawful act or because it was obtained by the exploitation of an unlawful act.\u201d Therefore, we affirm Baker\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AFX\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-12\">. This view is supported by a majority of the panel. One panel member believes that the claim is sufficient because appellant stated in his affidavit: \u201cI believe that phone conversations of mine have been unlawfully and surreptitiously recorded. I base this belief on the fact that I heard the clicks and echoes during conversations which I had during said period of time.\u201d According to this panel member, this comports with the opinion in <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>526 F.2d 279 (5th Cir. 1976): \u201cWe tend to agree with the Second, Ninth and D.C. Circuits that a \u2018mere assertion\u2019 of unlawful surveillance is enough to trigger the government\u2019s obligation to affirm or deny.\u201d 526 F.2d at 282.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-27\">. Baker is presently incarcerated under plea of guilty to illegal importation of contraband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b788-28\">. The panel does not reach the issue of whether Baker is \u201ca party aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
