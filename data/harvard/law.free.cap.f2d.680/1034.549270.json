The vessel defendant appeals the dismissal of its third-party demand against the workman\u2019s employer for indemnification insofar as the injuries were caused by the employer\u2019s fault. The precise issue is whether the employer is immune from the indemnification demand as an employer covered by the LHWCA; it is contended that the employer should be denied this immunity because its employee, although injured by maritime tort on a vessel in navigable waters, was nevertheless not in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d and thus not covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">A panel of this court, in a split decision, held that the work involved was indeed \u201cmaritime employment\u201d within the meaning of the LHWCA. <em>Boudreaux v. American Workover, Inc., </em>664 F.2d 463 (5th Cir. 1981). Rehearing en banc was granted. 664 F.2d 480 (5th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">On rehearing, we reach the issue expressly reserved in <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co., Inc. v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 266 n.25, 97 S.Ct. 2348, 2358 n.25, 53 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977): \u201cwhether Congress excluded people who would have been covered before the 1972 amendment; that is, workers who are injured on navigable waters as previously defined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">For reasons to be set forth more fully, we find no Congressional intent to withdraw the coverage of the Act from those injured on navigable waters while engaged in what was considered as \u201cmaritime employment\u201d for LHWCA purposes prior to the 1972 amendments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We, therefore, like the panel, affirm the district court\u2019s determination in favor of the Act\u2019s coverage of this maritime injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural Context</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">The issue before us arises in the following factual and procedural context, which is more fully detailed in the panel opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"AJqq\">The plaintiff Boudreaux was injured over navigable waters in the course of his employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His employer (\u201cAquatek\u201d) was a contractor performing specialty mineral-production work on a drilling barge. Bou-dreaux sued the owner and operator (\u201cAWI\u201d) of the drilling barge for its negligent failure to provide him with a safe place to work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-14\">The district court dismissed a third-party demand by the defendant AWI (the owner and operator of the <em>vessel) </em>against Aqua-tek (the <em>employer) </em>for contribution or indemnity \u2014 in the event Boudreaux recovered against Aquatek \u2014 based on Aquatek\u2019s al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>leged contributing negligence. The district court thus upheld the contention of the employer that, since it was liable to Boudreaux for LHWCA compensation, it was protected from contribution or indemnity to the vessel by section 5(b) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b) (quoted in note 9 below). This enactment, added by the 1972 revision, expressly provides that an employer of an injured workman covered by the Act shall not be liable to the vessel \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d for any injuries caused to its employee by the negligence of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Thus, in the context of this litigation, the central issue \u2014 whether Boudreaux is covered by the LHWCA as amended in 1972, so as to be entitled to the compensation now being paid to him by his employer\u2019s insurer (see note 3) \u2014 concerns whether a maritime employer, as so recognized for LHWCA purposes prior to the 1972 amendments, is to be denied the immunity from liability for contributing to negligence-caused injury to its employee,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> an immunity expressly intended by the 1972 amendments to be accorded to employers of persons entitled to LHWCA compensation because of injury in maritime employment. It also concerns whether the 1972 amendments withdrew coverage from pre-1972 maritime employees injured on the waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">I. <em>The 1972 Statutory Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"afj-dedup-1\">Prior to 1972 a single situs requirement of the LHWCA governed the scope of its coverage. That requirement limited coverage to workers whose \u201cdisability or death resulted] from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock). ...\u201d LHWCA of 1927, ch. 509, \u00a7 3(a), 44 Stat. 1426. The Supreme Court decided that a worker who in the course of his duty was obliged to go on navigable waters, however briefly or sporadically, and who suffered an injury while in that historically maritime locality, was covered by the pre-1972 LHWCA. <em>Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962). <em>See </em>Gilmore and Black, The Law of Admiralty, \u00a7 6-19 (esp. at 421-22) (2d ed. 1975); 4 Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 89.23(b) (esp. at 16-168, 169) and \u00a7 89.26 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-13\">Under the 1972 revision of the LHWCA, with its express intent to move the coverage landward <em>(see </em>II below), this simple test (generally, injury on the navigable waters) was modified. By the 1972 amendments to that Act, to be entitled to its benefits, a disabled employee must (a) be disabled as the result of \u201can injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States\u201d (defined as also including adjoining areas), section 3(a) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014the \u201csitus\u201d test; and (b) be engaged in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d at the time of the injury, section 2(3) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 the \u201cstatus\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>These 1972 requirements for coverage under the Act have been at issue before the United States Supreme Court in three of its decisions. Two of them directly involved the issue of whether land-based employees, not covered by the LHWCA pri- or to the 1972 revision, were engaged in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d at the time of their injuries: <em>P. C. Pfeiffer Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>444 U.S. 69,100 S.Ct. 328, 62 L.Ed.2d 225 (1979) and <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Company, Inc. v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 97 S.Ct. 2348, 53 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977). In both of these, coverage was upheld, affording the Act a liberal construction in view of its remedial purpose. Although the issue in the third decision, <em>Sun Ship, Inc. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, </em>447 U.S. 715, 100 S.Ct. 2432, 65 L.Ed.2d 458 (1980), was peripheral to the present, that decision nevertheless affords persuasive support to our ultimate conclusion that the 1972 revision was not intended to withdraw from amphibious workers beneficial rights to a worker\u2019s compensation remedy previously permitted or enjoyed by them under the LHWCA prior to its 1972 revision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\"><em>Caputo </em>and <em>Ford, </em>the first two decisions, concerned land-based employees newly covered by the 1972 revision. They analyzed the 1972 amendments of the LHWCA as \u201creplacing the single situs requirement <em>[i.e., </em>on navigable waters or their statutory equivalent] with a two-part situs and status standard.\u201d <em>Ford, supra, </em>444 U.S. at 73-74, 100 S.Ct. at 332; <em>Caputo, supra, </em>432 U.S. at 264-65,97 S.Ct. at 2357. \u201cTo be eligible for compensation, a person must be an employee [status] as defined by \u00a7 2(3) [33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3)] who sustains injury on the situs defined by \u00a7 3(a) [33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a)].\u201d <em>Ford, </em>444 U.S. at 74,100 S.Ct. at 333. Situs turns on geography; status on the maritime-connected nature of the job. <em>Id., </em>444 U.S. at 73-83, 100 S.Ct. at 333-37; <em>Caputo, </em>432 U.S. at 265, 97 S.Ct. at 2358-63. Thus, both the status requirements, as defined by section 902(3), based on the nature of the job, and the situs requirements, as defined by section 903(a), based on geography, must be satisfied before the LHWCA can apply. <em>Ford, </em>444 U.S. at 73-74, 100 S.Ct. at 332-33 (1979); <em>Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 265, 97 S.Ct. at 2357.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">We must note, however, that the issue as to \u201cmaritime employment\u201d in <em>Caputo </em>and' <em>Ford </em>was with regard to land-based employees on the expanded waterfront situs of compensable accidents added by the 1972 amendment, as to whom the \u201cmaritime employment\u201d test was designed to confine the remedy to employees in maritime-connected industries and to exclude from coverage non-maritime employees within the expanded shoreward zone. <em>See </em>legislative purposes in II below. The Court was there not concerned with employees injured on the actual navigable waters, who were at the time of the 1972 revision already considered to be in maritime employment for purposes of the LHWCA. (Indeed, in <em>Caputo, </em>the Court expressly noted that its opinion did not concern persons covered before the 1972 amendment who were injured on navigable waters. 436 U.S. at 266 n.25, 97 S.Ct. at 2358 n.25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-8\">It is conceded that the present injured worker, Boudreaux, was engaged in employment at the time of the accident that was compensable under the LHWCA prior to the amendment as occurring on the navigable waters. <em>See Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Company, supra. </em>We have examined the legislative history and purposes of the 1972 revision (see II below) and the jurisprudential context in which it occurred (see III below), and we find no intention to dilute the pre-1972 meaning of \u201cmaritime employment\u201d, with regard to employees actually injured on navigable waters, as including all employees required to work on such waters as part of their duties. <em>See, e.g., Nalco Chemical Corporation v. Shea, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>419 F.2d 572 (5th Cir. 1969). Thus, we will conclude, an employee injured on the waters in the course of his employment satisfies the 1972 revision\u2019s \u201cmaritime employment\u201d test, because employment on the water <em>is </em>\u201cmaritime employment\u201d within the meaning of the LHWCA both before and after its 1972 revision. It therefore satisfies (when injury occurs on the waters) the 1972 \u201cstatus\u201d test as well as the \u201csitus\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">We must note here, by way of limitation, that no pre-1972 LHWCA case that we could discover involved the coverage of a person whose employment took him merely transiently or fortuitously to a maritime locus where he was injured, where otherwise except for this isolated incident his employer\u2019s business was both land-based and unconnected with maritime-related employment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We express no opinion as to coverage of such a person, an issue not posed by the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">Before turning to the legislative purposes of the 1972 revision of the Act, we must note the approach established by the Supreme Court in its opinions. This approach to construction of the 1972 revision should, we think, guide judicial interpretation of the changes in the Act accomplished by that revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">With regard to the landward extension of coverage, the Court stated that the \u201clanguage of the 1972 Amendments is broad and suggests that we should take an expansive view of the extended coverage,\u201d <em>Capu-to, supra, </em>432 U.S. at 268, 97 S.Ct. at 2359, and that the decision to focus on the nature, not location of employment \u201calso serves the broader congressional purpose of expanding coverage. Congress intended to apply a simple, uniform standard of coverage.\u201d <em>Ford, supra, </em>444 U.S. at 83-84, 100 S.Ct. at 338. <em>Caputo </em>stressed that this \u201cremedial legislation \u2018must be liberally construed in conformance with its purpose, and in a way which avoids harsh and incongruous results.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The third post-1972 decision, <em>Sun Ship, supra </em>(to be discussed more fully in VI below), involved an attempt, similar to the present, to construe the expanded coverage provisions of the 1972 revision as likewise somehow having the effect of overruling interpretations of the 1927 Act that were beneficial to covered employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-10\">In rejecting the effort to deduce such an intent from the amendments (that were designed to <em>expand </em>coverage), the Court found to be significant, and indeed determinative, the absence in the legislative history of the slightest intimation of any intent to affect prior jurisprudential interpretations \u2022with respect to pre-existing coverage afforded by the Act to employees injured in waterfront and seaward accidents. 447 U.S. at 719-22, 100 S.Ct. 2436-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">II. <em>Legislative Purposes and History of 1972 Amendments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-12\">In 1972, the Congress amended the LHWCA of 1927, P.L. 92-576, 86 Stat. 1251, Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act Amendments of 1972. The expansion of coverage landward, and the consequent addition of the \u201cmaritime employment\u201d requirement, were merely part of this 1972 revision, described by <em>Caputo </em>as \u201cthe first significant effort to reform the 1927 Act and the judicial gloss that had been attached to it.\u201d 432 U.S. at 261, 97 S.Ct. at 2356. As there stated, <em>Id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>The main concern of the 1972 Amendments was not with the scope of coverage but with accommodating the desires of three interested groups: (1) shipowners who were discontented with the decisions allowing many maritime workers to use the doctrine of \u201cseaworthiness\u201d to recover full damages from shipowners regardless of fault; (2) employers of the longshoremen who, under another judicially created doctrine, could be required to indemnify shipowners and thereby lose the benefit of the intended exclusivity of the \u25a0 compensation remedy; and (3) workers who wanted to improve the benefit schedule deemed inadequate by all parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akr\">To achieve the first two of these objectives, the final enactment provided, inter alia, (1) that the liability of the vessel was limited to those injuries caused by negligence and \u201cshall not be based upon the warranty of seaworthiness,\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the employer [of the covered worker] shall not be liable to the vessel for such [damages caused by vessel negligence] directly or indirectly.\u201d Section 5(b), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b), as added by the 1972 amendments, P.L. 92-576, \u00a7 18.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">The legislation was enacted after committees of each House submitted full reports, each summarizing the general purposes of the legislation and containing a section by section analysis of the changes provided. Senate Report No. 92-1125, 92d Congress, 2d Session [hereinafter cited as \u201cS.Rep.,\u201d followed by page number]; House Report No. 92-1441, <em>reprinted </em>in [1972] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4698 [hereinafter cited as \u201cH.Rep.,\u201d with USCAN page number]. For instance, with regard to the section 905(b) changes, the reports specifically stated the intention to eliminate any unseaworthiness remedy against the vessel afforded longshoremen and other non-seamen working on board a vessel, and to eliminate any liability of their employer to the vessel for their own breach of duty contributing to the accident. S.Rep. at 2, 8-12, 25; H.Rep. at 4699, 4701-05, 4719. It is also of note that these legislative reports, in stating the reasons for the changes, specifically identify the Supreme Court decisions intended to be legislatively overruled, such as <em>Ryan Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., </em>350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956) and <em>Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, </em>328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">We now turn specifically to the 1972 legislative revision of section 2(3), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3), quoted at note 6, and of section 3(a), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a), quoted at note 5. The former, it will be recalled, added the \u201cmaritime employment,\u201d or status, requirement for employees to be covered by the Act; the latter broadened coverage shoreward, to shoreside areas adjacent to navigable waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">To accommodate the broadened shoreside situs, the former definition of \u201cemployer,\u201d section 2(4), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(4) was amended to broaden the definition of a maritime-employment employer. Before the 1972 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>amendment, such an employer was defined with reference only to whether some of his employees worked, \u201cin whole or in part, upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock).\u201d After the amendment, the employer was defined as including the employer of those in maritime employment who worked, in whole or in part, upon the expanded shoreside areas as well as upon the navigable waters. As will be shown, because before 1972 the employee\u2019s work upon the navigable waters had been the simple test of maritime employment (see III below), a change in the definition of an \u201cemployee,\u201d section 2(3) was required in order to affirmatively, define which employees in the expanded shoreside situs were now covered.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">These changes are interrelated. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Caputo, </em>whereas before the 1972 amendments, \u201cso long as the work-related injury occurred on navigable waters and the injured worker was not a member of a narrowly defined class,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the worker would be eligible for federal compensation provided that his or her employer had at least one employee engaged in maritime employment\u201d; however, \u201cwith the definition of \u2018navigable waters\u2019 expanded by the 1972 Amendments to include such a large geographical area, it became necessary to describe affirmatively the class of workers Congress desired to compensate.\u201d 432 U.S. at 264, 97 S.Ct. at 2357.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-14\">The reasons for the broadening of coverage to the shoreside areas by the section 3(a) amendment are well-documented in the legislative reports: \u201c[Cjoverage of the present Act stops at the water\u2019s edge; injuries on land are covered by State Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws. The result is a disparity in benefits payable for death or disability depending on which side of the water\u2019s edge and in which State the accident occurs. To make matters worse, most State Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws provide benefits which are inadequate. * * \u201d S.Rep. at 12.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In explaining the broaden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>ing of coverage to extend to shoreside areas adjacent to navigable waters, the report stated: \u201cThe Committee believes that the compensation payable to a longshoreman or a ship repairman or builder should not depend on the fortuitous circumstance of whether the injury occurred on land or over water. ... The intent of the Committee is to permit a uniform compensation system to apply to employees who would otherwise be covered by this Act for part of their activity.\u201d S.Rep. at 13. The House report sets forth identical views in substantially similar language. H.R. at 4707-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">The reason for the addition, by the 1972 amendment to section 2(3), of the \u201cmaritime employment\u201d (or \u201cstatus\u201d) requirement for coverage is not as explicit. Both legislative reports do state in identical language, in apparent reference to this change: \u201cThe Committee does not intend to cover employees who are not engaged in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel, just because they are injured in an area adjoining navigable waters used for such activity... . Likewise the Committee has no intention of <em>extending </em>coverage under the Act to individuals who are not employed by a person who is an employer, <em>i.e., </em>a person at least some of whose employees are engaged, in whole or in part in some form of maritime employment.\u201d S.Rep. at 13; H.Rep. at 4708 (emphasis supplied). Nevertheless, in the section by section analysis by which the legislative reports explain the reason for the changes, it becomes manifest in our opinion that the 1972 change in definition of an \u201cemployee,\u201d section 2(3), was not intended to withdraw coverage from those previously considered to be in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d for purposes of LHWCA coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">The 1972 revision originated as Senate Bill 2318. The Senate committee draft of an amended definition of \u201cemployee,\u201d section 2(3) of the Act, was enacted by both Houses without change. In explaining the change in definition, the Senate committee report specifically noted that the new definition <em>\u201cdoes not exclude other employees traditionally covered\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> S.Rep. at 16. The House committee report, although less explicit, states the new definition \u201cincludes any employee engaged in <em>maritime employment, </em>any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harborworker (including any ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker)\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\">These committee reports of legislative purpose thus do not reflect any intention to withdraw the Act\u2019s coverage from injuries to workmen, such as Boudreaux, injured on navigable waters in the course of employment with an employer at least some of whose employees worked in whole or in part on navigable waters. In particular, the legislative reports do not question or even refer to the holding of <em>Calbeck, supra, </em>that the Act\u2019s coverage extended to \u201call injuries sustained by employees on navigable waters,\u201d 370 U.S. at 124, 82 S.Ct. at 1202\u2014 \u201ca significant omission in light of the care which the [committee] reports took to identify Supreme Court cases to be overturned .. . . \u201d See <em>Sun Ship, Inc., supra, </em>447 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>U.S. at 722, 100 S.Ct. at 2437. It is fair to say, we think, that a reading of the legislative reports, both overall and with specific reference to the \u201cmaritime employment\u201d status test newly provided by the 1972 amendment to section 2(3), did not contemplate disturbing the previous <em>Calbeck </em>characterization of LHWCA-covered maritime employment as including amphibious workers injured on navigable waters.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">In 1962, <em>Calbeck </em>ended thirty-five years of confusing and unworkable judicial interpretations by its simple test that the Act covered all injuries on the navigable waters of employees whose employers employed one or more workers to labor on navigable waters. <em>See Sun Ship, supra, </em>447 U.S. at 718,100 S.Ct. at 2435. The 1972 legislative committee reports reflect no dissatisfaction with this rule, and it is not readily credible that the previous forty-five years of judicial interpretations culminating in <em>Calbeck </em>and its progeny were intended to be legislatively altered without any mention of this drastic change to restrict coverage of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">We are reenforced in this view, not only by the silence of the legislative reports as to such an intent, but by the consistent explanation for the new provisions as \u201can <em>extension </em>of coverage to shoreside areas,\u201d S.Rep. at 12, H.Rep. at 4707 (emphasis supplied). The Senate Report in its \u201cSummary\u201d of the proposed legislation identifies its remedial purposes as \u201cto upgrade benefits\u201d and to \u201cextend coverage to protect additional workers,\u201d S.Rep. at 1 (as well as to \u201cresolve the longstanding dispute over third-party actions by injured longshoremen\u201d by abolishing (see text at note 10) the unseaworthiness remedy and the vessel-indemnity against stevedores, S.Rep. at 2). The thrust of the summary is that the legislation was designed to broaden coverage and increase benefits.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We cannot find that <em>Calbeck\u2019s </em>well-accepted construction of the Act as covering injuries on navigable waters was silently overruled by a remedial statute designed to broaden coverage and \u201cframed out of solicitude for the workers.\u201d <em>Sun Ship, Inc., </em>447 U.S. at 726,100 S.Ct. at 2439. To do so, as the Court observed in a similar context, \u201cwould blunt the thrust of the 1972 amendments, and frustrate Congress\u2019 intent to aid injured maritime laborers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-11\">III. <em>Jurisprudential Context of 1972 Amendments to the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-13\">The jurisprudential context in which the 1972 amendments to the Act were enacted makes it plain that a person who suffered an injury that occurred on navigable waters, such as the present plaintiff Bou-dreaux, was considered to be in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d for purposes of the Act. The Court has quite recently summarized this jurisprudential context. <em>See Ford, supra, </em>444 U.S. at 73, 100 S.Ct. at 332, and <em>Sun </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number><em>Ship, Inc., supra, </em>447 U.S. at 718-19, 100 S.Ct. at 2435-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">As succinctly stated in <em>Ford, id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-5\">The pre-1972 Act was simply an effort to fill the gap in workmen\u2019s compensation coverage created by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, </em>244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086 (1917), which held that state compensation systems could not reach longshoremen injured seaward of the water\u2019s edge. A single situs requirement in \u00a7 3(a) of the Act governs the scope of its coverage. That requirement limited coverage to workers whose \u201cdisability or death resulted] from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock). . .. \u201d Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of 1927, ch. 509, \u00a7 3(a), 44 Stat. 1426. In light of <em>Jensen </em>and the limited purpose of the Act, the situs test was understood to draw a sharp line between injuries sustained over water and those suffered on land. Thus, in <em>Nacire-ma Operating Co. v. Johnson, </em>396 U.S. 212, 218-220, 90 S.Ct. 347, 351-352, 24 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969), this Court held that the Act did not extend to injuries occurring on a pier attached to the land. Although the Court recognized that inequities might result from rigid adherence to the <em>Jensen </em>line, the Court concluded that \u201c[t]he invitation to move that line landward must be addressed to Congress, not to this Court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>[396 U.S.,] at 224, 90 S.Ct. at 354.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-6\">. Congress responded with the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act Amendments of 1972 (1972 Act).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">The intermediate states of jurisprudential development of the coverage issue between <em>Jensen </em>and <em>Nacirema Operating Co. v. Johnson, supra, </em>are described in <em>Sun Ship, </em>447 U.S. at 718, 100 S.Ct. at 2435.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-8\">[T]he Court began to narrow the <em>Jensen </em>doctrine by identifying circumstances in which the subject of litigation might be maritime yet \u201clocal in character,\u201d and thus amenable to relief under state law. <em>Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, </em>257 U.S. 233, 42 S.Ct. 89, 66 L.Ed. 210 (1921); <em>Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, </em>257 U.S. 469, 42 S.Ct. 157, 66 L.Ed. 321 (1922). And, in 1927, Congress was finally successful in extending a measure of protection to marine workers excluded by <em>Jensen </em>by enacting a federal compensation law \u2014 the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-11\">Federal and state law were thus linked together to provide theoretically complete coverage for maritime laborers. But the boundary at which state remedies gave way to federal remedies was far from obvious in individual eases. As a result, the injured worker was compelled to make a jurisdictional guess before filing a claim; the price of error was unnecessary expense and possible foreclosure from the proper forum by statute of limitations. <em>Davis v. Department of Labor, </em>317 U.S. 249, 254, 63 S.Ct. 225, 228, 87 L.Ed. 246 (1942). After a decade and a half during which there had not been formulated \u201cany guiding, definite rule to determine the extent of state power in advance of litigation,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 253, 63 S.Ct., at 227, the Court determined that the border between federal and state compensation schemes was less a line than a \u201ctwilight zone,\u201d in which \u201cemployees must have their rights determined case by case ...\u201d <em>id., </em>at 256, 63 S.Ct., at 229. Within this zone, <em>Davis </em>effectively established a regime of concurrent jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-12\"><em>Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962), further overlapped federal and state law coverage for marine workers. <em>Calbeck </em>held that the LHWCA comprehended \u201call injuries sustained by employees on navigable waters,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 124, 82 S.Ct., at 1202, without regard to whether the locus of an event was \u201cmaritime but local,\u201d and hence within the scope of state compensations provisions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>Thus, as summarized by <em>Sun Ship, </em>447 U.S. at 719, 100 S.Ct. at 2486:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-5\">Before 1972, then, marine-related injuries fell within one of three jurisdictional spheres as they moved landward. At the furthest extreme, <em>Jensen </em>commanded that nonlocal maritime injuries fall under the LHWCA. \u201cMaritime but local\u201d injuries \u201cupon the navigable waters of the United States,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a), could be compensated under the LHWCA or under state law. And injuries suffered beyond navigable waters \u2014 albeit within the range of federal admiralty jurisdiction \u2014 were remediable only under state law. <em>Nacirema Co. v. Johnson, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqd-dedup-1\">That all employment-related injuries on navigable waters, including those that were characterized as \u201cmaritime but local,\u201d were considered to have been in maritime employment, can be seen not only from the decisions of the era, see, <em>e.g., Nalco Chemical Corporation v. Shea, supra, </em>419 F.2d at 574,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but also by considering that under the pre-1972 scheme of coverage (see note 11), as now, the Act applied only to employers whose employees were \u201cemployed in maritime employment, in whole or in part upon the navigable waters of the United States.\u201d Section 2(4) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(4). And aside from its statutory meaning for purposes of the LHWCA, the term \u201cmaritime employment\u201d includes even in a nontechnical, general sense, employment upon the navigable waters.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">Under the pre-1972 jurisprudence, thus, an injury in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d included, for purposes of the Act, all work injuries of amphibious workers on navigable water. Given this accepted pre-1972 meaning of the term for purposes of the Act, then within the intention of the 1972 amendments an amphibious worker injured on the navigable waters simultaneously meets both the \u201csitus\u201d and the \u201cstatus\u201d (occupational) tests. As earlier noted, the legislative purpose of adding the \u201cmaritime employment\u201d test was to limit the Act\u2019s coverage in the newly extended shoreside areas to those employees who were injured therein in the course of maritime-related employment. We can find no sign in the legislative history or purpose that the Congress intended by the 1972 amendments to change the prior well-accepted understanding that an injury on navigable waters was compensable as being in \u201cmaritime employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">IV. <em>Post-1972 Commentary and Jurisprudence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-11\">Following adoption of the 1972 amendments, the new \u201cmaritime employment\u201d status test has arisen for application in two situations. The bulk of the litigation concerns application of the test in the new extended shoreside application, as in <em>Caputo </em>(1977) and <em>Ford </em>(1979), which we have discussed at I above. A substantial minority of the decisions of the lower courts, however, attempted to apply a status test in some formulation to work-related injuries on navigable <em>waters </em>\u2014 i.e., to those considered as in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d prior to the 1972 revision \u2014 , although in all but three or four instances (only one from this circuit), coverage was nevertheless upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>Preliminarily, we note that the majority view of the commentators, including the highly respected Gilmore and Black, is that the amended Act does not exclude coverage from anyone who would have been covered under the original Act; and thus that any injury upon the navigable waters is still compensable.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This view has also had the consistent support of the director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, the administrative agency charged with enforcement of the LHWCA.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This court has held that the director\u2019s views are entitled to deference.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> These authorities rely primarily on the legislative history and the remedial purposes of the 1972 amendments in support of the proposition that the amended Act does not exclude anyone who would have been covered prior to 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">In the adjudicative context, at least prior to 1979, it appeared that this position would be widely accepted. It was adopted by the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d), the entity created by the 1972 amendments to hear administrative appeals of LHWCA coverage disputes.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Furthermore, this \u201cno exclusion of those traditionally covered\u201d doctrine was initially embraced by the courts in <em>St. Ju-lien v. Diamond M Drilling, </em>403 F.Supp. 1256 (E.D.La.1975), and <em>Fusco </em>v. <em>Perini North River Associates, </em>601 F.2d 659 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>vacated, </em>444 U.S. 1028, 100 S.Ct. 697, 62 L.Ed.2d 664 (1980) <em>(\u201cFusco I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">The first decision to take a more restrictive view of the LHWCA coverage of injuries on the actual water was <em>Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Gilmore, </em>528 F.2d 957 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 868, 97 S.Ct. 179, 50 L.Ed.2d 148 (1976). <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>rejected the BRB\u2019s construction of the 1972 amendments as not affecting the pre-1972 construction of maritime employment that included all work-injuries on the water. Instead, the Ninth Circuit held that the term \u201cmaritime employment\u201d means that the employment \u201cmust have a realistically significant relationship to \u2018traditional maritime activity involving navigation and commerce on navigable waters.\u2019 \u201d 528 F.2d at 961 (a test it educed from <em>Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. v. City of Cleveland, </em>409 U.S. 249, 93 S.Ct. 493, 34 L.Ed.2d 454 (1972) \u2014 a decision we find inapposite for this purpose, for reasons to be stated in V below). Thus, under the <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>test, some employees whose injuries would have been covered under the pre-1972 Act would not be entitled to LHWCA coverage. The <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>court relegated <em>Calbeck </em>and the other pre-1972 decisions \u201cto limbo,\u201d based on the conclusion that the 1972 amendments \u201cradically changed the basis for an employee\u2019s entitlement to federal compensation.\u201d 528 F.2d at 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">In recent years, the more restrictive Wey-erhaeuser test has been accepted, or at least given lip service, by many courts, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>this court. Ironically, the case that proved to be the catalyst for the widespread acceptance of the restrictive <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>view regarding accidents upon the actual water was the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ford, supra, </em>a case that actually <em>expanded </em>LHWCA shore-side coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Subsequent to <em>Ford, </em>over the dissent of three justices, the Supreme Court vacated and remanded the Second Circuit\u2019s <em>Fusco I </em>decision for reconsideration in light of <em>Ford. Perini North River Associates v. Fusco, </em>444 U.S. 1028, 100 S.Ct. 697, 62 L.Ed.2d 664 (1980). On remand, despite the fact that <em>Ford </em>took a very expansive view of LHWCA coverage, and despite the fact that <em>Ford </em>did not so much as mention the Weyerhaeuser \u201csignificant relationship to navigation or commerce on navigable waters\u201d test for determining \u201cmaritime employment,\u201d the Second Circuit found that <em>Ford </em>had \u201crendered untenable\u201d its holding in <em>Fusco I. </em>Noting <em>Ford\u2019s </em>conclusion that the term \u201cmaritime employment\u201d is an occupational concept, based on the nature of a worker\u2019s activities, the Second Circuit read <em>Ford </em>\u201cas precluding any application of the LHWCA as amended in 1972, to an employee whose activities do not bear a significant relationship to navigation or to commerce on navigable waters.\u201d <em>Fusco v. Perini North River Associates, </em>622 F.2d 1111, 1112-13 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. </em>denied<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> 449 U.S. 1131, 101 S.Ct. 953, 67 L.Ed.2d 119 (1981) <em>(\u201cFusco II\u201d). </em>The <em>Fusco II </em>court noted that such a reading was consistent with the construction of the term \u201cmaritime employment\u201d given by the <em>Weyer-haeuser </em>court, and with the position of the BRB, which, after having been reversed by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Weyerhaeuser, </em>had overruled its previous decisions that had held that the 1972 amendments did not in any way reduce the traditional coverage of the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-11\">Since 1979, the <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>\u2014 Fusco <em>II </em>\u201crealistically significant relationship to traditional maritime activity\u201d test for determining whether an individual was engaged in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d has frequently been employed by the courts, in eases involving accidents both on the seaward and shoreward sides of the <em>Jensen </em>line. In this circuit, the <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>test has been cited approvingly in several decisions of the court, in cases involving accidents both on the land and the water;<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> nevertheless, LHWCA coverage was found in all of the cases.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As might be expected from application of a test that requires determination case-by-case under the specialized facts of each instance, the <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>test \u2014 even though recovery has ultimately been upheld \u2014 has produced sharp disagreement as to whether under particular facts the on-water employment indeed had the talismanic \u201csignificant relationship.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>It is of some significance to note that, despite the sometimes cumbersome methodology involved in the disputable borderline case-by-case application of the <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>\u201csignificant relationship\u201d test, actually in only three decisions was coverage denied by it to a workman injured waterward of the <em>Jensen </em>line who would apparently have been covered by the pre-1972 Act under <em>Calbeck: Weyerhaeuser </em>itself, by the Ninth Circuit; <em>Fusco II </em>(but see note 25) by the Second; and, adhering to <em>Fusco II, Churchill v. Perini North River Associates, </em>652 F.2d 255 (2d Cir. 1981), <em>cert. </em>granted,U. S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1425, 71 L.Ed.2d 647 (1982). (Also, although not employing the <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>rationale, one decision of this court denied coverage for an on-water accident of an oil field worker, who presumably would have been covered under <em>Calbeck, </em>on a basis subsequently disapproved by <em>Ford </em>and subsequent decisions of this circuit. <em>Thibodaux v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>580 F.2d 841 (5th Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">V. <em>Distinction Between Shoreside and On-Water Injuries Insofar as Being in \u201cMaritime Employment\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">We have found no legislative intent to alter the previously accepted construction of the Act as considering employment on the navigable waters to be \u201cmaritime employment.\u201d See II and III above. For employees injured in the course of such employment, no further examination into the relationship of their employment activities to \u201c \u2018traditional maritime activity involving navigation and commerce on navigable waters,\u2019 \u201d <em>Weyerhaeuser supra, </em>528 F.2d at 961, is necessary, because by settled construction of the Act their duties necessarily constitute such maritime activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-11\">However, as we noted, <em>see </em>text <em>supra </em>at note 11, the 1972 expansion of situs to include shoreside areas required a different change both in the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d to include those within the expanded situs and also in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d so as to exclude those employees injured in the expanded shoreside situs who were not engaged in maritime-related employment. As the legislative committee reports stated, the 1972 revision to include shoreside areas was not intended to cover employees \u201cjust because they are injured in an area adjoining navigable waters\u201d or who were <em>not </em>\u201cengaged, in whole or in part in some form of maritime employment.\u201d S.Rep. at 13; H.Rep. at 4708.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>To delineate only those shoreside employees who were legislatively intended to be included within the coverage of the Act, the <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>or an equivalent maritime-relationship test may indeed be appropriate.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">Where we part company with Weyer-haeuser is in its application of such a test to those injured while working on navigable waters, construed for LHWCA purposes as being in maritime employment since <em>Cal-beck. </em>As earlier noted, to restrict this accepted statutory construction is to do so in the complete absence of any intent expressed in the legislative history to do so and, in fact, in the face of express statement by the legislative drafters that the new 1972 definition of employee afforded by the amended section 2(3) \u201cdoes not exclude other employees traditionally covered.\u201d S.Rep. at 16. See II above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\"><em>Weyerhaeuser </em>derived its \u201csignificant relationship\u201d test for coverage, 528 F.2d at 961, by direct quotation from <em>Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. v. City of Cleveland, </em>409 U.S. 249, 93 S.Ct. 493, 34 L.Ed.2d 454 (1972). That decision is inapposite to the issue now before us. The sole issue in <em>Executive Jet </em>was whether there was federal jurisdiction over a suit for damages resulting from an airplane crash into navigable waters, and there the assertion of jurisdiction was based solely upon the provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1) granting federal district courts jurisdiction of \u201c[a]ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.\u201d The Court emphasized that in flights between points in the continental United States, \u201cwhich are principally over land, the fact that an aircraft happens to fall in navigable waters, rather than on land, is wholly fortuitous.\u201d 409 U.S. at 266, 93 S.Ct. at 503. The Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-10\">the mere fact that the alleged wrong \u201coccurs\u201d or \u201cis located on\u201d or over navigable waters ... is not of itself sufficient to turn an airplane negligence case into a \u201cmaritime tort.\u201d It is far more consistent with the history and purpose of admiralty to require also that the wrong bear a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity. We hold that unless such a relationship exists, claims arising from airplane accidents are not cognizable in admiralty in the absence of legislation to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">409 U.S. at 2681, 93 S.Ct. at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-12\"><em>Executive Jet </em>is thus entirely inapposite to the issues before us. Although the issue there and here each involved a determination of legislative intent in the utilization of the term \u201cmaritime,\u201d two entirely different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>statutes are concerned, each with different legislative histories and jurisprudential interpretations over the course of decades.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Unlike <em>Executive Jet, </em>which involved no specific legislation addressed to the issue, here the LHWCA both in its 1927 enactment and its 1972 revision provided for coverage of injuries in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d occurring \u201cupon the navigable waters of the United States,\u201d which the Court in <em>Calbeck </em>had interpreted to include all injuries in the course of employment upon the navigable waters. Finally, marine petroleum workers are not \u201cfortuitously\u201d located on the water, but are required to work there by the nature of their jobs, a substantial maritime relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">VI. <em>No Intention to Reduce Prior Coverage of On-Water Injuries: The Contribution of </em>Sun Ship</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">The rationale in <em>Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, supra, </em>supports our conclusion that the legislative history of the 1972 amendments reflects no intention to disturb the prior <em>Calbeck </em>interpretation of the Act that work-injuries on navigable waters were incurred in maritime employment for purposes of the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">The issue in <em>Sun Ship </em>was whether the shoreside extension of the Act\u2019s federal compensation coverage displaced <em>state </em>workers\u2019 compensation laws applicable to those on-land injuries, a concurrent <em>state </em>compensation remedy available under pre-1972 LHWCA interpretations to workingmen injured in \u201cmaritime but local\u201d activities. The issue is the obverse of the present, which is: did the 1972 revisions reflect any intent to remove a <em>federal </em>compensation remedy formerly available to those amphibious workmen injured while working on navigable waters? Nevertheless, the issue is generically similar; as <em>Sun Ship </em>recounted, 447 U.S. 718-19, 100 S.Ct. at 2435-36 (quoted in III above), both the concurrent state-federal remedy for \u201cmaritime but local\u201d workers, as well as the <em>Calbeck </em>holding that the LHWCA comprehended \u201call injuries sustained by employees on navigable waters,\u201d 370 U.S. at 124, 82 S.Ct. at 1202, resulted after years of tortuous litigation attempting to solve the same problem:</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">Under the \u201cmaritime but local\u201d doctrine, a state, instead of a federal, remedy was accorded a workman injured on navigable waters, if neither his general employment nor his activities at the time of the accident \u201chad any direct relationship to navigation or commerce.\u201d <em>Grant Smith-Porter Co. v. Rohde, </em>257 U.S. 469, 475-76, 42 S.Ct. 157, 158, 66 L.Ed. 321 (1922). However, the state remedy would be disallowed \u2014 and the federal remedy was exclusive \u2014 if the Court found that the employment was \u201cnot [a] matter of purely local concern,\u201d but instead had \u201cdirect relation to commerce and navigation.\u201d <em>Northern Coal &amp; Dock Co. v. Strand, </em>278 U.S. 142, 144, 49 S.Ct. 88, 89, 73 L.Ed. 232 (1928). <em>Sun Ship </em>describes the uncertainties, hardships, and requirement for litigation by \u201cjurisdictional guess,\u201d 447 U.S. at 718, 100 S.Ct. at 2435, that resulted from the necessity on a case by case basis to determine whether an amphibious worker\u2019s employment had sufficient \u201cdirect relation to commerce and navigation\u201d so as to be compensable under the federal or the state remedies respectively. To solve this identical problem, concurrent state and federal remedies were recognized for \u201cmaritime but local\u201d land-based employees <em>(Davis, supra, </em>discussed in III), while <em>Calbeck </em>held that all work-injuries on the navigable waters were compensable under the LHWCA \u201cwithout regard to whether the locus of an event was \u2018maritime but local,\u2019 and hence within the scope of state compensation provisions.\u201d <em>Sun Ship, </em>447 U.S. at 718,100 S.Ct. at 2435.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number><em>Sun Ship </em>examined the legislative history and reports of the same 1972 amendments as are at issue before us. 447 U.S. at 719-725, 100 S.Ct. at 2436-39. Citing the complete absence of any reflected intent to abrogate the doctrines of <em>Davis </em>and <em>Cal-beck, </em>the Court held that the 1972 amendments could not fairly be understood as \u201cresurrecting the jurisdictional monstrosity that existed before the clarifying opinions in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Calbeck,\u201d </em>447 U.S. at 719, 100 S.Ct. at 2436. The Court also noted that so to adopt the appellant\u2019s position \u201cwould thrust employees into the same jurisdictional peril from which they were rescued by <em>Davis </em>and <em>Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co.\u201d </em>447 U.S. at 725, 100 S.Ct. at 2439 \u2014 a result that \u201cwould blunt the thrust of the 1972 amendments, and frustrate Congress\u2019 intent to aid injured maritime workers\u201d through this \u201cremedial\u201d legislation enacted \u201cout of solicitude for the workers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">The issue in <em>Sun Ship </em>related to whether the pre-1972 concurrent state-federal remedy recognized by <em>Davis </em>had been diminished by the 1972 amendments. Nevertheless, <em>Sun Ship\u2019s </em>reasoning, it seems to us, equally applies as to the generically similar issue before us, <em>i.e., </em>whether these same amendments have diminished <em>CalbecWs </em>pre-1972 recognition of all work-injuries on navigable waters as being in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d for purposes of the Act \u2014 an interpretation complementary to the concurrent-remedy interpretation of the Act accorded by <em>Davis, </em>equally based upon the identical reasons of effectuating the certain and efficient administration of the compensation remedy afforded by Congress to amphibious workers by the Act.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">We, similarly to <em>Sun Ship, </em>can find no legislative intent expressed in the legislative history to override <em>Calbeclds </em>interpretation that injuries sustained at work on navigable waters were sustained in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d within the meaning of the Act; in fact, the legislative history here indicates the contrary. See II above. We note that attempting to determine case by case whether an on-water injury occurs in an employment with a \u201crealistically significant relationship to traditional maritime activity involving navigation and commerce on navigable waters,\u201d as enunciated by <em>Weyerhaeuser, supra, </em>involves the same difficulties and disagreements in determinations <em>(see, e.g., </em>note 28), as did the unworkable case by case determination in the \u201cmaritime but local\u201d test of whether the employment had a \u201cdirect relationship to navigation or commerce,\u201d <em>see Grant Smith-Porter v. Rohde, supra, </em>that was rejected by <em>Davis </em>and <em>Calbeck.. </em>No more than was the Court in <em>Sun Ship, </em>are we willing to believe that in its 1972 remedial revisions the Congress intended \u2014 without the slightest sign of any intent to do so \u2014 to resurrect the \u201cjurisdictional monstrosity\u201d created by such a test of indeterminate content, terminated fully by the clarifying interpretations of <em>Davis </em>(1942) and <em>Calbeck </em>(1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">One final note. We must be mindful that a primary intent of the 1972 amendments was not only remedial as to injured work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>ers, by increasing their benefits and by extending coverage landward. Another principal purpose was to free maritime employers of indemnity claims by vessels on which their employees were injured, and thus to assure that an employer\u2019s compensation liability under the Act \u201cshall be exclusive and in place of all other liability\u201d for an employment-related injury, section 905(a), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a). See text at notes 9 and 10 above. The express legislative intent was to immunize employers of amphibious workers injured on a vessel from indemnity claims, such as that herein asserted by the vessel-defendant by third-party demand against the plaintiff Bou-dreaux\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">If we here determine that Boudreaux was not in \u201cmaritime employment\u201d at the time of his injury on navigable waters, his employer is exposed to the vessel\u2019s indemnity action, <em>see Miller v. Central Dispatch, Inc., supra, </em>673 F.2d at 784, despite the undoubted and express intent reflected by the legislative reports and statutory language to exempt all maritime employers from such a claim. The legislative history reveals not the slightest intention other than that this freedom from indemnity claim granted by the 1972 amendments was intended to benefit all employers of amphibious workers injured on vessels, such as Boudreaux\u2019s employer in the present instance. To withdraw coverage from Bou-dreaux and other amphibious workers injured on navigable waters is to expand their employers \u2019 exposure to such indemnity claims, as well as to vexatious suits on a case-by-case basis (including those based on unseaworthiness), using indefinite criteria to determine whether the employee\u2019s injuries were or were not covered by the Act. As we stated in this context in <em>Miller, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-5\">This result would run contrary to the clear Congressional intent under the 1972 amendments to include maritime workers under the Act in exchange for eliminating the right to sue for unseaworthiness. <em>Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, </em>447 U.S. at 724, 100 S.Ct. at 2438, 65 L.Ed.2d at 466. The LHWCA is to be liberally construed and in such a way as to avoid the jurisdictional dilemma which existed pri- or to the 1972 amendments. <em>See Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, </em>447 U.S. at 719-21, 725-26, 100 S.Ct. at 2436-37,-2439, 65 L.Ed.2d at 462-64, 466-67.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">673 F.2d at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">VII. <em>Coverage Afforded Even Under the Weyerhaeuser Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">We further note that coverage of the Act is here afforded even under the <em>Weyerhaeu-ser test- </em>\u2014 i.e., that, even though the injury is sustained on the navigable waters, for an injured employee\u2019s work-activity to be considered within the coverage of the Act as \u201cmaritime employment,\u201d the employment activities must have a realistically significant relationship to traditional maritime activity relating to navigation or commerce on navigable waters. This is the conclusion reached by the panel decision herein, 664 F.2d at 464-66 (Part I), relying upon a holding under similar facts in <em>Pippen v. Shell Oil Co., </em>661 F.2d 378 (5th Cir. 1981). In both of these decisions, oil-production specialty workers were injured at work on movable drilling barges (\u201cvessels\u201d). The situs test was unquestionably met, and the issue was whether these employees met the status or \u201cmaritime employment\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-10\">The substance of the reasoning in these decisions is set forth at <em>Pippen, </em>661 F.2d at 383-84:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-11\">In the instant case, plaintiff Pippen was a wireline operator. At the time of his injury he was preparing to set packers for perforation. The function of the vessel on which Pippen was working was to drill gas wells; consequently, Pippen\u2019s work was essential to the function of the vessel. More importantly, Pippen\u2019s job was necessary to the completion of the offshore drilling process. As discussed above, to determine whether the status test is satisfied, it is necessary to examine the nature and purpose of the employee\u2019s activities and to determine whether those activities had a realistically significant relationship to maritime navigation or commerce. The \u201csignificant relationship\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>requirement can be met when the purpose of the employee\u2019s activities is to facilitate maritime commerce. Since offshore drilling \u2014 the discovery, recovery, and sale of oil and natural gas from the sea bottom \u2014 is maritime commerce, it follows that the purpose of Pippen\u2019s work was to facilitate maritime commerce. Since the purpose of Pippen\u2019s work was to enable the vessel to perform its designated task \u2014 offshore drilling \u2014 and since the work was, in addition, directed at facilitating maritime commerce, we are compelled to conclude that the work performed by Pippen had a realistically significant relationship to maritime commerce. Thus, Pippen was engaged in maritime employment at the time of his injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">Or, as summarized by the panel majority in <em>Boudreaux, </em>664 F.2d at 466:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-6\">The ruling in <em>Pippen </em>is dispositive of the present issue. In the case before us, Boudreaux (like Pippen) was injured on navigable waters while performing wire-lining employment duties that were an integral or essential contribution to the mineral-production function of the vessel upon which he was working. The work performed thus \u201chas a realistically significant connection to traditional maritime activity\u201d, <em>Pippen, supra, </em>661 F.2d at 385, so as to be \u201cmaritime employment\u201d within the coverage of the LHWCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">The jurisprudential expressions upon which these conclusions are reached are fully set forth by the cited opinions. We see no need to reiterate them here. Suffice it to say, they fully support the holdings in these cases that the injured employees involved met the \u201csignificant relationship\u201d test of maritime employment enunciated by these decisions, and that therefore their injuries were within the coverage of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\">Some suggestion is made that contemporaneous 1972 legislative action (or rather inaction) indicates that Congress did not consider maritime oil-production workers to be covered by the Act, as amended in 1972. Reliance is placed upon Congress\u2019s failure, after consideration, to enact the \u201cTower bill\u201d, the \u201cMarine Petroleum Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of 1971\u201d.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> However, assuming legislative intent could be deduced from Congress\u2019s failure to enact related legislation, no such inference could be drawn here. The Tower bill was intended to extend LHWCA coverage to <em>all </em>marine petroleum extractive workers; its primary purpose, however, was to relegate to the LHWCA compensation remedy those oil workers assigned as \u201cmembers of the crew\u201d to movable barges and thus entitled to the greater damages afforded by the Jones Act, see <em>Offshore Company v. Robison, </em>266 F.2d 769 (5th Cir. 1959)<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As the Senate committee hearings show, it was. conceded by both industry and labor witnesses that non-crew offshore oil workers were then entitled to LHWCA benefits if injured on navigable waters, or on fixed platforms on the outer continental shelf, and the effort of the bill was only to extend a similar coverage to oil-worker \u201ccrew\u201d members on movable barges and to deny them the more generous Jones Act seaman remedy.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> If any inference as to Congressional intent is permissible from the circumstances surrounding non-enactment of the Tower bill, it is that Congress felt that no new legislation was required to afford LHWCA coverage to non-crew oil-workers injured on navigable waters, and that it did not wish to deprive \u201ccrew\u201d oil-workers of their more lucrative Jones Act recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">For the reasons above stated, we conclude that the 1972 LHWCA amendments did not in any way diminish the traditional coverage of workers injured at work on navigable waters, who under the Act have been and are considered to be in \u201cmaritime employment.\u201d Even were it required that the duties of a \u201cmaritime employee\u201d require a \u201csignificant relationship to maritime commerce or navigation\u201d, the plaintiff Bou-dreaux is nevertheless within the coverage of the LHWCA, because persons in the marine petroleum business who work on drilling vessels in navigable waters are engaged in employment significantly related to maritime navigation and commerce. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court, which held that the third-party defendant (Boudreaux\u2019s employer) was exempted from indemnifying the vessel party (defendant in Boudreaux\u2019s suit, and third-party plaintiffs herein) by statutory provisions according this defense to employers covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">. We further note (see part VII of this opinion) that the present injury is covered under the amended Act even under the test of \u201cmaritime employment\u201d adopted by some post-1972 decisions that, even though the injury occurs on navigable waters, the duties of the employment in which injured must have a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity. See, <em>e.g., Weyerhaeuser v. Gilmore, </em>528 F.2d 957, 961 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 868, 97 S.Ct. 179, 50 L.Ed.2d 148 (1976). Coverage of the Act on this basis was upheld by the panel majority in the present appeal and, under similar facts, by another panel of this court in <em>Pippen v. Shell Oil Co., </em>661 F.2d 378 (5th Cir. 1981).

Agreements between steve-doring companies and vessels to indemnify the latter are prohibited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-17\">(The omitted paragraphs deal with upward revision of the benefit structure and with administrative changes.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">.

American Workover, Inc., </em>664 F.2d 463, 469-80 (5th Cir. 1981). Judge Tate\u2019s opinion for the en banc court is sufficiently similar to his for the panel that I see small occasion to repeat here what I said there. Since then, moreover, on February 22,1982, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in <em>Churchill v. Perini North River Associates, </em>652 F.2d 255 (2d Cir. 1981), <em>cert, granted sub nom. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Perini North River </em>Associates,-U.S.-, 102 S.Ct. 1425, 71 L.Ed.2d 647 (1982). The issue there is the same as here, and since it is now to be decided by the high Court, I see little need for us to debate it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">Simply stated, it is whether there are to be different \u201cstatus\u201d requirements for LHWCA coverage according to the \u201csitus\u201d of the injury. As all acknowledge and none disputes, the Supreme Court held, in <em>P. C. Pfeiffer Co. v. Ford, Mi </em>U.S. 69, 100 S.Ct. 328, 62 L.Ed.2d 225 (1979), that after the 1972 revision of the LHWCA a dual test governs coverage: situs (injury on navigable waters or their recently included adjoining areas) <em>and </em>status (work in maritime employment). According to the majority opinion above, whenever a worker is injured on navigable waters themselves, both the status and the situs requirements of <em>Pfeif-fer </em>are ipso facto satisfied. This is to say that any work whatever, no matter how landside in nature, becomes \u201cmaritime employment\u201d if performed at a location actually <em>on </em>such waters and that the status test of <em>Pfeiffer </em>is therefore to be applied to exclude coverage as nonmaritime only on the newly included adjoining areas \u2014 piers, wharfs, and so on. Thus by semantic legerdemain the dual test of <em>Pfeiffer </em>is effectively cabined in application to the narrow fringe of \u201cadjoining areas\u201d added by the 1972 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">So to hold, in my view, is largely to reverse the principles laid down in <em>Pfeiffer </em>by the Supreme Court \u2014 a bold stroke indeed. In so holding, we stand alone among the major maritime circuits. But for us, each of these, to one degree of clarity or another, has held that \u201cstatus\u201d requires for coverage that the work being done at the time of injury be of a nature traditionally maritime and bear some significant relationship to navigation and commerce on navigable waters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>To me, therefore, the weight of authority \u2014 as represented by the opinions of our sister circuits \u2014 and the dictates of reason\u2014 as I have sought to show in the panel dissent cited above \u2014 are to the contrary of the majority\u2019s decision today.
