During a two-day bifurcated jury trial conducted in the Circuit Court of Fauquier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>County, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence during the guilt-determination phase showed that on the afternoon of January 7, 1997, Fishback, armed with a handgun, robbed an employee of a convenience store and unlawfully detained two store employees and a customer with intent to deprive them of their personal liberty. Based upon the evidence, the jury convicted Fishback of all eight felony offenses charged in the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">During the penalty-determination phase, Fishback\u2019s counsel proffered jury instruction \u201cNo. S\u201d stating that \u201cthere is no parole in Virginia.\u201d The trial court inquired whether counsel had \u201cauthority for that instruction?\u201d Counsel replied that she did not have authority for this instruction, but asserted that it \u201cis just the current state of the law now.\u201d The trial court ruled that \u201c[i]t is not an approved instruction,\u201d refused to give it to the jury, and noted counsel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The trial court then addressed instruction \u201cNo. T\u201d proffered by Fishback\u2019s counsel which directed the jury to \u201cassume that [the defendant] will actually serve all of the jail or prison time you find to be an appropriate sentence and you are not otherwise to concern yourselves with what may happen afterwards.\u201d The trial court again inquired whether counsel had authority for this instruction. She replied that she had \u201cprepared this instruction knowing that many times a jury returns with questions about the amount of time a person will serve and probation and things of that nature. That is what this instruction was designed by me to address.\u201d The trial court refused the instruction, but noted that \u201c[i]f the jury sends a question . . . about. . . probation or parole or how much time [Fishback] is going to serve . . . then I will deal with that issue should it arise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">During its deliberations on sentencing, the jury sent a note to the trial court, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">\n<em>Question:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">1. Will these terms run</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">Consecutively?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">Concurrently?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">2. Can the sentence be reduced by the judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-13\">3. Can he qualify for parole</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-14\">Robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-15\">Abduction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-16\">Firearms?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>After a brief discussion of the questions with both counsel, the trial court indicated that it would \u201cpropose giving the model \u00a1jury] instruction\u201d the Commonwealth had prepared. This instruction stated that \u201c[h]aving found [Fishback] guilty, you should impose such punishment as you feel is just under the evidence and within the instructions of the Court. You are not to concern yourselves with what may happen afterwards.\u201d Fishback\u2019s counsel did not object to this instruction or renew her request that the trial court instruct the jury that parole had been abolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">After further deliberations, the jury returned verdicts sentencing Fishback to terms of imprisonment of thirty years for robbery, seven years for each of the abductions, and a total of eighteen years for the firearm offenses. Following receipt of a pre-sentence report, the trial court imposed the jury\u2019s sentences to run consecutively, but suspended fifty-one years of the sentences on condition that Fishback serve ten years probation following his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Fishback filed a petition for appeal in the Court of Appeals asserting issues related to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove abduction and the firearm offenses predicated on abduction, the denial of a suppression motion, the refusal of an instruction defining abduction, and the refusal of the instruction concerning the abolition of parole. By order dated November 13, 1998, the Court of Appeals awarded an appeal for the first four of these issues, but denied an appeal on the parole issue. In that order, the Court of Appeals, quoting from <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>26 Va. App. 415, 417, 494 S.E.2d 898, 899 (1998), noted that it had previously held that \u201ca trial court is not required to instruct the jury on a defendant\u2019s eligibility for parole in non-capital cases.\u201d After oral argument on the issues for which an appeal had been awarded, the Court of Appeals affirmed Fishback\u2019s convictions in an unpublished opinion. <em>Fishback </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 1377-98-4 (June 15, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Fishback filed a petition for appeal in this Court reasserting the issues reviewed by the Court of Appeals in its order and opinion. We awarded Fishback an appeal limited to the issue of whether the trial court \u201cerred in refusing appellant\u2019s proffered penalty phase instruction that parole has been abolished in Virginia.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In <em>Yarbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 347, 519 S.E.2d 602 (1999), we noted that the abolition of parole pursuant to Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1 and the exclusion of prisoners serving life sentences for class one felonies from being eligible for geriatric release pursuant to Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01 rendered a defendant convicted of capital murder parole-ineligible. <em>See id. </em>at 368 n.7, 519 S.E.2d at 612 n.7. Reviewing the rule, first stated in <em>Coward </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 639, 646, 178 S.E. 797, 799 (1935), that a jury should not be instructed upon the possibility of parole, we held that \u201c[t]he <em>Coward </em>rule simply does not address [the] unique situation\u201d in which a jury must elect between a death sentence and a sentence of life without possibility of parole. <em>Yarbrough, </em>258 Va. at 372, 519 S.E.2d at 615. Accordingly, we further held that a defendant convicted of capital murder was entitled to an instruction that he would be parole-ineligible if sentenced to life imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 374, 519 S.E.2d at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In rendering our decision in <em>Yarbrough, </em>we recognized \u201cthat the limitations placed upon the availability of parole by Code \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-40.01 and 53.1-165.1 may call into question the continued viability of the <em>Coward </em>rule in a non-capital felony case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373, 519 S.E.2d at 615. However, we emphasized that our decision in <em>Yarbrough </em>was \u201climited to the effect of Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1 on capital murder prosecutions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, this appeal presents the first opportunity since that decision for this Court to examine the effect of the statutory abolition of parole on the <em>Coward </em>rule in non-capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Our decision in <em>Yarbrough </em>is not dispositive of the issue presented in this case. This is so because a defendant convicted of a non-capital felony committed after the effective date of Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1, while no longer eligible for parole, may nonetheless be eligible for geriatric release, Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01, and may also qualify for a reduction in sentence through an earned sentence credit calculation, Code \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-202.2 <em>et seq., </em>commonly referred to as a \u201cgood behavior credit.\u201d Although neither of these provisions is defined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u201cparole\u201d in the Code, they are nonetheless respectively a form of early release and a form of sentence reduction available to a prisoner under the administration of the executive branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Discussing the policy underlying the <em>Coward </em>rule, we have noted that \u201c[u]nder our system, the assessment of punishment is a function of the judicial branch of government, while the administration of such punishment is a responsibility of the executive department. The aim of the rule followed in Virginia is to preserve, as effectively as possible, the separation of those functions during the process when the jury is fixing the penalty, in full recognition of the fact that the average juror is aware that some type of further consideration will usually be given to the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Hinton v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 492, 496, 247 S.E.2d 704, 706 (1978). Accordingly, unlike the unique circumstances of the sentencing decision to be made by a jury in a capital murder trial, where the executive branch will have no discretion to reduce a life sentence through parole or geriatric release, it would be inaccurate to inform a jury that a defendant convicted of a lesser felony would not be eligible for early release in every instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">One of the conundrums created by the interaction of Code \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-40.01, 53.1-165.1, and 53.1-202.2 <em>et seq. </em>is that, depending on the length of the sentences imposed and the age of the defendants, some persons convicted of non-capital felonies will not be eligible for any form of early release, while others may be able to benefit from geriatric release, good behavior credits, or both. Moreover, it is apparent on the record of this case, and of countless others reviewed by this Court and the Court of Appeals, <em>see, e.g., Clagett v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 79, 94, 472 S.E.2d 263, 272 (1996); <em>Mosby </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>24 Va. App. 284, 287, 482 S.E.2d 72, 73 (1997), that juries frequently have no comprehension of the current state of parole eligibility in this Commonwealth, but remain concerned that their sentencing decisions will be subjected to extensive reductions by executive action. <em>See, e.g., Yarbrough, </em>258 Va. at 358, 519 S.E.2d at 607 (jury question to the trial court asking whether a life sentence meant \u201cyour entire life or does it have a certain limit such as 12 years?\u201d). For these reasons and in light of the significant limitations which are now placed on the executive branch in modifying the sentences imposed on defendants by the judicial branch as the result of the enactment of Code \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-40.01, 53.1-165.1, and 53.1-202.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>et seq. </em>it is not merely appropriate, but requisite, that we reconsider the policy underlying the <em>Coward </em>rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We begin that reconsideration with the acknowledgement that while \u201ctruth in sentencing\u201d is a goal to be desired in the judicial process, it is necessarily an elusive one when a jury has the responsibility to fix punishment. This is so, in part, because under our system, as we noted in <em>Hinton, </em>the assessment of punishment against a defendant and the subsequent administration of that punishment are separate functions of the judicial and executive branches of government respectively. However, the specific reason is that after imposition of the jury\u2019s punishment, the conduct of the defendant will control the length of that punishment to a significant degree. In short, there can be no guarantee that a defendant will earn some form of statutorily permitted early release from the punishment fixed by the jury and yet the jury may attempt to factor some form of anticipated early release into its determination of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Nevertheless, to perform its responsibility a jury is required to consider a broad range of punishment in terms of years of confinement statutorily established by the legislature. Pertinent to the present case, for example, Code \u00a7 18.2-58 provides for a range of punishment between a term of life to any term not less than five years for robbery, and a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-47 is a Class 5 felony punishable by a term of not less than one year nor more than ten years for abduction. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-10(e). However, within the permissible range of punishment a jury is required to determine a specific term of confinement that it considers to be an appropriate punishment under all the circumstances revealed by the evidence in the case. A jury should not be required to perform this critical and difficult responsibility without the benefit of all significant and appropriate information that would avoid the necessity that it speculate or act upon misconceptions concerning the effect of its decision. Surely a properly informed jury ensures a fair trial both to the defendant and the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The question then becomes how a jury is to be instructed so that it is properly informed and can render a fair trial to both parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>while preserving, as effectively as possible, the separation of the functions of assessing punishment and administering it. With regard to the issue of parole, the answer lies primarily in the enactment of Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1 which, in pertinent part, provides that \u201c[a]ny person sentenced to a term of incarceration for a felony offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, shall not be eligible for parole upon that offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1 is clear and, as to those offenses to which it applies, it leaves no room for speculation by a jury as to what might occur thereafter during the executive department\u2019s administration of the sentence imposed. Moreover, as a result of the enactment of this statute the policy underlying the <em>Coward </em>rule is eroded. The executive branch no longer has the discretion to grant or deny parole because this statute abolishes parole. Thus, in the context of achieving the goal of \u201ctruth in sentencing,\u201d it simply defies reason that this information ought not to be provided to the jury by an instruction of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">However, it is equally clear, as we have noted, that it would be inaccurate to inform a jury that a defendant convicted of a non-capital felony would not be eligible for early release in every instance. Indeed, for every person convicted of a non-capital felony offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, the provisions of Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01 and Code \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-202.2 <em>et seq. </em>are implicated and conditionally provide for forms of early release and sentence reduction. Because such early release and sentence reduction provisions are not mandatory, the policy concerns underlying the <em>Coward </em>rule logically remain viable, although to a lesser extent. Nonetheless, because those statutory provisions represent a clear departure from the broad discretion given to the executive branch under the prior law with regard to early release and sentence reduction, we believe that strict adherence to the <em>Coward </em>rule is no longer appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Although we have discussed Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01 and Code \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-202.2 <em>et seq. </em>in the context that these statutes provide for forms of early release and sentence reduction, they are distinctively different with regard to the issue of parole eligibility in this appeal. The former is more in the nature of a parole statute than the latter. Indeed, Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01, in pertinent part provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">Any person serving a sentence imposed upon a conviction for a felony offense, other than a Class 1 felony, committed on or after January 1, 1995, (i) who has reached the age of sixty-five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>or older and who has served at least five years of the sentence imposed or (ii) who has reached the age of sixty or older and who has served at least ten years of the sentence imposed may petition the <em>Parole Board </em>for conditional release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In contrast, the Board of Corrections, pursuant to Code \u00a7 53.1-202.4, is required, among other things, to establish the criteria upon which a person shall be deemed to have earned or forfeited sentence credits. In addition, Code \u00a7 53.1-202.3 limits the maximum rate at which sentence credits may be earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">However, for purposes of our present analysis with regard to the <em>Coward </em>rule, the most significant distinction between the statutory provisions for geriatric release and sentence reduction for good behavior credit is a matter of application and predictability. The determination of a prisoner\u2019s eligibility for geriatric release is essentially a mathematical calculation. The age of the prisoner and the years served of the sentence imposed are readily determinable and, thus, not subject to speculation. A prisoner\u2019s eligibility for early release for good behavior credit does not involve such a clear-cut calculation. Rather, under the applicable statutory provisions, eligibility for sentence reduction for good behavior credit necessarily involves the unpredictable conduct of a prisoner, and to a significant degree the subjective assessment of that conduct by employees of the Department of Corrections, with regard to compliance with rules and participation in various programs established and administered by the Board of Corrections. Thus, when attempting to factor good behavior credit into its determination of an appropriate sentence, a jury would be required to speculate on the unpredictable conduct thereafter of a particular defendant and the assessment of that conduct by the executive branch of government. The avoidance of such speculation underlies the <em>Coward </em>rule because speculation by the jury is inconsistent with a fair trial both to the defendant and the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">For these reasons, we are of opinion that a new rule is both appropriate and mandated as a result of the statutory enactments discussed above. Accordingly, we will direct that henceforth juries shall be instructed, as a matter of law, on the abolition of parole for non-capital felony offenses committed on or after January 1, 1995 pursuant to Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1. In addition, because Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01 is in the nature of a parole statute, where applicable juries shall also be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>instructed on the possibility of geriatric release pursuant to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Under this new rule, the task of the trial courts will require only that instructions with regard to the abolition of parole be tailored to the facts of a particular case. Thus, when a defendant\u2019s age and the permissible range of punishment for the offense in question totally negate the applicability of Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01, the jury will be instructed that the defendant is not eligible for parole in accordance with Code \u00a753.1-165.1. In those cases where geriatric release is a possibility, then the jury will be instructed in accordance with the applicable provisions of Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01 along with the instruction that parole is otherwise abolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">This new rule, however, does not include the requirement that juries also be instructed with regard to the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-202.2 <em>et seq. </em>As explained above, at the time a jury assesses punishment it does not, and cannot, have a factual basis upon which to factor the provisions for good behavior credit into its determination of an appropriate sentence in a given case. Rather, such an effort would be an exercise in pure speculation. Consequently, juries are not to be instructed with regard to these statutory provisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In light of this new rule and the limitation we have placed on it with regard to jury instructions concerning good behavior credits and executive clemency, we will overrule <em>Coward </em>and its progeny to the extent that they are inconsistent with this opinion. In addition, because this is a new rule of criminal procedure it is limited prospectively to those cases not yet final on this date. <em>See Mueller, </em>252 Va. at 361, 478 S.E.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">We now turn to the specific circumstances of Fishback\u2019s case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Initially, we note that Fishback\u2019s proposed instruction \u201cNo. S\u201d was not wholly accurate because it suggested that he would not be eligible for any form of early release. Because Fishback was forty-four years of age at the time the jury considered its sentence, under the permissible sentencing range for the robbery and abduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>offenses for which he had been convicted he would become eligible for geriatric release under Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01 when he reached age sixty. In addition, Fishback\u2019s proposed instruction \u201cNo. T\u201d was not accurate because it would have told the jury to assume that he would serve the entire sentence imposed even though under Code \u00a7 53.1-202.3 good time credits can result in a reduction of a sentence by fifteen percent. These deficiencies in his proffered instructions, however, do not bar our consideration of the issue presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">It is axiomatic that \u201c[i]t belongs to the [trial] court to instruct the jury as to the law, whenever they require instruction, or either of the parties request it to be given.\u201d <em>Thornton v. Commonwealth, </em>65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 657, 662 (1874). Moreover, pertinent here, we have stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">We adhere to the rule that the trial court is not required to amend or correct an erroneous instruction, but the rule is subject to the limitation that when the principle of law is materially vital to a defendant in a criminal case, it is reversible error for the trial court to refuse a defective instruction instead of correcting it and giving it in the proper form. A jury should not be left in the dark on the subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\"><em>Whaley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 353, 355-56, 200 S.E.2d 556, 558 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The jury\u2019s knowledge of the abolition of parole was materially vital to Fishback\u2019s case in the penalty-determination phase of his trial. Under our holding above, he was entitled to have the jury properly instructed on that matter. Thus, the trial court erred in refusing to give a proper instruction to the jury on the abolition of parole including the availability of geriatric release.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Accordingly, Fishback\u2019s sentences will be vacated, the order appealed from reversed, and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals with directions to remand the same to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\"> Accordingly, only Fishback\u2019s sentences, and not his convictions, are at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\"> Such an instruction was already required where the Commonwealth elected to present evidence of the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness to society. <em>See Simmons </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>512 U.S. 154, 161-62 (1994) (plurality opinion); <em>Mueller v.

Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 639, 646, 178 S.E. 797, 799 (1935)). The policy underlying that rule is twofold. First, a \u201cjury should not be permitted to speculate on the potential effect of parole, pardon, or an act of clemency on its sentence because doing so would inevitably prejudice the jury in favor of a harsher sentence than the facts of the case might otherwise warrant.\u201d <em>Yarbrough, </em>258 Va. at 372, 519 S.E.2d at 615. Equally important is the separation of powers between the judicial and executive branches of government. In our criminal justice system, the judicial branch of government assesses punishment, and the executive branch administers that punishment. <em>See Hinton, </em>219 Va. at 496, 247 S.E.2d at 706. \u201cThe aim of the rule followed in Virginia is to preserve, as effectively as possible, the separation of those functions during the process when the jury is fixing the penalty . ...\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">However, in <em>Yarbrough, </em>we created an exception to that rule in capital murder cases because, with the abolition of parole in Virginia, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1, and the unavailability of geriatric release, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01, \u201c[t]he <em>Coward </em>rule simply does not address [the] unique situation\u201d presented to a jury when it must elect between imposing the death penalty or a sentence of life. <em>Yarbrough, </em>258 Va. at 372, 519 S.E.2d at 615. There, we said that \u201cthis unique situation arises from the fact that a defendant sentenced to life imprisonment for capital murder, a class one felony, is not subject to \u2018geriatric parole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in capital murder cases, under the rule announced in <em>Yarbrough, </em>there is no danger that the judicial branch will exceed its role in assessing punishment by taking into account matters within the province of the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Today, the majority extends the exception recognized in <em>Yarbrough </em>to non-capital felony cases even though in such cases, the executive branch, in administering the sentence, continues to have available certain forms of sentence reduction, such as earned sentence credits, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 202.2 through -202.4, and geriatric release. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Because I believe that the majority\u2019s decision will blur the lines between the judicial branch of government and the executive branch, <em>see </em>Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 5, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The majority recognizes that it would be unfair to the Commonwealth to instruct a jury that parole is no longer available in Virginia without also, in appropriate cases, advising the jury about geriatric release. However, the majority also states its view that the jury should not be instructed about executive clemency, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7\u00a753.1-229 through -231, or earned sentence credits. While the majority\u2019s view on the propriety of instructing the jury about earned sentence credits or executive clemency comports with the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>in that it follows our long-standing precedent, <em>see Hinton, </em>219 Va. at 495, 247 S.E.2d at 706, <em>Coward, </em>164 Va. at 646, 178 S.E. at 799, precedent that the majority overrules today in other respects, the majority reaches its decision not by adhering to our prior decisions, which were well-grounded in public policy, but rather by distinguishing between what it considers to be the speculative nature of various types of sentence reduction available to the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Claiming to find geriatric release and earned sentence credits \u201cdistinctively different,\u201d the majority posits that, because the eligibility of a prisoner to petition the Parole Board for conditional geriatric release can be easily calculated, a jury\u2019s knowledge of geriatric release would not lead to speculation by it in determining an appropriate sentence. However, in making this distinction, the majority fails to recognize that the availability of geriatric release and the award of earned sentence credits both involve the discretion of the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">An examination of the statutes creating geriatric release and earned sentence credits indicates that consideration of either one by a jury in its sentencing decision would involve speculation. The statute authorizing geriatric release provides that a prisoner may petition the Parole Board for such release. However, the statute does not mandate release when a prisoner reaches age 65 and has served 5 years, or age 60 and has served 10 years, but authorizes the Parole Board to promulgate regulations to implement the provisions of that statute. Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Likewise, the executive branch is given discretion in fashioning standards under which prisoners can qualify for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>earned sentence credits. Code \u00a7 53.1-202.4. In fact, the very same \u201cunpredictable conduct of a prisoner, and . . . subjective assessment of that conduct . . . with regard to compliance with rules and participation in various programs ^ established and administered by the Board of Corrections,\u201d which the majority contends renders the earned sentence credit program too speculative to tell the jury about, is similar to the inquiry that the Parole Board must conduct before it can discharge any inmate on geriatric release. Virginia Parole Board, Virginia Parole Board Administrative Procedures Manual No. 1.226 (effective Nov. 14, 1995) (Parole Board uses same criteria for determining prisoner\u2019s suitability for geriatric release as it does \u201cfor assessing offenders eligible for parole consideration\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">If \u201ctruth in sentencing\u201d is a goal of our system of justice, it seems that, if a jury is told anything about the availability or unavailability of parole or geriatric release, it should also be instructed about earned sentence credits and any other matter that could affect the amount of time that a defendant may actually serve.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Otherwise, a jury will be receiving a \u201chalf-truth,\u201d and the Commonwealth will be prejudiced because a jury could believe that a defendant will serve all of a sentence imposed when, in fact, that is not always what happens in a non-capital felony case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">However, if a jury receives all relevant information so that neither a defendant nor the Commonwealth is prejudiced, I fear that juries may become confused, will speculate on the effect of any applicable sentence reduction methods available to the executive branch, and perhaps will resort to the use of a calculator in attempting to fashion an appropriate sentence. We have previously noted that \u201cthe average juror is aware that some type of further consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>will usually be given to the sentence imposed,\u201d <em>Hinton, </em>219 Va. at 496, 247 S.E.2d at 706, but have warned against encouraging speculation by a jury. \u201c[I]f it is thought necessary to tell the jury not to speculate about the information given, it is safer not to give the information at all.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>194 Va. at 278, 72 S.E.2d at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">I also believe that if a jury is advised about all the factors that might impact the amount of time that a defendant actually serves, the jury will, in essence, be considering factors outside its control, and in doing so, will not only be intruding upon the discretion afforded to the executive branch in administering sentences,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but also nullifying the legislative goal underlying earned sentence credits and other forms of sentence reduction. A jury \u201cshould not fix a defendant\u2019s punishment with the view of preventing the operation of laws that have been duly enacted for the handling of a prisoner after sentence in a way considered by the lawmakers to be in the best interests of the public and of the prisoner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 72 S.E.2d at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Furthermore, this Court has already partially addressed the question before us. In <em>Peterson v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 302 S.E.2d 520, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 865 (1983), the jury asked whether it was possible \u201cto give a life sentence without parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296, 302 S.E.2d at 525. In response, the trial court advised that jury that its responsibility was to impose such sentence as it deemed just and that it was not to concern itself with what may thereafter happen. <em>Id. </em>at 296-97, 302 S.E.2d at 525. The defendant in that case, who was charged with capital murder in the commission of armed robbery and had two previous convictions for armed robbery, did not object to the court\u2019s answer. However, he argued before this Court that Code \u00a7 53.1-151(B1), which became effective July 1, 1982, and made a person convicted of three separate offenses of armed robbery ineligible for parole, changed the rule addressed in <em>Hinton. </em>We did not consider the effect of that statutory amendment but reaffirmed \u201cthe principle . . . that it is improper to inform the jury as to the possibility of parole.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>at 297, 302 S.E.2d at 525. We further stated that \u201cit would have been improper for the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>to have offered a jury instruction based upon the 1982 amendment, even if, as [the defendant] now contends, the amendment applied to him\u201d and rendered him parole ineligible. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Thus, I believe that the rule enunciated in <em>Coward </em>and consistently followed until today in non-capital felony cases remains viable and should not be discarded. The rule preserves our system of government premised on the separation of powers between the branches of government and also takes into account practical considerations about how much information a jury should receive regarding sentencing while still maintaining fairness to both the defendant and the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">For these reasons, I dissent and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\"> The Parole Board has not promulgated those regulations to date, although it has issued manuals that contain rules implementing the provisions of Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01. <em>See </em>Virginia Parole Board, Virginia Parole Board Policy Manual (July 1997); Virginia Parole Board, Vir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ginia Parole Board Administrative Procedures Manual Nos. 1.218 (revised May 21, 1996) and 1.226 (effective Nov. 14, 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\"> Among those criteria are \u201c[w]hether the individual\u2019s history, physical and mental condition and character, and the individual\u2019s conduct . . . reflect the probability that the individual will lead a law-abiding life . . .,\u201d as well as an evaluation of the individual\u2019s \u201c[g]eneral [adjustment\u201d to the institutional experience, including the individual\u2019s behavior and relationships with the prison staff and other inmates.
