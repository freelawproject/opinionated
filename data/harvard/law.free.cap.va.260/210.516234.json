In an unpublished opinion, <em>Oulds v. Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 2062-98-3 (September 28, 1999), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, and we awarded Oulds this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We will summarize the facts from the record of the testimony delivered at trial by the defendant, the victim of the assault, and an eyewitness to that assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Paul R. Adams, a Lynchburg City policeman, had worked off-duty for 12 years as a security guard at the Plaza, a shopping center in Lynchburg. Adams testified that the police department had formally approved his off-duty employment and authorized him to act \u201cdressed in uniform, carrying his side arm, handcuffs, and some other implements of a police officer.\u201d In the exercise of the authority granted by the department and the Plaza, Adams had notified Oulds that he was \u201cbarred from the Plaza and that if he ever came back over there again, he would be arrested for trespassing.\u201d Adams recalled that he had been \u201cpreviously familiar with Mr. Oulds\u201d on \u201c[t]wo other occasions at the Plaza involving arrests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">On the occasion relevant here, Adams saw Oulds at the Plaza and attempted to handcuff and arrest him for trespassing. During the struggle that ensued, Adams sustained wounds to his mouth and to his right index finger. Oulds broke free from the struggle and ran to another section of the Plaza, where he was arrested with the aid of police officers. Ms. Sarah Reeves, a manager of a department in one of the stores in the Plaza, testified that she had witnessed the injuries Adams suffered in a \u201cwrestling match\u201d, Oulds\u2019 attempt to flee, and his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">n. JUDICIAL NOTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">In support of a motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Oulds contended that the Commonwealth had failed to prove the elements of the crime because it did not introduce an authenticated copy of a city ordinance enacted in compliance with Code \u00a7 15.2-1712 (formerly \u00a7 15.1-33.1) authorizing police officers to use their police power in off-duty employment. In response, the Commonwealth identified the city ordinance as \u201cSection 31.5 . . . which basically, expressly gives police officers permission, as long as they follow the guidelines, to work off duty in the City of Lynchburg.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Announcing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>that he had \u201cruled before ... on the very same point,\u201d the trial judge overruled the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Affirming Ould\u2019s conviction on appeal, the Court of Appeals held that a trial court \u201cneed not admit formally the ordinances of the jurisdiction where it sits because it is required to take judicial notice of those laws.\u201d In an assignment of error on appeal to this Court, Oulds contends that \u201cthe Court of Appeals erred in the application of the doctrine of judicial notice.\u201d That error exists, according to Oulds, because \u201cthe prosecution did not ask to take judicial notice of\u201d the ordinance, and \u201ca copy of the ordinance was not admitted as evidence.\u201d We disagree with Oulds\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Oulds\u2019 contentions ignore the plain language and function of the Virginia statute defining the doctrine of judicial notice. Code \u00a7 19.2-265.2(A) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">Whenever, in any criminal case it becomes necessary to ascertain what the law, statutory or otherwise, of this Commonwealth, of another state, of the United States, of another country, or of any political subdivision or agency of the same is, or was, at any time, the court shall take judicial notice thereof whether specially pleaded or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">This statute eliminates the necessity of introducing an authenticated copy of a city ordinance into evidence and that the ordinance be \u201cspecially pleaded.\u201d In this case, as recited above, the Commonwealth specifically directed the trial court\u2019s attention to the city ordinance in question. Thus the Court of Appeals did not err in concluding that, under the principle of judicial notice, the Commonwealth met its burden to prove that the city had adopted an ordinance authorizing police officers to work off-duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Oulds also complains that the trial court erroneously allowed hearsay testimony to establish the existence of and compliance with regulations adopted by the city regarding off-duty employment by police officers. Again we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Here, Officer Adams\u2019 testimony that he had complied with the department\u2019s directives concerning off-duty employment was not offered to prove the existence and content of such regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>in. PUBLIC DUTIES</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">We do agree with Oulds that \u201cthe prosecution must prove a law enforcement officer is performing his public duties to sustain a felony conviction under Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-57.\u201d Yet, we disagree with Oulds\u2019 view that the evidence in this case was insufficient to prove that Adams was engaged in the performance of public duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The felony of which Oulds was convicted is defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-57(C). That statute provides that \u201cif any person commits an assault or an assault and battery against another knowing or having reason to know that such other person is a law-enforcement officer . . . engaged in the performance of his public duties as such, such person shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The evidence, including Oulds\u2019 own testimony, clearly shows that Oulds committed an \u201cassault and battery\u201d upon Adams; that Oulds recognized Adams as a \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d; and that Adams was engaged in the arrest of a person who had committed a criminal trespass upon private property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Court of Appeals concluded, Adams\u2019 \u201cprivate employment did not relieve him of the responsibility or authority to maintain the peace, protect property, and enforce the laws of the Commonwealth.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that Adams was \u201cengaged in the performance of his public duties\u201d when he was assaulted by Oulds.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Finding no error of record in this appeal, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-11\"> The Lynchburg ordinance, a copy of which was included in the record on appeal to the Court of Appeals, provided that \u201cpolice officers will be permitted to engage in off-duty employment which requires the use of their police powers.\u201d Such an ordinance was defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tively authorized by former Code \u00a7 15.1-33.1 (now, \u00a7 15.2-1712), which permits, but does not require, a locality to enact such regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\"> Police officers \u201cmay arrest, without a warrant, any person who commits any crime in the presence of the officer <em>. . . .\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-81.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
