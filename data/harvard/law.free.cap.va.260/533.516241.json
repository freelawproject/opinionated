Talton, </em>249 Va. 182, 188, 455 S.E.2d 232, 236 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">In 1994, Henry Steven Cardenas was employed as a teller by First Union Bank. His duties included, among other things, the receiving of cash and checks for deposit into the accounts of the bank\u2019s customers. At the beginning of his employment, Cardenas received \u201cabout two weeks\u201d of training. During that training, First Union instructed Cardenas not to accept checks made payable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>businesses for deposit into personal accounts or to accept checks for more than $7,000 for deposit without a supervisor\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Prior to beginning his employment with First Union, Cardenas was acquainted with Amie Cheryl Lehman, who was dating Cardenas\u2019 brother. Shortly after Cardenas began working as a teller, he moved into an apartment with his brother and Lehman. Lehman, who had formerly been a teller at Signet Bank, was employed at that time by Gina Chin &amp; Associates, Inc. (Chin), a food wholesaler, as the firm\u2019s accounts payable clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">After Cardenas had been working at First Union \u201ca little over a year,\u201d Lehman, relying on her knowledge as a former bank teller, requested his assistance in depositing a forged check into her First Union account. The check was drawn on Chin\u2019s account at Signet Bank,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was made payable to one of Chin\u2019s suppliers. Lehman created the check by entering a false invoice into Chin\u2019s accounts payable computer program, which produced the check on a printer. Lehman then forged both the signature of Gina Chin, Chin\u2019s president, as drawer and the endorsement of the supplier making the check payable to Lehman.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Cardenas at first refused to assist Lehman, \u201cbut then she kept on insisting and insisting and then she convinced me, I guess, by offering me some money on the side.\u201d Lehman told Cardenas that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t come back to [him] at all\u201d because she reconciled the bank statements for Chin\u2019s account and could intercept the statements with the forged checks before they came to the attention of the firm\u2019s principals. Cardenas thereafter deposited the check into Lehman\u2019s First Union account. The drawer bank paid the check, debiting the amount from Chin\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Ultimately, using the forgery scheme outlined above, Lehman and Cardenas succeeded in depositing $270,488.72 in forged checks into Lehman\u2019s personal account at First Union.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cardenas received approximately 20 percent of the funds deposited. After Lehman left her employment with Chin, Signet Bank discovered the forgery scheme and reported its findings to Chin and the police. Lehman and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Cardenas subsequently were convicted of one count of bank fraud each in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">On June 11, 1996, Chin filed a motion for judgment against First Union seeking $270,488.72 in damages resulting from the forgery scheme of Lehman and Cardenas. Chin alleged that First Union was negligent when it accepted for payment checks drawn on Chin\u2019s accounts bearing both forged signatures of the drawer and forged endorsements of the payees. Chin further alleged that First Union was vicariously liable for Cardenas\u2019 criminal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The trial court initially sustained First Union\u2019s demurrer to Chin\u2019s motion for judgment and entered summary judgment in favor of First Union on the ground that under the factual circumstances asserted by Chin certain provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code barred an action by the drawer of a check against the depository bank. We awarded Chin an appeal from that judgment, reversed it, and remanded the case for further proceedings. <em>Gina Chin &amp; Associates v. First Union </em>Bank, 256 Va. 59, 63, 500 S.E.2d 516, 518 (1998). In doing so, we held that \u201cChin\u2019s motion for judgment pled a cause of action pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 8.3A-404 and -405 of the Uniform Commercial Code, Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.1-101 through 8.11-108.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 500 S.E.2d at 517. We explained that pursuant to these statutes the concept of comparative negligence is employed to determine liability to the person sustaining the loss based upon the premise \u201cthat all participants in the process have a duty to exercise ordinary care in the drawing and handling of [checks].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 500 S.E.2d at 517. Thus, in the context of the present case, the ultimate issue of comparative negligence, which is solely a jury issue, centers upon the conduct of First Union through its employees and that of Chin through its employees. In short, there is no dispute that while First Union accepted the forged checks for payment and Chin permitted access to its checks by its employee who forged them, the ultimate issue still undecided at that point in the proceedings was whether First Union was negligent or whether First Union and Chin were both negligent and, if so, to what comparative extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Upon remand, a jury trial was commenced in the trial court on July 17, 1999. After First Union prevailed on its motion in limine to exclude the anticipated testimony of Chin\u2019s expert witness regarding established banking customs and standards, the trial court stated \u201cthe primary issue is scope of employment.\u201d Chin then proceeded to produce its evidence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Cardenas, Lehman, and Donald Chin, Chin\u2019s treasurer, were each called as witnesses for Chin. Consistent with the facts previously related herein, Cardenas and Lehman detailed the scheme to forge the checks and to deposit them into Lehman\u2019s account. Cardenas further testified that after he left his employment with First Union, Lehman continued the forgery scheme using her account at another bank where Cardenas\u2019 brother worked as a teller. Donald Chin testified concerning the failure of Chin to detect the forgery scheme. At the conclusion of Chin\u2019s case-in-chief, the jury was read stipulations of fact, including the stipulation that Cardenas\u2019 acts were not known to his supervisors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\">First Union moved to strike Chin\u2019s evidence, asserting that Chin had failed to establish that Cardenas was acting within the scope of his employment in knowingly accepting the forged checks for deposit. First Union argued that \u201calthough taking these checks may have been incidental to First Union\u2019s business because it takes checks for deposit, there was no evidence that it was in furtherance of First Union\u2019s interest.\u201d First Union contended that this was so because Cardenas willfully violated its policies concerning the deposit of commercial checks into personal accounts and accepting certain checks without management approval. Thus, First Union argued that Cardenas was not acting in furtherance of its interest and, hence, not within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Chin, citing <em>Commercial Business Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bell South Services, Inc., </em>249 Va. 39, 453 S.E.2d 261 (1995), and other cases, responded that the specific wrongful act by the employee need not be in furtherance of the employer\u2019s interest so long as the service that the employee was performing at the time was in the course of his employment. Chin asserted that its evidence showed that Cardenas was acting as an employee of First Union when he accepted the forged checks for deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">After a lengthy colloquy in which the trial court and counsel for both parties discussed in detail the case law concerning the doctrine of respondeat superior, the trial court sustained First Union\u2019s motion to strike Chin\u2019s evidence. In the final order dismissing the case with prejudice, the trial court ruled as a matter of law that Cardenas\u2019 acts \u201cwere not within the scope of the employee\u2019s authority, being in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>contravention of First Union\u2019s directives, and they were not within the scope of employment as they were shown not to be in furtherance of First Union\u2019s interests; and . . . reasonable persons cannot differ on the conclusion reached herein based on the evidence presented by the Plaintiff, with all inferences most favorable to the Plaintiff.\u201d We awarded Chin this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Initially, we note that the procedural posture of this case, as will be demonstrated, is significant. The case is before us following the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion to strike Chin\u2019s evidence. In that posture, we are unable to review this case in consideration of all the evidence that may have been produced on the issue in question. Moreover, despite our consideration of this case in the prior appeal, we are unable to reach the ultimate merits, or lack thereof, of Chin\u2019s claims against First Union. However, for the reasons that follow, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">With respect to an assertion of liability based upon the doctrine of respondeat superior, this Court made the following pertinent observation almost 80 years ago in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>133 Va. 69, 112 S.E. 628 (1922):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">If a person, acting for himself, wilfully and maliciously inflict an injury upon another, he is liable in damages for such injury. And there is no reason why a master should be permitted to turn his business over to servants who have no regard for the public welfare and thereby escape the responsibility which he would otherwise have to bear. It is manifestly right and just that both corporations and individuals be required to answer in damages for wanton and malicious assaults inflicted upon others by their servants, while acting within the scope of the servant\u2019s employment and duty, and it matters not whether the act of the servant is due to lack of judgment, the infirmity of temper, or the influence of passion, or that the servant goes beyond his strict line of duty and authority in inflicting such injury ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 74, 112 S.E. at 630-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Almost from its first consideration by the courts of this Commonwealth, however, the determination of the issue whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>employee\u2019s wrongful act was within the scope of his employment under the facts of a particular case has proved \u201cvexatious.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Kidd </em>v. <em>DeWitt, </em>128 Va. 438, 443, 105 S.E. 124, 125 (1920); <em>Appalachian Power Company v. Robertson, </em>142 Va. 454, 456, 129 S.E. 224, 224 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">We have defined \u201cscope of employment\u201d in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">Generally, an act is within the scope of the employment if (1) it was expressly or impliedly directed by the employer, or is naturally incident to the business, and (2) it was performed, although mistakenly or ill-advisedly, <em>with the intent to further the employer\u2019s interest, </em>or from some impulse or emotion that was the natural consequence of an attempt to do the employer\u2019s business ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\"><em>Kensington Associates </em>v. <em>West, </em>234 Va. 430, 432, 362 S.E.2d 900, 901 (1987)(emphasis added). The emphasized language in this definition is the focal point of First Union\u2019s assertion in the present case. First Union apparently interprets this language to require that the specific act which caused the injury be performed by the employee with an intent to benefit the employer. At first blush, this language is susceptible to such an interpretation. However, our prior decisions do not support that interpretation by implication, <em>see, e.g., Plummer </em>v. <em>Center Psychiatrists, Ltd., </em>252 Va. 233, 238, 476 S.E.2d 172, 175 (1996)(counselor engaging in unethical sexual relationship with patient was potentially acting within scope of employment); <em>Commercial Business Systems, </em>249 Va. at 46, 453 S.E.2d at 266 (employee violating company rule against self-dealing and accepting illegal bribes to award contracts was potentially acting within the scope of employment), and we expressly reject it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In cases involving a willful and wrongful act of an employee, a narrow and literal reading of the language in this definition, which would create a patent conflict within it, is not to be applied as a matter of law to the facts of a particular case. The present case and First Union\u2019s assertions in support of its motion to strike Chin\u2019s evidence are illustrative of the point. Where an employee commits a willful and wrongful act that results in injury to others, simple logic suggests that such employee generally does not do so \u201cwith the intent to further the employer\u2019s interest.\u201d That is to say, the employee generally does not intend to benefit the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Here, it may well be reasonable to conclude that a bank teller does not intend to further the interest of his employer bank when he knowingly accepts forged checks for deposit for his own gain. However, that does not resolve the legal issue presented, as a matter of law, to the trial court upon a motion to strike the injured party\u2019s evidence. Rather, it should be apparent that the proper application of this definition in the context of the doctrine of respondeat superior does not resolve into a simplistic determination that an employee\u2019s willful and wrongful act was not done with the intent to further the employer\u2019s interest or to benefit the employer in some way. Any doubt that may have existed in that regard was clearly resolved in <em>Commercial Business Systems </em>and in <em>Plummer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">As in the present case, we recognize that the difficulty in applying this definition to the facts of a particular case frequently arises where \u201c[tjhe real inquiry is, was the question as to whether [the employee] was acting within the scope of his employment . . . one to be determined by the Court, or was it a question of fact to be submitted to, and determined by, the jury?\u201d <em>Crowell v. Duncan, </em>145 Va. 489, 500, 134 S.E. 576, 579 (1926). In that regard, a motion to strike requires the trial court to test the evidence against the applicable burdens of production before permitting the jury to weigh that evidence against the applicable burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Settled principles guide the trial court\u2019s considerations. While the plaintiff has the burden of persuasion on the issue whether the employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the act complained of, we have consistently held that proof of the employment relationship creates a <em>prima facie </em>rebuttable presumption of the employer\u2019s liability. <em>McNeill v. Spindlier, </em>191 Va. 685, 694-95, 62 S.E.2d 13, 17-18 (1950). Thus, \u201c[w]hen an employer-employee relationship has been established, \u2018the burden is on the [employer] to prove that the [employee] was <em>not </em>acting within the scope of his employment when he committed the act complained of, and ... if the evidence leaves the question in doubt it becomes an issue to be determined by the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kensington Associates, </em>234 Va. at 432-33, 362 S.E.2d at 901 (quoting <em>Broaddus v. Standard Drug Co., </em>211 Va. 645, 653-54, 179 S.E.2d 497, 504 (1971)); see <em>also Plummer, </em>252 Va. at 235, 476 S.E.2d at 174; <em>Turner v. Burford Buick Corp., </em>201 Va. 693, 698, 112 S.E.2d 911, 915 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Admittedly, the trial court\u2019s task may be particularly difficult in cases in which the injury is caused by an intentional, often criminal, tortious act which clearly would not have been contemplated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the employer as being within the scope of employment, but which nonetheless was performed incident to the employment and even facilitated thereby.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such cases invoke consideration of whether the employee deviated from the scope of his employment because of an \u201cexternal, independent, and personal motive ... to do the act upon his own account.\u201d <em>Broaddus, </em>211 Va. at 653, 179 S.E.2d at 503-04. In that regard, we have distinguished between the motive of the employee and the relevant question whether the service performed was within the scope of employment. In making this distinction, we have held that the motive of the employee in committing the act complained of is not determinative of whether it took place within the scope of the employment relationship. <em>Commercial Business Systems, </em>249 Va. at 45, 453 S.E.2d at 266; <em>Tri-State Coach Corp. v. Walsh, </em>188 Va. 299, 305-06, 49 S.E.2d 363, 366 (1948). Rather, the issue is \u201cwhether the service itself, in which the tortious act was done, was within the ordinary course of such business.\u201d <em>Davis v. Merrill, </em>133 Va. 69, 78, 112 S.E. 628, 631 (1922); <em>accord Commercial Business Systems, </em>249 Va. at 44, 453 S.E.2d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In <em>Commercial Business Systems, </em>an employee, in violation of conflict of interest rules established by his employer, created a business to work with companies that provided services to his employer. The employee then used his position as a contract negotiator and administrator to funnel business to suppliers who agreed to work with his company and pay him illegal \u201ckickbacks.\u201d 249 Va. at 43, 453 S.E.2d at 265. We held that these facts did not \u201cconclusively establish that [the employee] was not acting within the scope of his employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 453 S.E.2d at 266. Although the employee\u2019s motive was to advance his self-interest, rather than the interest of his employer, he was nonetheless \u201cperforming his duties ... in the execution of the services for which he was employed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We emphasize that the employee\u2019s improper motive is not irrelevant to the issue whether the act was within the scope of employment. Rather, it is merely a factor to be considered in making that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>determination, and, unless the deviation from the employer\u2019s business is slight on the one hand, or marked and unusual on the other, but falls instead between those two extremes, the question is for the jury. <em>McNeill, </em>191 Va. at 695, 62 S.E.2d at 18; <em>accord Kensington Associates, </em>234 Va. at 433, 362 S.E.2d at 902. Thus, in <em>Commercial Business Systems, </em>we held that \u201cthe evidence presents a jury issue whether [the employee] acted within the scope of his employment when he committed the wrongful acts.\u201d 249 Va. at 46, 453 S.E.2d at 266; <em>see also Plummer, </em>252 Va. at 238, 476 S.E.2d at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Applying these principles, the issue presented to the trial court by First Union\u2019s motion to strike was whether the evidence presented by Chin was such that, as a matter of law, a reasonable juror could not find that an employer-employee relationship existed between Cardenas and First Union or that, although such a relationship existed, Cardenas was acting within the scope of that employment at the time of the commission of the acts which injured Chin. First Union does not contest that Chin produced clear evidence that established the necessary employment relationship between Cardenas and First Union. Accordingly, Chin\u2019s evidence established a <em>prima facie </em>case of First Union\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">First Union contends, however, that Chin\u2019s evidence was also sufficient to meet First Union\u2019s burden of production on the issue whether Cardenas\u2019 acts were nevertheless outside the scope of that employment and, moreover, that this evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption of liability as a matter of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">First Union asserts that Chin\u2019s evidence establishes that Cardenas\u2019 wrongful acts were not \u201cexpressly or impliedly directed by the employer\u201d because he violated directives in accepting commercial checks for deposit into a personal account, in failing to obtain a manager\u2019s approval to accept high value checks for deposit, and in knowingly accepting checks for deposit with forged endorsements. This assertion is without merit because the act need not be expressly or impliedly directed by the employer in order for the act to occur within the scope of the employment. Similarly, an act committed in violation of an employer\u2019s direction is not always beyond the scope of the employment. Rather, as previously noted, the test is \u201cwhether the service itself, in which the tortious act was done, was within the ordinary course of\u201d the employer\u2019s business. In this instance, it is clear that accepting checks for deposit by a bank teller is a service within the ordinary course of First Union\u2019s banking business.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>First Union further asserts that Chin\u2019s evidence also establishes that Cardenas was acting exclusively for his own benefit and that of Lehman. Thus, First Union contends that Cardenas was acting outside the scope of his employment because he had an \u201cexternal, independent, and personal motive\u201d to perform the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">There can be no doubt that Cardenas was not steadfast in the performance of his duties and obligations to his employer when he chose to participate in a criminal scheme to accept forged checks for deposit. Cardenas was acting out of self-interest in participating in Lehman\u2019s scheme, and his conduct was \u201coutrageous and violative of his employer\u2019s rules.\u201d <em>Commercial Business Systems, </em>249 Va. at 46, 453 S.E.2d at 266. Nonetheless, it is clear that in doing so he was performing a normal function of a bank teller in accepting checks for deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In sum, First Union\u2019s assertions, and the apparent basis of the trial court\u2019s decision to strike Chin\u2019s evidence and to award summary judgment to First Union, are premised not on the failure of Chin to present sufficient evidence to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of the necessary employment relationship at the time of the injury to Chin, but on the failure of that evidence to prove that the acts complained of were committed within the scope of that employment. As we have explained, Chin did not have the burden of presenting evidence that Cardenas\u2019 acts were within the scope of his employment. Rather, having established that the employment relationship existed, Chin was entitled to have the case go forward with the burden on First Union to prove that Cardenas acted <em>outside </em>the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The procedural posture of the case, as we noted above, is significant. Chin\u2019s evidence, without any additional evidence offered by First Union, was sufficient to establish a jury issue whether Cardenas acted within the scope of his employment. That issue therefore, on the evidence presented, did not lend itself to a resolution as a matter of law by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court erred in sustaining First Union\u2019s motion to strike Chin\u2019s evidence and awarding summary judgment to First Union. Accordingly, we will reverse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\"> During the course of the ensuing forgery scheme conducted by Lehman and Cardenas, Chin moved its account to Citizen\u2019s Bank of Washington, D.C. Checks drawn on both accounts were deposited into Lehman\u2019s First Union account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-9\"> The total amount of the forged checks reflected here is taken from Chin\u2019s motion for judgment. Chin concedes in that pleading that this amount is subject to amendment because some of the forged checks were apparently deposited in another bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\"> First Union had been permitted to call its expert witness out of turn at the end of the first day of the trial, but had not formally begun presenting its case when it moved to strike Chin\u2019s evidence. Accordingly, we will not consider the evidence received from that witness in reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b563-6\"> An alternate approach in such circumstances has been to assign liability to the employer not vicariously through respondeat superior, but directly through the torts of negligent hiring and negligent retention. <em>See, e.g., J. v. Victory Tabernacle Baptist Church, </em>236 Va. 206, 208-09, 372 S.E.2d 391, 393 (1988)(confirming prior recognition of the tort of negligent hiring); <em>Philip Morris Inc. </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>235 Va. 380, 401, 368 S.E.2d 268, 279 (1988)(recognizing tort of negligent retention). Chin did not allege either of these torts in its motion for judgment. Chin did allege negligent failure to supervise as a theory of liability in its motion for judgment, but abandoned that claim at the outset of trial on remand. Accordingly, the viability of that claim is not before us in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
