Finding no error with regard to the first issue but concluding that the jury verdict is inadequate as a matter of law, we will reverse in part, and affirm in part, the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">PRIOR PROCEEDINGS AND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Johnnie W. and Rita S. Rice (the Rices), co-administrators of the estate of their daughter Leona Lynn Rice (Leona), filed a motion for judgment in the circuit court against Clifford Anthony Charles pursuant to Virginia\u2019s Death by Wrongful Act statute, Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-50 through -56.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They alleged that Leona died as a result of injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident in which she was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Charles. At trial, Charles admitted that he was negligent and that his negligence was a proximate cause of the accident and Leona\u2019s death. However, Charles proceeded on a defense of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">At the close of all the evidence, the Rices moved to strike the defense of contributory negligence on the basis that there was insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>cient corroboration of Charles\u2019 testimony, as required under Code \u00a7 8.01-397 (commonly referred to as the \u201cdead man\u2019s statute\u201d). The circuit court sustained the motion and thereafter submitted the case to the jury on the sole issue of damages. The jury then returned a verdict for the Rices in the amount of $7,283.27 for \u201creasonable funeral expenses.\u201d That figure represented the exact amount of Leona\u2019s funeral and related burial expenses<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> incurred by the Rices. The jury did not award any damages to the statutory beneficiaries, Leona\u2019s parents and her older sister Beverly Rice McClanahan, for sorrow, mental anguish, and loss of solace. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-52 through -54.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The Rices subsequently moved to set aside the verdict and to award a new trial on the issue of damages. The basis of their motion was the fact that the jury had awarded damages only for funeral expenses. The Rices argued that, by returning such a verdict, the jury disregarded the court\u2019s instructions and the uncontroverted evidence. The circuit court denied the motion and entered judgment for the Rices in accordance with the jury verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In accordance with well-established principles, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Rices, the prevailing parties at trial. <em>Morgen Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>252 Va. 60, 62, 471 S.E.2d 489, 490 (1996); <em>Besser Co. v. Hansen, </em>243 Va. 267, 269, 415 S.E.2d 138, 139 (1992); <em>Penn v. Manns, </em>221 Va. 88, 90, 267 S.E.2d 126, 127 (1980). On the evening of the accident, Leona and Charles planned to see a movie but decided to \u201cgo[ ] cruising around for a while\u201d in Charles\u2019 pickup truck before the movie started. During their drive, Leona and Charles saw J.D. Baker on a \u201cfour-wheeler\u201d in a parking lot. They stopped and asked Baker to go with them to the movie, and he agreed to do so. Leona and Charles then followed Baker to his home where Charles and Baker subsequently decided to buy beer instead of going to a movie. According to Charles, Leona heard the discussion about purchasing beer and did not object to the change in plans, but neither did she encourage or ask anyone to buy beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Because all three of these individuals were under the age of 21 years and could not legally purchase alcoholic beverages, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 4.1-305, they went to the home of Scott Mullins. The parties stipulated that, upon arriving there, Charles asked Mullins to buy beer for him. Mullins agreed to do so, but McClanahan, who was dating Mul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>lins at that time, objected. As a result, McClanahan and Mullins \u201cgot into an argument,\u201d and Leona, Charles, and Baker left Mullins\u2019 house while McClanahan and Mullins were still arguing. According to McClanahan, Leona said that she was \u201cgoing straight home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Charles testified that Leona then got back in Charles\u2019 truck, and, together with Baker, they proceeded to a local pharmacy where Charles talked to an individual who agreed to purchase two cases of seven-ounce bottles of beer for Charles. After getting the beer and putting it in the back of the truck, Charles drove to Enochs Branch in Dickenson County, where he and Baker drank some of the beer and discussed where to go from there.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Leona did not drink any beer. Eventually, all three of them got back in Charles\u2019 pickup truck. Leona sat in the middle between Charles and Baker, and a case of beer was placed in the front floorboard. Charles testified that he then drove toward Haysi, and that, while he was driving, and in Leona\u2019s presence, Baker handed him additional beers to drink. According to Charles, Leona did not try to stop him from drinking, did not request to get out of the truck, and did not ask him to take her home, even though they drove by her house on the way to Haysi. Although Leona had her learner\u2019s permit, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-334, she also did not offer to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Continuing, Charles testified that, just before the accident occurred, he stopped to use the bathroom and noticed that he had a \u201cbuzz\u201d and could feel the effect of the alcohol. At that point, Charles had consumed five or six of the seven-ounce bottles of beer in slightly less than two hours, and he had not eaten lunch or dinner that day. However, Charles stated that he had no trouble with his driving and did not believe that anyone would have considered him intoxicated. Charles further testified that he thought Leona would have told him if she had been concerned for her safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The accident occurred as Charles was coming into a \u201csteep curve\u201d too fast and lost control of his truck. Charles stated that he thought he had already driven through that curve. The truck flipped, and Charles and his two passengers were thrown out of the truck. When Charles found Leona after the accident, she was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Approximately an hour and a half after the accident, Charles\u2019 blood alcohol content (BAC) measured .08 percent by weight by vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ume.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A forensic toxicologist, whom Charles called to testify at trial, opined that Charles\u2019 BAC at the time of the accident could have been as low as .07 percent or as high as .10 percent, and that a BAC in that range would have adversely affected Charles\u2019 judgment, attention, concentration, and reaction time. However, the toxicologist also testified that, considering Charles\u2019 experience with drinking large quantities of alcohol, he would not likely have been \u201cvisibly drunk\u201d to an objective observer.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Charles and Leona had been dating more than a year at the time of her death and were engaged to be married. Charles testified that Leona had ridden with him many times when he was drinking and driving, and that they had argued about his drinking. At Leona\u2019s suggestion, Charles had entered a detoxification center a few months before the accident, but he had left the center before completing the detoxification program.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Several witnesses testified about the impact of Leona\u2019s death on her family. A neighbor of the Rices established that Leona had a close relationship with her mother and that Leona\u2019s death upset the Rices. The neighbor added that Mrs. Rice continues to suffer because of the death of her daughter and is not dealing well with the loss. One of Leona\u2019s friends also testified that Leona had a good relationship with both McClanahan and Mrs. Rice, and that the family was \u201cheartbroken\u201d when Leona died.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Mrs. Rice testified that she had a \u201cvery special\u201d relationship with Leona and that, when she learned of Leona\u2019s death, she experienced \u201cthe awfullest feeling that any person can have.\u201d Mrs. Rice also stated that McClanahan and Leona were very close, and that Leona and Mr. Rice likewise had a good relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Mrs. Rice acknowledged that she did not encourage Leona\u2019s relationship with Charles when the couple began dating. Mrs. Rice also stated that Leona had told her about Charles\u2019 drinking problem but had assured her parents that she would not ride in a car with someone who had been drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Mr. Rice also testified that he loved Leona very much, that he spent a lot of time outdoors with her, and that his entire family was very close. He stated that he felt hurt and anger when he learned of Leona\u2019s death, and that her loss will \u201churt [him] all [his] life.\u201d Mr. Rice further testified that Leona\u2019s death continues to affect his fam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ily, that his wife cries continuously, and that he has trouble dealing with his grief. He also testified that McClanahan has changed since Leona\u2019s death and is not as happy as she used to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">McClanahan stated that she and Leona were close even though she was four years older than Leona, and that she still suffers over Leona\u2019s death. Leona had told her about Charles\u2019 problem with drinking alcoholic beverages. Consequently, McClanahan had warned Leona not to ride with Charles after he had been drinking, and, according to McClanahan, Leona assured her that she would not do so. McClanahan related an incident just a few months prior to Leona\u2019s death when Leona had asked to get out of a vehicle because other people had beer in the vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">This appeal presents two separate issues. First, the Rices assign error to the circuit court\u2019s denial of their motion for a new trial on the issue of damages. In an assignment of cross-error, Charles asserts that the circuit court erred by striking his defense of contributory negligence because his testimony in support of that defense was not corroborated. We will address the assignment of cross-error first.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">With regard to that issue, Charles contends that the circuit court erroneously required corroboration of all the elements of his contributory negligence defense. Instead, Charles claims that, under Code \u00a7 8.01-397, the court should only have required \u201cthat [his] account of the accident be supported or strengthened by the attendant circumstances or other testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Elaborating, Charles argued orally that he had to prove three elements of his contributory negligence defense: (1) that Leona knew or should have known that it was dangerous to ride in a motor vehicle being driven by an individual who was or had been consuming alcoholic beverages; (2) that Leona knew or should have known that Charles was drinking on the evening in question and that his ability to drive was consequently impaired, and that she, nevertheless, voluntarily rode with him while he was driving his truck; and (3) that Leona\u2019s presence in Charles\u2019 truck at the time of the accident proximately caused her death. Charles acknowledged that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the evidence with regard to the second element came solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>from his testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nonetheless, he claims that, based on the stipulation regarding the events at Mullins\u2019 house and McClanahan\u2019s testimony, it is reasonable to infer that Leona heard the discussion about purchasing beer and the argument that ensued between her sister and Mullins, and that she therefore knew Charles was going to drink and drive that evening. This same evidence, according to Charles, also supports his testimony that he and Leona were together approximately an hour and one-half before the accident. Finally, Charles posits that his BAC level corroborates the fact that he had consumed alcohol before the accident and that his ability to drive was impaired. Thus, he claims that his testimony on this critical element of his defense was sufficiently corroborated. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Code \u00a7 8.01-397 provides that \u201c[i]n an action by or against a person who, from any cause, is incapable of testifying ... no judgment or decree shall be rendered in favor of an adverse or interested party founded on his uncorroborated testimony.\u201d The statute was designed, in part, \u201cto prevent a surviving party from having the benefit of his own testimony where, by reason of the death of his adversary, the latter\u2019s personal representative is deprived of the decedent\u2019s version of the [facts].\u201d <em>Haynes, Ex\u2019x </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>197 Va. 746, 752, 91 S.E.2d 433, 437 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We do not question that certain aspects of Charles\u2019 testimony concerning the events of the evening in question and the circumstances of the accident were corroborated by other evidence. However, the critical, inquiry is whether his testimony presented an essential issue that, if not corroborated, would defeat his contributory negligence defense. <em>See Hereford </em>v. <em>Paytes, </em>226 Va. 604, 608, 311 S.E.2d 790, 792 (1984). We have previously recognized, and we do so again in this appeal, that \u201cit is impossible to formulate a fixed rule as to the corroboration necessary in every situation\u201d because each case must be decided on its particular facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">However, we have stated some general principles that are pertinent here. \u201cIt is not necessary that the corroborative evidence should of itself be sufficient to support a verdict, for then there would be no need for the adverse or interested party\u2019s testimony to be corroborated.\u201d <em>Brooks, Adm\u2019r v. Worthington, </em>206 Va. 352, 357, 143 S.E.2d 841, 845 (1965) (citing <em>Burton\u2019s Ex\u2019r </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>142 Va. 500, 509, 129 S.E. 356, 359 (1925); <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Silvey, Adm\u2019x, </em>148 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>132, 137, 138 S.E. 513, 514 (1927); <em>Clay v. Clay, </em>196 Va. 997, 1002, 86 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1955)). \u201cCorroborating evidence tends to confirm and strengthen the testimony of the witness[,]\u201d and it may come from other witnesses as well as from circumstantial evidence. <em>Hereford, </em>226 Va. at 608, 311 S.E.2d at 792. It is not essential that a survivor\u2019s testimony be corroborated on all material points. Id; <em>Brooks, </em>206 Va. at 357, 143 S.E.2d at 845.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">The corroboration, to be sufficient under the statute, however, must at least tend, \u201cin some degree, of its own strength and independently, to support <em>some essential allegation or issue </em>raised by the pleadings [and] testified to by the [surviving] witness . . . which allegation or issue, if unsupported, <em>would be fatal to the case.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><em>Hereford, </em>226 Va. at 608, 311 S.E.2d at 792 (quoting <em>Burton\u2019s Ex\u2019r, </em>142 Va. at 508, 129 S.E. at 359). (First emphasis added.) <em>Accord Diehl, Adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Butts, 255 </em>Va. 482, 489, 499 S.E.2d 833, 838 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In the present case, we view these principles in the context of the necessary elements of Charles\u2019 contributory negligence defense. \u201c[A] guest may be guilty of contributory negligence if [the guest] knows or reasonably should know that [the] driver had been drinking intoxicating liquor<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to an extent likely to affect the manner of . . . driving and voluntarily continues as a passenger after a reasonable opportunity to leave the automobile.\u201d <em>Meade </em>v. <em>Meade, </em>206 Va. 823, 827, 147 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1966) (citing <em>Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. Terrell, </em>149 Va. 344, 354-55, 141 S.E. 231, 235 (1928); <em>Yorke </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>173 Va. 183, 188, 3 S.E.2d 366, 369 (1939); <em>Bates, Adm\u2019x v. Thompson, </em>200 Va. 501, 506, 106 S.E.2d 728, 732 (1959)). It is not sufficient merely to establish that the driver of an automobile has been drinking and that the passenger knew that fact. <em>Meade, </em>206 Va. at 827, 147 S.E.2d at 174. The evidence must also prove that the driver\u2019s ability to operate the vehicle was impaired because of the consumption of alcoholic beverages, that the passenger knew, or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known, of the driver\u2019s impaired ability, and that the passenger nevertheless entered or continued to ride in the vehicle. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Thus, we conclude that the question whether Leona knew or should have known that Charles\u2019 ability to drive was impaired because of his consumption of beer and she, nevertheless, chose to continue to ride with him is the sole essential issue raised by Charles\u2019 testimony regarding his contributory negligence defense, which, if unsupported by corroborating evidence, is fatal to his defense. <em>See </em>Hereford, 226 Va. at 608, 311 S.E.2d at 792; <em>see also Vaughn </em>v. <em>Shank, </em>248 Va. 224, 229, 445 S.E.2d 127, 130 (1994) (holding that Code \u00a7 8.01-397 required corroboration of sole essential allegation on which claim was based); <em>Ratliff, Adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Jewell, </em>153 Va. 315, 326, 149 S.E. 409, 412 (1929) (\u201cwitness need not be corroborated on all material points, but must be supported on some essential fact whose establishment is necessary to sustain the judgment\u201d). We find no such corroborating evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Even if we accept the stipulation and McClanahan\u2019s testimony about the events at Mullins\u2019 house as corroboration of Charles\u2019 testimony that Leona knew about the plans to purchase beer, there nevertheless is not even a scintilla of evidence that \u201ctends to confirm and strengthen\u201d his assertion that Leona knew or should have known that his ability to drive was impaired. <em>Hereford, </em>226 Va. at 608, 311 S.E.2d at 792. Instead, we find evidence supporting a different conclusion. Charles testified that, even though he felt a \u201cbuzz\u201d when he stopped to use the bathroom, he did not have any trouble with his driving and did not believe anyone would view him as intoxicated. Furthermore, the toxicologist stated that Charles\u2019 degree of intoxication would not have been apparent to an objective observer because of his history of excessive drinking. Thus, rather than having corroborating evidence that Leona knew that Charles\u2019 ability to drive was impaired that evening, the record actually contains evidence indicating the opposite. Nor is there evidence to corroborate Charles\u2019 testimony that Leona voluntarily continued to ride in his truck with him even though she allegedly knew the extent of his drinking on that evening, and never asked to get out of the truck or to go home.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Thus, we conclude that, while corroboration on all material points of Charles\u2019 contributory negligence defense is not necessary, the essential issue raised by his testimony remains unsupported. Hence, the circuit court did not err in striking Charles\u2019 contributory negligence defense and submitting the case to the jury solely on the issue of damages. Generally, when there is more than a scintilla of corroborating evidence, the question whether testimony has been sufficiently corroborated is an issue for the jury to resolve. <em>Brooks, </em>206 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Va. at 357, 143 S.E.2d at 845 (citing <em>Timberlake\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>158 Va. 397, 403, 163 S.E. 402, 404 (1932)). However, for the reasons already stated, the circuit court correctly determined that Charles\u2019 testimony was not corroborated as a matter of law. <em>See Whitmer v. Marcum, Adm\u2019x, </em>214 Va. 64, 68, 196 S.E.2d 907, 910 (1973) (\u201ccorroboration need not always present a jury issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Since Charles admitted his liability and the court properly struck his defense of contributory negligence, the only issue for the jury\u2019s consideration was that concerning the question of damages. Thus, we turn to the Rices\u2019 assignment of error regarding the amount of damages awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The Rices argue that the jury verdict in the exact amount of Leona\u2019s funeral expenses was inadequate as a matter of law because the verdict failed to compensate the statutory beneficiaries for the non-monetary elements of damage, such as sorrow, mental anguish, and loss of solace, despite uncontroverted evidence with regard to such damages. In response, Charles contends that, because the jury was instructed that it \u201cmay\u201d consider items of non-economic damages but \u201cshall\u201d award damages for funeral expenses, the verdict is proper and supported by the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the Rices.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Sprouse, </em>254 Va. 428, 492 S.E.2d 637 (1997), this Court held that \u201ca jury award in a personal injury action which compensates a plaintiff for the exact amount of the plaintiff\u2019s medical expenses and other special damages is inadequate as a matter of law, irrespective of whether those damages were controverted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431, 492 S.E.2d at 639. Similarly, in <em>Johnson, Adm\u2019r v. Smith, </em>241 Va. 396, 403 S.E.2d 685 (1991), we examined the adequacy of a damage award in a wrongful death action. In <em>Johnson, </em>the verdict represented only about two years of the decedent\u2019s income for the widow, and only slightly more than one year of the decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>income for each of two children. The verdict did not include any sum for sorrow, mental anguish, and solace for the decedent\u2019s widow and children, nor any sum for the children\u2019s lost services and protection. <em>Id. </em>at 399, 403 S.E.2d at 686. We found that verdict \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe jury must have misconceived or misunderstood the facts or the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400-01, 403 S.E.2d at 687. <em>Accord Hall, Adm\u2019x v. Hall, </em>240 Va. 360, 365, 397 S.E.2d 829, 832 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">We reach the same conclusion in this case. The jury verdict for the exact amount of Leona\u2019s funeral expenses was inadequate as a matter of law because it failed to compensate her statutory beneficiaries for any other items of damage despite the fact that the court instructed the jury that Charles was liable for Leona\u2019s death and any damages suffered by her parents and her sister. By returning a verdict for only the amount of the funeral expenses, the jury demonstrated a misunderstanding of either the law or the facts, or both. Furthermore, the evidence at trial clearly supported the conclusion that Leona\u2019s statutory beneficiaries experienced sorrow, mental anguish, and loss of solace as a result of Leona\u2019s death. Thus, they were entitled to compensation for these elements of damage. <em>See Bowers, </em>254 Va. at 431, 492 S.E.2d at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Our conclusion is not changed by the fact that the circuit court instructed the jury that it <em>\u201cshall </em>award damages for . . . reasonable funeral expenses\u201d but <em>\u201cmay </em>consider . . . any sorrow, mental anguish, and loss of solace suffered by the beneficiaries.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We agree with Charles that this instruction is the law of this case because the circuit court gave it to the jury without any objection by the Rices, <em>see King v. Sowers, </em>252 Va. 71, 77, 471 S.E.2d 481, 484 (1996), and that the instruction does not incorporate the precise language of Code \u00a7 8.01-52.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, we do not accept Charles\u2019 argument that the jury followed the instructions given to it and elected, as it was told it could by use of the term \u201cmay,\u201d not to award any damages for non-economic losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The damage instruction given to the jury in <em>Bowers </em>also used the term \u201cmay\u201d with regard to the elements of damage to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>considered by the jury. 254 Va. at 431 n.3, 492 S.E.2d at 638 n.2. Notwithstanding that fact, we did not approve the verdict, but instead concluded that the jury verdict for the exact amount of the plaintiff\u2019s medical expenses and other special damages in that case was inadequate as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 431, 492 S.E.2d at 639. Similarly, the use of the term \u201cmay\u201d rather than \u201cshall\u201d with regard to damages for sorrow, mental anguish, and loss of solace does not justify the jury\u2019s failure in this case to compensate the statutory beneficiaries for any other items of damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial solely on the issue of damages. <em>See Rawle v. McIlhenny, </em>163 Va. 735, 748, 177 S.E. 214, 220 (1934) (when evidence is insufficient to support verdict finding defendant not liable, new trial is limited to question of damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-13\"> The purpose of the Death by Wrongful Act statute is to compensate a decedent\u2019s statutory beneficiaries for their loss resulting from the decedent\u2019s death. <em>Wilson v.
