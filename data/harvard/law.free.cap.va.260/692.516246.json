Pitt, of attempted robbery and fixed his punishment at ten years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of $50,000. The trial court\u2019s judgment approved the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">Pitt appealed the judgment to the Court of Appeals, and a panel of the Court affirmed the conviction. Following a hearing <em>en banc, </em>the trial court\u2019s judgment was again affirmed, without opinion, by an evenly-divided Court. <em>Pitt </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>31 Va. App. 173, 521 S.E.2d 790, vacating 28 Va. App. 730, 508 S.E.2d 891 (1999). We awarded Pitt this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On May 29, 1996, about 4:00 a.m., Randy Williams, the victim, was walking alone on Birdneck Road in the City of Virginia Beach. While Williams was in the process of turning onto Virginia Beach Boulevard, three men on bicycles approached him. Two of the men rode past Williams, but the third man, Pitt, stopped and spoke. Pitt asked Williams if he was \u201clooking,\u201d and Williams believed that Pitt was referring to drugs. Williams told Pitt that he was not interested, and Pitt rode away.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Williams then crossed the street to a service station. He took a $20 bill from his pocket, folded it, and put it in his mouth because he believed \u201c[sjomething was going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">A short time later, Pitt and one of the other riders, Lambert L. Bonds, Pitt\u2019s co-defendant, again approached Williams. They began to follow Williams and ask him \u201ccrazy questions about drugs.\u201d Williams continued to walk down the street, and he told the two men that he did not \u201cdo\u201d drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Williams crossed the street, and, after Pitt and Bonds passed a building on a street comer, Williams \u201ccut back\u201d to avoid further contact with the two men. About that time, however, Pitt jumped off his bicycle, grabbed Williams, and began to wrestle with him. Bonds then joined in the straggle and helped to hold Williams down while Pitt \u201cwas sticking his hands in [Williams\u2019] mouth.\u201d About that time, the police arrived at the scene and apprehended Pitt and Bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Pitt and Bonds gave statements to a police detective after being advised of and waiving their <em>Miranda </em>rights. Pitt told the detective that he had straggled with Williams in an attempt to retrieve cocaine from Williams\u2019 mouth. Pitt explained that he, with Bonds\u2019 help, had gotten Williams to the ground and that he had tried to pry open Williams\u2019 mouth with his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Bonds told the detective that, when Pitt and Williams got into a straggle, he tackled both men. Bonds explained that he did this because Williams \u201cwas getting the better of Pitt.\u201d Bonds also said that, as he helped to hold Williams, Pitt tried to open Williams\u2019 mouth to get cocaine. Over Pitt\u2019s objection, Bonds\u2019 recorded statement was played to the jury at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">The trial court ordered a joint trial for Pitt and Bonds over Pitt\u2019s objection. Pitt contended that he and Bonds would be prejudiced by a joint trial because each had given a statement to police that could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>be used against the other. At the joint trial, the two statements were admitted into evidence, but the trial court instructed the jury that each defendant\u2019s statement was not evidence against the other and could not be considered in determining the other\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">On appeal, Pitt contends that his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was compromised because Bonds\u2019 statement was not subject to cross-examination.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Commonwealth counters that Pitt\u2019s right of confrontation was not violated because Bonds\u2019 statement was inherently reliable and was fully corroborated by other evidence, including Pitt\u2019s own statement to police. In the alternative, the Commonwealth contends that \u201cany conceivable error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">We will assume, without deciding, that the admission into evidence of Bonds\u2019 statement in the circumstances of this case constituted error. Our inquiry, then, is whether the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">When a federal constitutional error is involved, a reversal is required unless the reviewing court determines that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). The reviewing court must determine \u201c \u2018whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23 (quoting <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>375 U.S. 85, 86-87 (1963)). In making that determination, the court must consider, among other factors, \u201cthe importance of the tainted evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether that evidence was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the tainted evidence on material points, and the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 548, 551, 523 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1999) (citing <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">To convict Pitt of attempted robbery, the Commonwealth is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Pitt intended to steal personal property from Williams, against his will, by force, violence, or intimidation. Additionally, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Pitt committed a direct, but ineffectual, act to accomplish the crime. <em>See Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 291, 293, 163 S.E.2d 570, 572-73 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">In the present case, Williams, the victim, positively identified Pitt as his principal assailant a short time after the offense had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>committed, and Pitt was apprehended near the crime scene. More importantly, Pitt\u2019s own statement to police confirmed that he had attacked and struggled with Williams with intent to steal some personal property from Williams\u2019 mouth. Pitt admitted that he had attempted to pry Williams\u2019 mouth open to get what he thought was cocaine. On these material points, Pitt\u2019s statement is consistent with Bonds\u2019 statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Clearly, Bonds\u2019 statement was not important to the Commonwealth\u2019s case; it was, at most, merely cumulative. Moreover, all of the other evidence tended to corroborate, rather than contradict, Bonds\u2019 statement on material points. Indeed, the evidence as a whole, excluding Bonds\u2019 statement, overwhelmingly proved that Pitt is guilty of attempted robbery. We conclude, therefore, that there was no reasonable possibility that Bonds\u2019 statement might have contributed to Pitt\u2019s conviction. Thus, we hold that, even if the admission of Bonds\u2019 statement compromised Pitt\u2019s right of confrontation, the error, in the circumstances of this case, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\"> Amendment VI to the Constitution of the United States provides, in pertinent part, that an accused \u201cshall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
