The question presented is whether the Court of Appeals of Virginia erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>in affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment that the evidence was sufficient to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In 1997, defendant Tomika T. Taylor was found guilty in a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Greensville County of abduction in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-47 as a principal in the second degree, Code \u00a7 18.2-18. She was sentenced to eight years\u2019 confinement, suspended except for time served prior to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">On appeal, a panel of the Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction, holding the evidence was insufficient to convict. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>28 Va. App. 498, 507 S.E.2d 89 (1998). Upon a rehearing <em>en banc, </em>the Court of Appeals, in a 7-2 decision, withdrew the panel opinion and affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, holding the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction on the theory of accomplice liability. <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va. App. 54, 521 S.E.2d 293 (1999). We awarded defendant this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Employing settled principles of appellate review, we shall recite the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the trial court. In December 1996, Meshia Powell, age 16, and her ten-month-old son resided in Emporia. The child was the illegitimate son of Avery Moore, formerly of Hampton. The father resided in Decatur, Georgia, with defendant, his \u201cfiance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">On the day of this offense, December 26, there had been no custody or support proceedings involving the child in any court. The father, who was absent at the child\u2019s birth, was paying no child support. He had seen the child only once, when the mother took the child to Hampton.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">During the early morning hours of the day in question, the father and the defendant were en route from Hampton to Georgia. The couple stopped at the home of the mother\u2019s aunt in Southampton County. The father told the aunt, that \u201che had come to take the baby.\u201d He then spoke by telephone with the mother indicating \u201che had gifts for the baby,\u201d and, upon defendant\u2019s suggestion, told the mother that the child\u2019s grandmother was in the car with the couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Upon arrival at the mother\u2019s Emporia home, where she lived with her father, the couple \u201cpushed\u201d their way into the house. The child\u2019s mother refused the natural father\u2019s request to see the child. An argument ensued and the baby fell to the floor from the mother\u2019s arms. Defendant and the mother \u201cstarted fighting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">During the melee, the defendant \u201cpassed\u201d the child to his father, ran outside, \u201cand jumped in the car.\u201d She called to the child\u2019s father to \u201churry up, hurry up.\u201d The father entered the vehicle with the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>and they left with the defendant driving. Shortly, the defendant was found with the child and the father in Atlanta, Georgia, where she was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">At the time of this offense, and before its 1997 amendment, Code \u00a7 18.2-47 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">\u201cAny person, who, by force, intimidation or deception, and without legal justification or excuse, seizes, takes, transports, detains or secretes the person of another, with the intent to deprive such other person of his personal liberty or to withhold or conceal him from any person, authority or institution lawfully entitled to his charge, shall be deemed guilty of \u2018abduction\u2019; but the provisions of this section shall not apply to any law-enforcement officer in the performance of his duty. The terms \u2018abduction\u2019 and \u2018kidnapping\u2019 shall be synonymous in this Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">Abduction for which no punishment is otherwise prescribed shall be punished as a Class 5 felony; provided, however, that such offense, if committed by the parent of the person abducted and punishable as contempt of court in any proceeding then pending, shall be a Class 1 misdemeanor in addition to being punishable as contempt of court. Provided further, however, that such offense, if committed by the parent of the person abducted and punishable as contempt of court in any proceeding then pending and the person abducted is removed from the Commonwealth by the abducting parent, shall be a Class 6 felony in addition to being punishable as contempt of court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">In this appeal, defendant contends that the Court of Appeals incorrectly affirmed her conviction, arguing that the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt was erroneous both factually and legally. Factually, she says, relying on a version of the facts favorable to her, there was no evidence of a designed plan to take the child, only proof that the snatching was done on impulse. Legally, she says, there was no accomplice liability because the father had \u201clegal justification,\u201d in the words of the statute, to take the child \u201cand thus could not be guilty ... of abduction of his own child.\u201d We do not agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Initially, the law of accomplice liability should be reviewed. Generally, in the case of every felony, a principal in the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>degree may be indicted, tried, convicted, and punished in all respects as if a principal in the first degree. Code \u00a7 18.2-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">A person who is present at the commission of a crime, inciting, encouraging, advising or assisting in the act done, is deemed to be an aider and abettor, and is liable as principal. <em>Snyder v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 1009, 1015, 121 S.E.2d 452, 457 (1961). However, \u201cbefore the accessory to a crime can be convicted as such, it must be shown that the crime has been committed by the principal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1017, 121 S.E.2d at 458. But it is unnecessary that the principal should be convicted of the basic offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The question then becomes whether the evidence establishes that the natural father, the alleged principal in the first degree, committed the crime of abduction of his illegitimate son.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The substantive provisions of the abduction statute are clear and unambiguous; they plainly permit prosecution of a father for the abduction of his child. The statute proscribes the conduct of \u201c[a]ny person.\u201d The only person exempted from that statutory term is \u201cany law-enforcement officer in the performance of his duty.\u201d <em>See Diehl v. Commonwealth, 9 </em>Va. App. 191, 194, 385 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">There is no statutory exception for a parent. Indeed, the terms of the second paragraph of the statute specifically contemplate, in two places, the offense being \u201ccommitted by the parent of the person abducted.\u201d This is a clear indication of legislative intent that a child\u2019s parent can be guilty of the crime of abducting it. That has not always been the law of Virginia. Formerly, parents were exempted from child abduction statutes. <em>See </em>Code of 1877-78, \u00a7 3713; Code of 1919, \u00a7 4409.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The next operative terms of the statute require proof that \u201cby force, intimidation or deception\u201d the child was taken, transported, detained or secreted with the intent to deprive the child of his personal liberty or to withhold it from any person lawfully entitled to his charge. The proof in this case clearly meets those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">All of the statutory elements were established. The father, accompanied by defendant, forcibly entered the home where the child resided in the mother\u2019s lawful, physical custody. Falsely asserting that a grandmother was waiting in their vehicle outside the home, the father, accompanied by defendant, by intimidation and deception, snatched the child in the midst of a melee from his mother\u2019s control, transported him to Georgia with the obvious intent to withhold him from the mother, who was lawfully entitled to his charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>The final operative terms of the statute require that the forcible seizure be \u201cwithout legal justification or excuse.\u201d As we have stated, counsel for the defendant in this appeal relies solely on the proposition that \u201cAvery Moore had \u2018lawful [sic] justification\u2019 to take his own child and thus could not be guilty under the circumstances of this case of abduction.\u201d Therefore, our inquiry will be confined solely to the \u201clegal justification\u201d language of the statute; defendant has not focused here on the word \u201cexcuse.\u201d Indeed, in this appeal the defendant states that \u201cthe point of contention\u201d in this case should not be whether the conduct was \u201c \u2018excused\u2019 (as the majority [of the Court of Appeals] chooses to narrowly define that term. . . .)\u201d After noting defendant argued \u201cthat the father\u2019s legal justification in taking the child precludes her conviction,\u201d 31 Va. App. at 57, 521 S.E.2d at 294, the Court of Appeals decided the case on the \u201cexcuse\u201d language and said that \u201cthe defense of \u2018legal excuse,\u2019 is personal to Moore and unavailable to [defendant].\u201d 31 Va. App. at 64, 521 S.E.2d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In order to determine whether the father\u2019s conduct was with \u201clegal justification,\u201d the nature of his rights regarding his illegitimate child under the circumstances of this case must be examined. In passing, however, we observe that the father, who did not appear as a witness at defendant\u2019s trial, never expressly claimed during this episode that he relied on any legal justification in taking his son from the mother. Nevertheless, we will assume that such reliance is implicit in his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">At common law, a father and his illegitimate child shared no legal relationship whatever, and the putative father was under no obligation to contribute to the child\u2019s support. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>183 Va. 353, 355, 32 S.E.2d 79, 80 (1944). In modem times, however, the harsh common-law rules on the subject of parental rights and responsibilities regarding illegitimate children have been modified by statute and case law. Nevertheless, upon birth of an illegitimate child, the right of the natural mother to immediate custody is superior. <em>Commonwealth v. Hayes, </em>215 Va. 49, 52, 205 S.E.2d 644, 647 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">In discussing the due process rights of \u201can unmarried father\u2019s inchoate relationship with a child whom he has never supported and rarely seen in the two years since her birth,\u201d the Supreme Court of the United States draws a \u201cclear distinction between a mere biological relationship and an actual relationship of parental responsibility.\u201d <em>Lehr </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 249-50, 258-60 (1983). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Court stated that even though each married parent has some substantive due process right to maintain his or her parental relationship, it does not follow that each unwed parent has any such right. The Court said that, in most cases, parental rights require enduring relationships and do not spring full-blown from the biological connection between parent and child. <em>Id. </em>at 260. <em>Cf. Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645 (1972) (Due Process Clause violated by automatic destruction of custodial relationship without giving father of illegitimate child any opportunity to present evidence regarding his fitness as a parent); Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 20-124.2 (in determining custody and the best interests of the child, there shall be no presumption or inference of law in favor of either parent).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In the present case, Avery Moore had only a biological relationship, and none other, with his child. He was absent at the child\u2019s birth, he had not contributed to the child\u2019s support, and he had not visited the child, seeing him only once, when the mother brought the child to him. The child had been in the physical custody of the mother continuously since birth. And, there were no proceedings pending in any court regarding the child\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Under these circumstances, the father had no sufficient \u201clegal justification,\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 18.2-47, for his conduct in forcibly taking the child from the mother\u2019s custody. The word \u201cjustification\u201d simply means \u201c[a] lawful or sufficient reason for one\u2019s acts or omissions;\u201d it sometimes is referred to as the \u201cjustification defense\u201d or the \u201cnecessity defense.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 870 (7th ed. 1999). Manifestly, the father\u2019s biological relationship did not give him sufficient reason or furnish any necessity for his acts. He had no actual relationship of parental responsibility. Therefore, we hold that the evidence establishes that the father, the principal in the first degree, committed the crime of abduction of his illegitimate son.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Because the principal in the first degree committed the abduction, we hold the defendant properly was found guilty as a principal in the second degree. She was present at the commission of the crime, she incited, encouraged, advised, and assisted the father in committing the crime, and she is liable as an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Consequently, the judgment of the Court of Appeals will be</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b710-9\">JUSTICE HASSELL,</author>\n<p id=\"An1\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>I join the majority\u2019s opinion in its entirety. The majority states that \u201cupon birth of an illegitimate child, the right of the natural mother to immediate custody is superior.\u201d I write separately solely to emphasize that the natural mother\u2019s superior right to \u201cimmediate custody\u201d of her child does not extend to any judicial proceedings that may ensue if the unmarried father seeks custody of the child. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
