Therefore, we must adopt the facts and inferences from those facts that are most favorable to the nonmoving party, Cynthia A. Lindsay, unless those inferences are forced, strained, or contrary to reason. <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Selective Ins. Co. of America, </em>250 Va. 282, 283, 462 S.E.2d 81, 82 (1995); <em>Renner </em>v. <em>Stafford, </em>245 Va. 351, 353, 429 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">Lindsay executed a written \u201cExclusive Right to Represent Buyer Agreement\u201d with McEnearney Associates, Inc., which gave McEnearney Associates the exclusive right to represent Lindsay in any real estate transactions for the purchase of a home. The written agreement required Lindsay to pay McEnearney Associates a commission of three percent of the sales price of any residential real property that Lindsay purchased between August 13, 1997, and November 30, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Subsequently, Lindsay signed a sales contract for the purchase of property located at 2343 South Nash Street in Arlington County. She negotiated the price and terms of the sale \u201con her own,\u201d and she purchased the property without the assistance of McEneamey Associates. Lindsay claimed that she entered into an oral agreement with Loretta Connor, McEneamey Associates\u2019 sales associate. Pursuant to the terms of that parol agreement, Lindsay claims that she was required to pay to McEneamey Associates a commission of one percent rather than three percent because Lindsay found the property that she purchased without the assistance of McEneamey Associates. She closed on the property, and a statement shows that McEneamey Associates received a commission of one percent. In response to requests for admission, Lindsay admitted that she did not sign a written modification of the \u201cexclusive right to represent buyer agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">McEneamey Associates filed a warrant in debt against Lindsay in the Arlington County General District Court and alleged that Lindsay breached the written agreement. Lindsay alleged in the general district court that McEneamey Associates breached the agreement, and she asserted that the written contract had been orally modified. She asserted a defense of accord and satisfaction based upon the oral modification. Lindsay also filed a counterclaim, seeking a refund of an earnest money deposit on a real estate contract that was never accepted. The general district court entered a judgment in favor of Lindsay, and McEneamey Associates appealed the judgment to the circuit court for a trial <em>de novo </em>as permitted by Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-106 and -107. Lindsay did not appeal the general district court\u2019s judgment denying her counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">McEneamey Associates filed a motion for summary judgment in the circuit court and asserted that it was entitled to judgment because the \u201cexclusive right to represent buyer agreement\u201d required that Lindsay pay McEneamey Associates a three percent sales commission in the event that Lindsay purchased residential property, that Lindsay purchased and closed upon such property, but she only paid a one percent commission to McEneamey Associates. Continuing, McEneamey Associates asserted that the written \u201cexclusive right to represent buyer agreement\u201d could not be modified orally. Responding, Lindsay asserted in the circuit court that the contract between the parties had been modified orally and that she had a viable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>defense of accord and satisfaction that could not be defeated by the statute of frauds. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of McEneamey Associates, and Lindsay appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Code \u00a7 11-2, often referred to as the statute of frauds, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201cUnless a promise, contract, agreement, representation, assurance, or ratification, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be charged or his agent, no action shall be brought in any of the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201c7. Upon any agreement or contract for services to be performed in the sale of real estate by a party defined in \u00a7 54.1-2100 or \u00a7 54.1-2101. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Code \u00a7 54.1-2100 defines real estate broker as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">\u201cany person or business entity, including, but not limited to, a partnership, association, corporation, or limited liability corporation, who, for compensation or valuable consideration (i) sells or offers for sale, buys or offers to buy, or negotiates the purchase or sale or exchange of real estate . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Code \u00a7 54.1-2101 defines real estate salesperson as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\">\u201cany person, or business entity of not more than two persons unless related by blood or marriage, who for compensation or valuable consideration is employed either directly or indirectly by, or affiliated as an independent contractor with, a real estate broker, to sell or offer to sell, or to buy or offer to buy, or to negotiate the purchase, sale or exchange of real estate, or to lease, rent or offer for rent any real estate, or to negotiate leases thereof, or of the improvements thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Lindsay argues that the statute of frauds does not apply to the written contract she signed with McEneamey Associates or, alternatively, that the statute of frauds has no application here because the contract has been fully performed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The purposes of Code \u00a7 11-2 are to provide reliable evidence of the existence and terms of certain types of contracts and to reduce the likelihood that contracts within the scope of this statute can be created or altered by acts of perjury or fraud. For example, we stated in <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>187 Va. 101, 106, 46 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1948), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">\u201c[tjhe statute [of frauds] was founded in wisdom and sound policy. Its primary object was to prevent the setting up of pretended agreements and then supporting them by perjury. There is further a manifest policy of requiring contracts of so important a nature as the sale and purchase of real estate to be reduced to writing since otherwise, from the imperfection of memory and the honest mistakes of witnesses, it often happens either that the specific contract is incapable of exact proof or that it is unintentionally varied from its original terms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><em>Accord Wright </em>v. <em>Pucket, </em>63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 370, 373 (1872).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">We held in <em>Heth\u2019s </em>v. <em>Wooldridge\u2019s, </em>27 Va. (6 Rand.) 605, 609-11 (1828), that the statute of frauds rendered unenforceable an oral modification of a written contract for the sale of land. Explaining our holding, we stated that the parol modification of an agreement required to be in writing by the statute of frauds would permit \u201cthe very mischiefs which the statute meant to prevent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The written contract that Lindsay executed with McEneamey Associates falls within the scope of Code \u00a7 11-2 because the contract is an agreement for services to be performed in the sale of real estate by a real estate broker and a real estate salesperson. Applying our established precedent, we hold that when, as here, a contract is required to be in writing pursuant to Code \u00a7 11-2, any modification to that contract must also be in writing and signed by the party to be charged or his agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">It is true, as Lindsay observes, that in certain circumstances written contracts, even those that contain prohibitions against unwritten modifications, may be modified by parol agreement. <em>See Reid </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>259 Va. 356, 369-70, 527 S.E.2d 137, 145 (2000). This principle, however, does not apply to an agreement which must be in writing to satisfy Code \u00a7 11-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">We find no merit in Lindsay\u2019s contention that the statute of frauds does not apply to her agreement with McEneamey Associates because the agreement has been fully performed. The agreement has not been fully performed because, as Lindsay admitted in the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>court, she failed to pay McEneamey Associates three percent of the sales price of the real property she purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Lindsay argues that the circuit court erred by ruling that the statute of frauds barred the presentation of her evidence of an accord and satisfaction as a defense to McEneamey Associates\u2019 breach of contract claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We have discussed the following principles of accord and satisfaction which are equally pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201c \u2018Accord and satisfaction is a method of discharging a contract or cause of action, whereby the parties agree to give and accept something in settlement of the claim or demand of the one against the other, and perform such agreement, the \u201caccord\u201d being the agreement, and the \u201csatisfaction\u201d its execution or performance.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">\u201c \u2018The thing agreed to be given or done in satisfaction must be offered and intended by the debtor as full satisfaction, and accepted as such by the creditor.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u201c \u2018Thus an accord and satisfaction is founded on contract embracing an offer and acceptance. The acceptance, of course, may be implied, and as a general rule, where the amount due is unliquidated, <em>i.e., </em>disputed, and a remittance of an amount less than that claimed is sent to the creditor with a statement that it is in full satisfaction of the claim, or is accompanied by such acts or declarations as amount to a condition that if accepted, it is accepted in full satisfaction, and the creditor accepts it with knowledge of such condition, then accord and satisfaction results.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-9\"><em>Virginia-Carolina Elec. Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>192 Va. 78, 80-81, 63 S.E.2d 717, 718-19 (1951) (citations omitted); <em>accord John Grier Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Jones Welding &amp; Repair, Inc., </em>238 Va. 270, 272, 383 S.E.2d 719, 720-21 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">We hold that the statute of frauds does not permit Lindsay to establish a defense of accord and satisfaction. The purported contract that constitutes the accord is predicated upon the existence of an oral modification of Lindsay\u2019s written \u201cexclusive right to represent buyer agreement\u201d with McEneamey Associates. Yet, as we have already stated, Code \u00a7 11-2 requires that any modifications to that contract must be in writing. Thus, Lindsay cannot assert the defense of accord and satisfaction based on a contract that violates the statute of frauds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Approval of this defense in these circumstances would permit Lindsay to circumvent the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">In view of our holdings, we need not consider Lindsay\u2019s remaining contentions. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
