The dispositive issue is whether, and to whom, ownership of a particular automobile was transferred as the result of the owner endorsing the certificate of title for that vehicle but leaving the name of the transferee blank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The parties do not dispute the principal facts. Shannon Scarborough (Scarborough) was at one time the owner of a 1982 Buick Regal automobile (the Buick). The Buick had been purchased for her by Lawrence Ferrell (Ferrell\u2019s father), the father of her boyfriend Sean R Ferrell (Ferrell). Scarborough was living in the Ferrell household at the time. Ferrell\u2019s father had the Buick titled in Scarborough\u2019s name. In December, 1996, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (Nationwide) issued a motor vehicle liability insurance policy to Scarborough on the Buick.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">According to Ferrell\u2019s father, although the Buick was purchased for Scarborough to drive \u201cback and forth to work,\u201d he intended \u201cto give the car to both Shannon and to [his] son.\u201d The Buick was \u201cavailable for both of them to drive,\u201d but was titled in Scarborough\u2019s name alone because his son\u2019s driving record would have resulted in a higher insurance rate for the vehicle had it been titled in his son\u2019s name. Ferrell and Scarborough each had a set of keys for the Buick, and Ferrell drove the Buick \u201cpretty much\u201d whenever he wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In January 1997, Scarborough planned to move to Georgia to live with her father. Ferrell\u2019s father \u201ctold her we were going to sell [the Buick] and since it was in her name she\u2019d have to sign the title.\u201d Scarborough thought that \u201c[t]he car didn\u2019t belong to me . . . and once [I\u2019d] gone [to Georgia] I\u2019d go ahead and sign the title over to [Ferrell\u2019s father].\u201d While Ferrell\u2019s father \u201cwas out of town,\u201d Ferrell and Scarborough \u201cgot into an argument, and she signed [the certificate of title]\u201d leaving it and the Buick with Ferrell and moved to her sister\u2019s house. Regarding the circumstances of Scarborough\u2019s signing the certificate of title, according to Ferrell \u201c[s]he said that she was leaving and I asked her if she would sign the title over to me because a friend of mine, . . . wanted to buy the [Buick].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Scarborough signed her name and entered the date on the certificate of title. However, she did not complete the assignment of title by filling in the name of the intended transferee in the space provided for that purpose on the certificate. Scarborough understood that she was not to receive any money from the transfer of ownership of the Buick.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>After Scarborough signed the certificate of title to the Buick and left the vehicle with him, Ferrell \u201c[u]sed [the Buick] when [he] needed to\u201d without \u201cask[ing] anybody\u2019s permission to drive the car.\u201d According to Ferrell, his father had a set of keys only to \u201cmove [the Buick] in our yard.\u201d Ferrell made premium payments to Nationwide on Scarborough\u2019s insurance policy because \u201cshe didn\u2019t want me to get caught driving [the Buick] without insurance.\u201d Ferrell also \u201cpurchased a city sticker, inspection sticker and paid the personal property tax and everything in February so that it would still be legal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">On March 28, 1997, Ferrell, while operating the Buick, was involved in an accident with a motor vehicle occupied by Steve Vitek and Martha Vitek, resulting in alleged personal injuries to the Viteks. At that time, Ferrell was the named insured under a motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued to him by Atlanta Casualty Company (Atlanta Casualty) on his 1979 Plymouth Volare. At that same time Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) was the issuer of an automobile liability insurance policy, including uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, on the Viteks\u2019 vehicle. Martha Vitek filed a lawsuit against Ferrell, alleging that he negligently caused the accident and her injuries. During the pendency of that lawsuit and in anticipation of a potential lawsuit by Steve Vitek, Atlanta Casualty filed a declaratory judgment suit against Ferrell, the Viteks, Nationwide, and Allstate. Atlanta Casualty sought a declaration that it was not required to provide a defense to Ferrell or to provide coverage for any liability he might incur as a result of the accident. Atlanta Casualty asserted that the Buick was owned by Scarborough at the time of the accident and was not a qualified \u201cnon-owned vehicle or substitute vehicle within the confines of the declaration of [Ferrell\u2019s] policy\u201d with Atlanta Casualty.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Thereafter, Nationwide filed its grounds of defense, denying that Scarborough was the owner of the Buick at the time of the accident. Allstate filed an \u201canswer,\u201d asserting that it should be dismissed from the proceedings because the motion for declaratory judgment made no claim for relief against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Following a hearing at which evidence in accord with the above-recounted facts was received <em>ore terms </em>by the chancellor, the parties presented their respective positions to the chancellor in oral argument supplemented by trial and letter briefs. In summary, Atlanta Casualty contended that the attempted transfer of ownership of the Buick by Scarborough had failed because no transferee\u2019s name was entered on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the certificate of title. Thus, because the Buick was a non-owned vehicle regularly furnished for Ferrell\u2019s use, it was subject to an exclusion in his insurance policy with Atlanta Casualty, and primary coverage rested with Nationwide as the insurer of the Buick under Scarborough\u2019s policy. Nationwide contended that the transfer of ownership was effective and, thus, that the Buick was no longer owned by Scarborough, its named insured. Allstate maintained that regardless of whether the transfer of ownership had been effective, the Buick qualified as a \u201cnon-owned vehicle\u201d subject to coverage under Ferrell\u2019s policy with Atlanta Casualty.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">By letter opinion dated May 7, 1999 and subsequently incorporated by reference in the final order, the chancellor ruled that \u201cthe Buick . . . was owned at the time [of the accident] by Shannon Scarborough. She had failed to correctly and fully endorse the title certificate. Scarborough\u2019s \u2018gift\u2019 of the car failed because of an unspecified donee.\u201d Accordingly, the chancellor ruled that Nationwide is responsible for defending and indemnifying Ferrell for any and all claims and lawsuits arising out of the March 28, 1997, motor vehicle accident involving Ferrell and the Viteks. The chancellor further ruled that \u201cthe Atlanta [Casualty] policy has no coverage in this case since the car was owned by Scarborough and Ferrell was not using the Buick as a \u2018temporary substitute vehicle.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Prior to the entry of the final order, Allstate sought reconsideration by the chancellor of the issue whether coverage under Atlanta Casualty\u2019s policy was not also available. Allstate asserted that the ineffective attempt to transfer ownership of the Buick did not amount to permission by Scarborough for regular use of the vehicle by Ferrell and, thus, that his policy with Atlanta Casualty would afford coverage for his casual use of the Buick.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In a final order dated July 13, 1999, the chancellor denied Allstate\u2019s motion to reconsider and entered judgment for Atlanta Casualty in accord with the rulings of his May 7, 1999 letter opinion. We awarded appeals to both Nationwide and Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The focus on the determination of the ownership of the Buick by the parties here and in the trial court is for the obvious reason that \u201c[t]here is no insurance separate and distinct from the ownership of the car.\u201d <em>Nationwide Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>203 Va. 337, 341, 124 S.E.2d 203, 206 (1962) (citation omitted). Accordingly, in its appeal, Nationwide contends that the chancellor erred in ruling that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Scarborough remained the owner of the Buick after she signed the certificate of title and surrendered possession and control of the vehicle. Allstate contends that regardless of whether the transfer of ownership was effective, Ferrell\u2019s use of the Buick was only casual and not expressly with the owner\u2019s permission and, thus, was not subject to the exclusion in his policy relied upon by Atlanta Casualty. As will become clear, we need address only the first of these two issues regarding the ownership of the Buick.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">In order to complete the sale of a motor vehicle, it is essential that the owner deliver to the transferee a proper assignment of title. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Mullin, </em>153 Va. 383, 391, 149 S.E.2d 494, 497 (1929). Code \u00a7 46.2-628 governs the manner in which a proper assignment of title is made and provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[tjhe owner of a motor vehicle . . . when transferring or assigning his title . . . shall fully and correctly endorse the assignment and warranty of title on the certificate of title of the motor vehicle ... to its purchaser . . . and shall deliver the certificate to the purchaser or transferee at the time of delivering the motor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">However, Code \u00a746.2-630 further provides that <em>\u201c[t]he transferee </em>shall write his name and address in ink on the certificate of title and . . . shall within thirty days forward the certificate to the Department with an application for the registration of the motor vehicle .. . and for a certificate of title.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, it is the responsibility of the transferee, not the owner, to enter on the received certificate of title the name in which the new certificate of title will be issued. Common experience tells us that the purchaser or transferee of a motor vehicle often will desire to have the vehicle titled, either jointly or separately, in the name of another. Indeed, that is what occurred in this case when Ferrell\u2019s father pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>chased the Buick and had it titled in Scarborough\u2019s name. Thus, Scarborough\u2019s failure to complete the assignment of title by entering the name of the transferee on the certificate of title does not, <em>per se, </em>defeat the transfer of her ownership of the Buick. Accordingly, we must look to the specific circumstances in this case to determine if, and to whom, Scarborough\u2019s ownership of the Buick was transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">In order to effect a transfer of the ownership of a motor vehicle, two things are required: (1) the owner must actually deliver the endorsed certificate of title to the transferee, and (2) the owner must deliver possession of the vehicle to the transferee. <em>See Nationwide Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Storm, </em>200 Va. 526, 528-29, 106 S.E.2d 588, 589-90 (1959) (holding that delivery of possession of vehicle without delivery of certificate of title did not transfer ownership even though full payment had been received). Although Scarborough testified that the Buick \u201cdidn\u2019t belong to\u201d her, the record is clear that she was the sole owner of the Buick, as evidenced by the certificate of title, even though Ferrell\u2019s father had actually purchased the car and \u201cintended to give the car to both [her] and to [his] son.\u201d Accordingly, only Scarborough could transfer ownership of the Buick. Therefore, the subsequent desire of Ferrell\u2019s father to have the Buick sold and Scarborough\u2019s acquiescence at the time he told her \u201cshe\u2019d have to sign the title\u201d are not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">It is clear on this record that following an argument with Ferrell, Scarborough desired to leave the Ferrell household and Ferrell \u201chad her sign the title.\u201d Scarborough knowingly signed and dated the certificate of title as the owner of the Buick, delivered the certificate of title to Ferrell, and left the Buick in his sole possession and control. In doing so, Scarborough\u2019s signature constituted the required owner\u2019s endorsement under Code \u00a7 46.2-628. Her delivery of the certificate of title to Ferrell so endorsed at the time she also left the Buick with Ferrell satisfied the further requirements of that statute. Accordingly, Scarborough effected a transfer of ownership of the Buick to Ferrell. Thereafter, it was Ferrell\u2019s responsibility under Code \u00a7 46.2-630 to complete the blank space designed for the transferee on the certificate of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The evidence in the record supports the further conclusion that Ferrell fully understood that ownership of the Buick had transferred to him. Ferrell thereafter treated the Buick as his own. He drove the Buick whenever he needed to and without seeking permission to do so. Ferrell also paid property taxes and a local licensing fee on the Buick, had the vehicle inspected as required by law, and paid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>inspection fee. He also attempted to maintain insurance on the vehicle by paying premiums on Scarborough\u2019s insurance policy. It is true that he failed to apply for a new certificate of title within the time period required by law; however, while this might subject him to criminal liability, the failure to apply for a new certificate of title does not void the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the chancellor erred in ruling that Scarborough remained the owner of the Buick because her \u201c \u2018gift\u2019 of the car failed because of an unspecified donee.\u201d Thus, we will reverse the chancellor\u2019s determination that Nationwide has a duty to defend Ferrell and provide coverage for any Lability he might incur as a result of the accident. Ferrell\u2019s ownership of the Buick moots any inquiry into Allstate\u2019s contention that the \u201cnon-owned vehicle\u201d coverage in Ferrell\u2019s insurance policy with Atlanta Casualty would apply. Because the chancellor did not consider whether Atlanta Casualty would have a duty to defend Ferrell and provide liability coverage under his insurance policy if he were the owner of the Buick, we will remand the case for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-14\"> For this reason, it is unnecessary to relate in detail the specific policy provisions of the insurance policies involved. It is sufficient to simply note that these provisions are those standard in the motor vehicle insurance industry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\"> Although the certificate of title was not produced as an exhibit at trial, it is undisputed that the space for entering the transferee\u2019s name remained blank at all times relevant to these appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\"> Code \u00a7 46.2-629 also requires the owner to enter the vehicle\u2019s odometer reading on the certificate of title at the time of transfer. Failure by an owner to comply with Code \u00a7 46.2-629 can result in criminal liability and can prohibit the transferee from obtaining a new certificate of title. The certificate of title to the Buick was not produced as an exhibit at trial and the record is silent as to whether the odometer reading was recorded thereon. However, as the issue was not raised before the chancellor, we do not consider it on appeal. Rule 5:25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\"> Code \u00a7 46.2-631 provides an express exception to the requirement of Code \u00a7 46.2-630 for a transferee who is \u201ca dealer who holds [the vehicle] for resale and operates it only for sales purposes under a dealer\u2019s license plate.\u201d Similarly, a dealer or other person may receive an unendorsed title along with the transferor\u2019s \u201cpower of attorney ... for the purpose of assigning the transferor\u2019s interest.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-629. Accordingly, we emphasize that the views expressed in this opinion do not apply to transfers of motor vehicles to dealers or to the delivery of an unendorsed certificate of title to an attomey-in-fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
