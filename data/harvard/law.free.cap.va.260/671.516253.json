The Circuit Court of Arlington County imposed the jury\u2019s verdict, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in an unpublished opinion. <em>Dearing v. Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 1233-98-4 (August 17, 1999) [hereinafter <em>Dearing </em>/]. We awarded Dearing an appeal. The Commonwealth now concedes that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a co-defendant\u2019s statements to police. <em>Cf. Dearing v. Commonwealth, 259 </em>Va. 117, 123, 524 S.E.2d 121, 124 (2000) (addressing similar issue from a different conviction). Thus, the dispositive issue is whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that any error in admitting these statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">\u201cApplying well-established principles of appellate review, we must consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth [the prevailing party in the circuit court].\u201d <em>Derr v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 413, 424, 410 S.E.2d 662, 668 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">At approximately 1:30 a.m. on August 7, 1997, Danny Neil, a pedestrian, was stopped on the sidewalk by two men in a white Honda automobile. The passenger in the front seat pointed a gun at Neil and commanded Neil to give him all his money. When Neil emptied his pockets to show that he had no money, the gunman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>required Neil to give him a gold chain fastened around Neil\u2019s neck. After the men in the Honda drove away, Neil placed a 911 emergency call.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Police officers on night patrol in the community, who had been following a white Honda automobile occupied by Dearing and Leroy Vemoise Dorsey, learned that a car matching that description may have been involved in the robbery and stopped the car. When an officer brought Neil to the place where Dearing and Dorsey were being detained, Neil identified Dearing as the Honda passenger with a gun and noted that his gold chain was around Dearing\u2019s neck. Neil testified that a gun found by the officers on a shoulder of a road traveled by the white Honda was the weapon Dearing had pointed at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Dearing and Dorsey were tried jointly. Over Dearing\u2019s objection, Detective Paul Larson was allowed to testify that Dorsey first denied any involvement in the crime, but after Larson told him that \u201chonesty is always the best policy\u201d, Dorsey stated that he had come over \u201cfrom Maryland into Virginia to commit a robbery with his cousin . . . Alfred Dearing\u201d. Larson also testified that Dorsey had told him that he saw his cousin using a small black handgun to perform the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him\u201d, and this provision was held applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment in <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 406 (1965). \u201c[Bjefore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967); <em>accord Rose v. Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 576 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">\u201cWhether such an error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a host of factors, all readily accessible to reviewing courts. These factors include the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986); <em>accord Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 18 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Significantly, the <em>Chapman-Van Arsdall </em>harmless error standard has been applied expressly by the Supreme Court of the United States in appeals in which the constitutional Confrontation Clause had been violated. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>411 U.S. 223 (1973); <em>Schneble </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>405 U.S. 427 (1972); <em>Harrington v. California, </em>395 U.S. 250 (1969). We apply that standard here.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">While it is true that the challenged testimony was incriminating, this testimony was merely cumulative of the other evidence adduced by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth\u2019s cardinal witness at the jury trial, an eyewitness to the robbery and criminal use of a gun, was the victim of the crime. In the presence of investigating officers, and later at trial, Danny Neil identified Dearing as the principal criminal agent, the gun found discarded on the shoulder of the road as the criminal instrument, and the victim\u2019s necklace as the fruit of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">We declare, therefore, that the evidentiary error committed at trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\"> Appellant contends on brief that his assignments of error raise a question presented \u201cwhether admission of co-defendant\u2019s statements as a declaration against appellant\u2019s penal interest constitutes reversible error under Virginia law.\u201d We agree with the following ruling in the opinion of the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">Having concluded that any error was harmless under the more rigorous \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard applicable to constitutional error, we need not consider whether the admission of Dorsey\u2019s statement violated Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule and, if error, whether that error was harmless under the less exacting standard applicable to errors of state law. <em>See generally Lavinder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en banc) </em>(finding that the \u201cfederal standard is not required ... for non-constitutional error\u201d). <em>Dearing I, </em>slip op. at 6 n.1.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
