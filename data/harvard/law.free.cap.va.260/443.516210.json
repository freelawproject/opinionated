Cook (Cook) was declared incapacitated pursuant to former Code \u00a737.1-132.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cook\u2019s husband, Donnie R. Cook, was appointed as her guardian. On November 24, 1997, Cook, in her own name, filed a medical malpractice action against Radford Community Hospital, Incorporated, and Drs. Mark Todd and Robert C. Solomon for injuries she alleged resulted from treatment she received while a patient at the Hospital from November 24, 1995 to January 17, 1996. She filed an amended motion for judgment in November 1998. The defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss arguing that, because a guardian had been appointed for Cook, Code \u00a7 37.1-141 required that her guardian prosecute the action. Agreeing that Cook did not have standing to sue in her own right, the trial court determined that Cook was not entitled to amend her pleadings under either the misnomer statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-6, or the misjoinder statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-5, and dismissed Cook\u2019s motion for judgment. Cook appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Cook acknowledges that pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-141, a fiduciary \u201cshould prosecute actions for his ward.\u201d Nevertheless, she maintains that the failure to comply with the statute does not preclude pleading amendments to cure any defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Code \u00a7 37.1-141 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">All actions or suits to which the ward is a party at the time of qualification of the fiduciary and all such actions or suits subsequently instituted shall, subject to any conditions or limitations set forth in the order appointing him, be prosecuted or defended, as the case may be, by the fiduciary, after ten days\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>notice of the pendency thereof, which notice shall be given by the clerk of the court in which the same are pending.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d indicates that prosecution of a ward\u2019s cause of action by the fiduciary, if one has been appointed, is mandatory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Failure to comply with a mandatory condition can preclude curative amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u201cShall,\u201d however, does not always impose a mandatory condition. It has been construed as permissive or directory rather than mandatory depending on the subject matter and context in which it is used. <em>White </em>v. <em>Morano, </em>249 Va. 27, 32, 452 S.E.2d 856, 859 (1995); <em>Fox v. Custis, </em>236 Va. 69, 77, 372 S.E.2d 373, 377 (1988). To determine whether \u201cshall\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 37.1-141 is mandatory or permissive, we will review the history of the statute and relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">No statute specifically required that claims of a ward be prosecuted by a fiduciary until 1950. However, as early as 1872, this Court in <em>Bird\u2019s Committee </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 712 (1872), stated that \u201cwhen there is a committee, . . . every suit respecting the person or estate of the lunatic must be instituted in his name.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716. In that case, a person of unsound mind filed an action by next friend against her former committee over the settlement of accounts. Because of the factual situation involved, the Court in <em>Bird\u2019s Committee </em>allowed the case to proceed by carving out a narrow exception to the general rule: \u201c[Wjherever the interests of the committee clash with those of the lunatic, or when no committee has ever been appointed, the lunatic should be permitted to institute a suit in his or her own name, with some responsible person named as next friend and approved by the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">In <em>Cole\u2019s Committee v. Cole\u2019s Adm\u2019r, 69 </em>Va. (28 Gratt.) 365 (1877), a proceeding instituted in the name of a person of unsound mind was challenged because it was not brought by the fiduciary. Again, this Court allowed the action to proceed, finding that the action was \u201csubstantially a suit by the committee\u201d because it was styled in the name of the person of unsound mind, suing \u201cby his next friend and <em>committee.\u201d Id. </em>at 370-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>By 1934, \u201cthe established rule\u201d was that suits against persons declared insane must be brought in the name of the committee and that adults \u201c \u2018who are incapable of acting for themselves, though neither idiot nor lunatic, have been permitted to sue by their next friend.\u2019 \u201d <em>Counts v. Counts, </em>161 Va. 768, <em>777, </em>172 S.E. 248, 251 (1934). This rule was premised on the policy that an \u201c \u2018insane person, whether plaintiff or defendant, cannot appear in these judicial proceedings alone and unprotected; he must sue or defend by guardian, guardian <em>ad litem, </em>or committee.\u2019 \u201d 161 Va. at 775, 172 S.E. at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In 1950, the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 37-149, the predecessor to Code \u00a7 37.1-141, directing that actions or suits to which a ward is a party \u201cshall\u201d be prosecuted or defended by the fiduciary once one has qualified. By this statute, the General Assembly adopted the established rule recognized in <em>Bird\u2019s Committee, Cole\u2019s Committee, </em>and <em>Counts. </em>That rule was not permissive; it was mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The conclusion that Code \u00a7 37.1-141 is mandatory also finds support when that section is contrasted with Code \u00a7 37.1-139 and its predecessors. Well before the enactment of Code \u00a7 37.1-141, the predecessors of Code \u00a7 37.1-139 stated that a fiduciary \u201cmay sue and be sued\u201d with respect to claims for or against the ward. <em>See </em>Code 1950, \u00a7 37-147; Code 1919, \u00a7 1054; Code 1887, \u00a7 1702; Code 1849, tit. 24, ch. 85 \u00a7 45. By using the word \u201cshall\u201d rather than \u201cmay\u201d in the new statute, the General Assembly distinguished the new section from the long-standing provisions recited in current Code \u00a7 37.1-139 as well as enacting into statute the mandatory common law rule adopted in <em>Bird\u2019s Committee, Cole\u2019s Committee, </em>and <em>Counts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Cook advances a number of arguments in support of her position that a suit which does not comply with the provisions of Code \u00a7 37.1-141 is nevertheless valid. First, she argues that the difference between a declaration of incapacity and of incompetency is a \u201cmajor and material\u201d difference which requires a different outcome in this case. We agree that incapacity and incompetency represent different disabilities, but that difference is not material for the purposes of this suit. The statute at issue in this case does not distinguish between the types of disabilities, but applies when any fiduciary has been appointed for a ward, regardless of the particular disability suffered by the ward. Therefore, whether the disability is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>incompetency or incapacity, the issue remains the same if a fiduciary has been appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Cook next argues that the policy underlying Code \u00a7 8.01-9 requires that she be granted leave to amend her petition in this case. Code \u00a7 8.01-9 requires the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for a person under a disability who is named as a defendant in a suit unless the person under a disability is represented by counsel. Code \u00a7 8.01-9 further provides that it is the duty of the court to \u201csee that the interest of [such] defendant is so represented and protected.\u201d Cook posits that this section recognizes that a suit filed against a person with disabilities rather than against the guardian is valid and curative amendments can be made if necessary. Based on this premise, Cook reasons that the converse must also be true; that is, a suit filed by a person under a disability is also valid and subject to curative action if needed to protect and represent the interest of such person. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-9 is inapposite to the issue in this case. That section is a general law applying to all persons under a disability, which includes minors, alcoholics, drug addicts, incarcerated felons, as well as incapacitated persons. The statute is not concerned with the capacity of a person under a disability to sue but with the protection of such person when named as a defendant in a lawsuit. One who institutes litigation is in a posture completely different than one against whom suit is filed. The filing of a lawsuit is an affirmative act on the part of a plaintiff and does not carry with it the need for the type of court-initiated protection which may exist when a person with a disability is required to defend himself in litigation that he did not instigate, particularly if such person does not have a fiduciary. The provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-9 do not provide any basis for concluding that a suit by a person under a disability who has a duly appointed fiduciary is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Finally, Cook cites a number of cases decided by this Court as examples of valid litigation filed by a person under a disability, all of which are distinguishable. None of the cases construes Code \u00a7 37.1-141 and in no case had a fiduciary been appointed for the person under a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\"><em>Dunn </em>v. Terry, 216 Va. 234, 217 S.E.2d 849 (1975), involved the application of former Code \u00a7\u00a7 53-305 and -307.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Former Code \u00a7 53-305 provided for the appointment of a committee for a convict. For<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>mer Code \u00a7 53-307 provided that all actions or suits to which a convict was a party \u201cshall be prosecuted or defended\u201d by \u201csuch committee,\u201d language which is very similar to Code \u00a7 37.1-141 at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Dunn, a convict, sought to quash a garnishment summons issued in connection with civil litigation which began prior to his incarceration. No committee had been appointed for Dunn and he proceeded in his own name. The Court in <em>Dunn </em>concluded that the appointment of a committee was neither automatic nor required because former Code \u00a7 53-305 provided that such appointment was made upon the \u201cmotion of any interested party.\u201d As an interested party, the convict had the ability to seek appointment of a committee. Conversely, the Court in <em>Dunn </em>concluded, the convict could waive the appointment of a committee by failing to make such a motion. As no such motion was made by Dunn or any other interested party, there was no \u201csuch committee\u201d for purposes of former Code \u00a7 53-307, and, therefore, the provisions of that section requiring \u201csuch committee\u201d to prosecute or defend actions involving a convict were inapplicable. Thus, the Court in <em>Dunn </em>did not need to consider whether the use of the phrase \u201cshall prosecute or defend\u201d as used in former Code \u00a7 53-307 was mandatory or permissive. <em>See also Cross v. Sundin, </em>222 Va. 37, 278 S.E.2d 805 (1981). The rationale of <em>Dunn, </em>which resulted in allowing a convict to maintain an action in his own name rather than by his committee, is not applicable here because of the statutory provision allowing waiver of a committee in that case and the material factual difference between the cases, that is, the absence of a previously appointed fiduciary in <em>Dunn </em>and the presence of one in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Cook\u2019s reliance on <em>Riddle v. Barksdale, </em>194 Va. 766, 75 S.E.2d 507 (1953), for the proposition that a minor\u2019s suit is valid even though he did not sue by next friend is also misplaced. In <em>Riddle, </em>a judgment in favor of a minor for personal injuries was sustained even though the minor did not sue by next friend because former Code \u00a7 8-487 provided that no judgment should be \u201carrested or reversed\u201d so long as the minor appeared by an attorney and the judgment was in favor of the minor and not to his prejudice. 194 Va. at 770, 75 S.E.2d at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Finally, Cook refers to two cases involving the ability of a person under a disability to engage in actions with legal significance such as executing a will or deed; <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>186 Va. 630, 44 S.E.2d 16 (1947), and <em>Waddy </em>v. <em>Grimes, </em>154 Va. 615, 153 S.E. 807 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>(1930). The only act of legal significance at issue in this case is the ability to file a law suit. Whether Cook could execute a will or a deed while the guardianship remains effective is not relevant to the issue before us, and therefore these cases are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that if a fiduciary has been appointed for a ward, Code \u00a7 37.1-141 requires that the fiduciary prosecute any suit to which the ward is a party. In the absence of an exception, the ward does not have standing to sue in his or her own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Based on this construction of Code \u00a7 37.1-141, the trial court correctly refused to allow amendment of the pleadings to add or substitute Cook\u2019s guardian as the plaintiff. Neither Rule 1:8, relating to liberal leave to amend pleadings, nor Code \u00a7 8.01-5, relating to misjoinder and nonjoinder of parties, are applicable here. With regard to Rule 1:8, we stated in <em>The Chesapeake House on the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Virginia Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>231 Va. 440, 442-43, 344 S.E.2d 913, 915 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">[T]he foregoing rule [Rule 1:8] has always been subject to the limitation that a new plaintiff may not be substituted for an original plaintiff who lacked standing to bring the suit. Statutes relating to misjoinder and nonjoinder are not applicable in such situations, and the sole remedy is a nonsuit followed by a new action brought in the name of a proper plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">As in <em>Chesapeake House, </em>the guardian here cannot be substituted for Cook because Cook did not have standing to bring the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Likewise Code \u00a7 8.01-6 is not applicable here. That statute permits amendment and relation back if the pleadings contain a misnomer. A misnomer \u201carises when the right person is incorrectly named, not where the wrong [person] is named.\u201d <em>Swann </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>252 Va. 181, 184, 476 S.E.2d 170, 172 (1996). In this case the \u201cright person\u201d was Cook\u2019s guardian. The \u201cright person\u201d was not incorrectly named; the \u201cwrong person,\u201d Cook, was named.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">For the reasons stated, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-12\"> Code \u00a7 37.1-132, addressing incapacity, was repealed by Acts 1997, c. 921, effective January 1, 1998. For the current version of the statute, see Code \u00a7 37.1-134.13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-10\"> The statutes and case law addressed in this opinion use the terms guardian, committee, and fiduciary depending upon the ward\u2019s particular disability. For purposes of construing Code \u00a7 37.1-141, unless the context requires otherwise, we use the general term \u201cfiduciary\u201d to refer to the person who has been charged with the care of a ward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\"> Now codified as Code \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-221 and -222.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
