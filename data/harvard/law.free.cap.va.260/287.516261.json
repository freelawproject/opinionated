Smith, Jr., was injured when the vehicle he was driving collided with a vehicle driven by Gale A. Aldrich. In April 1997, Smith filed suit against Aldrich alleging that he was injured as a result of Aldrich\u2019s negligent operation of a motor vehicle. Smith filed an amended motion for judgment adding Media <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>General as a defendant, asserting that at the time of the accident Aldrich was acting in the scope of his employment as a newspaper carrier for Media General, the parent corporation of Richmond Newspapers, Inc. Smith served George L. Mahoney, the General Counsel and Registered Agent for Media General. Media General did not file any pleadings in response to Smith\u2019s motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On March 24, 1998, the trial court entered a default judgment against Media General. At a subsequent hearing, the court awarded damages of $405,246.50 against Media General.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">On October 13, 1998, Media General filed a bill of complaint pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-428(D) seeking to set aside the default judgment entered against it. The trial court denied Media General the relief sought and dismissed the bill of complaint, finding that Media General was \u201cnot free from fault or negligence\u201d in failing to respond to Smith\u2019s motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">On appeal, Media General assigns eight errors to the judgment of the trial court. These assignments of error address four general issues: (1) whether the trial court erred in finding that Media General was \u201cnot free from fault or negligence\u201d; (2) whether the trial court erred in failing to adopt \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d as an alternative standard for determining negligence under Code \u00a7 8.01-428(D); (3) whether the trial court erred in concluding that Media General was a proper party; and (4) whether the trial court erred in refusing to admit evidence regarding the effectiveness of Media General\u2019s system of accepting documents served on it. We consider these questions in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The evidence is not in dispute. In April 1996, Smith\u2019s attorney notified the Richmond Times-Dispatch, by letter, of Smith\u2019s claim against Aldrich. This letter was forwarded to Mahoney, and a file was established at Media General for Smith\u2019s claim. In September 1996, D. Page Cooper, Media General\u2019s Risk Manager, responded to an inquiry from Smith\u2019s uninsured motorist liability insurance carrier regarding Aldrich\u2019s employment status and the applicability of certain automobile liability insurance carried by Media General. In April 1997, Media General received a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>requesting information regarding Cooper\u2019s response to Smith\u2019s 1996 inquiry. The request was forwarded to Media General\u2019s counsel, who prepared and forwarded a response. Media General\u2019s file on Smith\u2019s claim was sent to storage in July 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>On August 18, 1997, Mahoney received Smith\u2019s amended motion for judgment and dictated a memorandum referring the matter to Cooper with instructions that the case be forwarded to Media General\u2019s insurance carrier. Neither the memorandum nor the amended motion for judgment was received by Cooper or the insurance carrier. There is no evidence showing what happened to these documents. The record also reflects that Smith\u2019s attorney mailed various notices to Mahoney, such as the notice for hearing on the default judgment motion, but Mahoney testified that he did not recall receiving any of them. Following the entry of the default judgment against Media General, Smith\u2019s counsel informed Media General by certified letter that he intended to proceed with the collection of the judgment, and that, in the absence of a response, Smith would proceed with collection of this debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-428(D) allows a court to \u201centertain at any time an independent action to relieve a party from any judgment or proceeding.\u201d To prevail in an action filed under this provision, the applicant for such relief has the burden to prove: (1) that the default judgment should not, in equity and good conscience, be enforced; (2) that it had a good defense to the alleged cause of action on which the judgment is founded; (3) that fraud, accident, or mistake prevented it from obtaining the benefit of its defense; (4) that there was an absence of fault or negligence by the defendant; and (5) that the applicant for relief under this Code section was without an adequate remedy at law. <em>Charles v. Precision Tune, Inc., </em>243 Va. 313, 317-18, 414 S.E.2d 831, 833 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">At issue in this case is whether Media General produced sufficient evidence to satisfy the fourth element of the cause of action, i.e., that it was free from fault or negligence. Media General argues that it met its burden of proof in this case with its evidence that it had a system in place for receiving and responding to service of process, that the system was reasonable, had operated well in the past, and \u201cappears to have been triggered appropriately\u201d when Smith\u2019s motion for judgment was received. Media General argues that, although it does not know what happened to the amended motion for judgment, it had a system for handling such matters in place, and, consequently, its lack of knowledge as to why its system apparently did not work properly does not rise to the level of negligence or fault on its part. Therefore, Media General concludes, the trial court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>in finding that Media General was not \u201cfree from fault or negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We reject Media General\u2019s argument. Media General had the burden to produce evidence showing that it was neither at fault nor negligent. The evidence recited above shows only that a system failed. It does not provide any showing as to how or why the system failed and thus provides no evidence that Media General was free from fault or negligence when it did not respond to Smith\u2019s motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Media General next argues that in determining whether it was negligent, the trial court should have applied the broader standard of \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d a standard utilized under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and a number of other jurisdictions, in considering whether to set aside default judgments. <em>See, e.g., Paige v. City of Chariton, </em>252 N.W.2d 433, 437 (Iowa 1977); <em>White v. Berryman, </em>418 S.E.2d 917, 925 (W. Va. 1992); <em>Jackson Hole Community Hous. Trust </em>v. <em>Scarlett, </em>979 P.2d 500, 502 (Wyo. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The General Assembly has not incorporated the excusable neglect standard into Code \u00a7 8.01-428, and we decline Media General\u2019s invitation to do so here. As we have stated on previous occasions, principles of certainty and finality of judicial proceedings require that the provisions of subsection (D) of Code \u00a7 8.01-428 be narrowly construed. <em>See Precision Tune, </em>243 Va. at 317, 414 S.E.2d at 833, and cases cited therein. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to apply a standard of excusable neglect and did not err in finding that Media General was not free from negligence or fault in failing to respond to Smith\u2019s amended motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Media General also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s finding that it was a proper party to Smith\u2019s action. This assertion is raised in the context of establishing the first element of an independent action under Code \u00a7 8.01-428(D) recited above. Media General\u2019s argument on this point can be summarized as asserting that the default judgment should not be enforced \u201cin equity and good conscience\u201d because Media General was named as a defendant \u201cunder the incorrect assumption that Aldrich was a Media General employee.\u201d Media General contends that there was \u201cno basis for holding Media General liable for any act of Aldrich.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">To prevail in an action under Code \u00a7 8.01-428(D), all five elements of the independent action must be established. Because we have already concluded that Media General did not meet its burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>of proving that it was without fault or negligence in failing to respond to Smith\u2019s amended motion for judgment, we need not address the question whether Media General met its burden of proving that enforcing the judgment against Media General was inequitable or unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Finally, Media General asserts that it should have been allowed to introduce evidence regarding the \u201cgood track record\u201d of its system for receiving and referring documents served on it. Specifically, Media General sought to introduce testimony that \u201cthere had never been a default judgment taken against Media General.\u201d The trial court refused to admit this statement, finding it irrelevant. We agree. Such evidence does not indicate what happened to the documents in this case, nor does the evidence show whether Media General was free from fault or negligence in failing to respond to Smith\u2019s amended motion for judgment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">For the reasons stated, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> On brief before this Court, Media General argues that the evidence in question should have been admitted to show that Media General\u2019s reliance on its system was reasonable. That argument was not made before the trial court, and we do not consider it here. Rule 5:25.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
