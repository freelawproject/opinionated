Because the court took this action prior to a deadline that it had previously established for plaintiff to make his expert witness available for a deposition, we conclude that the court abused its discretion and will therefore reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Raymond William Walsh filed an amended motion for judgment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against Dr. Dean R. Bennett, an orthopaedic surgeon, and several other defendants, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Dr. Bennett was negligent and committed medical malpractice in performing orthopaedic surgery on Walsh.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In accordance with the trial court\u2019s pre-trial scheduling order, Walsh designated five expert witnesses. Dr. Bennett objected to Walsh\u2019s designation of expert witnesses on the basis that the designation was inadequate, and moved to strike the designation and prevent Walsh from calling the experts as witnesses at trial. The trial court sustained that motion but granted Walsh leave to amend his designation of experts. The court further ordered that Walsh would not be permitted to file any additional amendments to his designation of expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Walsh subsequently submitted a Supplemental Designation of Expert Witnesses, naming only Dr. John P. Kostuik as an expert witness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Bennett again objected and moved to strike the designation on the basis that it was vague and contained insufficient information.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">After a hearing on May 21, 1999, the trial court denied Dr. Bennett\u2019s motion on the condition that Dr. Bennett have the opportunity to \u201cadequately depose\u201d Dr. Kostuik \u201cby the close of business\u201d on June 4, 1999. Otherwise, the court would grant Dr. Bennett\u2019s motion. Both parties objected to the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Prior to the hearing on May 21, Walsh had requested an extension of time in which to complete discovery, or alternatively, a continuance of the scheduled trial date of June 21, 1999. In that request, Walsh asserted that Dr. Kostuik was essentially unavailable for depo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>sition during the remaining time prior to the trial date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Walsh also contended that, without the extension, he would not have sufficient time in which to depose Dr. Bennett\u2019s expert witnesses prior to trial. On May 26, 1999, the trial court heard Walsh\u2019s motion and denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Also on May 26, Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel noticed the discovery deposition of Dr. Kostuik for June 4, commencing at 1:30 p.m. A representative of Dr. Kostuik\u2019s office then called Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel and advised that Dr. Kostuik was available only on June 4 for a deposition from 12:30 until 1:30 p.m. The next day, Dr. Bennett again moved to strike Walsh\u2019s designation of his expert witness because of Walsh\u2019s alleged failure to make Dr. Kostuik available for a deposition at a time convenient to Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">At a hearing on June 2, 1999, regarding Dr. Bennett\u2019s motion, Walsh stated that Dr. Kostuik could be deposed from 10:00 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. on June 4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel advised the court that she had informed Walsh\u2019s counsel on several occasions that she was available to take Dr. Kostuik\u2019s deposition on any day other than that time frame on June 4. However, on a previous occasion, Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel had advised the court and Walsh\u2019s counsel that she was available \u201cat any time other than June 4, 1999, between 12:30-1:30 p.m.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">At that hearing, Walsh also argued that, by making the doctor available for three and one-half hours, he was in compliance with the court\u2019s earlier order to provide an opportunity for Dr. Kostuik to be \u201cadequately depose[d].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel again stated that she was available to depose Dr. Kostuik anytime other than from 10:00 am to 1:30 p.m. on June 4, the trial court offered to extend the June 4, 1999 deadline. However, Walsh\u2019s counsel stated that the previously identified three and one-half hour time frame on June 4 was the only time Dr. Kostuik was available for deposition. When pressed by the court for information on Dr. Kostuik\u2019s availability, Walsh\u2019s counsel replied that the court \u201cmay as well \u2018go ahead and dismiss the case.\u2019 \u201d The court then granted Dr. Bennett\u2019s motion to strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Walsh\u2019s designation of his expert witness and ordered that Dr. Kostuik would not be permitted to testify as an expert witness at the trial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Thereafter, at the same hearing, Dr. Bennett moved the court to dismiss the case on the ground that, without an expert witness, Walsh\u2019s evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove his claim for medical malpractice. Again, Walsh\u2019s only response was \u201cgo ahead and dismiss the case.\u201d The trial court granted the motion and entered an order on June 2, 1999, reflecting its decision on both of Dr. Bennett\u2019s motions. We awarded Walsh this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Rule 4:12(b) governs discovery abuses and provides for sanctions against a party who fails to comply with a court\u2019s order to provide or permit discovery. A trial court generally exercises \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in determining the appropriate sanction for failure to comply with an order relating to discovery. <em>Woodbury </em>v. <em>Courtney, </em>239 Va. 651, 654, 391 S.E.2d 293, 295 (1990). Consequently, we accord deference to the decision of the trial court in this case and will reverse that decision only if the court abused its discretion in striking Walsh\u2019s designation of his expert witness. <em>See First Charter Land Corp. </em>v. <em>Middle Atl. Dredging, Inc., </em>218 Va. 304, 308-09, 237 S.E.2d 145, 148 (1977). However, an appellate court should not simply rubber stamp every discretionary decision of a trial court. To the contrary, we have an obligation to review the record and, upon doing so, to reverse the judgment of the trial court if we find a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The determination whether a trial court has abused its discretion is fact-specific. The facts of the instant case show that the trial court ordered Walsh to make his expert witness available for a deposition on or before the close of business on June 4. However, prior to that date \u2014 in other words, before Walsh had exhausted the time during which he could comply or fail to comply with the court\u2019s order \u2014 the court struck Walsh\u2019s designation of his expert witness and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The facts also establish that in the days prior to June 2, Walsh\u2019s counsel had made Dr. Kostuik available for an additional two and one-half hours, some of which was during a time Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel had on one occasion indicated that she would be available. Although Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel advised the court at the hearing on June 2 that she could not depose Dr. Kostuik during this addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>tional period of time, we do not know whether the schedule of either Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel or Dr. Kostuik would have again changed between June 2 and the close of business on June 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Considering these facts, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion because it deprived Walsh of time, in this case two days, in which to comply with the court\u2019s order and to provide Dr. Bennett with the opportunity to \u201cadequately depose\u201d Dr. Kostuik. The court prematurely imposed a sanction pursuant to Rule 4:12(b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because Walsh had not yet failed to obey the terms of the court\u2019s prior discovery order. <em>See </em>Rule 4:12(b)(2)(\u201c[i]f a party . . . fails to obey an order to provide . . . discovery, ... the court . . . may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just\u201d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The trial court\u2019s action before the June 4 deadline also \u201cshort circuited\u201d the legal process. We have often warned of the dangers of \u201cshort circuiting\u201d litigation because in doing so, a trial court \u201cdeprives] a litigant of his day in court and deprives] this Court of an opportunity to review a [more] thoroughly developed record on appeal.\u201d <em>Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather &amp; Geraldson </em>v. <em>Lake Fairfax Seven Ltd. Partnership, </em>253 Va. 93, 95, 480 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1997) (citing <em>CaterCorp, Inc. v. Catering Concepts, Inc., </em>246 Va. 22, 24, 431 S.E.2d 277, 279 (1993); <em>Renner v. Stafford, </em>245 Va. 351, 353, 429 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1993); <em>Carson v. LeBlanc, </em>245 Va. 135, 139-40, 427 S.E.2d 189, 192 (1993)). In this case, the trial court unnecessarily cut short the remaining time before the June 4 deadline for counsel to schedule Dr. Kostuik\u2019s deposition and, in doing so, may have prevented this case from proceeding to trial, thus depriving Walsh of his day in court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">For these reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-10\"> Walsh initially filed this case in 1997 but later nonsuited it. After he re-filed his case, the trial court sustained defendants\u2019 demurrers, and Walsh then filed the amended motion for judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-11\"> The trial court subsequently dismissed all the defendants except Dr. Bennett.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-12\"> In that supplemental designation, Walsh also stated that he expected to call his treating physicians as witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"> In his written request, Walsh stated that Dr. Kostuik was available for deposition only on June 11, 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\"> Walsh\u2019s counsel represented that he had previously informed Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel that Dr. Kostuik was also available to be deposed from 10:00 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. on June 4. However, Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel denied having received that information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\"> In his last motion to strike, Dr. Bennett claimed that the court had previously ruled that Dr. Kostuik must be made available for a minimum of three hours for a deposition. However, no statement to that effect appears in any of the court\u2019s orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\"> The trial court\u2019s order does not explicitly reference Rule 4:12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b196-10\"> The statements of Walsh\u2019s counsel at the June 2 hearing that the trial court could \u201cgo ahead and dismiss the case\u201d did not justify the trial court\u2019s \u201cshort circuiting\u201d of the process. Neither did the statements constitute \u201cinvited error\u201d under the doctrine enunciated by this Court, most recently in <em>Moore v. Hinkle, </em>259 Va. 479, 491, 527 S.E.2d 419, 426 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>JUSTICE LEMONS,</author>\n<p id=\"AOT\">with whom JUSTICE LACY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In my view the trial court did not abuse its discretion by striking plaintiff\u2019s designation of his expert witness for failure to comply with an order to provide discovery and thereafter, upon request of the plaintiff, dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">There is no transcript of the proceedings before the trial court in this record. Rather, Walsh relies upon a statement of facts pursuant to Rule 5:11(c). The pertinent portion of the statement of facts states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">Counsel for the Plaintiff informed the [cjourt that the June 4, 1999 time frame was the only opportunity Dr. Kostuick [sic] had available for the deposition. When pressed by the [c]ourt for additional information concerning Dr. Kostuick\u2019s [sic] availability, counsel for the Plaintiff replied that the court may as well \u201cgo ahead and dismiss the case.\u201d Failing in an attempt to find alternative dates for the deposition of Dr. Kostuick [sic], the [c]ourt granted the Defendant\u2019s motion to preclude Dr. Kostuick\u2019s [sic] testimony as an expert witness at trial. Counsel for the Defendant then moved to dismiss the case on the ground that Plaintiff\u2019s evidence as a matter of law was insufficient to prove medical malpractice without a medical expert. Again, Plaintiff\u2019s only response was \u201cgo ahead and dismiss the case.\u201d The [c]ourt granted the Defendant\u2019s motion and the case was dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The majority holds that \u201cthe trial court abused its discretion because it deprived Walsh of time, in this case two days, in which to comply with the court\u2019s order.\u201d Calling the dismissal a premature sanction under Rule 4:12, the majority suggests that \u201cWalsh had not yet failed to obey the terms of the court\u2019s prior discovery order.\u201d The majority further observes that \u201cwe do not know whether the schedule of either Dr. Bennett\u2019s counsel or Dr. Kostuik would have again changed between June 2 and the close of business on June 4.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The majority does not hold that dismissal of the case for failure to comply with a discovery order of the court is an abuse of discretion; rather, the majority is concerned that the dismissal occurred two days before the stated deadline. However, the only evidence before us on the subject is the recitation in the statement of facts that \u201cthe June 4, 1999 time frame was the only opportunity Dr. Kostuick [sic] had available for the deposition.\u201d The unavailability of Dr. Bennett\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>counsel within the narrow time frame offered by Dr. Kostuik for his deposition had been repeatedly established. Consequently, on the only evidence before us, the parties agreed that the deposition could not be taken between June 2 and the close of business on June 4. Plaintiff then twice invited the court to \u201cgo ahead and dismiss the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Although I believe that it was not error to dismiss the case, if error occurred, it most assuredly was invited error that the plaintiff may not successfully assert on appeal. The majority concludes without analysis that the request to \u201cgo ahead and dismiss the case\u201d does not satisfy the invited error doctrine. The invited error doctrine is essentially a waiver of the right to assign error under Rule 5:25. <em>See Wright </em>v. <em>Norfolk and Western Railway Co., </em>245 Va. 160, 169-70, 427 S.E.2d 724, 729 (1993). As we stated in <em>Wright, </em>\u201ca litigant will not be permitted to invite a trial court to commit error, either through agreeing or failing to object, and then be permitted to successfully complain of such error on appeal.\u201d Id. at 170, 427 S.E.2d at 729. If error occurred in the failure of the trial judge to wait an additional two days before entering the dismissal order, surely the error was occasioned by the acknowledgement by the plaintiff that no compliance with the order was possible within the two-day period followed by the express invitation, issued twice, to \u201cgo ahead and dismiss the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">As the statement of facts reveals, this case was originally filed in May of 1997 and was nonsuited prior to argument on a motion for summary judgment based upon plaintiff\u2019s failure to timely designate expert witnesses. After the case was refiled in September of 1998, controversy arose over the adequacy of compliance with the Rules of Court concerning designation of expert witnesses. The trial court gave plaintiff leave to amend his designation. Upon the filing of an amended designation, defendant again filed a \u201cmotion to strike the [pjlaintiff\u2019s expert.\u201d The trial court denied the motion; however, the court ordered \u201cthat the [djefendant be afforded the opportunity to adequately depose [pjlaintiff\u2019s expert by the close of business on June 4, 1999, or the [cjourt would revisit its decision on the motion to strike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">At a hearing on June 2, 1999, the court was advised of plaintiff\u2019s lack of compliance with the terms of the order requiring discovery. In another display of attempted accommodation of plaintiff, the court \u201cthen agreed to extend the June 4, 1999 deadline in order to accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>modate the deposition of Dr. Kostuick [sic].\u201d Inexplicably, plaintiff did not accept the trial court\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Faced with plaintiff\u2019s repeated failure to comply with the Rules of Court and discovery orders, the trial court nonetheless tried to provide plaintiff with alternatives other than striking his expert or dismissing his case. For reasons known only to plaintiff, the efforts of the court were resisted. In this context, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to accept plaintiff\u2019s invitation to dismiss the case. Even if the failure to wait two more days to enter the order is characterized as error, under any reasonable interpretation, it was invited error about which plaintiff may not now complain on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion because it elevates form over substance. I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
