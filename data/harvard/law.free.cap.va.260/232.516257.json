The court also suspended Reittinger\u2019s driver\u2019s license for a period of six months, pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-259.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">On July 21, 1998, a panel of the Court of Appeals reversed Reittinger\u2019s conviction. <em>Reittinger </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>28 Va. App. 80, 502 S.E.2d 151 (1998). Upon a rehearing <em>en banc, </em>however, the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. <em>Reittinger </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>29 Va. App. 724, 514 S.E.2d 775 (1999) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">On May 3, 1996, about 10:30 p.m., Deputy Sheriff Hugh Bolen stopped a van on Route 11 in Rockbridge County because the van had \u201conly one operable headlight.\u201d Deputy Bolen approached the driver\u2019s side of the van, and Deputy Max Smith approached the van\u2019s passenger side. Deputy Bolen asked Reittinger, the driver, for his operator\u2019s license and vehicle registration and informed Reittinger that the van had only one illuminated headlight. Thereupon, Reittinger displayed a new headlight that he said he planned to install the following day. Deputy Bolen, having decided against issuing a citation, simply gave Reittinger a verbal warning. Deputy Bolen then told Reittinger that he was \u201cfree to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Immediately thereafter, however, Deputy Bolen asked Reittinger whether he had any illegal weapons or drugs in the vehicle, and Reittinger stated that there was nothing illegal in the van. Deputy Bolen then asked Reittinger for permission to search the van. The deputy twice repeated the request to search while Reittinger appeared to consult with the passengers in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">Rather than answer the deputy, Reittinger exited the van. Deputy Bolen then saw a \u201clarge bulge\u201d in Reittinger\u2019s right pants pocket and conducted a \u201cpat down\u201d search of Reittinger. The bulge felt \u201chard,\u201d and Deputy Bolen thought Reittinger might be carrying a weapon. Deputy Bolen then ordered Reittinger to empty his pocket. Reittinger removed an object that proved to be a smoking pipe containing marijuana residue. Deputy Bolen testified that, when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>requested consent to search the van, he had no reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity on the part of Reittinger.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Reittinger contends that, under the facts of this case, the search was the product of an unlawful seizure and, therefore, was invalid. He further asserts that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>he was engaged in a consensual encounter with the deputy when he exited his vehicle, no legal justification existed for his seizure and search.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The Commonwealth contends that Reittinger was not unlawfully seized but that, after he was told that he was free to leave, he and the deputy were engaged in a consensual encounter following the completion of a lawful traffic stop. The Commonwealth further contends that, after Reittinger exited the vehicle and while the deputy and Reittinger continued to be engaged in a consensual encounter, the deputy saw a bulge in Reittinger\u2019s pocket that he believed could have been a weapon. Therefore, the Commonwealth asserts, the search of Reittinger was lawful because it was done for the deputies\u2019 protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of Reittinger\u2019s motion to suppress, the Court of Appeals essentially adopted the Commonwealth\u2019s contentions. The Court of Appeals held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">where a lawful encounter based on reasonable suspicion or probable cause flows immediately into a consensual encounter, an officer remains lawfully in the presence of the individual previously detained for purposes of conducting a pat-down search[, and, tjherefore, the officer may frisk the individual for weapons if he develops a reasonable suspicion that the individual may be armed and dangerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-10\"><em>Reittinger, </em>29 Va. App. at 733-34, 514 S.E.2d at 779-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">The Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, . . . and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d It is firmly established that warrant-less searches and seizures are <em>per se </em>unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically-established and well-delineated exceptions. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>469 U.S. 17, 19-20 (1984). Thus, \u201cthe Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>wealth has the burden of proving the legitimacy of a warrantless search and seizure.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 200, 204, 380 S.E.2d 656, 659 (1989). Whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated \u201c \u2018is a question of fact to be determined from all the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 40 (1996) (quoting <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 248-49 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In considering a challenge under the Fourth Amendment, questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause involve questions of both law and fact and are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>Ornelas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996); <em>Bass </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 470, 475, 525 S.E.2d 921, 924 (2000). Similarly, the question whether a person has been seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment is reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>See Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 226; <em>see also United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 551 n.5 (1980). An appellate court, however, \u201cshould take care both to review findings of historical fact only for clear error and to give due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In the present case, the trial court found that \u201c[t]he deputy effectively seized [Reittinger] without probable cause and without an articulable suspicion to investigate further.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The court further found that \u201c[a] reasonable person . . . upon immediately being subjected to a new and unrelated inquiry would conclude his detention continued . . . and [that] the reasonable inference to be drawn from [Reittinger\u2019s] voluntarily exiting his vehicle is that [he] concluded he was not free to leave.\u201d Despite the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he detention of [Reittinger] after the investigation of the [traffic] violation was completed was illegal,\u201d the court ruled that the subsequent \u201cpat down\u201d search was justified for the deputies\u2019 protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">While law enforcement officers may engage in consensual encounters with citizens, the Supreme Court has limited such encounters to those in which \u201ca reasonable person would feel free \u2018to disregard the police and go about his business.\u2019 \u201d <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 434 (1991) (quoting <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 628 (1991)); <em>accord Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497-98 (1983) (plurality opinion). In the present case, Reittinger had been stopped in a rural area in the nighttime. He was in the presence of two armed deputies, one on each side of the vehicle. Deputy Bolen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>asked Reittinger to waive his Fourth Amendment right and consent to a search of the vehicle. When Reittinger did not respond, the deputy asked a second and then third time for consent to search. These requests for permission to search were made even though Deputy Bolen admitted that he \u201chad no reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity on the part of [Reittinger].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Although Deputy Bolen had told Reittinger that he was free to go, we think that the events that transpired immediately thereafter would suggest to a reasonable person that just the opposite was the case. We do not think that a reasonable person, under the circumstances, would have considered that he was free to disregard the deputies and simply drive away. Therefore, we conclude, from our <em>de novo </em>review of the facts, that Reittinger was unlawfully seized in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights; that the trial court, though correct about the seizure, erred in refusing to suppress the product of the unlawful seizure and search of Reittinger; and that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate Reittinger\u2019s conviction, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals with direction that the case be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> A person is \u201cseized\u201d \u201conly when, by means of physical force or a show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained.\u201d <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 553.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
