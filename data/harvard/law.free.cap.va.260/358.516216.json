Smith.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Akers has waived his appeal of right, Code \u00a7 17.1-313 mandates that we review the death sentence. We must consider and determine whether the sentence of death was imposed \u201cunder the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor,\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(1), and whether that sentence is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">On the morning of December 19, 1998, responding to a citizen report that a body was located there, Franklin County Sheriff\u2019s Department Investigator F.M. Jamison went to a field at the intersection of State Route 40 and Sawmill Road in Franklin County. Jami-son discovered three pools of blood on the shoulder of the road and \u201ca clear drag mark which was saturated with blood that went down the hill toward a creek.\u201d Following the trail of blood, Jamison discovered Smith\u2019s body, which was covered with blood and bore the unmistakable signs of a savage beating including \u201c[sjeveral wounds to the back of his head, deep cuts, hair knocked off his head, a lot of blood on his shirt and his coat, and a large pool of blood under his face\u201d. Searching further, Jamison found an aluminum baseball bat \u201clying in the creek partially submerged\u201d twelve to fifteen feet from Smith\u2019s body. Subsequent laboratory testing established that Smith\u2019s blood was on the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Forensic examination of Smith\u2019s body revealed that he had been struck a minimum of three times in the head \u201cand probably a great deal more than three\u201d times. As a result, Smith suffered several fractures to his skull causing a subdural hematoma. The blows were not instantly fatal, and it would have taken \u201cminutes to hours, at least,\u201d before Smith died. In addition to the lethal wounds inflicted to his head, Smith suffered numerous defensive wounds to his hands and arms. He also had been struck several times on his back, and his neck was bruised in a manner consistent with an attempted strangulation by ligature. The ligature marks were consistent with the size and shape of a belt subsequently discovered in Smith\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Franklin County Sheriff\u2019s Department Investigator H.T. Woods interviewed Smith\u2019s mother, his sister, and George Slusser, a family friend. Based on these interviews, Woods determined that on the evening of December 18, 1998, Slusser had visited Smith at his apartment in Roanoke. At approximately 8:00 p.m., Akers and Timothy Martin, Akers\u2019 cousin, arrived at Smith\u2019s apartment. Martin and Smith had been acquainted for some time and Martin had recently introduced Smith to Akers. Akers and Martin told Smith that they had set him up for a \u201cblind date.\u201d The four men left the apartment and drove in Smith\u2019s car a short distance away to drop Slusser off at the home of his girlfriend. Akers, Martin, and Smith were seen together later that evening at a Roanoke nightclub.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">After it was discovered that Smith had been murdered, that Smith\u2019s apartment had been ransacked, and that several items of value were missing from the apartment, arrest warrants were issued for Akers and Martin for the murder and robbery of Smith, along with a bulletin for law enforcement officers to be on the lookout for Smith\u2019s car, which had vanity plates reading \u201cWESMODE.\u201d On December 22, 1998, an officer with the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Police in northern New York observed Smith\u2019s car in an area of the Mohawk reservation near the Canadian border known for smuggling activity and illegal alien entry. Upon learning that the vehicle and its occupants were wanted in Virginia, tribal police stopped the car and took Akers and Martin into custody. Akers subsequently attempted to flee from a room at the police station and when he was subdued he told the tribal police officers, \u201cIt\u2019s a good day to die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">When he was arrested, Akers was in possession of Smith\u2019s wallet. A search of Smith\u2019s car revealed numerous items from Smith\u2019s apartment, the belt used as a ligature, and a pair of black boots covered with Smith\u2019s blood. The boots were subsequently identified as belonging to Akers.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Thereafter, Akers talked openly with other prisoners about Smith\u2019s murder. Akers stated that he, Martin, and Smith had stopped at the field to urinate. Akers took the belt and placed it around Smith\u2019s neck, using it to drag Smith away from the car. Akers then held Smith down on the ground and choked him with the belt. Akers and Martin then took turns beating Smith with the baseball bat, which they had found in Smith\u2019s car. Smith resisted and begged the two men to stop. Akers and Martin then dragged Smith to the creek where they beat him again and abandoned him, throwing the baseball bat into the creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Akers subsequently admitted to the killing in letters sent to the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. In one letter, Akers admitted that \u201c[i]t was my full intent to kill and rob Wesley Smith after I got acquainted with him,\u201d and that he had taken approximately two hundred dollars from Smith\u2019s wallet. In another letter, Akers admitted beating Smith to death before returning to Smith\u2019s apartment to have \u201ca decent meal and change into [Smith\u2019s] clothes and [take] a pleasurable trip to New York.\u201d Akers further stated that he left his boots \u201call blood covered for the Commonwealth.\u201d Akers later told the probation officer preparing his presentence report that he planned to kill Smith because Martin had told him that Smith \u201cwas going to get 20 other people to assault Martin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Prior to the entry of his guilty plea, Akers was evaluated by Evan S. Nelson, Ph.D., a licensed clinical psychologist, and was found competent to enter that plea. At a hearing held on September 28, 1999, the trial court heard evidence in accord with the above-recited facts, and thereafter accepted Akers\u2019 guilty plea and ordered that a presentence report be prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Akers had directed his attorneys not to present any evidence on his behalf during the guilty plea hearing or at his sentencing hearing. Following the guilty plea hearing, the trial court instructed Akers\u2019 counsel to obtain a further opinion from Dr. Nelson concerning Akers\u2019 competence to waive his right to present evidence in mitigation at sentencing. In a letter to Akers\u2019 counsel subsequently received into evidence by the trial court at the sentencing hearing, Dr. Nelson opined that \u201cAkers possessed the capacity to rationally understand, appreciate, and consider the consequences of his plea of guilty.\u201d Dr. Nelson further opined that while \u201c[i]t makes all parties uncomfortable to see a defendant choose to place himself in the [worst] legal position possible\u201d by waiving his right to present evidence in mitigation, there was \u201cno viable reason to question [Akers\u2019] competency to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Following the preparation of the presentence report, the trial court held a sentencing hearing on November 5, 1999. At that hearing, the Commonwealth, relying on the evidence from the guilty plea hearing, contended that the killing of Smith was vile in that it involved an aggravated battery, torture of the victim, and resulted from depravity of mind. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. The Commonwealth also contended that Akers represented a continuing threat to society. <em>Id. </em>In support of this latter contention, the Commonwealth presented evidence of Akers\u2019 extensive criminal history including four convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>for robbery and seven convictions for larceny. Akers had also been convicted of assaulting correctional officers while in prison and had numerous notations of infractions in his prison record including disciplinary actions for thirty-two assaults. The Commonwealth offered additional evidence showing that while in jail awaiting trial in this case, Akers repeatedly assaulted jail officers and destroyed and defaced jail property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Akers told the trial court that he wanted to receive a death sentence. Akers reiterated to the trial court statements that he had made orally and in letters to the trial court, the police, his counsel, and the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney at various times since his arrest that he would \u201cplot and scheme behind bars and escape and come back to Franklin County\u201d to commit additional murders if he were given a life sentence. When asked if he had anything to say prior to sentencing, Akers said, \u201cI have no sympathy or remorse for what I did, and I plan to commit another capital murder in the future.\u201d In imposing the death sentence, the trial court found that the aggravating factors of vileness in the commission of the murder and of future dangerousness to society were both present.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C), we are required to consider \u201cany errors in the trial enumerated by appeal\u201d in any case where a sentence of death is imposed. Accordingly, the trial court is required to forward the trial record of such case to this Court where an appeal of right will be heard. Code \u00a7 17.1-313(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">After the trial court record was received, Akers notified this Court of \u201chis intent not to participate in [the] appeal\u201d permitted pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313. We returned the record to the trial court with instructions that a hearing be held to determine whether Akers\u2019 waiver of appeal was voluntarily and intelligently made. On March 16, 2000, the trial court conducted that hearing and determined that Akers voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to participate in the appeal. On April 4, 2000, the trial court entered an order reflecting its findings and returned the record to this Court in order that we might conduct the mandated review of the death sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Akers instructed his attorneys to file no brief in support of commuting his death sentence. The review process mandated by Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C) cannot be waived. Rather, the purpose of the review process is to assure the fair and proper application of the death penalty statutes in this Commonwealth and to instill public confidence in the administration of justice. Accordingly, by order of this Court dated April 21, 2000, we instructed Akers\u2019 attorneys to file a brief limited to the issues to be considered under the statutorily mandated review of Akers\u2019 death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Counsels\u2019 duty to assist the Court in this process as officers of the Court does not conflict with their concomitant duty to represent the defendant in the manner he desires. Undeniably, these concomitant duties may place counsel in an ethically difficult and, as Akers\u2019 counsel noted during oral argument of this appeal, professionally \u201cfrustrating\u201d position. The record in this case, however, demonstrates that counsel may, without violating the express directives of the defendant concerning his desired manner of representation, fulfill the obligations owed to the trial court and this Court on appeal. In this manner, both the interests of the defendant, as he determines them, and the interests of justice are served.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(1), we now consider whether the death sentence in this case was imposed \u201cunder the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d The brutality of the crime amply demonstrates the vileness and depravity of mind involved in the murder of Smith. Similarly, Akers\u2019 stated lack of remorse and his insistence that he would commit further acts of violence if allowed any modicum of freedom demonstrates Akers\u2019 future dangerousness to society. In light of these facts and upon careful review of the whole record, we find no evidence that the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision was influenced by passion, prejudice, or any arbitrary factor, but was, in fact, wholly grounded in a reasonable evaluation of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(2), we next focus our consideration on whether the sentence of death in this case is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d In accordance with Code \u00a7 17.1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>313(E), we have accumulated the records of all capital murder cases reviewed by this Court. The records include not only those capital murder cases in which the death penalty was imposed, but also those cases in which the trial court or jury imposed a life sentence and the defendant petitioned this Court for an appeal. <em>Whitley v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 66, 81-82, 286 S.E.2d 162, 171, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 882 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u201cThe purpose of our comparative review is to reach a reasoned judgment regarding what cases justify the imposition of the death penalty. We cannot insure complete symmetry among all death penalty cases, but our review does enable us to identify and invalidate a death sentence that is \u2018excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Orbe v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 390, 405, 519 S.E.2d 808, 817 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>_ U.S. _, 120 S.Ct. 1970 (2000). In complying with the statutory directive to compare this case with similar cases, we have specifically focused on cases analogous to the facts in this record where the predicate offense was robbery and the death sentence was imposed upon a finding by the trial court that both aggravating factors were present. <em>See, e.g., Stout v. Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. 126, 376 S.E.2d 288, <em>cert. denied, </em>492 U.S. 925 (1989); <em>Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 329 S.E.2d 815, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 865 (1985); <em>Edmonds v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 303, 329 S.E.2d 807, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 975 (1985). In each instance, the evidence of the vileness of the crime and the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness to society is equaled or exceeded by the evidence presented by the Commonwealth on these issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Akers presents no argument that the sentence of death in his case is disproportionate, and based on our review of this case and similar cases we conclude that the sentence of death is neither excessive nor disproportionate to sentences generally imposed in this Commonwealth for capital murders comparable to Akers\u2019 murder of Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Accordingly, we perceive no reason to commute the death sentence in this case and will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> Akers also pleaded guilty to having robbed Smith, Code \u00a7 18.2-58, and was sentenced to life imprisonment for that offense. Akers has not appealed that judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\"> At the sentencing hearing, Akers\u2019 attorneys proffered to the trial court evidence in mitigation that they would have presented had Akers allowed them to do so. The proffer consisted principally of evidence concerning Akers\u2019 \u201chorrible\u201d childhood, prior psychiatric treatment, and testimony of his mother and grandmother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\"> While our consideration of the trial court\u2019s judgment is thus limited by Akers\u2019 waiver, we note that the evidence adduced by the Commonwealth establishes Akers\u2019 guilt beyond any reasonable doubt and that the record adequately supports the trial court\u2019s determinations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Akers\u2019 guilty plea, his subsequent refusal to participate in his sentencing, and his waiver of his appeal of right were voluntary, informed decisions on his part.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
