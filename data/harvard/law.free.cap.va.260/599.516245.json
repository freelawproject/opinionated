He contends that the circuit court imposed the death penalty under the influence of passion or prejudice, and that his sentence of death is disproportionate to sentences imposed in factually comparable cases. Finding no merit in the defendant\u2019s arguments and after reviewing his sentence of death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C), we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">David Leston Overton, Jr., pled guilty to the capital murder of Edgar Allen Williams, a 63-year-old quadriplegic. After accepting Overton\u2019s guilty plea and finding him guilty of capital murder, the circuit court heard evidence in aggravation and mitigation of the offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the penalty-phase hearing, the court sentenced Overton to death on the capital murder conviction, finding that Overton\u2019s conduct in committing the murder was outrageously or wantonly vile in that it involved an aggravated battery to the victim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C), we now undertake the mandatory review of Overton\u2019s sentence of death to determine whether it was imposed \u201cunder the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor,\u201d and whether his sentence is excessive or disproportionate to penalties imposed in this Commonwealth in similar cases, \u201cconsidering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">On the morning of February 26, 1999, a detective with the Chesterfield County Police Department responded to a call concerning a dead individual at Williams\u2019 residence. Upon arriving at the scene and entering the house, the detective found Williams lying on his back in his bed. Williams appeared to be deceased. The shirt that Williams was wearing was marked with numerous holes and red stains. The telephone in the bedroom had been pulled from the wall. During a search of Williams\u2019 house, the police discovered over $40,000 in cash and 11.88 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">A subsequent autopsy of Williams\u2019 body revealed that he had sustained 21 stab wounds and one incised wound. Three of the numerous stab wounds to Williams\u2019 chest were each lethal wounds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Although approximately 90 percent of the wounds were located in the chest region, four stab wounds were inflicted in the neck area. However, there were no defensive injuries on Williams\u2019 body nor any other bruising that would indicate his assailant had hit or punched Williams. On the autopsy report, the cause of death was listed as \u201c[ejxsanguination due to stab wounds of [the] chest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Overton confessed to the murder of Williams. That confession, along with testimony from Overton\u2019s girlfriend, Tina Marie Middlebrook, establishes the following pertinent facts. On the evening of Williams\u2019 murder, Overton, Middlebrook, and Eric Brown, a friend of Overton, were \u201cdoing drugs\u201d in a motel room. Overton and Brown left the motel and traveled by car to Williams\u2019 house. On the way to Williams\u2019 home, they stopped at a convenience store and purchased a flashlight so Overton could see what he was doing without having to turn on the lights in Williams\u2019 house. After they arrived at Williams\u2019 home, Brown stayed in the car, and Overton entered the house, apparently the door was not locked, and walked into Williams\u2019 bedroom. Williams then turned on the light beside his bed and started demanding to know why Overton was there so late at night. At that point, Overton, in his words, \u201cblacked out and did it[,] . . . stabbed [Williams] with a knife somewhere in his upper chest.\u201d Overton described the knife he used as a \u201cskinning knife.\u201d Overton then grabbed what money he could see and a gun lying in a drawer of a nightstand, and left Williams\u2019 house.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">On their way back to the motel, Overton threw the knife out the car window.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After he and Brown returned to the motel, Middlebrook observed a gun and rolls of money in Overton\u2019s coat pocket, and blood on his sleeve. She asked Overton what he had done, and Over-ton admitted that he had killed Williams. The three individuals then went to Richmond to buy more drugs. Overton was arrested approximately two weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">At Overton\u2019s sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth introduced evidence with regard to the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate. The court heard victim impact testimony from Williams\u2019 two daughters, his ex-wife, a friend, and caretakers. The forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy on Williams\u2019 body described the numerous stab wounds as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the Commonwealth introduced into evidence pictures of the victim and the wounds. The pathologist opined that Williams may have been aware of what was happening but that he would have become unconscious within minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Finally, the Commonwealth presented testimony from a doctor who had treated Williams. Although Williams was a quadriplegic, the doctor testified that Williams was able to move his shoulders and arms, though the muscle function in his hands was severely limited. Williams had normal sensation throughout both arms and down to a \u201cdermatoma level in the skin\u201d halfway between his collar bone and nipple. Thus, the doctor opined that the majority of the stab wounds inflicted on Williams were at or above the point where Williams\u2019 sensation was intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Overton then presented evidence in mitigation of the offense. Members of his family testified that Overton was \u201cremorseful\u201d and accepted responsibility for his crimes. A licensed clinical psychologist stated that, when he treated Overton on eight occasions approximately four years before Overton committed the present crimes, Overton was \u201cupset\u201d and \u201csad\u201d about the \u201cfights\u201d and \u201cconflict\u201d in his home. Finally, Overton submitted a letter to the circuit court in which he stated, \u201cI do not wish to fight this. I humbly request that you respect the family\u2019s [Williams\u2019 family] wishes in sentencing me to death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Overton does not assign any errors on appeal except with respect to the two questions that this Court must address in our statutorily mandated review. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C). In his first assignment of error, Overton asserts that his sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors for three reasons: (1) that the circuit court was improperly swayed by the emotional testimony of Williams\u2019 family and friends; (2) that the \u201cgraphic pictures\u201d of the victim improperly influenced the court; and (3) that Overton\u2019s letter to the circuit court requesting that the death sentence be imposed impacted the court\u2019s sentencing decision. In his second assignment of error, Overton contends that his sentence of death is disproportionate because defendants in factually comparable cases have received only life sentences. We do not agree with Over-ton\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">With regard to Overton\u2019s assertion that the circuit court was improperly influenced by the victim impact testimony from Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>liams\u2019 family and friends, and by the photographs of the victim and the stab wounds, we find that Overton failed to object at the sentencing hearing either to the victim impact testimony or to the introduction of the photographs. His failure to make contemporaneous objections at trial precludes consideration of those issues on appeal. Rule 5:25; <em>see also Cherrix v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 292, 310, 513 S.E.2d 642, 654, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 873 (1999) (defendant waived argument for failure to object in trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Turning to Overton\u2019s letter addressed to the circuit court, we note that the court stated at the sentencing hearing that it had \u201cnot considered the defendant\u2019s request to die as an aspect or component of the sentencing decision.\u201d Nevertheless, Overton insists that his request to die had to influence the court\u2019s sentencing determination. However, we are unwilling to disregard the court\u2019s unequivocal statement that it did not consider Overton\u2019s request. \u201c \u2018A judge, unlike a juror, is uniquely suited by training, experience and judicial discipline to disregard potentially prejudicial comments ....\u2019\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 243, 268, 389 S.E.2d 871, 885, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 881 (1990) (quoting <em>Eckhart v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981)). Thus, we conclude that Over-ton\u2019s sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The second part of our review, as well as Overton\u2019s second assignment of error, addresses the question whether his \u201csentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(2). Relying on several cases in which defendants convicted of capital murder received life sentences rather than the death penalty, such as <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 142, 143, 341 S.E.2d 159, 160 (1986), and <em>Simpson v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 557, 560, 318 S.E.2d 386, 388 (1984), Overton argues that the facts of the present case demonstrate that his sentence of death is disproportionate to sentences generally imposed in this Commonwealth for similar crimes. Those facts, according to Overton, include his age of 19 at the time of the offenses; his dysfunctional family; his drug use, especially on the day of the offenses as opposed to a few days earlier when he was not \u201chigh\u201d enough to commit the crimes; Williams\u2019 sale of drugs to Overton and his girlfriend; the absence of defensive wounds on Williams\u2019 body, which, according to Overton, indicates that he did not beat Williams; his confession and cooperation in helping the police recover the murder weapon; and his criminal record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>that consists of only three prior convictions: possession of a concealed weapon, petty larceny, and possession of stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313(E), we have accumulated the records of all capital murder cases reviewed by this Court. Those records include not only those cases in which the death penalty was imposed, but also those cases in which either the trial court or jury imposed a life sentence instead of the death penalty and the defendant filed a petition for appeal with this Court. <em>Orbe v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 390, 404, 519 S.E. 2d 808, 816 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>_ U.S. _, 120 S.Ct. 1970 (2000); <em>Whitley v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 66, 81, 286 S.E.2d 162, 171, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 882 (1982). In complying with the directive in Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(2) to compare \u201csimilar\u201d cases, we have given particular attention, in conducting the review of Overton\u2019s sentence of death, to those cases in which the underlying felony predicate, and the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the crimes were similar to those in this case. We have also focused on cases in which the death penalty was imposed solely on the basis of the \u201cvileness\u201d factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">If we conduct, as Overton did, a selective review of those records, it is possible to find comparable cases in which defendants received death sentences as well as comparable cases in which defendants received life sentences. For example in <em>Robinson, </em>discussed by Overton on brief, the defendant used a pair of scissors to inflict lethal stab wounds to two individuals during the course of a robbery in one of the victim\u2019s townhouse. 231 Va. at 146, 341 S.E.2d at 161. The defendant had gone to the townhouse twice on the day of the murder, first because his car had been towed and second ostensibly to pay his rent. <em>Id. </em>at 145, 341 S.E.2d at 161. However, the defendant received a life sentence instead of the death penalty on each of two convictions of capital murder. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 341 S.E.2d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">In contrast, the 21-year-old defendant in <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 229 </em>Va. 501, 505-06, 331 S.E.2d 407, 411 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1031 (1986), received the death penalty for the capital murder of his neighbor, who was an 87-year-old widow. The defendant planned the murder and went to the victim\u2019s home for a friendly visit. <em>Id. </em>at 507, 331 S.E.2d at 413. He then inflicted multiple blunt-force blows with a metal rod to the victim\u2019s head and neck, and stabbed her in the shoulder and chest. <em>Id. </em>at 507, 331 S.E.2d at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">However, our proportionality analysis encompasses all capital murder cases presented to this Court for review and is not limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>cases selectively chosen. <em>Id. </em>at 522, 331 S.E.2d at 422. Additionally, the question of proportionality does not turn on whether a given capital murder case \u201cequal[s] in horror the worst possible scenario yet encountered.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 543, 556, 364 S.E.2d 483, 490, <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1017 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Thus, upon reviewing the records of all capital murder cases presented to this Court, including those cases cited by Overton, and giving particular attention to cases involving the predicate offense of robbery and the \u201cvileness\u201d factor, we conclude that Overton\u2019s sentence of death is not excessive or disproportionate to sentences generally imposed in this Commonwealth for capital murders comparable to Overton\u2019s murder of Edgar Allen Williams. <em>See, e.g., Fry v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 413, 416-17, 463 S.E.2d 433, 435 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1110 (1996) (11 gunshot wounds to victim\u2019s head, chest, and abdomen; victim dragged down dirt road while alive); <em>Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 133, 360 S.E.2d 196, 199 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1036 (1988) (victim sustained multiple gunshot wounds); <em>LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 571, 304 S.E.2d 644, 647 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984)(three stab wounds, 40 other wounds inflicted on victim; carving fork and ice pick left in victim); <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 134, 295 S.E.2d 643, 645 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1029 (1983) (victim died from multiple hammer blows to head, neck, and back); <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 448, 452, 374 S.E.2d 303, 306 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1028 (1989) (victim died from multiple blunt impact injuries to head, face, and right hand; stabbed three times in neck, once in abdomen; and strangled).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Overton did, after all, inflict 21 stab wounds on a 63-year-old quadriplegic.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\u201cThe purpose of our comparative review is to reach a reasoned judgment regarding what cases justify the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d <em>Orbe, </em>258 Va. at 390, 519 S.E.2d at 817. Although we cannot insure that \u201ccomplete symmetry\u201d exists among all death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>penalty cases, \u201cour review does enable us to identify and invalidate a death sentence that is \u2018excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(2)); <em>see also Tennessee </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>958 S.W.2d 651, 665 (Tenn. 1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1083 (1998) (court\u2019s \u201cfunction in performing comparative review is not to search for proof that a defendant\u2019s death sentence is perfectly symmetrical, but to identify and invalidate the aberrant death sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">For these reasons, we find no error in the imposition of the death penalty in this case, nor do we perceive any reason to commute Overton\u2019s sentence of death to life imprisonment. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-11\"> Overton also pled guilty to robbery and statutory burglary while armed with a deadly weapon. After finding Overton guilty of these charges, the circuit court sentenced Overton to life imprisonment on the robbery conviction, and to 20 years on the statutory burglary conviction. Overton did not appeal those convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-12\"> The circuit court did not include its finding of the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate in its sentencing order dated December 14, 1999. Consequently, this Court remanded the case to the circuit court for clarification of its sentencing order. In a subsequent order, the court found \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s conduct in committing the offense . . . was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d The case was then returned to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\"> Overton had been to Williams\u2019 house with Middlebrook on many occasions to buy drugs from Williams. In fact, Overton admitted that he had gone to Williams\u2019 house a couple of days before the murder \u201cto do it\u201d but got scared because he was not \u201chigh.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\"> After Overton was arrested, he took two police officers to the location where he had thrown the knife. The officers recovered the knife at that spot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\"> We cite these cases to show that the death penalty is generally imposed in this Commonwealth for capital murders similar to the one in this case. <em>See Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 216, 223, 509 S.E.2d 293, 298 (1999) (from our accumulated records,- we determine whether juries in this Commonwealth generally approve the death penalty for comparable crimes). \u201cThe test is not whether a jury may have declined to recommend the death penalty in a particular case but whether generally juries in this jurisdiction impose the death sentence for conduct similar to that of the defendant.\u201d <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 283-84, 257 S.E.2d 808, 824 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
