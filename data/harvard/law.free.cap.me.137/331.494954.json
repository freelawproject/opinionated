Assumpsit on a promissory note dated May 2, 1932, signed by the defendants as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>makers and payable to Dirigo Trustees, trustees for an unorganized association. The plaintiff sues as assignee.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AUo5\"><em>Eugene F. Martin, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ABeH\"><em>Milan J. Smith, Bartolo M. Siciliano, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">One Siciliano, its treasurer and a shareholder in the association, was indebted to the defendants. A loan, evidenced by the note sued, was obtained from the association and the money so obtained was paid to them in discharge of their indebtedness against Siciliano.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In defense it was contended that following the assignment liability on this note was extinguished by a settlement between Siciliano and the plaintiff in pursuance of a vote to deduct from their \u201cpersonal shares\u201d as shareholders their liabilities to the association and that the assignee \u201cshould secure copies of each account against each shareholder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">With the assistance of an auditor, an unsigned written account between the association and Siciliano was made up, included in which, as a charge against Siciliano, was the amount due on this note. The plaintiff contended, however, that the account was not agreed upon and never became effective as a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Thus a single issue <em>of fact </em>was raised for decision by the referee. He found that no settlement was made. Facts found in reference under rule of court are final when supported by any evidence. <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Town of Newfield, </em>136 Me., 23, 1 A., 2d, 227, and cases cited therein. The record reveals ample testimony to support the finding of fact by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">It should be noted that the exception charging gross negligence and prejudice upon the part of the referee was withdrawn. Exceptions overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
