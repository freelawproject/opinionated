There is a sharp conflict in the evidence as to the position of the trucks on the highway when the collision took place, and the credibility of the witnesses called to the stand on the one side and the other is of vital importance. The case presents issues of fact peculiarly within the province of the jury to determine. On the record brought forward, it cannot be held that the verdict was manifestly wrong. Motion overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
