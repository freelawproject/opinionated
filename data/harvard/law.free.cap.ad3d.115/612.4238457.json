Here, defendant was sentenced to a term of 3x/2 years on February 20, 2001 upon a plea of guilty to robbery in the second degree. No term of postrelease supervision was imposed, and none was indicated in the sentence and commitment sheet. On May 26, 2004, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted robbery in the second degree. He was sentenced on June 22, 2004, and adjudicated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>second violent felony offender based on the 2001 conviction for robbery in the second degree. On December 14, 2009, defendant was resentenced on his 2001 felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\">In <em>Boyer, </em>the Court of Appeals explained as follows: \u201c[A] resentencing to correct the flawed imposition of PRS does not vacate the original sentence and replace it with an entirely new sentence, but instead merely corrects a clerical error and leaves the original sentence, along with the date of that sentence, undisturbed\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 24). Given this determination, we find that, notwithstanding the resentencing on December 14, 2009, defendant\u2019s 2001 violent felony conviction qualifies as a predicate felony conviction at the time of his sentencing on June 22, 2004, which requires the imposition of second felony offender status.</p>\n<judges id=\"Akzj\">Concur \u2014 Sweeny, J.E, Acosta, Andrias, Saxe and Clark, JJ.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
