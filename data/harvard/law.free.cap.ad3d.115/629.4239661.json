As the claimant was sitting on a wooden bench reading a newspaper, he observed a security guard talking on a cell phone while looking out a window. During the phone conversation, the security guard was informed of his grandmother\u2019s death and, in reaction to that news, went over to the waiting area and punched a wooden bench that was in front of the claimant, causing it to fall on the claimant. Subsequently, the claimant filed this claim against the State of New York to recover damages for personal injuries. At the close of the trial on the issue of liability, the Court of Claims granted the defendant\u2019s application to dismiss the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u201cUnder the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer can be held vicariously liable for the torts committed by an employee acting within the scope of the employment\u201d <em>(Fernandez v Rustic Inn, Inc., </em>60 AD3d 893, 896 [2009]; <em>see Riviello v Waldron, </em>47 NY2d 297, 302 [1979]). \u201cPursuant to this doctrine, the employer may be liable when the employee acts negligently or intentionally, so long as the tortious conduct is generally foreseeable and a natural incident of the employment\u201d <em>(Judith M. v Sisters of Charity Hosp., </em>93 NY2d 932, 933 [1999]; <em>see Riviello v Waldron, </em>47 NY2d at 304; <em>Davis v Larhette, </em>39 AD3d 693, 694 [2007]). \u201cAn employer, however, cannot be held vicariously liable for its employee\u2019s alleged tortious conduct if the employee was acting solely for personal motives unrelated to the furtherance of the employer\u2019s business at the time of the incident\u201d <em>(Gui Ying Shi v McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>110 AD3d 678, 679 [2013]; <em>see Horvath v L &amp; B Gardens, Inc., </em>89 AD3d 803, 803 [2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Here, the parties do not dispute that the security guard is an employee of the defendant for purposes of tort liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior. However, the defendant is not vicariously liable for the security guard\u2019s conduct because the evidence at trial established that the security guard was acting solely for personal motives unrelated to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>business at the time of the incident <em>(see Gui Ying Shi v McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>110 AD3d at 680; <em>Horvath v L &amp; B Gardens, Inc., </em>89 AD3d at 803; <em>Bowman v State of New York, </em>10 AD3d 315, 316-317 [2004]). Furthermore, the evidence failed to demonstrate that the security guard\u2019s conduct was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant <em>(see Gui Ying Shi v McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>110 AD3d at 680; <em>Bowman v State of New York, </em>10 AD3d at 317). Accordingly, the Court of Claims properly granted the defendant\u2019s application and dismissed the claim.</p>\n<judges id=\"A9u\">Skelos, J.P., Chambers, Hall and Miller, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
