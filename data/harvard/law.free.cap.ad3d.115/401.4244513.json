Admit One\u2019s reliance on <em>Ferluckaj v Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. </em>(12 NY3d 316 [2009]) is misplaced, because unlike the tenant in that case, here the testimony of Admit One\u2019s vice-president establishes that it selected the contractor for the work and substantially directed and controlled it. Indeed, emails provided by the architect further demonstrate that Admit One was actively engaged in the build-out.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Plaintiff demonstrated his prima facie entitlement to summary judgment on the issue of defendants\u2019 section 240 (1) liability through his testimony that, at the direction of the defendants\u2019 site foreman, he used the <em>only </em>ladder on the floor, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>open A-frame ladder \u201cnot too far\u201d from the foreman\u2019s toolbox, and that while he was standing on it, the ladder became unstable, wobbled and fell, causing him to fall and sustain injury <em>(see Schultze v 585 W. 214th St. Owners Corp., </em>228 AD2d 381 [1st Dept 1996]).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\">In opposition, defendants raised an issue of material fact. In his affidavit, the site foreman avers that prior to plaintiffs accident, he directed plaintiff not to use \u201ca couple of ladders, broken-up and busted-up\u201d and placed by the garbage bins. He further averred that \u201cat least two A-frame sturdy ladders\u201d were on the floor, and that he told plaintiff to \u201csweep the floor until a safe . . . ladder\u201d was available. According to the foreman, upon arriving at the scene of the accident, he observed that plaintiff had used a ladder that the foreman had specifically instructed him not to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">These competing versions of what transpired raise factual questions as to whether plaintiff was provided an adequate ladder, and, if so, whether he knew it was available and that he was expected to use it, but nevertheless unreasonably chose not to use it, thereby causing his injury <em>(see Nacewicz v Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Cross, </em>105 AD3d 402 [1st Dept 2013]). Thus, plaintiff is not entitled to partial summary judgment on his Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) claim.</p>\n<judges id=\"Aet\">Concur \u2014 Friedman, J.E, Renwick, Freedman and Feinman, JJ.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
