That the note on which the suit was brought was a company note, signed by the secretary and treasurer officially, and endorsed by him (the defendant), he being the vice-president of the company, all in pursuance of a resolution of said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-10\">2. That he, the defendant, McMurtrie, was merely an accommodation endorser, and received no personal benefit or profit from the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-11\">3. That the plaintiff', Middleton, was one of the persons constituting the said company, and, therefore, in effect, both plaintiff and defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-12\">4. That he, the said McMurtrie, endorsed the note in suit at the special instance and request of the plaintiff, Middleton ; that upon first being requested to endorse the said note by Middleton, he objected and refused, but after being assured by the plaintiff' that he should and would not be held responsible on the note or for it, and that his signature was simply wanted because the bank where the note was negotiated wanted the names of all the officer\u2019s of the company, and that the defendant\u2019s name was necessary, he being the vice-president of the company ; and that his (McMurtrie\u2019s) endorsement of the note was solely and exclusively made upon this promise of the plaintiff, Middleton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-13\">Issue being joined on these pleas, and the case coming on for trial, the plaintiff gave in evidence the note endorsed in the order stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-14\">The execution of the note, the protest, and notice of protest to the defendant were admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-15\">\u25a0 The defendant then, in support of his pleas, and for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>purpose of showing, as he contended, \u201c the true relations between the plaintiff and defendant, and to show the true purpose and proper liability of the immediate parties and. original signers,\u201d made the following offers of proof, each of which were successively rejected by the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\">1. To prove by the record of the official action of the board of directors of the Ellis Gold Mining and Reduction Company, that at a meeting of the directors, on the 1st of April, 1876, the plaintiff and defendant, McMurtrie, both being present, the following resolution was adopted, authorizing the making of the note in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\">\u201cResolved, That the secretary and treasurer be authorized to make two promissory notes on behalf of the company\u2014 one for $2,000, payable in three months, and one for $2,000, payable in four months, with interest at not exceeding 10 per cent, per annum \u2014 said notes to be endorsed by the board of directors and negotiated, and the proceeds applied to the payment of the debt of the company, and that payment of the notes shall be made from the first revenues accruing to the company from any source whatever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">2. To prove by the said records of the company, that at a certain other meeting of the board of directors of the company, February 24,1876, a certain other note was authorized to be made and negotiated on behalf of the company, whereby it was resolved to borrow one thousand dollars at sixty or ninety days, by giving a corporate note, to be endorsed by two of the directors individually.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-7\">8. To prove by the same record book that the note in suit was a renewal, by authority of the said board of directors, by resolution dated April 27, 1877, of the note as originally authorized by the resolution of April 1, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-8\">4. To prove that at the time of the endorsement of the note by the defendant, McMurtrie, the plaintiff promised and agreed to and with the defendant, that if he would endorse the note that he should not be held personally liable on it ; that his (McMurtrie\u2019s) signature was wanted simply because he was one of the board of directors and vice-presi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>dent of the company, and that he endorsed the note in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s promise, and because he was a director and officer of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-3\">5. To prove that the plaintiff and defendant were both stockholders or partners in the said company, as well as directors, at the time of the resolution authorizing the original making and renewal of the note in suit, and were both present at the meeting of the board of directors when the said resolutions were considered and passed upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-4\">6. To prove that as between the plaintiff and the defendant there was no consideration for the said endorsement from the plaintiff to the defendant, McMurtrie, or to any other person at the defendant\u2019s instance or request, and that the endorsement was simply an accommodation one, as above recited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">7. To prove that at the time the defendant signed the aaid note as an endorser, all of the signatures of the other endorsers were already on the note, and a place left for the defendant\u2019s name between the names of McCartee, president, .and Wyman, secretary of the said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-6\">Each of these offers being rejected and exceptions taken, the court, the case being closed, instructed the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and that they should find for him the full amount of the face value of the note in suit, with interest according to its terms. A verdict and judgment having been accordingly entered in favor of the plaintiff, .the defendant, McMurtrie, moved this court for a new trial \u25a0on the exceptions taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-7\">Linden Kent for plaintiff':</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-8\">It is submitted that no one of the pleas constitute any -defence to the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-9\">The first, merely in different language, reasserts the allegations of the declaration that the note was that of the company and was executed in accordance with authority \u2022especially given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-10\">The second, that the defendant, McMurtrie, was an ac-commodation endorser, and not liable. The answer is, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>accommodation endorsers are liable unless the circumstances bring them within some rule of exemption, which this plea does not attempt to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8EA\">As to the third plea, that the plaintiff, Middleton, was \u2022one of the persons constituting the said company, and therefore, in effect, both plaintiff\" and defendant, no comment need be made. Twin Lick Oil Company <em>vs. </em>Marbury, 1 Otto, 587.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-5\">The fourth plea undertakes (but imperfectly) to set up a verbal agreement contemporaneous between MeMurtrie and Middleton, which would not only vary the terms of the instrument, but makes it absolutely null and void as to the defendant MeMurtrie.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-6\">The doctrine on this subject, especially as applicable to negotiable paper, and as between the immediate parties thereto, is so well settled by the Supreme Court of the United States, that we rest it with a reference to the following cases: Goodman <em>vs. </em>Simonds, 20 How., 343<em>; </em>Brown <em>vs. </em>Wiley, 20 How., 443; McDonald <em>vs. </em>Magruder, 3 Peters, 474; Forsythe <em>vs. </em>Kimball, 91 U. S., 291; Bank U. S. <em>vs. </em>Dunn, 6 Peters, <em>57; </em>Thompson <em>vs. </em>Insurance Co., 104 U. S., 252; Martin <em>vs. </em>Cole, 104 U. S., 30.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-7\">In Specht <em>vs. </em>Steward, 16 Wallace, 564, Mr. Justice Swayne, \u2022delivering the opinion of the court, quotes from Parsons on Notes and Bills, 507, \u201c that it is a firmly settled principle \u25a0that parol evidence of an oral agreement alleged to have been made at the time of the drawing, making, or endorsing of a bill or note, cannot be permitted to vary, qualify, or contradict, to add to or subtract from the absolute terms of the written contract; \u201d and Mr. Justice Mathews, in the case of Martin, <em>vs. </em>Cole, supra, quoting this, says, that \u201c the question, as it arises in this case, cannot now be considered an open one in this court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-8\">Under these authorities, the evidence offered was inadmissible-in any view, but if the circumstances justified it,, in no aspect could it have been admitted under the pleadings in this suit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>J. W. Douglass for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-4\">1. The defendant offered to prove that, \u201cat the time of the endorsement of the note by the defendant, McMurtrie, the plaintiff promised and agreed to and with the defendant, that if he would endorse the note, he should not be held personally liable on it; that his (McMurtrie\u2019s)' signature was wanted simply because he was one of the board of directors and vice-president' of the company, and that he endorsed the note in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s ^promise and because he was a director and officer of the company.\u201d This evidence should have been heard under the familiar principle that \u201c any facts constituting fraud or misrepresentation, may be set up as a defence to a note, the burden of proof .being on the party alleging it.\u201d And that this principle has uninterrupted play between the immediate parties to a note. Chitty on Bills, 70; Byles on Bills, 243 (150); Parson\u2019s Mer Law, 124; Kerr on Frauds and Mis., 91-99; 21 Pick., 195; 1 Conn., 329; Abbott\u2019s U. S. Dig., 1st Series, 868; 1 Daniel on Neg. Inst., sec. 710; 22 Wis., 21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-5\">2. The defendant offered to prove by the official record of the board of directors, that the note was a company note, for the company\u2019s use alone, and was made in pursuance of certain resolutions passed at certain meetings of the board, at which meetings both the plaintiff' and defendant were present and taking part as members of the board and officers of the company. The resolutions' referred to show beyond doubt, as the note itself does on its face, and by the arrangement .pf names (endorsers) on its back, that the transaction was corporate and not individual. This, being a simple question of fact, without the slightest admixture of legal 'controversy, should have been left to the jury'to determine. To take it from the jury, as was done, was fatal error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-6\">3. The defendant \u201c further offered to prove that the plaintiff' and the defendant were both stockholders or partners in the said company as well as directors at the time 'of the resolution authorizing the original making and renewal of the note in suit,, and were bath present at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>meeting of the board of directors when the said resolutions were considered and passed upon.\u201d This offer was refused, however, and constitutes another grave error, as it robbed the defendant, when considered in connection with the other offers in the case, of the benefit of that principle of law which holds, that \u201c in no case can a man sue when he is both entitled and liable to contribute, though such liability appear neither on the instrument nor on the record.\u201d Byles on Bills, 76 (31) and 157 (130); 6 Pick., 316; 27 Barbour, 552; Parson\u2019s Mer. Law, 128; 1 Daniel on Neg. Inst., \u00a7 703.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-4\">4. The \u201c defendant further offered to prove that as between the plaintiff and the defendant there w\u2019as no consideration for the said endorsement from the plaintiff to the defendant, McMurtrie, or to any other person at the defendant\u2019s instance or request, and that the endorsement was simply an accommodation one, as above recited.\u201d This offer \u2022was rejected, and the defendant deprived of the benefit of the principle applicable to such cases, that \u201c in the case of .an accommodation endorsement there is an implied engagement on the part of the person requesting the accommodation, that he will indemnify the endorser to the extent of the sum payable on the bill.\u201d Chitty on Contracts, 438; 1 Greenleaf\u2019s Evidence, \u00a7284; 2 Greenleaf\u2019s Evidence, \u00a7 171; 1 Daniel on Neg. Inst., \u00a7 679.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-5\">5. The \u201c defendant further offered to prove that at the time the defendant signed the said note as an endorser, all of the signatures of the other endorsers were already on the note, and a place left for the defendant\u2019s name between the names of McCartee, president, and Wyman, secretary, of the said company.\u201d The object of this offer, which was rejected, was to show to the jury that the endorsement by McMurtrie was merely an official act as director and vice-president, and by consequence that he was not individually liable on the note \u2014 at least as between him and the immediate parties to the note. The offer was of great importance on this point, when considered. in connection with the language of the resolutions authorizing the making of the notes, as it showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>with strong inference that all of the parties to the transaction recognized that the defendant\u2019s signature was to be, and was merely official.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-4\">6. The bills of exception further show that \u201c the court rejected all of the evidence offered by the defendant to show the true relations between the plaintiff and defendant, and all evidence tending to show the true purpose and proper liability of the immediate parties and original signers of the said note in suit.\u201d The defendant claimed at the trial, as he claims now, that as between the immediate parties to a note, the obligation is one of ordinary contract, and not to be tested by those more stringent rules, in the interest of trade, that prevail when the controversy is about the rights of third or innocent parties. As between the immediate parties to a note, as the plaintiff and defendant were in this case, in a most striking and emphatic manner, the following rule, taken from one of the latest and ablest authors on the subject, is the true and just measure of responsibility : \u201c As between the immediate parties, the interpretation ought to be in, every case such as will carry their intention into effect, and that their intention may be made out by parol proof of the facts and circumstances which took place at the time of the transaction.\u201d 1 Daniel on Neg. Insts., secs. 174 and 740.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b437-5\">Mr. Chief Justice Cartter</author>\n<p id=\"AYI\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">On the trial of this case an offer was made to show that these parties were directors of the company named in the. paper sued on, and that the company being indebted, the directors, at a meeting held by them, at which the plaintiff' and defendant McMurtrie were both present, resolved to issue two promissory notes of $2,000 each, the notes to be endorsed by the directors and negotiated, and that- the note in suit was a renewal of one of the notes made by virtue of this authority, and further, that at the time of the endorsement Middleton told the defendant that if he would endorse the note he would not be held personally liable on it, that his (McMurtrie\u2019s) signature was wanted simply because he was one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>board of directors and vice-president of the company, and that he, McMurtrie, endorsed the note in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s promise, and because he was a director and officer of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The question arises, what kind of a paper, as between the parties to it, did these directors get up ? Did they make an ordinary piece of commercial paper that left liability to follow in the order of signatures? Or was it the simultaneous and concurrent act of all the parties. It seems to us that this resolution was a part of the written obligation which issued out of it, and that this was a paper concerted in the interest of all the parties. They were all involved in the indebtedness of the company, and they were all desirous of getting rid of that indebtedness, and they were all together when they passed the resolution creating this paper. Now we are asked to change the relative position of the parties to that transaction, and to make one of them the beneficiary of the whole of it, and the remainder of them, or one of them, the bearer of the onus of the obligation which they all united in. Can we do it ? Ought we to do it ? The plaintiff, Middleton, in common with the other parties to this suit, are obligated to protect the paper and see that it is paid. ITis act in taking up the common obligation was nothing more than an advancement by him in behalf of his co-obligors, and entitles him to a contribution for the money that he thus advanced, and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">There is some difficulty about the pleadings which can be easily remedied on another trial. A recovery could be had, however, under the common counts. This paper is declared on as if it were an ordinary promissory note. The pleas, too, are misconceived \u2014 this is not a case of accommodation endorsement. The case is remanded for a new trial, with leave to the parties to amend as they may feel advised.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
