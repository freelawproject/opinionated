Ann Hardy, the life tenant, died in 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">\u2022The above facts were shown upon the trial, but in addition it appeared that one of the plaintiffs, viz., Mary Frances Dawson, who was the Mary Frances White mentioned in the will, was, before the filing of the suit, and at the time of trial, a married woman ; that her husband was living, and that there had been children born of the marriage. At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, defendant\u2019s counsel moved the court to instruct the jury, \u201cthat'the plaintiffs could not recover in the present action because of the non-joinder of the husband of the co-plaintiff, Mary Frances Dawson, he being a necessary party.\u201d The motion was granted, and the court instructed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant, which was done, and the case came before the General Term upon an exception to this instruction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-6\">W.

Peters <em>vs. </em>Suters, 2 Mac A., 519.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-6\">The act of 1876, it is said, ignores them ; therefore they do not exist. But they are not within the evil sought to be remedied by the act. It seeks to compel a partition. In joint tenancy, each tenant by his own act can destroy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-7\">This court has, however, recently recognized the existence of joint tenancies.

Dawson, <em>in jure uxoris, </em>had a life estate as tenant by the courtesy, and as such tenant was, entitled to the possession and profits to the exclusion of his wife. There was no error, in the ruling of the court below that he should have been a party plaintiff in this action, for he was a necessary party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-6\">'A tenant by the courtesy initiate may sue alone for the possession of his wife\u2019s land and for damages for withholding it.

Bratton <em>vs. </em>Mitchell, 7 Watts, 113.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-8\">At common law the husband\u2019s interest iu the estates of which the wife was possessed, at the time of the marriage was a freehold, he alone having the right of entry and the present right of exclusive enjoyment. The wife could not recover the lands from a stranger, even though her husband was joined as defendant, and disclaimed title, and admitted the wife\u2019s right to possession. Clark <em>vs. </em>Clark, 20 Ohio St., 128.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-9\">Actual seizen is not necessary in order to entitle husband to courtesy. It is sufficient that the wife had title and a potential seizin or right of seizin \u2014 that is, the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u25a0demand and recover the immediate possession.

Hence on a joint demise the title proved must be joint, or the ..plaintiffs cannot recover. Taylor <em>vs. </em>Taylor, 3 A. K.

Dawson, was not, and could not be, affected by the Married Woman\u2019s Act (April 10, 1869); it is true, the life -estate to Ann Hardy did not fall in until after the passage of that act ; but the estate to the devisees, the plaintiffs, was -a vested estate in remainder from and after the death of the testator, in 1842 ; the statute is not retroactive. Hart <em>vs. </em>Dean, 2 Mac A., 60.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b353-9\">Mr. Justice Cox</author>\n<p id=\"AsA\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">This was an action of ejectment. The material facts of \u2022the case are, that in making out title in ejectment, the plaintiffs relied upon a will executed by William Magill, in November, 1842, in which he says : \u201c I devise to Ann Hardy \u2022part of lot one in square nine hundred and seventy-five, together with all the improvements thereon, during her \u2022\u25a0natural life, and at her decease I devise said property to my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>three grandchildren, Angelica Fowler, James William White and Mary Frances White, them and their heirs forever.\u201d The testator died in the year following the making of hie will, that is, in the year 1843, and the will was then admitted to probate. Ann Hardy, the life tenant, died in 1876. Just here it will be observed, that the title accrued originally to this plaintiff, Mary Frances White, now Dawson, by virtue of the will, as far back as 1843, before the-passage of the Mamed Woman\u2019s Act of 1869, while it is true that she only got the property in possession in 1876, after the passage of the Married Woman\u2019s Act. But as the <em>title-</em>was derived by her from this will in 1843, we think her rights in relation to the property are to be determined by the common law, and that the case does not come within the operation of the act of 1869. She and her co-tenants then instituted an action of ejectment, which is the case before us ; and at the trial it appeared that Mary Frances Dawson, one of the plaintiffs, had a husband, and also children of the marriage, living ; and the plaiutiffs having rested their case, the defendant, by his counsel, moved the court to instruct the jury that the plaintiffs had shown themselves out of' court, and not entitled to recover \u25a0 in the present action because of the non-joinder of the husband of the co-plaintiff,, Mary Frances Dawson. The answer made to this by Mrs.. Dawson is, that she was a joint tenant ; that in case of her death the rights of the survivors would be paramount to any right as tenant by courtesy in her husband ; that he is \u00bfnot entitled to courtesy in the property in which she is one of the parties interested, and has no interest in it, and therefore it is not necessary that he should join in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Now, all that may be very true, but there is really no question of tenancy by courtesy in the case The husband would not become such until the death of the wife. But independently of any question of title by courtesy, the husband has a freehold in the wife\u2019s freehold property by the fact of' marrittge ; he has the exclusive right to the possession, and rents and profits of it, and that is equivalent to a freehold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>during the coverture. It is an interest that his creditor can seize upon execution, as was determined by this court in the case of Bank <em>vs. </em>Hitz, 1 Mackey, 111, and as is held in all the common law books. So that the husband, as a party interest, has the exclusive right to the wife\u2019s freehold during coverture, although it is held in joint tenancy. Consequently, the wife does show that the property which is claimed here is really for the purposes of personal possession and enjoyment, in her husband, who is not a party to the suit. It is claimed that this objection should have been made by way of plea in abatement, and cannot be taken advange of at the trial. If it was a mere question of personal capacity to sue, that would be so ; the wife\u2019s coverture should be pleaded in abatement. But it is a question of title. At the trial of the case, when the claimants try to make out their title, they show one-third is in another party, and consequently they cannot recover. It is therefore appropriate to the general issue to show that the title claimed by one of the female plaintiffs is in her husband and not in herself. We think the court below was right in ruling that the plaintiffs had shown themselves out of court by this proof, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
