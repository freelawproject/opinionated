The plaintiff averred in his complaint that the premises were detained without right by Charles G. Godfrey and Ephraim S. Randall, to whom plaintiff had leased the same under the firm name of Godfrey <em>&amp; </em>Randall, and whose tenancy and estate therein had determined by the terms of the lease.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b170-11\">Godfrey did not appear and no step was taken in his behalf. Randall appeared and filed a plea of title, averring : \u201c That the title to said premises is in Mary E. Stone, and that, the said title hereby claimed is not derived from any letting of the premises by the plaintiff, or by those under whom the plaintiff claims, and is not derived from any forcible entry or forcible detainer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary id=\"b170-12\">Plaintiff objected, that this plea was defective in its failure to aver that the defendant claimed the premises under Mary E. Stone.</summary>\n\n<summary id=\"b171-4\">1st. Because the former plea of title has been by the court adjudged a nullity, and it was the duty of the justice of the peace, when the cause was remanded to him, to have tried the same, and to have rendered judgment in the matter as the right of the case required.</summary>\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b171-7\">Wm. 3?.

An appeal lies to the General Term from an order of the Circuit Court striking out a plea of title in a landlord and tenant case and remanding the same to the justice of the peace for trial on the merits.</p><p id=\"AN_\">2. When a defective plea of title is strciken out by the Circuit Court and the cause remanded to the justice of the peace the defendant may there file a new or amended plea of title.</p><p id=\"b170-9\">Statement oe the Case and Decision oe the Court.</p><p id=\"b170-13\">The justice certified the case to the Circuit Court, where the plaintiff moved to strike out the plea of title and remand the cause to the justice for trial on the merits. This motion was sustained, and the cause thereafter coming on for trial before the justice, the defendant filed a perfected plea, averring that he claimed under said Mary E. Stone, in whom he pleaded title. The case being again certified to the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Court for trial on this plea, the plaintiff again moved to strike it out and to remand the cause to the justice for the following reasons :</p><p id=\"b171-5\">2d. Because the said defendant Randall elected to stand upon his former plea of title, and cannot file a second plea \u2022or amend his former plea ; and because no amendment to a plea of title or additional plea can lawfully be made.</p><p id=\"b171-6\">This motion being sustained, the defendant appealed to the General Term, where the judgment was reversed and the \u2022cause remanded to the Circuit Court for trial upon the plea \u2022of title as amended.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
