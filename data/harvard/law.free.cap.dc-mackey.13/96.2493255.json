C., 199) is exactly in point. The testator devised to his wife for life and after her death to his three daughters and to their heirs,, exectitors, administrators and assigns forever. It was there held that the daughters took the remainder in joint tenancy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-4\">This rule is as well recognized in equity as in law, as the above cases cited show.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az\">Such words of severance as \u201cto be equally divided between them,\u201d Griswold <em>vs. </em>Johnson, 5 Conn., 365 ; \u201cdivided equally among her children,\u201d Whiting <em>vs. </em>Cook, 8 Allen, 63; \u201cto be equally divided between them, share and share alike,\u201d' Parks <em>vs. </em>Knowlton, 14 Pick., 432, Emerson <em>vs. </em>Cutler, 14 Pick., 108, Allison vs. Kurtz, 2 Watts, 185; \u201cin equal shares,\u201d Gilpin <em>vs. </em>Hollingsworth, 3 Md., 190; \u201cshare and share alike,\u201d 17 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 61, and numerous other cases-where such or equivalent language is used, have been held to-make an estate granted or devised a tenancy in common instead of a joint tenancy, as it would have been without such words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-6\">All these cases show that an estate created by such words-as are made use of in the case on trial must be a joint tenancy. The ground of the decision in all such cases is-that particular words were used from which the court collected an intention in the testator to create a tenancy in common.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-7\">The only variation of the rule to interpret such language as devises the \u201cMiller House\u201d and the \u201cPat Dulany House\u201d to the two sons as passing a joint tenancy is where statutes-have substantially abolished such an estate or made express-provision for changing the interpretation adopted at common law. In our jurisdiction there has been no change of the common law, and estates in joint tenancy have been repeatedly recognized.

It is,, however, such an intention as may be gathered from the language of the will itself, and hence it is the legal inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tion, and not the actual intention which the law seeks after.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-4\">A general or moral view or fancy of the intention of the testator, unless expressed in the will as controlling the devises, may not be sought after, and however agreeable to a sense of the fitness of things and equality in division among beneficiaries, has no force in the interpretation of unequivocal language.

T. Merrick and J. J. Darlington for defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-6\">The old common law doctrine of joint tenancy, with it\u00bb incident of survivorship, has been abandoned in every State and territory in the United States, unless it be held that it still lingers in the District of Columbia. Nor has express statutory provision been held necessary to its abolition. Sergeant vs. Steinberger, 2 Ohio, 306; see, also, Miles vs. Fisher, 10 Ohio, 1; Phelps vs. Jetson, 1 Root, 48; Lowe vs. Brooks, 23 Ga., 325; Nichols vs. Denny, 37 Miss., 59.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-7\">Unless the reasoning of these eases shall be disapproved of by this court, estates in joint tenancy n,o more exist here than in Ohio, and the other States noted above. For not-only have we \u201c no statutes recognizing the existence of any such principle as the right of survivorship,\u201d but we, too, have laws authorizing joint tenants, as well as tenants in common, to demand and have partition.\u201d \"See Md. Act of 1794, ch. 60, sec. 8; Act of 1797, ch. 114, sec. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-9\">Nor does there seem to be any reported case, either in this court or its predecessors, or in the Supreme Court of the\u201c United States, in which the right of survivorship has been recognized and enforced in this District. And the act of August 15,1876, providing for compulsory partition between \u201c all tenants in common and coparceners of any estate in lands, tenements or hereditaments, equitable as well as legal, within the District of Columbia,\u201d not only does not recognize, but ignores, the existence of estates in joint tenancy here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>But, if this court shall be unwilling to adopt and follow the reasoning of the very respectable courts cited above, it is established by an overwhelming and unanimous mass of authorities, that such estates are not to be favored, and that courts are \u201c to exercise their <em>ingenuity </em>against them.\u201d See Martin <em>vs. </em>Smith, 5 Binney, 16; Evans vs. Brittain, 3 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>R., 135; Galbraith <em>vs. </em>Galbraith, 3 Serg. &amp; R., 392; Bambaugh <em>vs. </em>Bambaugh, 11 Serg. &amp; R., 191; Chew <em>vs. </em>Chew, 1 Md., 168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-5\">To the same effect are all the American authorities, and, for more than a century past, the English authorities also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-6\">If it shall be held that estates in joint tenancy still exist here, we have, therefore, at least this established proposition to start with: that the devise in controversy here is not to be construed an estate of that description if there be any escape from such a construction; that the court is \u201c required \u201d as well as inclined to \u201c give the widest and most liberal construction \u201d to Abraham Butler\u2019s will, in order to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim. It is conceived, however, that, in this case, a fair and natural interpretation of the testator\u2019s meaning, as disclosed in the will, will be sufficient for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-7\">Where words having a technical signification are used, but it is evident from the context that the testator used them in a sense different from their technical one, they are to be construed according to the- sense in which the testator understood them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-8\">And where any word is used in a will in a non-technical sense, or in a sense peculiar to the testator, the courts will construe such word in the same sense throughout the will; or, as the rule is sometimes stated, \u201c Words are ordinarily to receive the same construction in every part of the instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">These two rules of construction are so well established as, doubtless, to render superfluous any citation of authorities in support of them. Some illustrations of their application, however, will be given, after their bearing upon the present case has been pointed out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>It will be observed that in the two clauses of the will in which the testator makes provision for the children of his first and of his second marriage, quoted above, the conveying words used are precisely the same. In the first he \u201cgives and bequeaths\u201d to Elizabeth, Ferdinand and Mary, and, in the second, he \u201cgives and bequeaths\u201d to \"William and John, without either words of inheritance or words of severalty in either case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\">But, looking to the latter part of the first of these devises, it is unmistakably obvious that the testator did not understand or use these words, \u201cI give and bequeath,\u201d without more, in their ordinary, limited, technical sense <em>\u00a1 </em>for he goes on to provide that, after the death of <em>one-</em>of these three devisees, and <em>of his </em>daughter, the <em>share given to him </em>should revert to the testator\u2019s heirs-at-law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">It is, therefore, as evident as if the testator had expressly so declared, that he understood and used the words. \u201cI give and bequeath,\u201d as conveying to his children distinct interests, which, on the death of any one of them,, would pass to his child, and upon the death of that child would continue to regularly descend, unless otherwise ex-pressty limited. In other words, the testator understood and 'used the words \u201c I give and bequeath,\u201d in this clause of his will, as conveying the devised property to his children as tenants in common, and in fee, except as tO' Ferdinand\u2019s share, which was to be for his own life and that of his daughter only, and then revert.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">This being the obvious sense in which the testator understood and used the words in question in that clause of the will in which he makes provision for the children of his first marriage, it is submitted, upon principle and upon the authorities, that he must be understood to continue so to use and understand them when he comes, in the immediately succeeding clause, to provide for the children of his second marriage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">\u201c Where, throughout any instrument, words are used in a peculiar sense, one part may be explained by reference to another. And ordinarily words are to receive the same</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u2022construction in every part of the instrument.\u201d Elliot <em>vs. </em>Carter, 12 Pick., 442; and see Bundy <em>vs. </em>Bundy, 38 N.

The court said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">\u201cWe have looked over the whole of this will to find out what was really intended. Now we find one clause giving to Eliza Perry, a house and lot for the benefit of her children, who were evidently looked upon as a group to which this property was given as a provision. The same course was followed in the devise of another house and lot to Mary Langly and her children, whether many or few. The testator then has one more house left, and this he gives to the same mothers for their children, and our conclusion is that he intended to regard them as groups, in this instance, <em>j list as he had done before.\u201d</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-6\">Mr. Justice Cox</author>\n<p id=\"AhL\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">These cases were actions of ejectment and depend upon the interpretation to be given to the will of Abraham Butler. He says in his will \u201cand after the.death of my said wife, I give and bequeath to Elizabeth Catherine Earhart, my (laughter, and to my son Ferdinand Butler, and to my \u2022daughter Mary Virginia Butler, the house and lot situated \u2022on the north side of P street between 11th and 12th streets, square number 290, and now occupied by R. C. Washington as my tenant, together with the piece of ground purchased by me, from Henry Turner to drain the same; and after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>death of Ferdinand Butler and his daughter Sarah Butler, I \u25a0desire and request that the interest in property bequeathed to said Ferdinand Butler, shall then revert to my heirs-at-law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">And for the children of his second marriage he provided as follows: \u201cAnd after the death of my said wife Sarah Butler, I give and bequeath to my sons William Joseph Butler and John A. Butler, the house and premises herein \u25a0described and known as the \u201cMiller House,\u201d adjoining the house in which I now live, and'the house known as the \u201c Pat Dulaney House,\u201d situated on the west side of 13th street, between E and F streets, which said house I give and bequeath to my said wife Sarah Butler during her natural life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">William Joseph Butler died, leaving a wife and child, and John A. Butler, having the impression that he was entitled to the whole of the property as surviving joint tenant, instituted these actions of ejectment to recover the property. 'The only question is whether he was a joint tenant ora ten\u25a0ant in common with his deceased brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The mere devise to the two sons William Joseph and John .A. Butler, without more, would give a life estate in joint tenancy. Such a devise, after a previous devise of the same property for life, would be considered by some courts a gift -of the fee, but it would still be a joint tenancy. But on both questions, viz., whether it be a life estate merely, and \u25a0whether in joint tenancy, or in common, light is thrown on the intention of the testator from other parts of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In the previous clause to the one in controversy, if we \u2022omit the reference to Ferdinand Butler\u2019s daughter, we will have a devise to a son and two daughters generally, with a provision, that after the death of the son, the interest in the property bequeathed to him shall revert to the testator\u2019s .heirs-at-law. This implies, that according to the testator\u2019s understanding of the general language he had already used, it would, but for this provision, go elsewhere. If he \u2022understood the nature of a joint \u25a0 tenancy, which is hardly -supposable, he might have thought that it would survive to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the others. More probably, he thought that it would descend to the heirs of Ferdinand. And, indeed, the language <em>\u201c </em>the interest in. property bequeathed to said Ferdinand,\u201d' &amp;c., indicates that he supposed he had bequeathed a separate interest to him, and not strictly a joint interest to him and others. But this probability becomes almost certainty when we add the reference to Ferdinand\u2019s daughter. lie gave-nothing in terms to this daughter, but directed that her father\u2019s share after her death should revert. Did he mean by implication to give her a life estate, after a life estate which he understood he had given to her father, or did he assume that the father\u2019s share would descend to the daughter in fee by virtue of his previous general devise, and design, by this provision, to reduce it to a life estate in her? It seems toils the latter was the testator\u2019s intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">lie desires and requests, not that Ferdinand\u2019s <em>share </em>shall revert, but that the interest, <em>i. e., the </em>estate, in property bequeathed to Ferdinand, shall, <em>after the death of his daughter,. </em>revert to the testator\u2019s heirs-at-law; all of which seems to-assume that the <em>estate </em>bequeathed to Ferdinand was such as-to descend to his daughter in fee, if not thus diverted in another direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">It seems to usj then, that he understood his general devise-in this clause, unmodified, to have the effect, of giving an, estate in common, in fee simple ; or, in other words, that he-used the language which he employed in that sense. And-, inasmuch as he used the same phraseology in the following-clause, we think he used it in the same sense there. The-authorities seem abundantly to justify us in translating a meaning which the context gives to language employed in, one clause, to the same language employed in another. And we feel especially justified in doing so, when it avoids the result, which the testator could hardly have intended, of' cutting off the family of one son in favor of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We think the intention was to give an estate in common-to the two brothers, and that the court below was right in holding the plaintiff not -entitled to recover, as claimed in. the declaration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
