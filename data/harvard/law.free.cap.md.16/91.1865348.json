J. S. Nicholas, who, in part payment of the purchase money, gave his two notes, one for $222.42, and the other for $1000, each payable \u201cto the order\u201d of the plaintiff, \u201cuse of her separate estate.\u201d These notes were placed in the hands of the defendant as collateral security for three checks, drawn by Mrs. Owings on the defendant, amounting to $505; two of which checks were payable to the order of Samuel C. Owings, and the other to bearer. The notes and checks were entered by the defendant in a bank book, produced by the-plaintiff at the trial, and these notes were paid by Col. Nicholas at maturity to the defendant, and this suit was brought by the plaintiff after the death of Samuel C. Owings to recover the balance of the amount of the notes after deducting the checks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">The defendant proved by J. S. Nicholas, Esq., that Col. Owings applied to him to borrow money on a mortgage of Mr. Owings\u2019 separate estate for her use, and afterwards, as her agent, sold a part of her property to him, and that the two notes in question were given by witness to Col. Owings, for his wife, in part payment for said property, and that, witness paid these notes at the banking house of Josiah Lee &amp; Co., of which house the defendant was a partner. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>fendantalso proved, by S. H. Taggart, Esq., that Ool. Owings came to witness, who was attorney for Gover, to get witness to go with him to Gover, and Col. Owings then had both notes in his hands, endorsed by Mrs. Owings; they we\u00f1t together to Gover, and witness told Gover the notes were good and he could with safety take them; witness was called upon by Col. Owings to accompany him to the banking house of Josiah Lee &lt;fc Co,, to see Mr. Gover in relation to said negotiations between them; it was stated that Gover had made advances on account of the notes in question; the amount of the notes and advances were calculated at the counter in the presence of witness, and Gover paid to Col. Owings a further sum of money as an advance, which witness understood was the full amount that would be coming to him; witness saw no check and no book at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\">It was admitted by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that the defendant had paid to Col. Owings the whole amount of the balance now claimed by the plaintiff, but when and how paid is not admitted, and it is not admitted that Col. Owings was authorized by Mrs. Owings to receive it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\">Upon these facts, several prayers were offered on the part of the defendant, which were rejected by the court (Lee, J.) to which rulings the defendant excepted. The ground upon which the decision of this court is made, renders a statement of these prayers unnecessary. The verdict and judgment were in favor of the plaintiff and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b108-7\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, C.

That the notes in question, and their proceeds when collected, were at law the property, .not of Mrs. Owings, but of her husband, and were subject to his disposition and control. Under this marriage contract or agreement, there is nothing to show that Mrs. Owings had, <em>at law, </em>any such title to the property as would prevent the marital rights of the husband from attaching, whatever might be the effect in equity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>4 <em>Md.

Now, whatever may be the construction of this marriage contract in other respects, it certainly did not create Deluol the legal trustee of Mrs. Owings, and if it created a trust for her separate use, and no trustee was appointed, her husband became her trustee, and as such had the right to collect the notes. 3 <em>Md.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALP\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">This is an action to recover from the appellant, who was the defendant below, a <em>sum of money </em>alleged to have been improperly and illegally paid to the husband of the plaintiff during his life, said sum being claimed as belonging to and as part of her sole and separate estate. The circumstances of the case may be thus briefly stated: The plaintiff, contemplating an intermarriage with a gentleman, who subsequently became her husband, together with him and another, executed the instrument of the 7th day of June 1858. This paper is designated in the record as the \u201cmarriage settlement,\u201d and was doubtless intended by the parties to it to convey out of her the <em>legal </em>title to her estate and to vest it in a trustee for her sole and exclusive use. It is not very artistically drawn, and did not, in our opinion, accomplish, in this particular, its intended office. We regard all those portions of it which refer to the interference of the third party (Louis R. Deluol) with her property, <em>as covenants </em>between the parties that her estate should be reserved to her free from the control of and liability-for the debts of her intended husband. But, whilst we do not consider the instrument as directly divesting her of the legal estate, we deem it sufficient to authorize her to direct the manner in which it should be <em>\u201cinvested and </em>appropriated,\u201d and for <em>\u201csuch purposes\u201d </em>as she might <em>\u201cthink fit.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In this state of marital relations between the plaintiff and her husband, a portion of her estate was disposed of to J. Spear Nicholas, who gave his notes for it. They promise to pay to the <em>\u201corder\u201d </em>of the plaintiff, \u201cuse of her separate <em>estate.\u201d </em>These notes were paid at the banking-house of Josiah Lee &amp; Co.', of which firm, the defendant was a member. From the evidence it appears they were endorsed in blank, and, in this condition, were in the possession of the husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>of the plaintiff, who obtained advances on them from the defendant. A portion of these advances were made on the checks of the plaintiff, and the residue paid to her husband. It is to recover this residue that this action was brought, it being insisted, that the defendant having received and collected the notes, knowing that they belonged to the separate estate of the plaintiff, he received them and their proceeds, subject to, and charged with the trust, and that the payments, other than on the checks of the plaintiff, were made by the defendant in his own wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">It is admitted that the defendant paid the whole amount received by him, part on the checks of the plaintiff, and the balance of it to her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In the view we have of this case it is not important to inquire, whether, the plaintiff had the right, under the terms of the ante-nuptial contract, to appropriate the proceeds of the note, if she thought \u201cfit,\u201d to her husband, or, whether, by the law governing negotiable paper, she had, by the very terms of the note, power to confer title on the holder, either by a special or blank endorsement. If the power existed in either supposed case, then, clearly, this action cannot be maintained. But, we do not decide the case on such ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">When a trust is created in behalf of a married woman, and there is no legal trustee created by the settlement, her husband becomes her trustee by operation of law, and as such, has the right to reduce into possession her <em>ckoses in action </em>for her sole use and benefit. And, like any other trustee, he and his representatives are responsible to her separate estate for whatever funds he may receive belonging to it. In virtue of this principle the husband of the plaintiff became her trustee, and was entitled to collect the note in question. If he misapplied the proceeds, his estate is liable to her claim, and not the party who has once honestly paid the amount of it. The case of <em>Bennet vs. Davis, 2 Peere Williams, </em>316, is to the point, that where there is a devise to <em>&amp; feme covert </em>for her separate use, without appointing any trustee, a court of equity will supply the want of one by regarding the husband as such.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b112-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>(Decided June 12th, 1860.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">It is the duty of trustees, as of executors, to render available the <em>choses in action </em>of their <em>cestui que trust, </em>and to enable them to do this, they have the right to resort to the proper means for their collection. Their receipt and release is a sufficient acquittance to the debtor. The only exception to this is, where the debtor knows the trustee intends to commit a breach of trust; in such a case, it would not, according to some of the authorities, be safe to pay to the trustee, whether he has an express power of signing receipts or not. But, even in such cases, the fact of such knowledge must be brought home to the person paying, so as to make him <em>particeps criminis, </em>a privy to the fraud. <em>Lewin on Trusts, </em>331, <em>marginal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In the case now before the court, there is no pretence or allegation of fraud against the appellant; all that has been contended for is, that the circumstances under which he received the notes were sufficient to inform him that they belonged to a trust fund. This was not sufficient to invalidate his payments to the trustee; something further was necessary; a knowledge on the part of the debtor of a purposed fraudulent misapplication of the fund by the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Prom what we have said, it will appear, we are of opinion the plaintiff cannot recover against the defendant on the facts in this case, and, it is, therefore, not necessary we should consider the form of the instructions granted or refused by the court. We reverse the judgment without <em>procedendo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
