Held:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b233-8\">That a prayer, by the defendant, to the effect that this entry was insufficient, if the jury find that the contract made was a sale on a credit of six months, is erroneous and was properly rejected, because it ignores this proof of usage, the truth of which the court was bound to assume when deciding upon the prayer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b233-9\">An entry of a sale of eoff'eo not stating any credit, is not an insufficient note, or memorandum, for want of a proper, or any specification of the length of credit, when, by mercantile usage, such a sale is a sale on six months\u2019 credit; the entry, in connection with the usage, is an entry of a sale with six months\u2019 credit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b233-10\">A sold note, or memorandum of sale, made out and delivered to the purchaser, by the <em>broker, after </em>the vendor had refused to ratify the sale, and after express notice of such refusal had been given, both to the broker and purchaser, is not a sufficient note or memorandum of the bargain to bind the vendor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b233-11\">Where a broker has authority to make an absolute sale, not subject to the approval of the vendor, (his principal,) and within the scope of such authority, makes such a sale, it is valid, whether the broker was influenced in making it by the approbation of the vendor\u2019s clerk or not, or whether the sale was afterwards objected to by the vendor or not.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b233-12\">A bargain for the sale of coffee, upon the terms, that the paper therefor should be satisfactory to the seller, is not sufficiently evidenced, under the Statute of Frauds, by a note or memorandum which does not mention whether the paper for the price should be satisfactory to the seller or not.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>When the evidence relied on, to sustain the facts which are the basis of a prayer, is in conflict, or inconsistent, with other evidence offered by the opposite party, in relation to the same facts, the prayer should not be refused merely because it docs not mention or notice the opposing or conflicting evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-5\">Where there is conflicting, or inconsistent, evidence, in relation to the same matter, either party has the right to ask the court to instruct the jury what should be the legal effect of their finding that the facts which are made the groundwork of his prayer are true.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-6\">In an action, by the purchaser, to recover damages for the non-performance, by the vendor, of a contract for the sale of a lot of coffee, there was no proof that the coffee was to be paid for, either by satisfactory paper or by cash, on any particular day, or at any specified period of time. There was no delivery, or offer of delivery, by the vendor, but, on the contrary, he very promptly, after being informed of the sale, refused to comply with the bargain. Held:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-7\">That the plaintiff was not hound to prove, at the trial, in order to entitle him to a verdict, that at, or before the time of suit brought, he had in his possession, or under his control, sufficient money or a sufficient amount of paper satisfactory to the seller, to cover the price of the coffee, ready to be handed over to the vendor simultaneously with the delivery of the coffee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-8\">In an action for not delivering goods, where no time is fixed for the completion of the contract, the damages must be calculated from the period at which the defendant refuses to perform it; such refusal leaves no <em>locus penitential </em>to the defendant, and the plaintiff cannot treat the agreement as any longer subsisting.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-9\">Where, in an action for the non-delivery of a lot of coffee, the defendant refused, on a certain day, to ratify the sale and deliver the coffee, and the plaintiff at that time had not paid, or offered to .pay, any part of the price, such refusal constitutes a breach of the contract at that time, and the measure of damages is the difference, if any, between the price of a lot of coffee, of the same quality and quantity, at the time of such breach, and the price at which the same had been sold.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b234-10\">Appeal from the Superior Court of Baltimore City.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqm\">Assumpsit, brought on the 10th of September 1853, by the appellees, partners, trading as Woods, Bridges &amp; Co., against the appellant and John B.

The name of William Howell &lt;fc Son, being written, not by either of the brokers, but by Mr. Hall, <em>their clerk, </em>is not signed by a person duly authorized as required by the <em>Statute of Frauds.

The memorandum is not <em>signed </em>at all by the defendant, by the plaintiffs, or by the brokers. A sufficient memorandum ought to show, not merely <em>the parties </em>to .the contract, the <em>subject-matter, </em>the <em>price </em>and <em>terms, </em>but ought to show, <em>ex-facie, </em>that it was <em>signed </em>by the party to be charged, or by some agent thereunto properly authorized. 15 <em>Pick., </em>307, <em>Brewster vs. Hobatt.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\">3rd.

It did not show whether the price was to be paid <em>in cash, </em>or on <em>credit, </em>or what <em>length </em>of credit, and whether on <em>security </em>or how. It did not say whether delivery was to be made <em>before </em>payment or after payment, or when, nor the quantity of coffee sold. It did not show that <em>the paper was to be made satisfactory </em>to the vendors, as proved by Mr. White.

But even if the memorandum was in form sufficient, the brokerhad no authority in fact to make it. 1st. Because if the evidence of Mr. Wright and Mr. Jenkins, as to usage, was accredited, the usage proved by them, limited the authority of the brokers to the mere office of middle-men, only authorized to contract subject to approval. They were bound to report the offer before acceptance. <em>Russell on Factors, </em>453. 2nd. The authority of the brokers was limited in its duration. It was not merely <em>revocable </em>but was <em>temporary </em>in its character. The evidence of Mr. Wright, as to usage in this respect, is very decided. <em>Blackburn on Sales, </em>115. 4 <em>Camp., </em>279, <em>Dickinson vs. Lilwall. </em>2 <em>Eng. C. L.

There was evidence from which it might have been found by the jury, that the entry was not made until the 5th of September. 4th. But even if Mr. White had the authority, as broker, to make this mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>orandum, (if lie had intended to act on the basis of this authority,) yet there is evidence from which it could properly have been found that he did not really act on such basis, but acted in virtue of a supposed special authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-4\">3rd. There is no sufficient evidence of a <em>special </em>authority. The clerk of the defendant had no authority to bind the defendant, and of course could impart none to Mr. \"White.

The <em>sold note, </em>or memorandum of sale given by Mr. White to the plaintiffs, does not conform to the actual agreement as proved. It omits the very essential condition, that \u201cthe paper was to be satisfactory to the sellers.\u201d Without the addition of this material condition, <em>the memor\u00e1ndum </em>would have been good for nothing, because of the variance between it and the real contract as proved.

Besides the general objections, there are special objections to all the prayers of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">The first, as originally propounded, not only assumes that the entry might be validly made in part by the broker\u2019s clerk, and might be <em>subsequently </em>changed by the broker, by additions thereto, but affirms, <em>as matter of law, </em>that said note was a memorandum to bind the defendant, <em>without leaving it to the jury </em>to find, <em>as matter of fact, </em>whether said memorandum did or did not conform to the agreement actually made. The proviso was no doubt intended to avoid this objection, but the proviso leaves it to <em>the </em>jury to construe <em>the </em>sense and signification of the entry, (which, being in writing, was the office of the court,) and authorizes the jury to decide whether said entry, <em>as they may interpret its sense and signification, </em>correctly shows the parties to, and the terms of, the assumed contract with the plaintiffs. This prayer affirms that an entry made, in part, by the <em>clerk </em>of a broker, if made under the actual presence, direction and supervision of the broker, and subsequently completed by the broker himself, whether so completed on the same day, or on a subsequent day, if made before the revocation, by the principal, of the authority, is sufficient to bind the principal, if, in other respects, the memorandum complies with the statute; and it further affirms that, in order to show the sufficiency of the memorandum in other respects, <em>the jury </em>may find as a fact that the memorandum represents, truly and fully, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>terms <em>of, </em>and parties to, the contract, either expressly, that is, by its legal interpretation, or by the meaning of its language and figures, under an assumed established usage and custom of merchants in Baltimore. But it does not give the court\u2019s infeipretation of the memorandum, considered <em>per se, </em>nor does it state the supposed custom and usage, nor does it ask the court to say that such supposed custom and usage is a valid one, nor does it leave it to the jury to find the existences of any custom, but really <em>assumes </em>the existence of an unexplained, assured, established custom. 10 <em>Md. Rep., </em>248, <em>Burroughs vs. Langley. 7 G.&amp; </em>J.,321, <em>Dorsey vs. Eagle, </em>6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>37, <em>Foley &amp; Woodside vs. Mason.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-6\">The second prayer leaves it to the jury to find that Murgiondo was authorised and empowered by Wm. Howell <em>&amp;&gt; </em>Son to accept an offer for the coffee in question, whereas there was no evidence from which the jury could properly find such authority. It leaves it to the jury to find that Murgiondo <em>acted </em>within the <em>scope of his authority </em>in accepting the offer, or in confirming the sale, whereas there is no evidence of the <em>existence of </em>any authority, much less of its <em>extent. </em>It moreover declares, that the entry by Murgiondo, the letter to Williams, and his telegram, constitute a sufficient memorandum of the sale, and leaves the jury to find the meaning of said documents, from usage and custom, whereas there was no proof of usage and custom in relation to the meaning of any of said documents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">The third prayer is compounded of the first and second,, and is liable to the same exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-8\">The fourth makes the bought note a sufficient memorandum, notwithstanding the objections already stated, and the special objection that it was made <em>after </em>the revocation of the authority claimed to have been given to White &amp; Elder. Besides, the provisos are very vague and indefinite, and calculated to mislead the jury \u2014 at least, to embarrass and confuse them in deciding the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-9\">The fifth assumes that it was necessary for the plaintiffs to establish, as a fact in the cause, that the bought note was actually written and delivered <em>before </em>the dissent of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ants, and before the revocation of the authority of White &amp; Elder, if any existed; and, by granting the prayer, the court makes the act of a mere witness <em>prima facie </em>evidence against the defendants. Even if it might be presumed, from the date, that it was <em>written </em>on day of its date, on what principle can it be inferred that it was <em>delivered </em>on that day? The natural order is changed, and the <em>onus </em>is put on the defendants of disproving what the plaintiff ought to <em>prove </em>affirmatively.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-5\">It is not deemed necessary to refer to the prayers of the defendant, as they have already been sufficiently considered in discussing the several points above staled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-6\">But (he verbal instructions given by the judge to the jury, although stated as not meant, or intended to be given, as <em>additional </em>to the several instructions contained in the granted prayers, yet they were <em>explanatory </em>of the court\u2019s views and opinions, and even if counsel had been at liberty to argue to the contrary, <em>(7 G. &amp; J., </em>341, <em>Sowerwein vs. Jones,) </em>yet they were well calculated to mislead and influence the jury, and to embarrass the defendant\u2019s counsel in argument.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-7\"><em>John H.

That the entry in the sales-book of White &amp; Elder, under the circumstances testified to by 'White, if it contained expressly or according to the mercantile interpretation of it, the terms of and parties to a contract of sale made by them, within the scope of their authority was a sufficient memorandum, under the Statute of Frauds, to bind their principals. <em>Story on Sales, sec. </em>266. <em>Story on Cont., sec. </em>786. <em>Story on Agency, sec. </em>28. <em>Russell on Factors and Brokers, </em>67. <em>Dunlap's Paley's Agency, </em>176, note <em>(n,) 315, </em>note <em>(g.) </em>6 <em>Eng.

It is said, by the appellant\u2019s counsel, that the Statute requires the signing by the party, or his authorized <em>agent, </em>and that the <em>clerk </em>of the agent is not the agent of the party. The word agent is used in the Statute in its ordinary common law acceptation. An agent may make his clerk do a mere <em>mechanical </em>act. He cannot delegate those things requiring integrity, intelligence, fidelity, or the exercise of discretion \u2014 ho cannot send his clerk out to make the contract of sale, but such a delegation of power is quite different from a case like this, where the agent merely uses the <em>hand of the clerk, </em>acting under his eye and supervision, to perform a mere mechanical act. The hand of the clerk exercises no discretion or intelligence. But if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>be conceded, as the authorities establish, that the memorandum, or any part of it, may be printed, this is a concession of the power of the <em>clerk </em>to do the same mechanical act as the man who sets up the type. The appellees were entitled to show, as they did, by the testimony of White &amp;\u25a0 Eider, that this entry and the other memoranda which they relied on as binding the appellant, contained, acccording to the received mercantile interpretation of them, the terms of the contract which was made. 14 <em>How., </em>456. 7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>321, <em>Dorsey vs. Eagle. </em>10 <em>Md.

The appellants, even if they so intended, had no right to prevent them from giving it. Williams, in his interview with Elder, did not pretend to deny that the sale was binding on the appellants, but only said they would exercise their right to be very particular about the paper, and the brokers could not have abandoned, even if they had so intended, the rights of the appellees. 5 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>384, <em>Bernard vs. Torrance. 7 Md.

That the authority of White &amp; Elder to make the sale was a question of fact to be found by the jury; and if they did, within the scope of their authority, make an absolute sale, not subject to the approval of the appellants, it is immaterial whether White was influenced by the supposed approbation of Murgiondo or not, or whether the appellants afterwards objected to it or not. That which is good and valid cannot be rendered defective by something that would have been surplussage if resorted to and used. The question is not what White &amp;\u2022 Elder <em>thought </em>about their authority, bnt whether they had it, <em>in fact, </em>or not. 16 <em>How., </em>25, <em>Turner vs. Yates. </em>The appellant\u2019s third prayer was, therefore, properly rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-7\">6th. That the testimony of Jenkins, on which the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>lants\u2019 fourth prayer is based, obviously refers to a sale made by a broker, under what the witness considers his ordinary authority, merely to <em>report an offer </em>to his principal, and deriving its validity from the approbation of the latter. The approval by the principal of the sale on credit, under such circumstances, is equivalent to a sale made by himself on credit, when he would be obliged, if nothing bad been said about the satisfactoriness of paper, to take that of the purchaser, because he had stipulated for no other. The witness in speaking of the mercantile interpretation of the paper which was given to the appellees, clearly means to confine it to such a case; for until a hypothetical case is afterwards put to him by the appellees\u2019 counsel, he is unable to imagine one in which a broker would be entitled to make a sale otherwise than subject to the approval of his principal; he says, \u201cwhenever the broker has authority to sell at a particular price the princijml has a right to determine whether the paper is satisfactory or not.\u201d The memorandum in question, therefore, unless made by a broker authorized to do more than simply report an offer, <em>i. e., </em>to make a positive sale, means, in the opinion of the witness, as in that of White and Eider and Chapman, that the seller has a right to judge of the satisfactoriness of the paper. Except upon the hypothesis of a sale on credit, reported by a broker for the approbation of his principal and by him approved, which approbation would import an agreement to accept the paper of the purchaser alone, there is no evidence whatever to support the prayer\u2014 for Jenkins concurs with the other witnesses in saying, if the sale be simply <em>made </em>by the broker and not afterwards ap proved by the principal, the latter has a right to determine whether the paper is satisfactory. There was, therefore, no evidence to support the prayer, as applicable to a sale made by a broker, as in this case, and not subsequently approved by the principal \u2014 dependent for its validity,not upon the subsequent approbation of the principal, but upon the original authority of the broker. The prayer in question is liable moreover to a fundamental and fatal objection. It asks the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>court, substantially, to instruct the jury, that if a sale, without any express stipulation as to the character of the paper to be given, does not, according !o usage, authorize the vendor to require satisfactory paper, then of consequence and as matter of law, a memorandum, containing no stipulation as to paper, is no sufficient or true memorandum of a bargain, in which the paper was to he made satisfactory to the vendor. The prayer ignores altogether the evidence of Mr. Elder, given and received without objection, wherein it is expressly stated that, as a matter of mercantile usage, the very memorandum in question signifies precisely what the prayer requires the court to declare as matter of law, that it does not. The evidence of Mr. Jenkins, even if properly construed, as contradicting that of Mr. Elder, can establish, at the most, only a conflict of evidence as to the meaning attached by mercantile custom to certain words. This conflict it was for the jury to reconcile, and not for the court to overlook or override. The appellants\u2019 fourth prayer was, therefore,properly rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-5\">7th. That the appellees offered to perform all the obligations imposed by the contract upon them, and as the appellants refused to comply with their part of it, the former wore not bound to prove that they had either the money or the notes ready to hand over contemporaneously with the delivery of the coffee.

That even if the appellants had, on the 3lst of August, refused to comply with the terms of sale, of which, however, there is no evidonoe, they were still entitled, as a matter of law, to a reasonable time after demand to do so. 14 <em>How., </em>455, 456. They were entitled to it by usage, and until the expiration of that reasonable time, there was no absolute breach of the contract. The appellants had a <em>locus </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>penitential, </em>and could have, complied with the terms of sale, and have prevented their liability to a suit, notwithstanding their previous refusal. The appellees would have been no more entitled to sue before, than on a note not due, which they were told the makers could not and would not pay at maturity. The proper measure of damages is the value of the coffee when it <em>ought, </em>under the contract, to have been delivered, and the jury were, therefore, entitled to go beyond the 31st of August, if the appellants might, without a breach of the contract, have postponed the delivery beyond that time. 1 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>464, <em>Williamson vs. Dillon. </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>301, <em>Cannell vs. M\u2019Clean </em>3 <em>Cranch, </em>298, <em>Douglass vs. McAllister. </em>1 <em>Md.

That White as a member of said firm, and under authority from William Howell &amp; Son, made the sale of coffee now in dispute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>That White then ordered R. W. Hall, the clerk of White &amp; Elder, to make an entry of the sale in the blotter of the firm, as said firm usually did in their blotter. That the entry was accordingly made by Hall, in part, and afterwards completed by White; which entry is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00ab1853, Augt. 26. Win, Howell &amp; Son. Woods, J3. &amp; Co. <em>G </em>W C. W , 1244 bags Rio coffee.

But the appellees consider the memorandum equally as valid and binding as if it had been prepared and signed by White himself; because it was written and signed, in the blotter or sales-book of White &amp; Elder, by Hall, their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>clerk, under the direction of White, he standing by the table Avhilst Hall made the entry, so far as it was made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Apart from all other objections urged by the appellant to the appellees\u2019 first prayer, supposing White &amp; Elder had authority to make sale of the coflfee, and did make a sale thereof, and that the terms of said sale are correctly and sufficiently set forth in the entry or memorandum on the blotter of White &amp; Elder, we propose, in the first place, to inquire whether the entry or memorandum is a valid and binding entry or memorandum of the sale, notwithstanding it is all in the handwriting of Hall, their clerk, except the figures \u201c9f,\u201d and the words, \u201cpaper to be satisfactory to the sellers,\u201d which are in the handwriting of White? This inquiry presents the legal question, argued before us by counsel, whether a broker, having made a contract of sale, can authorise his clerk to <em>wake </em>and sign an entry or memorandum thereof, under his direction and in his presence, so as to bind the parties named in the contract ?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">This question does not seem to have been conclusively settled. Whilst there are authorities which may be considered as favoring the doctrine that although a broker may, as an agent, make and sign a valid contract, for his principal, yet his agency is such that no portion thereof, under any circumstances, can be delegated to his clerk, there are others which speak of it as an open question, and others, again, seem to sustain the authority of the clerk to reduce the contract to writing, and sign the same, where he exercises no discretion, but merely acts <em>ministerially </em>or mechanically, under the direction and supervision of his employer, the broker. As authorities of the first class, reference is generally made to <em>Blore vs. </em>Sutton, 3 <em>Merivale, </em>237, and <em>Henderson vs. Barne</em>wall, 1 <em>Younge &amp; Jervis, </em>387.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In <em>Browne on Stat. of Frauds, sec. </em>369, after stating the authority of an auctioneer\u2019s clerk to write down the name of the buyer, under his principal\u2019s direction, the author says: \u201cIt has been decided that the rule did not embrace the clerk of a broker.\u201d The decision referred to in this note is <em>Henderson vs. Barnewall. </em>And the writer adds: \u201cBut even this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>seems now to be open to question.\u201d As authority for saying which, he cites <em>Townend vs. Drakeford, </em>1 <em>Carr. Kino., </em>20.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In <em>Story on </em>Agency, <em>sec. </em>13, the learned writer treats of the \u2018\u2018Delegation oe Agency. \u2019\u2019 He there states that a factor cannot ordinarily delegate his employment, as such, to another; after which he says: \u201cThe same rule applies to a broker; for he cannot delegate his authority to another to sign a contract in behalf of his principal, without the assent of the latter. The reason is plain; for, in each of these cases, there is an exclusive personal trust and confidence reposed in the particular party. And hence is derived the maxim of the common law: <em>delegata potestas-non potest delegari.\u2019\u2019 </em>This is but the enunciation of the general rule, that, <em>ordinarily, </em>a broker cannot, delegate his authority. For the principle just stated is, that a \u201cfactor cannot, ordinarily, delegate his employment,\u201d and then it is said, \u201cthe same rule applies to a broker.\u201d In addition to which, the reason for the rule as stated, is, because there is an exclusive personal trust and confidence reposed in the broker. Surely the reason of the rule cannot be applicable where the broker stands by whilst the clerk signs the contract, under his direction, leaving no act of discretion for the clerk to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The propriety of permitting an agent to perform a mere ministerial or mechanical act, by a sub-agent or deputy, even where he could not delegate any portion of his authority, requiring the exercise of the least discretion, is well considered, in the opinion of the Supreme Court of New York, delivered by <em>Mr. Justice Cowen, </em>in <em>Com. Bank of Lake Erie vs. Norton, </em>1 <em>Hill, </em>504. And there the cases of <em>Blore vs. Sultan </em>and <em>Henderson vs. Barnewall </em>are referred to. The court quote the language of <em>Lord Ellenborough </em>in <em>Mason vs. Joseph, (1 Smith\u2019s Rep., 406,) </em>when speaking of an agent in relation to a mere <em>ministerial </em>act, he says: \u201cSuppose, for instance, he had got the gout in his hands, and could not actually sign himself, he might have authorized another to sign for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In <em>Parsons\u2019 Mercantile Law, </em>155, <em>Note 7, </em>many authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ties are cited in relation to the power of an agent to appoint a sub-agent, and then it is said: \u201cA broker cannot delegate his authority.\u201d \u201cNor can a factor.\u201d, After stating each of these propositions, the writer cites authorities, and then says: \u201cBut the power to perform a merely ministerial act, involving the exercise of no discretion, may be delegated.\u201d Then he refers to <em>Mason vs. Joseph, </em>1 <em>Smith, </em>406, <em>per Lord Ellen-borough; Commercial Bank of Lake Erie vs. Norton, </em>1 <em>Hill, </em>501, and other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In 1 <em>American Lead. Cases, </em>589, <em>(Ed. of </em>1857,) the principle is recognized, that a merely ministerial or mechanical act may be done by a sub-delegate. And the above mentioned case, in 1 <em>Hill, </em>is there referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">After mature reflection we are not prepared to sustain the objection to the appellees\u2019 first prayer, urged by the appellant, upon the ground that the entry or memorandum is invalid, because it was chiefly prepared and signed by Hall, the clerk. The prayer submits to the jury the inquiry, whether the entry, so far as Hall participated therein, was made by him, under the order of White, and in his presence, also whether the other portion thereof was completed by White. And there is evidence tending to prove such facts. Believing that, under such circumstances, the clerk should not be considered as performing an act of delegated authority, requiring the exercise of any discretion, but merely a ministerial act, under the order and in the presence of White, as one of the firm of White &amp; Elder, the appellant\u2019s objection to the prayer is not, in our opinion, a valid objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The appellant says this prayer is erroneous, because the proviso therein requires the jury to find the \u201cestablished custom and usage of merchants in the city of Baltimore,\u201d without pointing to, or specifying any particular custom or usage, when the testimony speaks of usages which relate to several points in controversy, in regard to the disputed contract; and also because the proviso authorizes the jury, without the aid of the court, upon their own views of the custom and usage which they may find, and the other proof in the cause, in connection with <em>the entry, to decide </em>whether the entry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>\u201ceither expressly or according to the sense and signification of its language and figures,\u201d did represent, \u201ctruly and fully the terms of, and parties to, the contract of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">It is a well settled general rule that written instruments are to be construed by the court, alone, according to the meaning of the language therein employed, without the aid of parol proof to explain the meaning and intention of the parties thereto. If, however, in the case of a mercantile contract, \u201cthe instrument be not clear and unequivocal, evidence of the usage or course of trade at the place where the contract is <em>to be </em>carried into <em>effect, </em>is admissible to explain the meaning and remove the doubt.\u201d 2 <em>Kent's Com., </em>556, <em>{5th Ed.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">A note or memorandum of a contract came before the Supreme Court, in the case of <em>Salmon Falls Manufacturing Co. vs. Goddard, </em>14 <em>How. Rep., 454. </em>There, after stating what the Statute of Frauds requires to constitute a valid note or memorandum of a bargain, the court say: \u201cThis brief note of the contract, however, like all other mercantile contracts, is subject to explanation by reference to the usage and custom of the trade, with a view to get at the true meaning of the parties.\u201d And again: \u201cAlthough specific and express provisions will control the usage, and exclude any such explanation, yet, if the terms are technical, or equivocal on the face of the instrument, or made so by reference to extraneous circumstances, parol evidence of the usage and practice in the trade, is admissible to explain the meaning.\u201d See, also, <em>Browne on Statute of Frauds, sec. 380.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Whilst the above authorities show that in a mercantile transaction, when the terms of a written instrument are technical, or equivocal on its face, or are made so by reference to extraneous circumstances, parol evidence of the usage and practice in the trade, is admissible to explain their meaning, the principle applicable to such a case is, that the evidence of usage, and the surrounding circumstances, in explanation and illustration, is for the consideration of the jury, the province of the court being, to instruct them, conditionally or hypothetically, what should be the proper construction or interpretation of the written instrument, as they may find the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>dence either to support or not to sustain the purpose for which it has been offered. This view, we think, is sustained by <em>Eaton vs. Smith, </em>20 <em>Pick., </em>156, and <em>Neilson vs. Harford, </em>8 <em>Mees. &amp; Welsby, </em>823. See, also, <em>Morrell vs. Frith, </em>3 <em>Mees, &amp; Wels., </em>406.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In <em>Eaton vs. Smith, C. </em>J. Shaw, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201cWhen a new and unusual word is used in a contract, or when a word is used in a technical or pecu- - liar sense, as applicable to any trade or branch of business, or to any particular class of people, it is proper to receive evidence of usage, to explain and illustrate it, and that evidence is to be considered by the jury; and the province of the court will then be, to instruct the jury what will be the legal effect of the contract or instrument, as they shall find the meaning of the word, modified or explained by the usage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Speaking for the court, in <em>Neilson vs. Harford, </em>Baron Parke says-: \u201cThen we come to the question itself, which depends on the proper construction to be put on the specification. It was contended that of this construction the jury were to judge. We are clearly of a different opinion. The construction of all written instruments belongs to the court alone, whose duty it is to construe all such instruments, as soon as the true meaning of the words in which they are couched, and the surrounding circumstances, if any, have been ascertained as facts by the jury; and it is the duty of the jury to take the construction from the court, either absolutely, if there be no words to be construed as words of art, or phrases used in commerce, and no surrounding circumstances to be ascertained; or conditionally, when those words or circumstances are necessarily referred to them. Unless this were so, there would be no certainty in the law; for a misconstruction by the court is the proper subject, by means of a bill of exceptions, of redress in a court of error; but a misconstruction by the jury cannot be set right, at all, effectually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASC\">Without any construction of the entry given by the court, either absolute or conditional, the proviso in the prayer as granted, instructed the jury to inquire and to determine, themselves, whether the entry represented truly and fully the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>terms of, and parties to, the contract of sale. They were to ascertain whether the entry did this, \u201ceither expressly, or according to the sense and signification of its language and figures, under the established custom and usage of merchants, in the city of Baltimore, at the time \u2014 if they should find such custom and usage \u2014 and the other proof in the cause.\u201d This was submitting to the jury, not merely to ascertain the meaning of technical, or equivocal terms, words and figures, or phrases used in trade, according to the usage of trade, but it authorized the jury to ascertain the terms of the verbal contract, also to ascertain by their own interpretation of the entry, whether it expressly represented truly and fully, the terms of the said verbal contract, and if not expressly, whether, according to their interpretation of the sense and signification of the language and figures of the entry as ascertained by the aid of such custom and usage as they might find, and the other proof in the cause, the entry corresponded with the contract as made and truly and fully represented the terms thereof. Tn other words, the prayer authorized the jury to construe the entry or memorandum, without any absolute or conditional construction thereof by the court. This was erroneous, and the prayer should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second prayer begins by saying: \u201cIf the jury shall find, from the evidence, the facts in the plaintiffs\u2019 first prayer,\u201d and concludes with a proviso, which is considered erroneous, for the reasons assigned in objection to the proviso contained in the first prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The third prayer is compounded of the first and second, and the reasons given for holding that they were improperly granted, are also applicable to the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The fourth prayer is compounded of the first and second, and the first proviso contained in this is obnoxious to the objections, for which we have considered the proviso in the first prayer erroneous. The proviso thereto, added by the court, is also considered erroneous, because it was calculated to mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The fifth prayer of the plaintiffs, we think, was properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>granted. The proposition contained therein is sustained by <em>Glenn vs. Grover, </em>3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>228; <em>Barry vs. Hoffman, et al., </em>6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>86, and <em>Williams vs. Banks, </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>232.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Having examined the plaintiffs\u2019 prayers, we will now consider those of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The first asked an instruction to the jury that, if they should find the facts therein specified, then the entry on the blotter is not a sufficient note or memorandum of the bargain. The first ground of objection to the entry is the participation therein of Hall, the clerk. The views expressed on this subject, whilst considering the plaintiffs\u2019 first prayer, are deemed sufficient to show that this is not a valid objection to the entry; and, therefore, the refusal to grant the prayer now before us is not erroneous, so far as relates to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The entry is set forth in the prayer, which shows that no time for payment of the price of the coffee is stated therein. And for the purpose of presenting an objection <em>to the entry, </em>because it contains no specification of any credit or time of payment, the prayer submits the proposition that if the jury shall find a bargain, in relation to the coffee,.was made, \u201cand that the terms of such bargain as made, were, that there should be a credit of six months, for payment of the price, and that the said price should be settled for by paper satisfactory to said firm of William Howell &amp; Son, or else in cash at the usual discount,\u201d that no part of the price was paid, and no part of the coffee was delivered, \u201cthen the said entry is not a sufficient note or memorandum of the said bargain to bind said firm.\u201d The position here taken is, that if the jury should find the contract made was a sale upon six months\u2019 credit, inasmuch as the entry makes no mention of any credit, the contract is not truly and correctly represented by the entry, and, therefore, it is not a sufficient note or memorandum of the contract to bind the firm of William Howell &lt;fc Son, or the defendant, as surviving partner of said firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Admitting that by the express terms of the contract, as made, there was to be a credit of six months, and there is no credit mentioned in the entry, nevertheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>court committed no error in refusing to grant the instruction prayed for. The plaintiffs had offered uncontradicted evidence tending to prove that, by mercantile usage, the credit on a sale of coffee is always six months, where there is no stipulation to the contrary. The truth of that evidence the court were bound to assume, when considering whether the defendant\u2019s prayer should be granted or not. Viewing the entry in connection with the conceded truth of such evidence, it could not be considered an insufficient note or memorandum, for want of a proper, or any specification of the length of credit. Being an entry for a sale of coffee, and no credit stated, it was, according to the proof of the usage, an entry of a sale with six months\u2019 credit. At least it was proper that the court should have regarded such to have been the effect of the evidence, when deciding upon the prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">In <em>Cole vs. </em>Hebb, 7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>26, the county court had refused a prayer which had been offered at the instance of the defendant, who became the appellant. The Court of Appeals approved of this refusal, and held, that: \u201cIn granting an instruction at the request of the defendant, the court must assume the truth of all the facts of which the plaintiff had offered testimony, legally sufficient to warrant the jury in finding them, which are not inconsistent with the facts, the belief of which by the jury was made the groundwork of the prayer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In Wilson, <em>Adm\u2019r ad col. of </em>Owens, <em>vs. </em>Smith, 10 <em>Md. Rep., </em>75, it is said by the court: \u201cThe prayer on the part of the defendant does not present all the facts, but only a part of them, studiously excluding all allusion to the evidence in regard to the state of the records of the register of wills, and of the declarations of Mrs. Owens and Lowe, that no letters of administration had been granted. Although it is the right of a party to segregate a portion of the testimony in a cause, and ask the opinion of the court upon it, (1 <em>Gill, </em>127,) yet the court will not grant such instruction, if it be such as will likely mislead the jury; and we consider the direction asked on the part of the defendant of such a character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In <em>McTavish vs. </em>Carroll, 7 <em>Md. Rep., </em>366, the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u201cIt is certainly true, that when the proof the defendant, if believed by the jury, would establish any proposition inconsistent with the theory of the plaintiff\u2019s prayer, which is based upon his own evidence, such prayer cannot be given, because it must assume or admit the truth of all the defendant\u2019s proof on the subject.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The hypothesis of the defendant\u2019s second prayer is, that if the jury should find the facts therein mentioned then the memorandum, which is 'described in that prayer as having been signed by White &amp; Elder, and written by White and delivered to the plaintiffs, is not a sufficient note or memorandum of the bargain to bind the firm of William Howell &amp;. Son, or the defendant. Without intending to decide whether there was or was not such proof as would have warranted the jury in finding the enumerated facts, we think there was evidence legally tending to prove them; and upon the supposition of their being found by the jury, the conclusion of the prayer was correct. If this memorandum was made and delivered under such circumstances- as are set forth in the prayer, then <em>it </em>could not be regarded as a note or memorandum of the contract, which could bind the firm, of which the defendant is the surviving partner. The prayer, therefore, should not have been refused. The ruling on this prayer is, of course, confined exclusively to the memorandum therein described.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The third prayer was properly refused. Supposing there may be conflicting evidence as to whether White &amp; Elder-had authority to make an absolute sale of the coffee, not subject to the approval of the firm of William Howell &amp;\u2022 Son; still there is evidence tending to prove such absolute authority, and whether they had it or not was a question to be decided by the jury, upon the proof. If within the scope of such authority, White, as one of the firm of White &amp; Elder, did make an absolute sale, not subject to the approval of William Howell &amp; Son, it is not material whether White was influenced by the supposed approbation of Murgiondo, the clerk, or not, or whether the sale was afterwardsobjected to by William Howell &amp;\u2022 Son.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The position taken in the <em>fourth </em>prayer is, that the memorandum, mentioned in the defendant\u2019s second prayer, is not a sufficient note or memorandum of the alleged bargain, in case the jury should find, from the evidence, that the bargain was made on the terms, that the paper should be satisfactory to the seller. It will be seen that this memorandum does not mention whether the paper for the price of the coffee should be satisfactory to the seller or not. The grounds on which the prayer is based, are presented hypothetically to the consideration of the jury, and if found by them to be true, were, in our opinion, sufficient to justify the instruction asked. The facts set forth as the hypothesis of the second prayer of the defendant are first introduced; it is then made the duty of the jury to fmd, whether, a bargain was made at six months\u2019 credit, the paper therefor to be satisfactory to the seller; whether, by the usage and custom of merchants, a sale of coffee on credit, without any stipulation as to the paper to be given therefor, means, that the paper of the purchaser is to be received for the price of the coffee, and that in such case the seller would not be entitled to demand paper of other persons, or to require any thing more than the mere paper of the purchasers; and, whether, by the usage and custom of merchants, a sale of coffee on credit, on the terms that the paper shall be made satisfactory to the seller, means, that the seller has an absolute and unqualified right to judge for himself, as to the satisfactoriness of the paper, and cannot be required to accept any paper, except such as the seller may actually agree to accept for the price.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The questions submitted to the jury, by the prayer, in regard to usage, are specifically and distinctly presented; the evidence in relation thereto is conflicting or inconsistent. In such a state of case a party has the right to ask the court to instruct the jury, what should be the legal effect of their finding that the facts which are made the groundwork of his prayer are true. When the evidence relied on to sustain the facts, which are the basis of a prayer, is in conflict, or inconsistent with other evidence, offered by the opposite party, in the cause, in relation to the same facts, the prayer should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>be refused, merely, because it does not mention or notice the opposing or conflicting evidence. Under the circumstances here presented, the defendant had the right \u201cto segregate a portion of the testimony in the cause, and ask the opinion of the court upon it.\u201d1 And, we do not think, his prayer, in doing so, was calculated to mislead the jury. The defendant had given evidence in support of the usage, or facts, which were made the basis, or hypothesis, of his prayer, which evidence was contradicted by, and inconsistent with evidence offered by the plaintiffs, in relation to the same facts, or usage in reference to the same subjects. The prayer, therefore, is not liable to objection, as the appellees\u2019 counsel have supposed it to be, because it ignores, or omits to notice evidence going to show, that according to the usage of merchants in the city of Baltimore, in every sale of coffee on credit, the paper is to be satisfactory to the seller, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary. In our opinion the prayer ought to have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The defendant\u2019s fifth prayer was properly refused. The proof does not show that the coffee was to be delivered or paid- for, either by satisfactory paper or by cash, on any particular day, or at ai^ specified period of time. No part of the coffee was delivered, nor was there any offer to deliver it; on the contrary the plaintiffs received notice, from William Howell &amp; Son, very promptly, after the latter were informed of the alleged bargain, that thejr did not intend to comply therewith. Under such circumstances, the plaintiffs were not bound to prove, at the trial, what this prayer assumes was necessary to entitle them to a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The doctrine set forth in the sixth prayer of the defendant is, that if the jury should find that William Howell &amp; Son, on the 31st day of August 1853, expressly refused to ratify or comply with the alleged sale of coffee, and expressly refused to deliver the coffee, and the plaintiffs, on that day, had knowledge of such refusal, then the said refusal constituted a breach of the contract of sale, on the said 31st day of August; and if they should find that at the time of such breach, the plaintiffs had not paid any part of the price of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>coffee, and had not delivered, or tendered, notes satisfactory to William Howell &amp; Son, for the price of the coffee, or any part thereof, then the measure of damages, in case the jury should find for the plaintiffs upon the issues joined in this case, is the difference, if any, between the price of a lot of coffee, of the same quantity and quality, at the time of such breach, and the price at which the same had been sold, and such interest thereon as the jury might think right; and if the jury should not find that the price had increased at the time of such breach, beyond the price at which the coffee is alleged to have been sold, then the jury, in case they should find for the plaintiffs, should find their verdict merely for nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">From a letter of the plaintiffs, dated the 1st of September 1853, it appears that on the preceding day, (the 31st of August,) they had knowledge of the peremptory refusal of the firm of William Howell &amp; Son to comply with the alleged contract of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In <em>Mayne on </em>Damages, 82, in the <em>Law Library, </em>when treating of <em>\u201cActions for not delivering goods,\u201d </em>after commenting upon several cases, it is said: \u201cIn all tiiese cases there was a stated time fixed for the completion of the contract. Where there is no time fixed, damages will be calculated from the period at which the defendant refuses to perform it. Such a refusal leaves no further <em>locus penitenticc </em>to himself, and of course the plaintiff cannot treat the agreement as any longer subsisting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Believing this to be a correct statement of the law, in regard to damages in a case like the present, we deem it sufficient, without any thing further, to show that the theory of the defendant\u2019s last prayer is correct, and\u00bf therefore, the refusal of it was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">It is not considered necessary to express any opinion upon what have been called, \u201cverbal instructions given by the judge to the jury,\u201d inasmuch as the record shows the court declared, \u201cthat all the instructions on the law, which it meant to give to the jury, were contained in the plaintiffs\u2019 prayers, as granted and modified.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b272-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>(Decided June 28th, 1860.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Upon <em>the </em>first, second, third and fourth of the <em>appellees\u2019 </em>prayers, and upon the second, fourth and sixth of the appellant\u2019s prayers, the rulings of (he court below are reversed. Upon the fifth of the appellees, and upon the first, third and fifth of the appellant, the rulings are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
