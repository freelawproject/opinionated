The plaintiffs then asked leave to amend the <em>writ </em>and <em>nar. </em>from <em>covenant </em>to <em>assumpsit. </em>The defendant objected to the proposed amendment, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>court (Lee, J.) granted the leave and the amendment was made at the bar, without withdrawing a juror, by an agreement to consider the <em>nur. </em>as a <em>nar. </em>in <em>assumpsit, </em>arid the plea as a plea of <em>non assumpsit. </em>After this amendment was made the jury were again sworn, and the defendant offered its 3rd, 4th and 5th prayers, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">3rd. That if the jury find that in giving the renewal receipt, the secretary meant and intended to renew the policy in the name and for the benefit of the same persons who were therein assured, and neither lie or any of the officers or agents of the defendant were notified, or had knowledge that John McGowan had previously retired from the firm of John McGowan &amp; Sons, then the agreement to renew must be taken and considered as an agreement made with said John McGowan and the plaintiffs, and not merely as an agreement with the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-6\">4th.

That if the jury find the facts set forth in the third prayer, then the plaintiffs are not entitled to maintain an action of <em>assumpsit </em>on said receipt, unless it be shown in evidence, and found by the jury, that the defendant was applied to for a policy to be sealed and delivered in accordance with the terms of said receipt, and refused or declined to seal and deliver such policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-8\">The court rejected these prayers and granted the two prayers offered by the plaintiffs, relating, the one to waiver of preliminary proof, and the other to the construction of the policy with reference to the use to which the warehouse was appropriated by the plaintiffs.

The order of the court below, permitting the amendment to be made at bar, from covenant to <em>assumpsit, </em>was irregular and improper, and the objection, as it appears upon the record, is clearly open for review on (his appeal. The Act of 1852, ch., 177, allows amendments to be made to promote the ends of justice, but the discretion thereby given to the- courts is not a mere arbitrary discretion, which cannot be reviewed on appeal, for if it were so, an amendment might be made in the face of the ends of justice, and there would be no redress. Nor is there any valid objection to the form in which the question is presented. It was not a subject of exception \u2014 the objection was made and it comes up with the record, and is now open for review. 1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>77, <em>Lawson vs. Snyder. </em>7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>109, <em>Boteler &amp; Belt vs. The State. </em>The action being on the original policy, it was not competent to change it into a new suit by declaring upon the renewed policy as an agreement between other parties. 8 <em>Sergt. &amp; Rawle, 53, Wilson vs. Wallace. 2 Fairfield, </em>127, <em>Winslow vs. Merrill. </em>5 <em>Greenlf. </em>379, <em>Redington vs. Farrar.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-6\">2nd. The original policy was a deed. The parties there-' to were the insurer and <em>insured. </em>The insured were the persons composing <em>the firm </em>of John McGowan &amp; Sons, who Were confessedly three in number, John McGowan being one. Now the renewal of the policy but extended the <em>same contract </em>for a further time. The receipt was not, <em>in itself, </em>a policy; it was not in and of itself an insurance. It was evidence of a collateral fact, which fact existing, <em>the policy </em>continued to operate, precisely as if it had originally been issued for the whole extended term. It was a contract, therefore, between the Insurance Company of the one part, and the three persons who were assured, when the policy was issued. It is impossible that what was in October 1853, a contract with three persons, should, by any just rules of interpretation be construed as a contract with only two of these persons. Nor can it be said that the receipt is, of itself, the foundation of the suit. By the terms of the policy it is <em>cove-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>5muted, </em>that the policy is to continue so long as the premium is paid. Tiiis policy is under seal, and, by its charter, (Act of 1807, ch. 68,1 this company can insure only under its common seal. The case might be different, if the policy had been applied for pursuant to the receipt, (assuming the receipt to have been intended as applying only to the plaintiffs,),and the company had refused to issue it. But, even in that case, a parol agreement by this company to insure would only be an agreement to issue a policy under seal, enforcible only in a court of equity. As to the effect of this renewal see 2 Whart., 167, <em>Luciani vs. American Fire Ins. Co. </em>If these views are correct, the defendant\u2019s prayers should have been granted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-5\"><em>Robert J. Brent, for the </em>appellees, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">1st. The amendment was clearly within the Act of 1852, ch. 177, which allows, for the furtherance of justice, amendments of any of the proceedings, including the writ or summons <em>from one form of </em>action to another, to be made at any time before the jury retire to make up their verdict, and that such amendments shall not operate a continuance of the case unless the court shall be satisfied that the ends of justice re quire a continuance. The action was upon the renewal of the policy which was not under seal, and therefore, covenant would not, lie. There could be no recovery in covenant, the t\u00edre having occurred after the parol renewal. It was, therefore, proper that the action should be changed from covenant to <em>assumpsit. </em>But amendments are within the sound discretion of the court, and its action on such matters cannot be reviewed on appeal. Again, no exception was taken to the power of amendment as exercised; an objection was made but no exception was taken, and the question is not, therefore, before this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-7\">2nd. The renewal of the policy not being under seal, but by the simple receipt of the company\u2019s secretary, it results that the renewed policy could only enure to the benefit of the plaintiffs, who paid the premium, and who renewed it, under the name in which they were doing business. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>question cannot be affected by considering who were the parties entitled to sue upon the original policy, nor by the meaning and purpose of the company\u2019s secretary, as supposed in the defendant\u2019s third prayer. The fact, that John McGowan had withdrawn from the firm, was a matter of no moment to the company; its object was the premium, and it would have insured the sons as readily as the father and sons. There is nothing in the policy which required partners, when they insure, to disclose their names. The name of the firm was aJ. McGowan &amp; Sons,\u201d and the parol agreement to renew the policy, was made with the parties then constituting that firm, who were the plaintiffs alone. But this receipt was a <em>parol </em>and new contract, and not an extension of the policy for another year; it refers to the previous policy only to show what the new agreement was. That an action of <em>assumpsit </em>will lie upon such a renewal is established by the case of <em>Luciani vs. American Fire Ins. Co., 2 Wharf., 167, </em>cited on the other side. There was no error, therefore, in the rejection of the defendant\u2019s prayers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-5\"><em>Note. </em>\u2014 The argument on other points is omitted.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b64-6\">Le Grand, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AAo\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">This was, originally, an action of <em>covenant </em>brought by the appellees, on a policy of insurance, issued by the appellants. The policy was dated the 22nd of October 1853, and on a stock of groceries. It was for one year, with the privilege of renewal, so long as the company should continue to receive the premium on the risk. During the first 3rear the premium was paid for the second year. The loss-took phice on the 9th of December 1854, and the suit was brought by <em>the appellees </em>to recover its amount. The policy was issued to <em>J. McGowan fy Sons. </em>At the time of its issual, the firm of J. McGowan &amp; S'ons was composed of J. McGowan <em>and </em>the appellees. John McGowan retired from the business and firm, on the 2nd of May 1854, the business being conducted thereafter by the <em>appellees, </em>(William and John O. McGowan,) under the name of John McGo-wan &amp; Sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>At the trial, on the motion of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, the court allowed the writ and <em>nar. </em>to be so amended as to change them from <em>covenant </em>to <em>assumpsit. </em>To the allowance of this amendment, the appellants excepted. The record shows, that, after the amendment was made, the jury were sworn \u201cto say the truth in the premises,\u201d between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The Act of lSS^, chapter 177, section 1, is without limitation as to the power of the court to permit amendments to any proceedings, including the writ or summons, so that the case may be tried on its real merits, and the purposes of justice subserved. It expressly provides, that writs may be amended from one form of action to another, when the ends of justice require it. We do not think the court exceeded its power in granting the application of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">There was much said, both in the evidence and arguments of counsel, in relation to preliminary proof, to the comprehensiveness and meaning of the word \u201cgroceries,\u201d and other matters, which need not be commented upon, because, we are of opinion the appellees cannot recover in this action for any loss intended to be insured against by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The policy underwritten is a <em>sealed </em>instrument. The company had no authority to issue \u2022 any other than a sealed policy. The Kkh section of its charter, the Act of 1807, chapter 68, declares, \u201cthat <em>all </em>policies of insurance made by this corporation shall be signed by the president, and attested by the secretary, and <em>sealed </em>with the common seal, and all losses on any such policy or policies shall be adjusted by the president and board of directors, and paid, agreeably to the terms of the policy, out of the funds of the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">This prohibition, if there were none other, would be a sufficient answer to the plaintiffs right of recovery in this action. In the case of <em>The Penn. &amp; Maryland Steam Navigation Co. vs. </em>Dandridge, 8 <em>Gill &amp; </em>Johnson, 318, the court, adopting the doctrine as laid down in <em>Angel\u00ed and Ames on </em>Corporations, observes \u201cthat a corporation and an individual stand upon very different footing. The latter, existing for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>general good of society may do all acts and make all con\"tracts which are not, in the eye of the law, inconsistent with the great purpose of his creation; whereas, the former having been created for a specified purpose, cannot only make <em>no contract forbidden by its </em>charter, which is, as it were, the law of its nature, but, in general, can make no contract which is not necessary, either directly or incidentally, to enable it to answer that purpose.\u201d Substantially the same principles was adopted in <em>Albert and wife vs. Savings Bank and </em>others, 2 <em>Md. Rep., </em>159. But, in addition to this, the language of the policy aud of the renewal receipt is a conclusive bar to the plaintiffs recovery. The policy provides that <em>\u201cthis </em>insurance shall <em>continue </em>and be in force <em>from </em>the <em>expiration </em>of the time before mentioned for its duration, so long as the said assured, or their assigns, shall continue to pay the like rate of premium, as hath been paid for this insurance, and so long as this corporation shall agree to' accept, and actually receive, the same from the assured,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the renewal receipt was a <em>parol </em>and new contract, and not an extension for another year of the original sealed one. This view cannot be sustained by the receipt. It is just as positive the other way as is the policy. 'It expressly declares that, the premium is received under the original policy, and that, by it, the <em>policy </em>is <em>\u201ccontinued </em>in <em>force, </em>and will terminate at 12 o\u2019clock, noon, on the 22nd day of October 1855.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The case of <em>Luciani vs. The American Fire Insurance Co., </em>2 <em>Wharton, </em>167, is not available for the purpose for which it was cited at the bar. All that case decided was, that an action of <em>covenant </em>could not be sustained by virtue of endorsements on the policy, not under seal, to the effect that the insurance had been enlarged as to the amount as also the premium. It was held that these endorsements did not continue the policy as a <em>specialty, </em>but that the plaintiff might have.demanded a policy in conformity with the clause in the policy, or, <em>perhaps, </em>as suggested by <em>C. J. Gibson, </em>without deciding it, he might maintain <em>assumpsit. </em>That case is dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>tinguishnble from this in the fact, that there was not In,, it, as there is in the present one, a contract under seal for the <em>\u00a1\u25a0nntinuance </em>of the <em>policy. </em>Here the receipt, does not evidence a new coutract, but an extension of the original. By the <em>covenant </em>between the parties, the policy was to be for one year, or longer, on payment of the premium. There is nothing in the receipt to show, that there was a new contract of insurance with <em>other </em>persons, yet, other persons, not the original covenantees are here seeking to recover upon the policy. The plaintiffs are neither the covenantees nor their assignees. It is impossible, on the face of the plaintiffs\u2019 own evidence to hold, that the contract of insurance, from the 22nd of October 1854 until the 22nd of October 1855, was by parol. The only evidence on the point is all one way, and is clear, that the original sealed contract was not replaced by another and different one, but, <em>continued in force. </em>But, whether specialty or parol, no action could be maintained on the contract except by the parties insured. It is a <em>joint </em>contract, and whatever sum could be recovered would he <em>in </em>solido; \u201ca contract with several persons, for the payment to them of a sum of money, is a joint contract with all, and all the payees have therein a joint interest, so that no one can sue alone for his proportion.\u201d 1 <em>Parsons on </em>Contracts, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">If these views be correct then it follows that, the court erred in the rejection of the defendant\u2019s third, fourth and fifth prayers, and in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 prayers. The defendant\u2019s prayers denied the right of these plaintiffs to recover and were in their nature demurrers to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We abstain from all comment upon the merits of the claim or those of the defence, or of the degree of credibility which ought to be assigned to the conflicting testimony of the witnesses. The objection to the action is one founded in the rules <em>of the </em>law, and however hard they may bear in any particular case, it is not for the courts to infringe on their efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b68-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>(Decided June 1st, 1860.)</decisiondate>\n<author id=\"b68-4\"><em>Per Justices </em>Eggleston and Bartol:</author>\n<p id=\"Ahl\">In regard to so much of the opinion of the Chief Justices denies the right of the appellants to bind themselves by a policy not under seal, we express no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
