For a part of the money so loaned the <em>feme covert </em>gave <em>her note. </em>The <em>feme sole </em>then married, and she and her husband filed a bill against the <em>feme covert </em>and her husband, praying that this note might he paid out of her <em>separate estate. </em>The defendants pleaded in bar, and as an off-sett, a <em>judgment </em>for a larger amount, recovered by the husband against the complainants for the hoard of the <em>feme sole, </em>before marriage.

The deed of trust, under which the defendant, Ann Fallen, cl&amp;iiiis her separate estate, conveys a house and lot to a trustee, ain trust, nevertheless, for th\u00e9 sole and separate use and benefit of the said Ann Fallen, without the let or control of her present, or \u00e1riy future husband, and with full power and authority to her, whether <em>sole </em>or covert, to sell or otherwise dispose of the same by any instrument of writing in the nature of a deed or will.-\u201d The court (Krebs, J.) on passing the decree appealed from, delivered the following-opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">\u201cI am of opinion that the judgment, pleaded in-this case,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>by the defendants, is a bar to the claim of the complainants. It exceeds in amount that claim. The claim upon this judgment is of such a character as to bring it within the principles established by courts of equity in reference to the allowance of counter claims, or discounts in bar. The complainants have offered evidence for the purpose of proving that this judgment should not be regarded, by this court, as conclusive against them, because they were prevented, by surprize, from availing themselves of the privilege of appeal therefrom, and thus deprived of the opportunity of showing that it was erroneous, and that the claim which it established was unjust. But there is nothing in the pleadings upon which a right to be relieved from the judgment, on that ground, can be sustained. There are no statements in the bill anticipating the production of this judgment as a bar or set-off to the claim of the complainants, and setting forth, in advance, the facts and circumstances constituting the surprize relied upon against the conclusiveness of the judgment, nor are they set up in any other form in the pleadings. Under these circumstances, I must regard this judgment as in full force, and, therefore, a bar to the demand of the complainants in a court of equity. Entertaining these views upon this point, it is not necessary for me to decide the other questions that have been discussed at the hearing.\u2019'\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\">\u00c1 decree was then passed, dismissing the bill with costs, from which the complainants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b366-6\">,The cause was argued before Le Grand, O. J., Eccrest\u00f3n, Tuck and Bartol, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-7\"><em>L. M. Reynolds, for the </em>appellants, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-8\">. 1st. That the money, mentioned in the bill, was borrowed by the defendant, Ann, of the complainant, Mary, and by the former expended in improving her separate estate, and that.estate is liable for the payment of the note and interest. By the terms of the deed of trust to her, she has the power to sell, which includes the power to charge, and the only ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>tion, then, is, did she charge her separate estate with this debt? She appropriated the money to the improvement of her house, and it went into, and now composes, a part of her separate estate. The money of Mary having been used in paying debts incurred in building the house, she became substituted for the persons doing the work and furnishing the materials. For authorities to sustain the liability of this separate estate for this claim, see <em>Willard's Eq., </em>646; 2 <em>Story's Eq., secs. </em>1398, 1400, <em>et seq.; </em>7 <em>Paige, </em>13, <em>North American Coal Co. vs. Dyett; </em>22 <em>Wend., </em>528, <em>Gardner vs. Gardner; 7 H. &amp; </em>J., 302, <em>Price vs. Bigham\u2019s ex\u2019cr.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-5\">2nd. That the judgment filed in bar by the defendants is not such a claim as can be properly the subject of set-off to the complainant\u2019s claim; because, 1st, it is not a final judgment, and is not, therefore, of itself evidence of liquidated damages. The general replication put in issue the validity of this claim for set-off. The evidence of the magistrate shows that the complainants had taken their appeal from it. On the trial of that appeal, the defendant, Peter, would have had to prove his case exactly as though it had never been tried before the magistrate. 2nd. The claim of the defendant, Peter, (if it were a final judgment,) against the complainants, and the claim of the complainants against the seperate estate of the defendant, Ann, are not mutual and due in the same right. Admitting, therefore, the judgment to be final, it is no bar to the complainant\u2019s claim. The wife of the complainant, and the husband of the defendant, are mere formal necessary parties to this proceeding. 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., sec. </em>1368. 2 <em>Bright on Husband &amp; Wife, </em>255. One side of the case stands exactly as if the bill had been filed by, and is in law the claim of, Edward Lane against Ann Fallen, and it would be perfectly competent for Ann to set off or plead in bar any claim she might have, or might have purchased, against the said Edward, or against him and his wife; but I deny that Ann can say to Edward, <em>ai </em>will not pay you my note, held by you, unless you pay a judgment my husband has against you.\u201d The.effect of that law would be, in case of the death or insolvency of Peter and Ann, that the credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>tors or distributees of Ann would gain what the creditors or distributees of Peter would lose. That Peter assents to this \u00a1arrangement does not help it, because he still retains in himself the property in the judgment. Suppose a creditor of Peter were to attach the judgment in the hands of Edward, and a creditor of Edward were to attach the note in the hands of Ann, could Edward plead his claim against Ann to the attachment of Peter\u2019s creditors, or could Ann plead the judgment to the attachment of Edward's creditors? I submit that they could not, that Ann must pay her note to Edward\u2019s creditor, and if Edward should happen to be insolvent, then Peter\u2019s creditor is no worse off than before. 3 <em>Md. Ch.
