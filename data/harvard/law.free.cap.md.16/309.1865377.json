The damages claimed were $1000, and pleas were filed putting in issue the matters alleged in the\u2019declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-10\">It was agreed, that the cause should be referred to L. H. Reynolds, Wm. Scharf and L. M.

It was further agreed, that the award should be binding, if made by any two \u00a9f the referees. An award was then made, and filed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>court, by two of the referees, in which they: \u201cAward, order, determine and adjudge, that there is due and owing by the defendant, Durus Carter, to the plaintiff, William Garitee, the sum of $500, and that judgment be rendered by this court, in favor of said Garitee, plaintiff, for the sum of $500, and costs to be taxed by the clerk of this court, as well as for the costs of this reference and award, which is the sum of $45, being the sum of $15 for each of said referees.\u201d To 'this award exceptions were filed by the defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">1st.

Because said award is not certain to a common intent and final.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">The court (Lee, J.) sustained these exceptions, and set aside the award, and from this judgment the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b322-8\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, C.

In <em>Roloson vs. Carson, </em>8 <em>Md. Rep., </em>220, it is said, that \u201cby a long course of decision, courts have manifested a strong inclination to sustain the judgments pronounced by arbitrators;\u201d and in <em>Ebert vs. Ebert, </em>5 <em>Md. Rep., </em>859, that \u201cevery reasonable intendment will be made in favor of awards, and a construction given to them that will support them if possible.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-11\">It is said, on the part of the appellee, that this award has gone beyond the submission. This exception can only apply to the expenses of the arbitration and cannot affect the residue of the award. 5 <em>Md. Rep., </em>359. 6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>14 <em>Cromwell vs. Owings. </em>There is nothing on the face of the award to sustain the objection that it is not certain and final.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-12\">The question upon the motion to dismiss the appeal upon the ground, that it is interlocutory, is believed to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>finally settled in the case of <em>State, use of Hickley, vs. Stewart, et al., </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>453.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-5\"><em>S'e ' ard A.

The appeal should be d\u00a1 missed, because , the m'der setting aside the award is not a final judgment, but interlocutory merely, and, therefore, no appeal lies from it, 7 <em>Gill,, </em>366, <em>Welch vs. Davis. </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>405, <em>Keirle vs. Shriver. 2 Md.

If the appeal is allowed, it is then insisted: 1st, that the award must be set aside <em>pro tanto, </em>because the arbitrators decide therein matters not within the submiss\u2019 n in awarding themselves $45 costs of reference. <em>Willes, </em>62, <em>Candler vs. Fuller. </em>1 <em>Ev.

The question has been settled by the case of <em>The State, use of Hickley, vs. Stewart &amp; Gross, </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>456, where an appeal from the judgment of the county court setting aside an award, was sustained. <em>\u00a1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">We think the court below erred in sustaining the objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>lions to the award and setting it aside. It is shown by the return to the writ of diminution, that the reference in this case was made under a rule of court. The only exceptions to the award, presented for our consideration, are: 1st, because the arbitrators did not decide therein, on all, or any part, of the matters submitted to them, and decided on matters not within the submission. 2nd. Because said award is not certain to a common intent and final.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The rule by which this court is governed, in dealing with awards, has been often announced. It has been more than once said, with approbation: \u201cThat a more liberal, and reasonable interpretation of awards is now adopted by the courts than formerly existed. Every reasonable intendment will be made in their favor, and a construction given to them that will support them if possible, without violating the rules adopted for the construction of written instruments.\u201d 10 <em>G. &amp; </em>J., 193. 5 <em>Md. Rep., </em>359. 8 <em>Md. Rep., </em>225.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Applying this rule to the present case, we are unable to perceive any ground for the second exception taken to this award. It has all the certainty which the law requires, and is a final determination of the cause referred to the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">With reference to the first exception, we are clearly of opinion that so far as the award ascertains and decides that, \u201cthere is due and owing by the defendant, Durus Carter, to the plaintiff, William Garitee, the sum of five hundred dollars,\u201d and awards, \u201cthat judgment be rendered by the court in favor of said Garitee, plaintiff, for the sum of five hundred dollars and costs to be taxed by the clerk,\u201d it is a decision of the matters submitted to them, plainly within their authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">We think, however, that part of the award which detertermines that judgment be entered against the defendant for <em>\u201cthe costs of this reference and award, which is the sum of forty-five dollars, </em>being <em>the sum of fifteen dollars for each of said </em>referees,\u201d was not within the submission, and that the award was, <em>pro tanto, </em>void. <em>George vs. Lousley, 8 East., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>14. <em>Bell vs. Balson, 2 Chittifs Rep., </em>157. See, also, the authorities cited hi note <em>(a.) </em>in 18 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>283.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b325-8\">(Decided June 29th, 1860.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In the case of <em>Cromwell vs. </em>Owings, 6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>14, it was said: \u201cRut it is well settled that if an award be botli of matter that is submitted, and of that which is not within the submission, it may be good as to all that is within the submission, and void as to the residue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">This rule applies where that part of the award which is within the submission, is of entirely distinct matter, not depending upon that which is awarded without the terms of the submission. That is the case here, the award was had only in so far as it awarded to the arbitrators their expense-, to be paid by the defendant,; in other respects it was good. The judgment will be reversed, and a judgment entered in favor of the appellant, in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and judgment for appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
