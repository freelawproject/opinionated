He then proved that the work was measured by a sworn measurer, and its measurement ascertained as stated in the aforesaid account, and further proved that on the 15th of July 1857, the following notice was served on the defendant, Pue, at the request of the plaintiff. This notice contains a copy of the account as above set forth, and then states: \u2014 icSir: Please take notice that I have done and furnished for William M. Woods, in and about the construction of the dwelling house built by him for you, on your farm in Howard county, the work and materials specified in the within bill, at the time therein mentioned, and I intend to claim, for the amount of said bill, the benefit of the lien given by the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided.\u201d Testimony was then offered on both sides, as to the character of the work done, that offered by the plaintiff tending to show that the tin roofing was of proper material, and was properly put on, and that by the defendant tending to prove that it was not properly'put on, and in consequence thereof the roof leaked in many places. The defendant then offered in evidence the contract, dated the 8th of August 1856, between Wood and himself, for the building of the house in question, and the accompanying specifications. To the admission of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>papers the plaintiff objected, but the court allowed them to be read to the jury, in connection with other testimony going to show that the plaintiff was notified of their contents. The plaintiff then asked the following instruction to the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-5\">1st. That if they shall believe, from the evidence, that the plaintiff furnished work and materials upon a house of the defendant, Pue, at the instance of Woods, as contractor, builder or architect, and that said house is the same house as that described in the proceedings in this cause, and that within sixty days after furnishing such work and materials, the plaintiff, or his agent, gave notice of the same, and of the amount of his claim, in writing, to said Pue, and of his intention to claim the benefit of his lien, and that before the expiration of six months after said work was finished and materials furnished, the claim or statement of demand, appearing in the proceedings, was filed in the office of the clerk of Circuit court for Howard county, and that said work and materials are the same as those stated in said claim, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover, provided the jury shall find that said Woods was the contractor, builder or architect at the time said work and materials were furnished, and shall also believe that said work and materials were not done upon the individual responsibility of said Woods, but upon the faith and credit of said building, and shall further find that said work and materials were done and furnished in a reasonably proper and sufficient manner in reference to any -contract which the jury may find, and that the plaintiff has not been paid or satisfied for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-6\">2nd. If the jury shall find the furnishing of the work and materials as stated in the 1st prayer, and that a notice was served and claim filed as stated therein, and that said Woods was contractor, builder or architect at the time stated in said prayer, and that said work and materials were done upon the credit of said building, and that the plaintiff has not been paid or satisfied for the same, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount which said work and materials were reasonably worth, provided the jury shall further find that the' defendant, Pue, has accepted the same.

Because the pretended claim on which the writ, in this case was issued, and which was filed in the office of this court, before the issuing of this writ, does not set forth the amount or sum claimed to be due for the <em>work and labor </em>said to have been done and performed, in and upon the house and land in the said pretended claim mentioned and described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-7\">2nd.

That if the jury believe, from the evidence, that the work and materials for which the pretended claim in this case has been filed, were done and furnished on the individual credit of Woods, and not on the credit of the house and land sought to be charged by the said claim, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-9\">4th. That if the jury shall believe, from the evidence,, that the plaintiff\u2019s pretended claim in this case was filed in the office of this court on the 2nd of December 1857, and that the work done and materials furnished for which said claim was filed, was done and were furnished at several distinct periods and upon distinct contracts or orders, and not under one continuing contract, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action for any work done or materials furnished more than six months before said 2nd of December 1857, on any distinct contract performed or order complied with more than six months before said 2nd day of December 1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-10\">5th. That if the jury shall believe, from the evidence, the work done and materials furnished, for which the plaintiff\u2019s pretended claim was filed in the office of this court, on which the writ was issued in this case, was done and were furnished at several distinct periods, and upon distinct contracts or orders,., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>and not under one continuing contract, then the plaintiff <em>is </em>not entitled to recover in this action for any work done or materials furnished more than sixty days before the date of the service of notice of claim of lien to the, defendant, offered in evidence by the plaintiff, on any distinct contract performed, or order complied with, more than sixty days before the date of the said service of notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-5\">(3th. That the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action, unless the jury shall find, from the evidence, that within or at least the expiration of six mouths after the work was \u2022 done and materials were furnished, for which the pretended claim in this case was filed, that the plaintiff filed in this court a claim'setting forth the name of the party claimant, and of the contractor, the amount claimed to be due, the nature of the work done, the kind and amount of the materials furnished, and the time when the said work was done, and when the said materials were furnished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-6\">7th.

Neither the claim nor the notice properly sets forth the amounts due respectively for <em>'Work </em>donefnd <em>materials furnished. </em>It is absolutely necessary to state themmohrit of <em>each, </em>and not-the <em>aggregate o\u00ed </em>the two. Sec. 11, of the Act of 1838, ch. 205, says that <em>\u201cevery </em>claim <em>must </em>set forth,\u201d among other things, \u201cthe nature or kind of the work done, or the kind and amount of materials furnished,\u201d and when both work is done and materials are furnished, both must be specified in the claim. <em>Sergt. on Mechanics </em>Lien, 226. 6 <em>Barr., </em>191, <em>Noll vs. Swineford. </em>8 <em>Barr., </em>478, <em>Lawman's Appeal. </em>6 <em>Gill, </em>27, <em>Carson vs. White.

The Act of 1838, ch. 205, sec. 9, required the notice to the owner, in such a case as the present, where the house was built, by a contractor, to be given within 30 days after making the contract or furnishing the materials. The Act of 1845, ch. 176, sec. 1, extending the time of such notice to 60 days, did not apply to Howard district, because the Act of 1845, ch. 346, purports to extend \u201cthe Act of 1839, ch. 205, and the supplements thereto,\u201d to Howard district, and the Act here referred to and proposed to be extended, contains nothing whatever relating to mechanics\u2019 liens. The Act of 1838, ch. 205, had already been extended to Howard district by the Act of 1842, ch. 111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-9\">3rd. But even if the mechanics lien laws, and the Act of 1845, ch. 176, among them, had been extended to Howard district, they were never made applicable by the Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>of 1850, or by any statute, to <em>Howard county. </em>Art. 8, sec. 1, of the Constitution, simply makes Howard district a new county, to be called Howard county, and declares that its inhabitants \u201cshall have, hold and enjoy all such <em>rights </em>and <em>privileges </em>as are held and enjoyed by the inhabitants of the <em>other counties </em>of the State,\u201d and that \u201call <em>rights, powers and.obligations </em>incident to Howard district of Anne Arundel county, <em>shall attach </em>to Howard county.\u201d It is submitted that this does not extend to Howard county <em>all the laws </em>which had been previously applicable to Howard district, and this was not done till the adoption of the new Code, which is applicable to the whole State.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-5\"><em>Chas. E. Phelps </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-6\">1st. The claim, as filed, is correct, both in form and substance. It is not a claim filed by a contractor or builder, under the Act of 1845, ch. 287, but simply that of an ordinary mechanic or material-man. The contract of the appellee with Woods, the contractor, was to do the work <em>\u201cby the foot,\u201d </em>and when done the work was measured by a sworn measurer. Under these circumstances, what other or better statement of his claim could the appellee have set forth than that filed in this case ? \u201cThe nature and kind of work done,\u201d and \u201cthe kind and amount of materials furnished,\u201d are both set forth with certainty and precision. For any practical purpose, it is immaterial whether the charge for \u201ctin roofing\u201d and \u201cspouting,\u201d be regarded as <em>\u201cwork done,\u201d </em>in which case.,, the materials furnished will be merely an incident, a.s in <em>5 Barr., </em>18, <em>Shaw vs. Barnes, </em>and <em>2 Harris, </em>175, <em>Hill </em>vs. <em>McDowell, </em>and <em>Ibid., </em>167, <em>Bayer vs. Reeside, </em>or whether it be regarded as <em>\u201cmaterials furnished,\u201d </em>in which case the work, done upon the tin, in putting it down upon the building, of course, enters into the estimate of the price of the tin as <em>\u201cmofing\u201d </em>and <em>\u201cspouting,\u201d </em>just as the work previously done upon the raw material to reduce it into the proper condition. and form for use, enters into the estimate of its price, simply as <em>\u201ctin.\u201d </em>The lien laws are to be liberally construed, so as to advance the remedy provided, and it is suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>dent if their requirements are <em>substantially </em>complied with. <em>Act of </em>1845, <em>ch. </em>287, <em>sec. </em>1. 10 <em>Md. Rep., 257, Hess, et al., vs. Poultney, et al. </em>The true test of conformity with the requirements of sec. 11, of the Act of 1838, ch. 205, is given by the Court of Appeals, in <em>Carson vs. White, </em>6 <em>Gill, </em>27, and the appellee asks no more than that the claim in this case be measured according to the principles established by that decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-5\">2nd. But it is contended, on the other side, that the supplementary Act of 1845, ch. 176, is not in force in Howard county, and that, therefore, notice of <em>thirty days </em>should have been given under the original Act of 1838, ch. 205, which was extended to Howard district by the Act of 1842, ch. 111. This position rests upon the fact, that the Act of 1845, ch. 346, misrecites <em>the year of </em>the session in which the original Act referred to and proposed to be extended with <em>its supplements, </em>was passed. This misrecital obviously arises from clerical misprision, typographical error, or mere inadvertance. Is it true that our Acts of Assembly are liable to be invalidated by accidents so trivial? But fortunately, in this case the accident does no harm. The original Act is correctly described by its <em>title, </em>with perfect fullness and accuracy, leaving no room for doubt as to what Act was really meant by the Legislature. \u201cOne part of a statute must be so construed by another, that the whole will, if possible stand; <em>ut res magis valeat quam perealA\u2019\u2019 </em>1 <em>Bl. Com., </em>89. If there were any thing in this point, why was it not made in reference to the Act of 1845, ch. 287, in the case of <em>Okisko Co. vs. Matthews, </em>3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>168?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-6\">3rd. It is further contended, on the other side, that neither the original Act of 1838, nor any of its supplements, which have been applied to Howard <em>district, </em>are now in force in Howard <em>county, </em>inasmuch as they have not been specially <em>re-enacted </em>since the adoption of the new Constitution. The Constitution <em>(Art. </em>8, <em>sec. </em>1) provides that <em>\u201call rights, powers and obligations </em>incident to Howard district of Anne Arundel county shall attach to Howard county.\u201d This clause, of necessity, carries with it all the <em>laws </em>then in force in Howard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>district and \u201cattaches\u201d them to Howard county. No law was ever passed, none can be passed, which does not either confer a <em>\u201cright,\u201d </em>convey a <em>\u201cpower,\u201d </em>or impose an <em>\u201cobligation.\u201d </em>The mechanics lien laws do all these. Even were the terms- of the organic law not thus explicit, the court, it is submitted, would hesitate long before pronouncing a decision which would disturb, unsettle and shake, the very foundations of the legislation, upon which repose the vested rights of the citizens of Howard county, especially after an interval of ten years, during which the question has never been raised.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b560-5\">Goldsbokough, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALy\">delivered the opinion of this court:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u2022This is a proceeding under the lien law of 1838, ch. 205, and its supplements.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The appellant was the owner of a house in Howard county, built by a certain William W. Woods, under a contract dated the 8th of August 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The appellee was employed by Woods, the contractor, to cover the house with a tin roof, and to furnish spouting for the same. He finished the work, and failing to obtain payment from the contractor, Woods, filed his claim on the 2nd day of December 1857, in the G'ircuit court for Howard county, in pursuance of the above Acts of Assembly, and a <em>scire facias </em>was issued thereon. The bill of particulars, with notice, was served on the appellant on the 15th of July 1857. The appellant appeared, and filed the several pleas mentioned in the proceedings, <em>(ante., </em>540, 541,) and the appellee joined issue on. them.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The appellee then offered in evidence the claim on which the writ issued, the service of the bill of particulars on the appellant, the time when the work was finished, and the measurement of the work done, and its value. Evidence was offered on-both sides in regard to the character of the work done. At the trial, the appellee offered two prayers, both of which were granted; and the appellant offered eight prayers, the first, second and eighth of which were refused by the court; the remaining prayers of the appellant were granted with the consent of the appellee\u2019s counsel. From which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>.ruling of-the court, granting the appellee\u2019s prayers, and the rejection of the appellant\u2019s first, second and eighth prayers, the appellant appealed. <em>We </em>concur in the ruling of the court below. The bill of particulars shows a substantial compliance with the llth section of the original Act. The appellee was entitled to compensation only for a specific job of work, and the work, when completed, so combined the work and materials as to render it unnecessary to separate them in view of the law.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b561-7\">(Decided February 4th, 1861.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b561-5\"><em>We </em>are of opinion that the Act of 1838, ch. 205, the Act of 1845, ch. 176, extending the time of notice to sixty days, and the Act of 1845, ch. 346, extending these Acts to Howard District, were, by the 3rd Article of the Bill of Rights, and by the Constitution, extended to Howard county. The objection urged by the appellant\u2019s counsel, that there is no Act of L839, ch. 205, relating to mechanics\u2019 liens, is sufficiently answered by referring to the Act of 1845, ch. 346. In the title to that Act, it will be seen, that it speaks of an Act <em>passed </em>in 1839, and the original Act of 1838, ch. 205, was in fact passed in March 1839, and took effect from the first of June of that year. This is a sufficient identification of the original Act, to which that of 1845, ch. 346, was intended to be supplementary, especially when it is manifest that there was no law passed, in the session of 1839, relating to the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
