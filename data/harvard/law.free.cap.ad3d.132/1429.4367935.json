She also waived her right to appeal. Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was to be sentenced as a second felony offender to 1\u00bd to 3 years in prison. After preparation of the presentence report, County Court indicated that it was uncomfortable with the sentence and gave defendant the opportunity to either withdraw her plea or be sentenced to 2 to 4 years in prison. She elected to proceed and was sentenced accordingly. Defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-3\">Defendant\u2019s sole contention is that her sentence is harsh and excessive. Given defendant\u2019s valid waiver of her right to appeal, she is precluded from making this claim <em>(see People v Jennings, </em>75 AD3d 999 [2010]; <em>People v Houck, </em>74 AD3d 1476 [2010]). Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1326-4\">Mercure, J.P., Peters, Lahtinen, McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
