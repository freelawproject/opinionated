As an alternative holding, we reject it on the merits. Defendant\u2019s claim that he served the dominant role in perpetrating the crimes, thus preventing the enterprise from continuing in his absence, is no defense to enterprise corruption <em>(see People v Keschner, </em>110 AD3d 216, 221-225 [1st Dept 2013], <em>affd </em>25 NY3d 704 [2015]). We also find that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence <em>(see People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342, 348 [2007]).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">In this case involving extortion directed at construction contractors, the court providently exercised its discretion in admitting evidence of more than 100 calls to New York City\u2019s 311 system complaining of purported safety violations and fire hazards at construction sites. The evidence that defendant or his accomplices had made voluminous complaints of that type, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>not pertaining to any specifically charged victims, was directly relevant to establishing defendant\u2019s ongoing course of conduct beyond the specific pattern acts for purposes of the enterprise corruption and scheme to defraud counts. The evidence was also properly admitted to show defendant\u2019s motive and intent with respect to the counts alleging grand larceny by extortion against specific victims <em>(see People v Alvino, </em>71 NY2d 233 [1987]; <em>People v Peckens, </em>153 NY 576, 592-593 [1897]). The probative value of this evidence exceeded any prejudicial effect <em>(see People v Mateo, </em>2 NY3d 383, 424-425 [2004], <em>cert denied </em>542 US 946 [2004]). In any event, any error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt <em>(see People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230 [1975]).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Defendant failed to preserve his purported due process challenge to the admission of the 311 complaints (which amounts to a state evidentiary claim that is not of constitutional dimension), or his contention that the prejudicial effect was compounded by the prosecutor\u2019s references to the 311 complaints in summation. We decline to review these unpreserved arguments in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we reject them on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We perceive no basis for reducing the sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"AMp\">Concur\u2014 Tom, J.P., Renwick, Andrias and Kapnick, JJ.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
