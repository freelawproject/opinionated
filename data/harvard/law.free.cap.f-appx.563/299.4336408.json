California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Valadez has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>During the pendency of this appeal, Va-ladez completed his sentence of imprisonment, and he has no further term of supervised release to serve. The appeal is, therefore, moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED as moot, and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
