At sentencing, the district court applied a cross reference in United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) \u00a7 2B1.1(c)(1)(A), which applies the base offense level and specific offense characteristics of \u00a7 2K2.1 when \u201ca firearm ... was taken, or the taking of any such item was an object of the offense.\u201d As a result of this cross reference, Clark\u2019s base offense level increased from 6 to 12 under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(7), and he also received additional increases in his offense level based on \u00a7 2K2.1(b). Clark argues that the cross reference in \u00a7 2B 1.1(c)(1)(A) should not have applied to him because he lacked knowledge that he stole a package containing firearms. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2011). The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error, and its application of those facts to justify a sentencing enhancement is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Walker, </em>490 F.3d 1282, 1299 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cAlthough district courts now consider the Guidelines only in an advisory fashion, USSG \u00a7 1B1.3 instructs district courts to consider not merely the charged conduct, but rather all \u2018relevant conduct,\u2019 in calculating a defendant\u2019s offense level.\u201d <em>United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316, 1336 (11th Cir.2006). The district court is not limited to only those facts that the defendant has admitted or pleaded guilty to and may consider relevant facts in the record, undisputed statements in the Pre-sentence Investigation Report (PSI), or evidence proffered at the sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.2007). The district court\u2019s factual findings as to relevant conduct, however, must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-19\">This Court has not yet decided whether the cross reference in \u00a7 2B 1.1(c)(1)(A) contains a knowledge requirement. We need not decide that question in this case, however, because the record contains ample circumstantial evidence that Clark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>knew that he was stealing firearms when he attempted to steal the package at issue here. Clark stipulated that the government executed a controlled delivery of a package containing 11 handguns. The label on the package stated that it was being sent from \u201cJiminez Arms\u201d to \u201cGold Star Pawn.\u201d. Clark also testified that he did not see that the package was being sent by Jiminez Arms, yet he chose to steal this particular package out of all the packages he handled that day. Finally, Clark admits that he sent a text message to his confederate after diverting the package of guns, which stated: \u201cGot one comn <em>pow pow </em>$ROCAFELLAS$.\u201d (emphasis added). Based on this record, the district court had sufficient evidence to conclude that Clark was aware that he was stealing firearms when he stole the package at issue here. Therefore, the district court did not err by applying the cross reference in \u00a7 2B 1.1(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
