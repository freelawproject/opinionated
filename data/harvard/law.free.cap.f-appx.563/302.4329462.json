California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Ellis filed a letter requesting more time to file a response to the <em>Anders </em>brief, and he was given more time. However, he never filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-20\">To the extent that Ellis\u2019s pro se effort to withdraw his plea at sentencing raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the record is insufficiently developed; we therefore decline to consider it without prejudice to his right to raise it on collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014). We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief, the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, and Ellis\u2019s initial letter. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
