On appeal, Vargas-Lozano argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of a 12-month upward variance was substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-25\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The party challenging the sentence has the burden to show that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Although in choosing the sentence, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court in not required to address each factor separately. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.2006). Rather, an acknowledgment that the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors generally will suffice. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, the weight to be given to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor is \u201ca matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">If the district court decides to impose an upward variance, \u201cit must \u2018consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597). In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the advisory guidelines range, we take into account the district court\u2019s justification and the extent of the variance, but we do not require extraordinary circumstances to justify such a sentence or presume that such a sentence is unreasonable. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 594-95; <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). We must give \u201c \u2018due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1187 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597). We will vacate such a sentence \u201conly if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Here, Vargas-Lozano has not shown that his 83-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. Vargas-Lozano\u2019s sentence is just 12 months above the advisory guidelines range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment and well below the applicable statutory maximum twenty-year sentence. And, the district court had a reasoned basis for imposing the 12-month upward variance, namely that Vargas-Lozano\u2019s history showed he was a repeat offender who was already undeterred by a 71-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">Specifically, Vargas-Lozano was convicted in Georgia state court of trafficking in more than 28 grams of methamphetamine, which is considered an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. As a result, Vargas-Lozano was deported to Mexico on March 4, 2005. Within two months, Var<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>gas-Lozano was back in Georgia, and, on February 25, 2006, Vargas-Lozano was found in possession of methamphetamine and arrested. This time, Vargas-Lozano was convicted in district court of illegal reentry following an aggravated felony, pursuant to U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). After serving a 71-month sentence, Vargas-Lozano was deported on June 16, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">About a year later, on June 26, 2012, Vargas-Lozano illegally reentered the United States. On January 13, 2013, Vargas-Lozano again was arrested in Georgia for methamphetamine possession, which led to this second \u00a7 1326 illegal reentry conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">In deciding to impose the 12-month upward variance, the district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and cited in particular the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense and to afford adequate deterrence. The district court stressed that Vargas-Lozano\u2019s 71-month sentence for his prior \u00a7 1326 conviction had failed to deter him. The district court declined Vargas-Lozano\u2019s request for a downward variance because the court did not \u201cthink the point [was] getting across.\u201d Instead, a 12-month upward variance was warranted given that Vargas-Lozano \u201ccontinue[d] to show no respect for the law\u201d and his \u201crecord was very bad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">We cannot say the district court abused its discretion in imposing a 12-month upward variance. Each time Vargas-Lozano was deported, he returned to the United States within a year, and each time, he was discovered by law enforcement in possession of methamphetamine, a criminal offense. More importantly, Vargas-Lozano was back in the United States committing another drug offense within one year of his last deportation despite having just served a 71-month prison sentence. Clearly, the 71-month sentence did not have the desired deterrent effect. Under the circumstances, the district court\u2019s stated concerns over Vargas-Lozano\u2019s recidivism and criminal history in the United States were sufficiently compelling to support the 12-month upward variance, and we cannot say that the 83-month sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">The record belies Vargas-Lozano\u2019s claim that the district court failed to consider his personal history, including his methamphetamine addiction and lack of family ties in the United States that would induce him to return. The district court heard and considered these mitigation arguments and concluded that they were insufficient to warrant a guidelines sentence in light of Vargas-Lozano\u2019s criminal history and risk of recidivism. The district court was not required to address each of Vargas-Loza-no\u2019s mitigation arguments explicitly. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329. Vargas-Lozano essentially asks us to second guess the weight the district court gave each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which we do not do when, as here, \u201cthe sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>See United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">There is also no merit to Vargas-Loza-no\u2019s argument that his 83-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because he already was \u201cseverely punished\u201d by a 16-level increase in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) (providing for a 16-level increase if the defendant had previously been deported after being convicted of a felony drug trafficking offense for which the prison sentence exceed 13 months). A district court may consider conduct already used to calculate the guidelines range in deciding whether to impose a variance. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>487 F.3d 823, 833-34 (11th Cir.2007). Furthermore, our reasonableness review applies only to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence, not to \u201ceach individual decision made during the sentencing process.\u201d <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Vargas-Lozano did not challenge the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i)16-level increase in the district court, and does not raise this guidelines calculation issue in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Finally, Vargas-Lozano points to two other illegal reentry defendants whom he claims had \u201cmuch more troublesome\u201d criminal and immigration histories, but did not receive upward variances. This information does not demonstrate an unwarranted sentence disparity. Vargas-Lozano received an upward variance because he had already shown that a 71-month sentence, at the top of the advisory guidelines range, was insufficient to deter him from illegally reentering the country and committing further drug crimes here. Vargas-Lozano did not contend that the other illegal reentry defendants had such a record. <em>See United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1252 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that to be unwarranted, the disparity must be between similarly situated defendants with similar records).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Notably, one of the defendants received a 96-month sentence, longer than Vargas-Lozano\u2019s sentence, and the other defendant received a 46-month sentence, shorter than Vargas-Lozano\u2019s sentence. However, both defendants\u2019 sentences were at the top of their respective advisory guidelines ranges, suggesting that neither defendant was sufficiently similar to Vargas-Lozano to be comparing apples to apples. <em>See United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cA well-founded claim of disparity ... assumes that apples are being compare to apples.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). In any event, the fact that these two illegal reentry defendants did not receive a 12-month upward variance does not establish that Vargas-Loza-no\u2019s 12-month upward variance took his sentence \u201coutside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of [Vargas-Lozano\u2019s] case.\u201d <em>See Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1238 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">For all these reasons, Vargas-Lozano has not shown that his 83-month sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-6\"><em>. </em>Vargas-Lozano does not contend that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable or point to any procedural error at his sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
