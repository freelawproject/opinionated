U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>596 F.3d 1329, 1332 (11th Cir.2009). An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing, with specific and credible evidence, that: (1) he suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground; or (2) he has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>In order to qualify for asylum, the alleged feared persecution must be on account of one of the five protected grounds \u2014 \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-20\">Petlyovanyy testified that the mafia targeted his mother primarily to collect protection payments. Following her murder, the mafia targeted him and his family to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>try and collect the remainder of those payments. While it is true that the familial relationship played a necessary role in the targeting, the underlying motivation was based on the payments and any characteristic regarding the family relationship was tangential to the mafia\u2019s intent. Pet-lyovanyy may not establish his eligibility for asylum based on his refusal to cooperate with the mafia, or the fact that his family was the victim of criminal activity. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (1 1th Cir.2006) (stating evidence of private acts of violence or the petitioner\u2019s refusal to cooperate with criminals, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground); <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that to show a petitioner fears persecution on account of a protected ground, it is not enough for a petitioner to show that he will be persecuted due to his refusal to cooperate with guerilla groups). Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Petlyova-nyy could not establish a nexus between the feared persecution and a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) (stating an applicant must demonstrate that an enumerated ground \u201cwas or will be at least one central reason for persecuting\u201d him). Accordingly, we deny Petlyova-nyy\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-15\">. Because Petlyovanyy did not address the denials of withholding of removal or relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment in his brief on appeal, those claims are accordingly deemed abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b709-16\">. Where the BIA issues its own opinion, but expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Shkambi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>584 F.3d 1041, 1048 (11th Cir.2009). We review conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>and review findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). <em>Id. </em>Under the substantial evidence test, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the decision and must affirm the decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record. <em>Diallo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>596 F.3d 1329, 1332 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\">. Because Petlyovanyy has not shown that any persecution would be on account of a protected ground, he cannot show that he is eligible for asylum. Accordingly, we need not address his other arguments regarding the safety of relocation within Ukraine and the lack of notice or opportunity to provide corroborating evidence to confirm his belief that his father and brother may have been killed by the mafia.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
