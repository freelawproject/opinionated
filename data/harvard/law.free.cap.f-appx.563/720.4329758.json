Stat. \u00a7 856.011(3), Disorderly Intoxication. Plaintiffs thereafter brought this fifteen-count lawsuit against those three defendants and Officer Michael Brouillette and the City of New Smyrna Beach asserting federal and state law claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The federal claims were brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>against Williams, Shaffer and Theriault in Counts I through IX of the complaint and against the City in Count XV under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 based on their alleged infringement of plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the First and/or Fourth Amendments (and presumably under the Fourteenth Amendment) to the United States Constitution. The state law claims were brought against Williams, Theriault and Brouillette in Counts X through XIV.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">On motion for summary judgment, the District Court, in an order entered on August 19, 2013, held that the four police officers were entitled to qualified immunity, and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against them. The court declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state law claims and accordingly dismissed them without prejudice \u2014 thus appearing to conclude the case. But the court overlooked one federal claim in the case, a claim the court\u2019s order did not mention: Count XV, a Fourth Amendment claim against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Plaintiffs appeal the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 claims against the four officers, Williams, Shaffer, Theriault and Brouillette, and the court\u2019s dismissal of the state law claims. Although the court\u2019s August 19, 2013, order appears to have disposed of all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, it did not; Count IV remains. What is before us is an appeal of the court\u2019s order appearing to grant the four officers summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity. Since plaintiffs did not bring a \u00a7 1983 claim against Brouillette however, what we have is an order granting Williams, Shaffer and Theriault summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. We have jurisdiction to review that order. \u201c[A] district court\u2019s denial of a claim of qualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law, is an appealable \u2018final decision\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2817, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">We have thoroughly considered plaintiffs\u2019 arguments for the reversal of the District Court\u2019s qualified immunity rulings. We find that their arguments lack merit; for, as the District Court correctly concluded, the \u201cOfficers had arguable probable cause to arrest Plaintiffs for being involved in an altercation.\u201d Order at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">The District Court\u2019s judgment is affirmed to the extent that it grants defendants Williams, Shaffer and Theriault qualified immunity on the federal claims. The judgment is vacated with respect to the dismissal of the state law claims. The case is remanded for consideration of the Count XV \u00a7 1983 claim against the City and the state law claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">AFFIRMED, in part; VACATED and REMANDED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction over these claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and \u00a7 3443, and the state law claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">. Brouillette was named as a defendant only in Count XIV, a state law claim for slander.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\">. We of course intimate no view as to the court\u2019s discretionary exercise of \u00a7 1367 jurisdiction over the state law claims once it has ruled on the sufficiency of the Count XV claim against the City.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
