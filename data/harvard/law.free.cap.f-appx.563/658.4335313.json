We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">A. <em>Howard\u2019s Employment and the Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Howard was employed at Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (\u201cFidelity\u201d), as a Business Strategy Manager. Her job required her to sit for six hours per day, walk or stand for two hours per day, \u201cfrequently\u201d lift up to 10 pounds, and \u201coccasionally\u201d lift between 10 and 20 pounds. Her occupation also required \u201cfull use of the upper extremities, such as with fingering and handling, computer use and typing.\u201d R at 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">While employed at Fidelity, Howard was a participant in the Fidelity National Financial Inc. Group Benefit Plan (the ERISA \u201cPlan\u201d), which Hartford issued, insured, and underwrote. Hartford also funded and administered the Plan. Under the terms of the Plan, a participant is entitled to receive long-term disability (\u201cLTD\u201d) benefits if she meets the definition^) of disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R at 30. For the first 24 months of a claimed disability, eligibility for long-term disability benefits is conditioned on a participant\u2019s submission of proof that she was prevented by an illness or injury from performing, on a full-time basis, \u201cone or more of the Essential Duties of [her] Occupation.\u201d R at 55. \u201cEssential Duty\u201d is defined as \u201ca duty that: 1. is substantial, not incidental; 2. is fundamental or inherent to the occupation; and 3. [cannot] be reasonably omitted or changed.\u201d R at 55. According to the Plan terms, Hartford has \u201cfull discretion and authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe and interpret all terms and provisions of the [Plan].\u201d R at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">B. <em>Howard\u2019s Medical History and Benefits Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">In April 2005, Howard stopped working and applied for disability benefits. Her treating physician, Dr. Gary Decker, submitted to Hartford an Attending Physician\u2019s Statement, stating he had been treating Howard for \u201cmany years\u201d and, in his opinion, \u201cshe should qualify for total disability\u201d based upon her \u201cmultiple debilities.\u201d R at 1443. Dr. Decker reported Howard was 5'6\" and weighed over 300 pounds. He made a primary diagnosis of lupus, fibromyalgia, and severe joint pain, as well as secondary diagnoses of depression, short-term memory loss, and asthma. R at 1437. Dr. Decker concluded Howard \u201cbecame unable to work due to impairment\u201d on April 29, 2005. R at 1438. He listed Howard\u2019s impairments to include walking, sitting, lifting/carrying, pushing, pulling, driving, and keyboard use. In a second Attending Physician\u2019s statement, Dr. Decker listed his primary diagnosis as lupus and his secondary diagnosis as fibro-myalgia. He reported Howard was precluded from performing several of the functions of her job, including standing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>walking for more than a few minutes at a time and sitting for longer than an hour. Based on this information, Hartford approved Howard\u2019s claim for Short Term Disability benefits, which expired on November 3, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Beginning in July 2005, Hartford sent further inquiries to Dr. Decker and requested more information about Howard\u2019s health and limitations. He acknowledged Howard\u2019s lab work did not support lupus, but she was diagnosed \u201cper Rheumatolo-gy.\u201d R at 1346. He also stated Howard was unable to work in sedentary to light positions because of \u201c[sjevere joint pain\u201d in her hips and hands, difficulty with handwriting, and \u201clower extremity swelling.\u201d R at 1346. Hartford later sent Dr. Decker a second questionnaire, based on a rheu-matologist\u2019s findings that Howard was not experiencing spasms, severe joint pain, or other symptoms limiting her function. In response to Hartford\u2019s question as to how Dr. Decker determined Howard was having \u201csevere problems\u201d and \u201csevere symptoms,\u201d he stated his determinations were based on Howard\u2019s own reports of pain and multiple exams.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">On October 22, 2005, Howard filed for LTD benefits. Dr. Decker provided Hartford with an Attending Physician\u2019s Statement of Continued Disability, again reporting his primary diagnosis of lupus and fibromyalgia and his secondary diagnosis of severe joint pain, asthma, and depression. He also completed a Physical Capacities Evaluation Form stating Howard could not sit for more than an hour at a time and could not stand for more than five minutes. Additionally, Howard submitted a statement reporting she (1) was unable to multi-task because of short-term memory problems and chronic fatigue; (2) had suffered a loss of fine-motor skills; (3) was unable to life or carry more than 2 to 3 pounds; (4) could not stand or walk without support for more than a few minutes; (5) could not write more than a sentence or two without severe pain; and (6) had memory deficits, sometimes causing her to become confused or disoriented.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">On November 1, 2005, Hartford advised Howard her claim for LTD benefits had been approved, effective November 4, 2005. She also was advised an Independent Medical Examination (\u201cIME\u201d) would be performed. Dr. Mark Hofmann performed the IME and concluded, based on Howard\u2019s self-reported pain, Howard probably had fibromyalgia. He provided restrictions of \u201c[n]o lifting or carrying greater than 10 pounds occasionally, less than one hour per day of keyboarding and repetitive hand motion, [and] avoidance of ... standing/walking more than 10 minutes at a time.\u201d R at 1236. Based on the IME and Dr. Decker\u2019s submissions, Howard\u2019s LTD benefits were continued beyond November 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">C. <em>Investigation and Termination of Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Hartford initiated surveillance in March 2006 \u201c[t]o better understand [Howard\u2019s] capabilities.\u201d R at 995. A total of 60 hours of surveillance was conducted over six days: March 30 to April 1 and May 8-10, 2006. The surveillance showed Howard running errands for extended periods of time, driving approximately 248 miles over one day, driving her daughter to and from school, sitting in her vehicle for 33 minutes, carrying groceries, and walking with and without her cane.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">A Hartford investigator interviewed Howard, who gave a detailed statement regarding her condition, restrictions, and limitations. In her interview, she reiterated that she was prevented from working by chronic pain, she suffered \u201cextreme fatigue\u201d because of her fibromyalgia, she was not able to sit for more than one hour, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>she was able to stand only for 5 to 10 minutes and walk for 5 to 10 minutes, she could drive for only 30 minutes or less and not farther than 15 to 20 miles, and she used a cane to walk \u201c90% of the time.\u201d R at 2482-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Subsequently, Hartford sent Howard\u2019s medical records, surveillance video, and surveillance reports to Dr. William Sniger, a Board-certified Physician in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. After reviewing the file, Dr. Sniger made several observations, including that the activities seen in the video were \u201cin excess of [Howard\u2019s] stated limitations,\u201d and \u201cthe preponderance of objective information does not appear to support the severity of the claimant\u2019s subjective symptoms or alleged inability to perform full-time work.\u201d R at 1013, 1014. Dr. Sniger concluded: \u201cBased upon the subjective and objective information available to me, it is my opinion with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the preponderance of information does not support the claimant\u2019s alleged inability to perform full-time work from a physical perspective.\u201d R at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In a letter dated November 15, 2006, Hartford terminated Howard\u2019s LTD benefits. The letter detailed the information within Howard\u2019s file and explained, after considering all of the evidence, \u201cthe combined information ... d[id] not show that [Howard] [was] unable to perform the Essential Duties of [her] Occupation.\u201d R at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">D. <em>Howard\u2019s Appeal and Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Howard appealed Hartford\u2019s termination decision. With her appeal, she submitted (1) a letter asserting some of her activities captured during surveillance were necessary to assist family members and advising her condition was more severe on some days than others, and (2) additional medical examination reports and Attending Physician Statements in Support of Disability completed by Dr. Decker and Dr. Orlando Florete, a pain management physician.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">Hartford had Dr. Carol Walker, Ph.D., a neuropsychologist, review Howard\u2019s medical records. Dr. Walker concluded \u201cthere is no objective data to support psychological or cognitive symptoms that would interfere with [Howard\u2019s] ability to work- Cognitive and psychological issues have not been documented as the focus of treatment by her medical providers.\u201d R at 2293. Dr. Phillip Marion, a physician, also reviewed Howard\u2019s records and opined Howard\u2019s \u201ccontinued complaints of incapacitating full body pain are inconsistent with her observed functional independence.\u201d R at 2297. Dr. Marion concluded Howard could work as long as she avoided overhead lifting with the left upper extremity.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">Hartford thereafter notified Howard it was upholding the benefits termination. Hartford explained Howard had been observed \u201cperforming activities in excess of her reported limitations and as such, her report is not entirely reliable. Thus, the restrictions and limitations imposed by her physicians, being rooted in Ms. Howard\u2019s report almost exclusively, is likewise an unreliable indicator of Ms. Howard\u2019s functionality.\u201d R at 2275. Hartford concluded Howard was capable of light-duty work and the demands of her employment were of a sedentary capacity; therefore, \u201cthe weight of the evidence continues to support Ms. Howard\u2019s capacity to perform her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>occupation on a full-time basis.\u201d R at 2275.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Howard then filed suit against Hartford under ERISA and sought to reverse Hartford\u2019s decision to discontinue payment of her LTD benefits. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. In support of her motion for summary judgment, Howard attached 30 exhibits. These exhibits included a \u201cDeclaration of Howard\u2019s Counsel\u201d regarding the exhibits, transcripts of depositions taken after Howard filed suit, interrogatory answers in this suit, deposition transcripts, interrogatory answers, and discovery documents from lawsuits against Hartford to which Howard was not a party, articles and information obtained from the internet, and contracts between Hartford and medical consultant vendors. Because none of the exhibits were available or considered by the Plan administrator, Hartford filed a motion to strike the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The district judge construed the motion to strike as a motion in limine, granted the motion, and entered summary judgment for Hartford. The judge concluded Hartford\u2019s decision was reasonable, based on the evidence, and the challenged benefits decision was not arbitrary and capricious. <em>Howard v. Hartford Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>929 F.Supp.2d 1264 (M.D.Fla.2013). On appeal, Howard argues the district judge erred by refusing to consider the exhibits attached to her motion for summary judgment and failing to consider properly evidence regarding Hartford\u2019s financial conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We review orders granting summary judgment in an ERISA case de novo and apply the same judicial standard to the administrator\u2019s decision used by the district judge. <em>Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>644 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2011). ERISA does not provide a standard for courts to review administrators\u2019 plan determinations, but \u201cthe Supreme Court articulated a framework for judicial review, which this circuit has distilled into a six-part test.\u201d <em>Melech v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>739 F.3d 663, 672 (11th Cir.2014) (citing <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 109, 109 S.Ct. 948, 956-57, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989); <em>Williams v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>373 F.3d 1132, 1138 (11th Cir.2004)). Our test requires a reviewing judge to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">(1) Apply the <em>de novo </em>standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u201cwrong\u201d (i.e., the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">(2) If the administrator\u2019s decision in fact is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong,\u201d then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-11\">(3) If the administrator\u2019s decision is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong\u201d and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \u201creasonable\u201d grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-12\">(4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator\u2019s decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-13\">(5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-14\">(6) If there is a conflict, the conflict should merely be a factor for the court to take into account when determining whether an administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number><em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1355 (citation omitted). \u201cThe phrase \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 and \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 are used interchangeably.\u201d <em>Melech, </em>739 F.3d at 672 n. 14 (citing <em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at n. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">It is well established a district judge\u2019s review of an administrator\u2019s discretionary benefits decision is confined to the evidence that was before the plan administrator. <em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1354. The burden is on the claimant to prove she is disabled and the administrator\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1355. When the administrator makes eligibility decisions and pays benefits, a structural conflict of interest exists and a judge must reach step 6 wherein \u201cthe burden remains on the [claimant] to show the decision was arbitrary; it is not the [administrator\u2019s] burden to prove its decision was not tainted by self-interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Structural conflict of interest is only one factor in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion. <em>Glenn, </em>554 U.S. at 108, 128 S.Ct. at 2346; <em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">There is no dispute Hartford had discretionary authority to construe the Plan and determine Howard\u2019s eligibility. Review of Hartford\u2019s decision is governed by the deferential \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. <em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1355. Because Hartford determines and pays the Plan benefits, the district judge must take into account any conflicts of interest in determining whether Hartford\u2019s denial was supported reasonably by the record before the administrator. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">After reviewing the administrative record, the district judge concluded Hartford\u2019s termination of benefits was \u201centirely reasonable,\u201d and the structural conflict of interest did not warrant reversal of the decision. <em>Howard, </em>929 F.Supp.2d at 1302. We agree. Howard\u2019s disability primarily was based on her diagnosis of fibromyalgia and lupus. As we previously have recognized, fibromyalgia \u201coften lacks medical or laboratory signs, and is generally diagnosed mostly on a[n] individual\u2019s described symptoms.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Furthermore, the severity of fibromyalgia symptoms is \u201centirely subjective.\u201d <em>Leger v. Tribune Co. Long Term Disability Benefits Plan, </em>557 F.3d 823, 835 n. 8 (7th Cir.2009). Howard\u2019s lupus symptoms similarly were subjective, because her lab work failed to support such a diagnosis. Given the subjective nature of Howard\u2019s diagnoses, credibility in this case is of utmost importance. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211, 1212 (recognizing, because fibromyalgia\u2019s \u201challmark\u201d is the \u201clack of objective evidence,\u201d credibility determinations are critical to claims of impairment).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">In terminating Howard\u2019s benefits, Hartford reviewed \u201call documents in [her] claim file ... as a whole\u201d and concluded she had \u201cthe ability to perform a sedentary to light occupation.\u201d R at 993, 1002. Hartford reviewed the surveillance of Howard that showed her performing activities she had claimed she was unable to perform. As the district judge noted, Howard\u2019s credibility was \u201cseriously called into question by the surveillance video which shows her engaging in activities grossly inconsistent with her description of her abilities, and in stark contrast to her own treating physicians\u2019 assessments, which were based on Howard\u2019s subjective complaints.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>929 F.Supp.2d at 1299-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Hartford also reviewed the opinions of Howard\u2019s treating physicians as well as the opinions of the reviewing physicians and health care professionals. Hartford was entitled to rely on the reviewing health care professionals\u2019 assessments of Howard\u2019s capabilities, which were based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>on her medical records and the surveillance video. <em>See Turner v. Delta Family-Care Disability &amp; Survivorship Plan, </em>291 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2002) (recognizing an administrator was entitled to rely on the opinion of an independent medical examiner in view of a surveillance report). We previously have determined an administrator\u2019s \u201cuse of \u2018file\u2019 reviews by independent doctors \u2014 instead of live, physical examinations\u201d is not arbitrary and capricious, \u201cparticularly in the absence of other troubling evidence.\u201d <em>Blankenship </em>644 F.3d at 1357. The reviewing physicians recognized Howard\u2019s physical limitations, but they also had observed her in the surveillance video, examined her medical records, and determined she could perform her job. Howard failed to submit evidence showing the reviewing health care providers were tainted or biased, and Hartford\u2019s reliance on their opinions was not arbitrary or capricious. While there were some conflicting reports regarding Howard\u2019s condition, because Hartford based its decision on evidence in the administrative record and concluded Howard was not precluded from \u201cperforming one or more of the Essential Duties of [her] Occupation,\u201d we do not conclude Hartford\u2019s finding was arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Turner, </em>291 F.3d at 1274 (holding an administrator\u2019s decision to terminate benefits that was based on the record was not arbitrary or capricious regardless of whether \u201canyone else might reach a different conclusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">While Howard contends Hartford operated under a conflict and Hartford\u2019s decision to terminate her benefits was influenced by financial concerns, conflict of interest is just one factor to consider. <em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1355. The district judge recognized deference is given to the administrator\u2019s \u201cdiscretionary decision-making\u201d even where a conflict of interest exists. <em>Howard, </em>929 F.Supp.2d at 1301 (quoting <em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1355). Despite Howard\u2019s argument to the contrary, the district judge appropriately deferred to Hartford\u2019s decision regarding benefits while weighing the structural conflict of interest as one factor. <em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Finally, in her motion for summary judgment, Howard attached 30 exhibits, which she alleged related to Hartford\u2019s conflict of interest. Howard argues the district judge erred in failing to consider her exhibits; however, we find it unnecessary to resolve this argument, because the district judge did examine all exhibits Howard tendered but concluded these exhibits did not justify another result. The district judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">Here, Howard has submitted thirty exhibits, some of which she did not cite at all in her briefing, others she cited only by exhibit number despite the exhibit being hundreds of pages in length, and many of which are far-afield of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Hartford\u2019s decision regarding Howard\u2019s specific LTD benefits eligibility. Only some of the exhibits were in existence at the time of the administrator\u2019s decision, and most importantly, none establish that an inherent or case-specific bias affected the administrator\u2019s decision in this case, or a higher likelihood that the structural conflict of interest affected the administrator\u2019s benefits decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><em>Howard, </em>929 F.Supp.2d at 1290-91 (footnote omitted). We conclude the district judge did not err in her evaluation of the exhibits or in her conclusion that Howard failed to establish a conflict of interest of \u201csufficient inherent or case-specific importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291 (quoting <em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1357) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, we affirm both the district judge\u2019s granting summary judgment to Hartford and the motion to strike exhibits filed supporting Howard\u2019s summary judgment motion in this ERISA case.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-10\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-11\">. The Plan defines \"Disability or Disabled\u201d to mean \"during the Elimination Period and for the next 24 months [a participant] [is] prevented by: 1. accidental bodily injury: 2. sickness; 3. Mental Illness; 4. Substance Abuse; or 5. pregnancy, from performing one or more of the Essential Duties of [her] Occupation, and as a result [her] Current Monthly Earnings are no more than 80% of [her] Indexed Pre-disability Earnings.\u201d R at 55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\">. Dr. Florete had diagnosed Howard with fi-bromyalgia, cervical degenerative disc disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and a left shoulder rotator cuff tear, and described Howard as \"totally and permanently disabled.\u201d R at 2025.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b690-4\">. Howard additionally challenges the district judge\u2019s finding that Hartford's interpretation of the Plan\u2019s \u201cOwn Occupation\u201d definition of \"disability\u201d was not arbitrary or capricious. She argues the Plan\u2019s definition of disability required her to establish she was unable to perform only <em>one </em>essential duty of her job and all physicians, including Hartford\u2019s IME physician, advised she was unable to type for extended periods of time. Howard, however, overlooks the fact that the Plan defined \"Own Occupation\u201d to mean \"as it is recognized in the general workplace. Your Occupation does not mean the specific job you are performing for a specific employer or at a specific location.\u201d R at 57. Because we find the plain language of the Plan directed Hartford to evaluate Howard's ability to perform her occupation as a whole and not an isolated job assignment, we find Howard\u2019s argument to be meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
