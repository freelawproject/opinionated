The district court\u2019s sanction relied on the magistrate judge\u2019s finding<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that because Lawson did not have sincere beliefs in his faith he had \u201cmisrepresented facts ... and pursued a frivolous, malicious claim.\u201d The magistrate judge based this finding on evidence that Lawson did not attend morning prayer services, declined a work proscription for the Sabbath, and consumed non-Kosher foods. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and dismissed Lawson\u2019s claims as a Rule 11 sanction for filing a pleading containing false allegations. Lawson argues that the district court inappropriately resolved genuine issues of material fact related to his religious sincerity. Additionally, Lawson argues that the district court abused its discretion by granting Rule 11 sanctions based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>This case comes before us now for the third time. Previously, we affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Lawson\u2019s claim as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>Lawson v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>427 Fed.Appx. 799, 801-02 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). However, Lawson\u2019s Motion for Rehearing was granted, and we ultimately reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal based on our determination that \u00a7 1915 did not apply to Lawson because he paid his initial filing fee in full. <em>Lawson v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Com., </em>454 Fed.Appx. 706, 707-09 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). On remand, the district court clarified that it did not \u201cdismiss[] [Lawson\u2019s] case as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) but rather as a sanction for filing a pleading containing false allegations, pursuant to Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Lawson v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Com., </em>No. 4:04-cv-00105-MP-AK, 2013 WL 978991, at *1 (N.D.Fla. Mar. 13, 2013). After careful review, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">We review \u201call aspects of a district court\u2019s Rule 11 determination\u201d for abuse of discretion. <em>McGregor v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs of Palm Beach Cnty., </em>956 F.2d 1017, 1022 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam). A district court abuses its discretion by \u201cbas[ing] its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 2461, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">\u201c[T]he imposition of a Rule 11 sanction is not a judgment on the merits of an action. Rather, it requires the determination of a collateral issue: whether the attorney has abused the judicial process, and, if so, what sanction would be appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 110 S.Ct. at 2456. Rule 11 sanctions may be assessed for, <em>inter alia, </em>filing a pleading that has no reasonable factual basis. <em>Massengale v. Ray, </em>267 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam). A court considering a motion for sanctions must determine whether a party\u2019s claims or assertions are objectively frivolous in fact or law, and, if they are, determine whether the person who signed the pleading should have been aware of the frivolity. <em>Worldwide Primates, Inc. v. McGreal, </em>87 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir.1996). \u201cA factual claim is frivolous if no reasonably competent attorney could conclude that it has a reasonable evidentiary basis. Thus, where no evidence or only patently frivolous evidence is offered to support factual contentions, sanctions can be imposed.\u201d <em>Thompson v. RelationServe Media, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 628, 665 (2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Davis v. Carl, </em>906 F.2d 533, 536 (11th Cir.1990) (noting that the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions based on groundless factual allegations are only appropriate where \u201cplaintiffs offer[ ] <em>no </em>evidence to support their allegations\u201d). Where the evidence, although \u201cweak or self-serving,\u201d is reasonable, sanctions cannot be imposed. <em>Thompson, </em>610 F.3d at 665 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Here, the district court abused its discretion by dismissing Lawson\u2019s claim as a Rule 11 sanction because it based its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. Our review of the record indicates that Lawson has provided some evidence supporting his allegation that he is a devout follower of Orthodox Judaism. Specifically, Lawson asserts that he was born Jewish and \u201chas been a sincere adherent of the Jewish (Orthodox) faith since 1997.\u201d Additionally, he has provided evidence that he makes daily use of his religious texts and spends his mornings in prayer. Thus, the district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 was based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. <em>See Davis, </em>906 F.2d at 536 (stating that Rule 11 sanctions for factually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>groundless claims should only be imposed where \u201cplaintiffs offer[] <em>no </em>evidence to support their allegations\u201d). To be sure, the DOC has provided evidence suggesting that Lawson\u2019s beliefs are insincere \u2014 evidence relied on by the district court but disputed by the parties here on appeal. The dispositive issue, however, is not whether the DOC\u2019s rebuttal evidence is strong enough to defeat Lawson\u2019s claims on the merits. Rather, it is whether Lawson has provided <em>any </em>evidence supporting his claims. <em>See Cooter &amp; Gell, </em>496 U.S. at 396, 110 S.Ct. at 2456. He has. The fact that Lawson has provided <em>some </em>evidence showing the sincerity of his beliefs is sufficient to establish that Rule 11 sanctions are inappropriate in this situation. It is entirely possible that Lawson\u2019s claims will fail on the merits. That does not, however, provide an avenue for dismissing his complaint as a Rule 11 sanction. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s decision to impose sanctions under Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-13\">. Because he has not alleged any points of law or fact that this court overlooked or misapprehended in dismissing his appeal, his motion for reconsideration is denied. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 40(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-14\">. The magistrate\u2019s Third Report and Recommendation (Report) was filed on November 3, 2009 in response to the DOC\u2019s Emergency Motion for Sanctions and Evidentiary Hearing, which sought dismissal of the case as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. The district court\u2019s order adopting the Report as the basis for its Rule 11 dismissal of Lawson\u2019s case was filed on March 13, 2013.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
