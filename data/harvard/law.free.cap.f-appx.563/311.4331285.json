California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Lopez-Gamez has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-22\">Because Lopez-Gamez has completed the confinement portion of his sentence, has evinced a desire to appeal only his sentence, and has been removed from the United States, his appeal is now moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED as moot, and counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
