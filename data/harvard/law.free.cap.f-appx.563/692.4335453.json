On appeal, Mr. Wiles raises three issues: an ineffective assistance of counsel claim related to his classification as an armed career criminal; a challenge under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3) to the magistrate judge\u2019s finding of a sufficient factual basis for his guilty plea to the third count; and a challenge under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1) to the magistrate judge\u2019s involvement during his plea hearing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b719-21\">After providing notice of his intent to plead guilty, Mr. Wiles consented to having a magistrate judge conduct the change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>of plea hearing. At that hearing, the magistrate judge read the three counts referenced above, and Mr. Wiles pled guilty to each of them. Mr. Wiles admitted that he was a convicted felon, but, for purposes relevant to sentencing, only admitted to having one prior felony conviction. Mr. Wiles also admitted to possessing and selling methamphetamine, possessing a firearm in furtherance thereof, and selling firearms and methamphetamine together. After the magistrate judge\u2019s review and explanation, Mr. Wiles indicated he understood all of the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty. Mr. Wiles also stated that he had discussed the case with his attorney, that his attorney had explained the charges to him, and that he was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The magistrate judge also asked Mr. Wiles and his attorney about his position concerning the applicability of the 15-year minimum mandatory sentence to Mr. Wiles as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Mr. Wiles\u2019 attorney responded that he did not think the sentence applied to Mr. Wiles, but he had put him on notice \u201cin the abundance of caution.\u201d D.E. 45 at 21. The magistrate judge then explained to Mr. Wiles that he faced a minimum mandatory sentence of 15 years if he had three predicate drug felonies or violent crimes committed on different occasions. Mr. Wiles acknowledged that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Finally, the magistrate judge asked about whether Mr. Wiles was offered a plea agreement. Mr. Wiles\u2019 attorney indicated that Mr. Wiles did not accept a plea agreement because, though it would have dismissed the second count, it did not affect the calculation of his sentence under the guidelines and would have limited his right to appeal. The magistrate judge then asked Mr. Wiles if he wanted to think about going forward without the plea agreement. After Mr. Wiles replied \u201cno, my head\u2019s going all over the place,\u201d the magistrate judge reiterated his attorney\u2019s statements by telling Mr. Wiles: \u201che said two things. One is, that it really doesn\u2019t give you much benefit, if any, I think is the way he put it. And that\u2019s not uncommon because most of what the Government offers in their plea agreement you can get without it. And secondly, you limit very significantly your right to appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-30. Mr. Wiles acknowledged that he was pleading guilty freely and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The magistrate judge recommended that the district court accept Mr. Wiles\u2019 guilty pleas because the offenses charged in the indictment were supported by an independent factual basis and because Mr. Wiles\u2019 guilty pleas were knowing and voluntary. Mr. Wiles did not file any objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and the district court adopted it, adjudicating Mr. Wiles guilty of the three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The district court sentenced Mr. Wiles to imprisonment for 240 months in total. At the sentencing hearing, the district court found that Mr. Wiles had four predicate offenses under the ACCA. Mr. Wiles expressed concern to the district court about the applicability of the ACCA, and indicated that, in pleading guilty, he relied on his attorney\u2019s advice that it would not apply. Mr. Wiles then requested a trial, which the district court denied. Though the district court had discretion under the advisory guidelines to impose a sentence of 188-285 months for the first and second counts, it varied downward and sentenced Mr. Wiles to the mandatory statutory minimum \u2014 180 months \u2014 for those counts, to run concurrently. Mr. Wiles also received a 60-month mandatory minimum sentence for the third count, to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Mr. Wiles subsequently filed a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, raising nine ineffective assistance of counsel claims. One of his claims concerned his lawyer\u2019s failure to file an appeal after Mr. Wiles instructed him to. In granting his \u00a7 2255 motion on that claim, the district court vacated the judgment and sentence, and then re-imposed the same sentence, in order to allow Mr. Wiles to appeal, <em>see </em>D.E. 49 at 2 (citing <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>225 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2000)), but did not address his other ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Mr. Wiles now appeals, raising only one of the nine ineffective assistance of counsel claims he raised below and two challenges under Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">With regard to Mr. Wiles\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim, \u201cit is well settled law in this circuit that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be considered on direct appeal if the claims were not first raised before in the district court and if there has been no opportunity to develop a record of evidence relevant to the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>694 F.3d 1, 8 (11th Cir.2012). <em>See also United States v. Patterson, </em>595 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that a \u00a7 2255 motion is preferable to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim \u201ceven if the record contains some indication of deficiencies of counsel\u2019s performance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">In granting Mr. Wiles\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court specifically explained it was not deciding the remaining ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The record here is not sufficiently developed to review those claims, and we disagree with Mr. Wiles\u2019 conclusory arguments suggesting otherwise. Given that the district court vacated its original judgment and imposed an identical sentence in a new judgment, Mr. Wiles may raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claims and develop a sufficient record through a properly-filed \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Stewart v. United States, </em>646 F.3d 856, 859 (11th Cir.2011) (citing <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 295, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">With regard to Mr. Wiles\u2019 remaining two challenges concerning the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and involvement during the plea colloquy, we conclude Mr. Wiles has waived his right to appellate review of these claims because he did not file any objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 59(b)(2) (\u201cFailure to object ... waives a party\u2019s right to review.\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Garcia-Sandobal, </em>703 F.3d 1278, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2013). Nevertheless, even if we were to review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that failure to object to a Rule 11 violation in the district court results in plain error review), we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">Mr. Wiles admitted that his possession of a firearm was in furtherance of the methamphetamine offense and that he sold the firearms and methamphetamine together. This provided a sufficient factual basis for his guilty plea to possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and does not constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1252-54 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cthere must be a showing of some nexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">Also, though Rule 11(c)(1) provides that a \u201ccourt must not participate\u201d in plea agreement discussions between the government and a defendant, the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>judge\u2019s discussion here did not violate this provision. The plea negotiations had already ended due to Mr. Wiles\u2019 rejection of the plea agreement, and the magistrate judge\u2019s questioning and comments were to ensure Mr. Wiles\u2019 guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. Mr. Wiles has not shown that his discussion with the magistrate judge compelled him to plead guilty, even if, as he contended during his sentencing hearing, his reliance on his attorney\u2019s advice may have influenced him to do so. <em>Cf. United States v. Castro, </em>736 F.3d 1308, 1313-15 (11th Cir.2013) (denying Rule 11 challenge because, although district court\u2019s comments plausibly may have compelled the defendant to plead guilty, it was equally plausible that the defendant pled guilty for other reasons, including a shorter sentence). Thus, the magistrate judge\u2019s comments do not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We affirm Mr. Wiles\u2019 convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
