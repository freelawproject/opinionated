The relationship between Spectrum Creations and Home Depot was governed by four contracts: (1) the Supplier Buying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Agreement (\u201cSBA\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a standard form contract governing Home Depot\u2019s relationship with each of its vendors; (2) an annual USA Rebate Agreement, requiring Spectrum Creations to pay a percentage discount based on actual annual sales; (3) an annual USA Marketing Agreement, requiring Spectrum Creations to pay a portion of Home Depot\u2019s annual marketing costs; and (4) the Exclusive Sales Agreement, giving Home Depot the exclusive right to sell Spectrum Creations\u2019s products in the pertinent market.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">After working with Home Depot for nearly twelve years, Spectrum Creations began struggling financially. Spectrum Creations ultimately stopped selling its products and terminated its relationship with Home Depot in May 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">In August 2010, Spectrum Creations filed this civil action against Home Depot. Briefly stated, Spectrum Creations alleged that, as a result of Home Depot\u2019s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations and to act in good faith, Spectrum Creations was forced out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The district court determined that Spectrum Creations\u2019s claims were barred by the SBA\u2019s one-year limitations period. In the alternative, the district court also determined that Spectrum Creations failed to provide sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Home Depot\u2019s alleged conduct caused Spectrum Creations to suffer actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law in favor of the moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 836-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">Under the SBA, Spectrum Creations \u201cagree[d] to bring any claim or dispute against The Home Depot (including payment disputes) within one year after the occurrence of the event giving rise to such dispute.\u201d Spectrum Creations does not dispute that the latest \u201cevent giving rise\u201d to its claims occurred in May 2009, when Spectrum Creations terminated its relationship with Home Depot. Because Spectrum Creations filed its complaint more than one year later, this case turns on whether Spectrum Creations\u2019s claims are governed by the SBA\u2019s one-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">Spectrum Creations contends that the SBA\u2019s limitations period applies only to disputes arising out of, or involving, the SBA and, thus, is limited to disputes involving purchase orders. Spectrum Creations argues that, because its claims arise out of Home Depot\u2019s breach of the Exclusive Sales Agreement, the USA Marketing Agreement, and the USA Rebate Agreement \u2014 not the SBA \u2014 the SBA\u2019s limitations period does not apply. We must disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">First, the plain language of the SBA\u2019s limitations period applies to \u201cany <em>claim or dispute </em>against The Home Depot.\u201d This language is \u201cbrief, unequivocal and all-encompassing.\u201d <em>See Brown v. ITT Consumer Fin. Corp., </em>211 F.3d 1217, 1221 (11th Cir.2000) (interpreting an agreement to arbitrate \u201cany dispute ... or claim\u201d to mean that \u201cthe parties agreed to arbitrate any and all claims against each other, with no exceptions.\u201d). Nothing in the SBA restricts the limitations period to disputes involving the SBA or purchase orders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>The language of the contractual limitations period is unambiguous. <em>See id. </em>(noting that the phrase \u201cany dispute\u201d \u201cis not vague solely because it includes the universe of the parties\u2019 potential claims against each other.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Second, the contractual agreements upon which Spectrum Creations\u2019s claims rely incorporate expressly the terms of the SBA. The Exclusive Sales Agreement says specifically that the parties intend for the Exclusive Sales Agreement to supplement the terms of the Vendor Buying Agreement (which was later superseded by the SBA). The USA Marketing Agreement and the USA Rebate Agreement also provide that purchases covered by those agreements will be governed by the SBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Based on this record, we conclude that each of the contractual agreements between Home Depot and Spectrum Creations incorporated the terms of the SBA and, thus, are governed by the SBA\u2019s limitations period. This conclusion is supported further by Home Depot\u2019s letter notifying Spectrum Creations that the USA Rebate Agreement, the USA Marketing Agreement, and the Exclusive Sales Agreement, \u201care hereby ratified and made part of the SBA....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Because Spectrum Creations\u2019s claims are governed by the SBA\u2019s limitations period and because Spectrum Creations filed its complaint more than one year after the occurrence of events giving rise to its causes of action, \u2019 the district court dismissed properly Spectrum Creations\u2019s claims as time-barred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-16\">. The district court determined \u2014 and Spectrum Creations does not challenge \u2014 that Spectrum Creations abandoned its claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and \"various cost and overpayment arguments.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">. Spectrum Creations and Home Depot first entered into a Vendor Buying Agreement which was superseded by the SBA in 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b753-10\">. Because we affirm on timeliness grounds, we need not address the district court\u2019s alternative determination that Spectrum Creations failed to present evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact about damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
