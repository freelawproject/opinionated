Ct. 507, 69 <em>L. </em>Ed \u2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b168-17\">EVAN A. EVANS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AgdV\">Plaintiff was convicted of violating section 2 of the Hours of Service Act (34 Stat. 1415 [Comp. St. \u00a7 8678]). The material portions of the act, so far as this case is concerned, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-18\">\u201cProvided, that no operator, train dispatcher, or other employee who by the use of the telegraph or telephone-dispatches, reports, transmits, receives, or delivers orders pertaining to or affecting train movements shall be required or permitted to be or remain on duty for a longer period than nine hours in any twenty-four hour period in all towers, offices, places, and stations continuously operated night and day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-19\">Two questions, the answers to which are determinative of liability, are: (a) Was defendant\u2019s yardmaster an \u201coperator, train dispatcher or other employee,\u201d within the meaning of the statute? (b) Were the telephone messages that he received or transmitted \u201corders,\u201d within the meaning , of the statute ?</p>\n<p id=\"b168-23\">The facts are not involved or controverted. The yardmaster in charge of the switching and movement of ears in the Chicago yards communicates with the Corwith ' towerman, a few miles distant, by telephone. The towerman\u2019s duties are various, but those material to this case are limited to those wherein he and the yardmaster cooperated in the movement of trains.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-24\">When the towerman wanted to send a train into the yards, he \u2019phoned the yardmaster over a wire used for that purpose and so informed him. If the tracks in the yards were sufficiently clear to admit the entry of the train, the yardmaster would reply, \u201cLet her come.\u201d If the tracks in the yard were full, the yardmaster would so advise the towerman, or, as illustrated in the record, he would say, \u201cLet her follow up No. 39.\u201d In sending out trains from the yards a similar practice prevailed. The yardmaster would advise the towerman over the \u2019phone that he had a train \u201cmade up\u201d ready to \u201cgo out.\u201d The towerman would reply, \u201cLet her come,\u201d or \u201cHold her until I get No. - out of the way,\u201d depending upon the condition of the tracks outside the yards, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-27\">Question (a) above stated must be answered in the affirmative, on the authority of Chicago, Rock Island &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. United States, 226 F. 27, 141 C. C. A. 135; Chicago &amp; Alton R. R. Co. v. United States, 244 F. 945, 157 C. C. A. 295; Chicago &amp; Alton R. R. Co. v. United States, 247 U. S. 197, 38 S. Ct. 442, 62 L. Ed. 1066. The holding of these eases is to the effect that the rule of ejusdem generis, does not apply to the construction of the words of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-28\">The real controversy is over question '(b) heretofore stated. The term \u201corder\u201d has been defined in United States v. H. B. &amp; T. Ry. Co., 205 F. 344, 125 C. C. A. 481, and with the conclusions there reached we agree. \u201cOrders,\u201d as used in this statute, should not be limited to train orders issuing from the train dispatcher\u2019s office. Neither should the term be restricted to orders reduced to writing. Orders may be given by one authorized so to do merely through the wave of a lantern, the movement of aims, or by the change of light in a signal station.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>There is a difference, as counsel for plaintiff in error points out, between giving orders and imparting information. This may be well illustrated in a switching operation in the night. The brakeman who makes the coupling may give information to the conductor by the swinging of Ms lantern. The conductor will then give a somewhat similar lantern signal to the engineer. Both of these signals are informative, but one is purely so, wMle the other is primarily an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The testimony in the present case does not permit of a conclusion which recognizes the communications that passed between the towormen and switchmen merely as information. The communications that were received or delivered over the telephone were \u201corders,\u201d wMch the receiving party was not at liberty to ignore. They dealt with the movement and operation of trains. Their form \u2014 whether in the nature of a command or worded as a request \u2014 -is not at all determinative of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">1 Our decision is based upon the conclusion we have reached respecting the nature and necessary effect of the directions which passed between these two employees of the company. We think they were \u201corders,\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
