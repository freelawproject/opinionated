The charter provided for 15 lay days for loading and 12 lay days for discharging, and for $250 per day demurrage. The vessel arrived at Axim on July 3, 1920, and her captain reported to the agent of the appellant that she would be ready to load cargo on July 5th, which was a Monday. The loading at Axim was completed on August 31st, and the master contended for 41 days\u2019 demurrage at $250 per day. After some controversy between the master and the agent of the appellant, a notation was made on the back of the bill of lading for the cargo in the- following language; \u201cLay days ended July 21, 1920. Demurrage commenced July 22, 1920. Loading completed August 31, 1920.\u201d The District Court rendered judgment in favor of the vessel for 41 days\u2019 demurrage, at $250 per day, aggregating the sum of $10,250, and allowed interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum from September 1, 1920, to the date of judgment. From that judgment this appeal is prosecuted. It is the contention of appellant that the District Court should have found) that the vessel was not seaworthy for the voyage, in that she was insufficiently equipped with loading tackle, and that the delay was caused by this alone. In support of this contention, the appellant relies upon a letter written by the captain to Wolf, appellant\u2019s agent at Axim, which would tend to show that the vessel had not sufficient equipment. The captain in his testimony explains the writing of the letter, \u2022 and, although additional equipment was furnished by the said agent, it also clearly appears that it was not needed, and it was not' used; the original equipment on the vessel b\u00e9ing sufficient. Appellant also seeks to evade the conclusion to be reached from the annotation on the bill of lading above referred to. We think the evidence fully sustains the judgment of the District Court, and that the judgment was right. Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
