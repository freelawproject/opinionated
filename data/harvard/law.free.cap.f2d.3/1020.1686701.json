This tax resulted from the government\u2019s theory that the plaintiff\u2019s legal reserve fund of $186,258,796 was not \u201cinvested capital,\u201d within the meaning of section 207 of the Income Tax Act of October 3, 19\u00cd7 (Comp. St. 1918, \u00a7 6336%h). In its return for the year 1917, the insurance company declared its invested capital to be $202,685,846.45, which included its legal reserve fund. In amending the return, the collector excluded this fund, and allowed only $14,719,043.76 as \u201cinvested capital.\u201d This made the plaintiff\u2019s per centum of income very high. It brought this suit to recover the excess profits tax, on the ground that its reserve fund was a part of its \u201cinvested capital.\u201d If this position is sound, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>would greatly decrease the rate of income. The defendant moved to strike out the complaint. In disposing' of this motion, Judge Rellstab held that the legal reserve fund was \u201cinvested capital,\u201d within the meaning of the act, and that the tax was assessed on the wrong basis. We are in accord with his conclusions, and affirm the judgment (295 F. 881) on his able opinion as expressing onr views.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
