This suit is to recover the damages caused by these practically simultaneous collisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">The masters of the three steam vessels involved promptly reported in writing to the local inspectors, and about four years later' two of them testified in open court as to the same matters; the master of the Scotia failed to appear. Our findings of fact are largely influenced by the discrepancies between the statements, separated by so long an interval of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">It is certain that Scotia was lying at the end of Pier 8, East River, head to the ebb tide, and started for Pier 38, Brooklyn; therefore, she went ahead under a port helm, intending to straighten \u2022 out after turning much more than 90 degrees. This maneuver would expose her, moving slowly and on no settled course, to everything coming up the river and near the pierhead line. Consequently the special circumstance rale applied to her. The John Rugge, 234 F. 861, 148 C. C. A. 459; The Newark (C. C. A.) 289 F. 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">When the Scotia was thus leaving Pier 8, Auburn with her tow and Pen\u00f3les unincum-bered were no further away than off the slip between Piers 6 and 7, coming up against the tide, and so near the pier head line that before Scotia got on her course for Pier 38, Brooklyn, Auburn\u2019s tow scraped her stem, and Pen\u00f3les struck just forward of the fantail. For the damage resulting the court below held both Auburn and Pe-n\u00f3les responsible, and both have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-16\">Determination of this matter plainly rests on ascertainment of what, if any, arrangements for clearing were made by signal, and how near the pier ends all parties were at and just before collision. Pen\u00f3les asserts that her speed was three knots, and Auburn was going enough faster to overtake and pass Pen\u00f3les \u25a0 on the latter\u2019s starboard side just before collision. Consequently the time between Scotia\u2019s leaving the pier and collision off the same pier (having regard to the known width of the slips) was certainly less than two minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-17\">As to distance out in the river, Auburn\u2019s report to inspectors declared that she was \u201cgoing up near the center of the East River.\u201d This is untrue, and the master did not repeat the statement in court, while his mate declared that the Scotia was no more than 150 or 200 feet out in the river just before collision. We find that she was certainly no more, and probably less, than that distance out, because, as Scotia lay right across the stream as Auburn\u2019s float passed up and seraped her, there was not enough room between her stem and the pier end for Pen\u00f3les to go clear. Scotia, when struck, was lying perfectly still and across the stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-18\">Auburn\u2019s master reported to the inspectors that he blew one whistle to Scotia, and received one in reply; he testified in court that he blew one whistle twice, and Scotia replied to his second signal, and his mate (on the ear float) declared that, when Auburn blew, Scotia was but 50 feet from the float. Pen\u00f3les\u2019 master reported that \u201csignal from Scotia was received and answered\u201d; but at trial this was changed to hearing one whistle from Scotia, which he concluded was for the Auburn, whereupon Pen\u00f3les stopped her engines.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-19\">Scotia\u2019s master reported that he blew two whistles to Pen\u00f3les, which answered with two, and stopped to let Auburn go by his bow, \u201cbeeaus'e it was evident I could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>cross Ms bow in safety.\u201d At the trial his deck hand denied that Scotia blew any whistles at all. Both witnesses and reports from the steam lighters assert that Auburn was \u201csqueezing in\u201d or \u201ccrowding\u201d toward the Manhattan shore, and for that reason scraped Scotia\u2019s bow with her car float, and prevented Scotia from giving room under her stern for Pen\u00f3les to pass between pier ends and said stem. Auburn\u2019s master did not know what was meant by the special circumstance rule, and regarded himself as obliged to hold Ms course and speed, because ho had Scotia on his port bow; as for Pen\u00f3les, he \u201cdid not notice her no time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">If, as above pointed out, the Scotia was affected by the rule of special circumstance, so were the other vessels. Where the Scotia was ajid what she was trying to do was apparent to both Pen\u00f3les and Auburn. All the craft were very near the Manhattan shore, and the probability of that happening which did happen was apparent as soon as Scotia started; i. e., that Scotia could not move fast enough to cross Auburn\u2019s bow, and, if she stopped, Pen\u00f3les could not go under her stern. Yet the latter boat did not stop her engines until collision was inevitable, and Auburn never noticed Pen\u00f3les, and therefore never knew how that lighter complicated the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Both the appellants were violating the East River statute, but we need not appeal to that law as a \u201ccontributing cause\u201d of collision (The Morristown [C. C. A.] 278 F. 714), but the reason for the violation was the bad custom of hugging the Manhattan shore to avoid the strength of the ebb (The Black Diamond [C. C. A.] 273 P. 811). If, however, we accept appellant\u2019s contention that violation of the statute was a condition and not a cause of collision, the rule of special circumstances still compels us to find that Scotia was at fault for leaving a place of safety without looking to see how she would block the way of vessels plainly visible, and for making no arrangements by signal <em>before </em>assuming a place of obvious danger, and Auburn at fault for failing to observe the plight of Pen\u00f3les, which she overtook and bottled up under Scotia\u2019s stern, and both Petioles and Auburn for not timely stopping and reversing, if necessary, in the face of the situation presented by Scotia\u2019s stopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Wo regard the evidence of Auburn\u2019s \u201ccrowding in\u201d to the Manhattan shore, as an optical illusion perhaps originating in the shape of the shore just below Pier 8; but the evidence, even when so explained, emphasizes how near all parties were to the shore, and the instant necessity of stopping when Scotia showed herself as an inevitable disturber of traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Decree reversed, with one bill of costs to appellants, and cause remanded, with direction to allocate damages in equal parts among the three parties to suit. Costs below to be similarly allocated.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b793-9\">LEARNED HAND, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ah2D\">(dissenting). I agree with the majority as regards the Scotia\u2019s fault; indeed, so heartily as to think that it leaves nothing more of the ease. I agree in discrediting the supposed crowding in of the Auburn. I agree that, though a vessel ignores the East River statute, she is not at fault unless her position is a \u201ccause\u201d and not a \u201ccondition\u201d of the collision. By that the books mean only this: That when the offending vessel has been seen in season, her position, though unlawful, is a fact with which all other vessels must reckon in their navigation. This rule is well settled in the decisions of tMs court under cases arising either on the East River statute or on the narrow channel rule. The Clara, 55 F. 1021, 5 C. C. A. 390; The Benjamin Franklin, 145 F. 13, 76 C. C. A. 43. La Bretagne, 179 F. 286, 102 C. C. A. 651; The No. 1, 180 F. 969, 104 C. C. A. 125; The Morristown, 278 F. 714. I do not understand that the purely maritime fault of hugging the pier ends is considered as in a different category.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">I dissent only on the facts, because I cannot see that the Auburn and the Pen\u00f3les should or could not have done anything else than they did in fact. The Auburn was so nearly opposite the Scotia\u2019s pier, when the latter made off, as to suppose, and -rightly suppose, that the Scotia would not try to cross her bows. The Scotia had no such purpose, as her wMstle and the navigation show. The Auburn did right to keep on at full speed; anything else would have made impossible any chance of success by the Scotia, which meant to go under her stern. To stop or reverse would have insured disaster. She is also held for bottling up the Pen\u00f3les. That would be fair enough if, when she passed the Pen\u00f3les, she had any intimation that the Scotia would try the crazy navigation which she did. That is the moment to take in judging her as respects the Pen\u00f3les, and no navigator ought to be hold to any such anticipation.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">The Pen\u00f3les is held for failing to stop and reverse in season, when she saw the Scotia\u2019s position. I acknowledge that the case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>not, so clear in her favor, but it seems to me clear enough, especially in the light of the wanton conduct of the Scotia. What that vessel tried to do on her own confession was to swing' out under a port helm and thread her way under the stem of the Auburn and aeross the bows of the Pen\u00f3les. I cannot conceive more reckless navigation, and I should be slow to charge any other vessel in the face of it. Yet, even so, since the collision of the Pen\u00f3les was near the Scotia\u2019s fantail, the Scotia nearly succeeded in crossing her bows. The reason why she did not altogether succeed was that, in the very midst of her maneuver the Scotia stopped her engines under the very nose of the Pen\u00f3les. This she had to do, because she could not otherwise go under the Auburn\u2019s stem. Now I must own it appears to me wholly unwarranted to charge a vessel because she did not foresee such an unexpected change of plan and stop sooner. She had the right to assume that the Scotia would go on with what she tried, or at least would not stop in her path. I attribute the whole collision to the failure of the Scotia to see the Pen\u00f3les at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The libel should be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
