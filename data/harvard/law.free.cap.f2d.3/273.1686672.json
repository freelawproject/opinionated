There is no. evidence of any protest either against the entry or the'taking of the literature. No demand was ever made for its return, and no objection was made to \u2018its introduction or use in evidence. The alien had been in this country nine years, and that he understood. what he was doing is quite evident. He had the literature for the purpose of distribution, for which he was compensated, and he had already distributed considerable ' of such literature. He had bought and paid for, and had in his possession, organization stamps' and stamps for dues in the Communistic party. In his room there were numerous books. On cross-examination by alien\u2019s attorney, the .government\u2019s agent was asked: \u201cWas there anything about most of the other books that you would consider illegal? A. Well, he was pretty well posted himself. He told me Those books are legal and those books illegal.\u2019 He knew the difference between the books himself.\u201d \" There was abundant evidence to justify the deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"a0c-dedup-0\">It \u25a0 appears from the record that' in such a proceeding blank forms to fit many conditions are used, and that .there was no effort to make the changes that would cause the blanks to fit the ease in hand. The Supreme Court has said In Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U. S. 149, 158, 44 S. Ct. 54, 57, 68 L. Ed. 221:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\u201cIf sufficient ground for his detention by the government is shown, he is not to be discharged' for defects in the original arrest or commitment\u201d \u2014 citing Nishimura Ekiu v. U. S., 142 U. S. 651, 662, 12 S. Ct. 336, 35 L. Ed. 1146; Iasigi v. Van de Carr, 166 U. S. 391, 17 S. Ct. 595, 41 L. Ed. 1045; Stallings v. Splain, 253 U. S. 339, 343, 40 S. Ct. 537, 64 L.
