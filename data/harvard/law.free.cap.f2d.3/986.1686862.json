Just prior to the accident, which happened at 9:15 p. m., the engine in charge of this crew had pulled out a ear loaded with freight for intrastate delivery, from a train consisting largely of interstate traffic ears. The accident, a collision, happened while this engine was pushing this single ear ahead towards track No. 2. The conductor had received orders to have it put over the hump onto the so-called Panhandle classification track No. 2, whereon cars were placed at any time during the day and night. The cars so placed were gathered into a train that left once in 24 hours, ordinarily between 8 :30 p. m. and midnight, for- another classification yard 10 miles away. There they were to be reclassified and allocated to Panhandle trains to be hauled to their ultimate destinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">But for the wreck, the ear would have gone over the hump onto No. 2 track and become part of the train which pulled out at 12:30 a. m. for the 10-mile run, with 43 ears, many destined to points in other states. While the yardmaster could not testify positively which, if any, of these ears were on track No. 2 at 9:15 p. m., he did testify that some were undoubtedly there; that they were classifying cars at all hours of the day and night.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-21\">In these circumstances, the deceased, in our judgment, was, at the time of the collision, engaged in work so closely related to interstate commerce as to be practically a part of it. See Shanks v. Railroad Co., 239 U. S. 556, 558, 36 S. Ct. 188, 60 L. Ed. 436, L. R. A. 1916C, 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-22\">We reach this conclusion, not because the car in question had been a part of an interstate train before it was drilled out or because it was expected, after its ultimate allocation, to be a part of a 'train hauling it with interstate cars to their ultimate destination, but because at the very moment of the collision it was moving towards track No. 2 for the very purpose of forming part of a once in 24 hours train, to depart within a few hours, ordinarily and when it so departed in fact hauling cars some of which were in interstate transportation. For' as to such cars every movement, whether a switch within one yard or between two clas-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>sifieation yards, or a haul either from the point of origin or to the point of destination, forms a part of the entire interstate transportation. And railroad employees engaged in the act of moving an intrastate ear for the very purpose of causing it to become part of such a train participate in, further, and facilitate the interstate work. See Davis, Agt., v. Dowling (C. C. A. 6) 284 F. 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
