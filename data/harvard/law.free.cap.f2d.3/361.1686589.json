The defendant demurred to the complaint. The District Judge overruled the demurrer and gave judgment for the plaintiff. The case was thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-17\">The defendant died on March 24, 1917, and the plaintiff, his administratrix, filed an income tax return for the period of her administration in that year, from March 26th to December 31st, deducting the inheritance tax paid to the state of New York, which extinguished the whole income. The deduction was disallowed, and the plaintiff was taxed $30,985.53, which she was forced to. pay. For the purposes of the ease it is agreed that all the intestate\u2019s estate may be regarded as personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-18\">Section 2 (b) of the federal Revenue Act of 1916 (Comp. St. \u00a7 6336b) declares that the income of decedent\u2019s estates shall be subject to the income tax \u201cand taxed to their estates ::: :i: ' to be assessed to the executor or administrator.\u201d Section 5 (Comp. St. \u00a7 6336e) of the same act provides that \u201cin computing the net income in the case of a citizen or resident of the United States\u201d there may be deducted \u201ctaxes paid within the year imposed \u2018 * 8 by the authority of any state,\u201d which must mean imposed on the citizen in question. Since there is no special section providing for deductions allowed to decedent\u2019s estates, this section must cover these as well as living persons. As section 2 (b) assesses the tax against tho executor personally, he is the \u201ccitizen or resident\u201d of section 5 who may deduct the state tax. The case at bar therefore turns on whether the Now York inheritance tax is \u201cimposed\u201d on him. At least, if it is so imposed, section 5 covers him. That is a question of Now York law, and we are bound by the decisions of the New York Court of Appeals on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-23\">The New York inheritance tax is imposed by section 220 of the Tax Law (Consol. Laws.N. Y. c. 60) on \u201cthe transfer of property.\u201d This is ambiguous in respect of its incidence, but section- 224 enacts that the tax shall be \u201ca lien upon the properly transferred * * * and the executors * \" 8 of every estate so transferred shall be personally liable for such tax until its payment.\u201d We think that in principle under this provision the tax is \u201cimposed\u201d on the executor, and that it was so ruled in Home Trust Co. v. Law, 204 App. Div. 590, 198 N. Y. S. 710, affirmed in <em>236 </em>N. Y. 607, 142 N. E. 303. There the New York inheritance tax was allowed as a deduction from the New York income tax upon a decedent\u2019s estate, under section 360 (subdivision 2), which follows verbatim section 5 of the federal Revbnue Act of 1916. Section 365 (subdivision 2) of the New York Income Tax Law requires the executor to make <em>the </em>return, and section 369 makes him \u201csubject to all the provisions of this article which apply to taxpayers,\u201d one of which (section 351-b), makes the tax a debt against the taxpayer. While the Court , of Appeals wrote no opinion, it seems to us necessary to-assume that they regarded the inheritance-tax as \u201cimposed\u201d under section 360 (subdivision 2), because that was the only section whien allowed the deduction. If so \u201cimposed,\u201d it must be a duty in personam, because the income tax, as has been shown, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>a debt, and the inheritance tax, in form also a debt, could not well be deducted unless it was a debt likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Our own decision in Prentiss v. Eisner, 267 F. 16, following U. S. v. Perkins, 163 U. S. 625, 16 S. Ct. 1073, 41 L. Ed. 287, compels the same conclusion. There we held that a legatee might not deduct the New York inheritance tax from his income tax. If neither he nor the executor may do so, the tax must be solely in rem, a conclusion effectively answered by section 224 above quoted. The \u2019defendant insists that the' contrary is true, the New York inheritance tax being levied on one entity, and the federal income tax on another; each being an \u201cestate\u201d of the decedent differently conceived. It is true that the language of the statutes is not wholly clear, but we prefer to follow the customary categories while that course is left open to us. An executor is vested with the personalty of the decedent, and here we are dealing only with personalty. While it is true that the New York inheritance tax is made a lien, that may well-be only for security, and in any event personal taxes normally create duties in personam, and the executor or administrator is the natural person on whom to levy them.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">U. S. v. Woodward, 256 U. S. 635, 41 S. Ct. 615, 65 L. Ed. 1131, in effect holds the same thing. There the question was whether the federal inheritance tax was deductible from income under section 214 of the act of 1918 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 6336%g), which was the same as section 5 of the act of 1916. The federal inheritance tax was by section 201 of the act of 1916 (Comp. St. \u00a7 6336%b) imposed upon the transfer of the \u201cnet estate of every decedent.\u201d By section 205 (Comp. St. \u00a7 6336%f), the executor must file the return, by section 207 (Comp. St. \u00a7 6336%h) he must pay the tax, and by section 209 (Comp. St. \u00a7 6336% j) it is made a lien. Thus the federal inheritance tax is like the New York inheritance tax, unless there is a difference between section 207 of the act of 1916 and section 224 of the New York Tax Law. We think that to say that the executor \u201cshall pay\u201d the tax is the same thing as to say that he shall be \u201cpersonally liable\u201d for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">N. Y. Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U. S. 350, 41 S. Ct. 506, 65 L. Ed. 963, 16 A. L. R. 660, held that the New York inheritance tax was not a deduction in calculating the federal inheritance tax. That ease turned on the meaning of section 203 (a) (1) of the act of 1916 (Comp. St. \u00a7 6336%d), especially the words \u201csuch other charges against the estate as are allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction * * * under which the estate is being administered.\u201d It is quite true that the reason given was that inheritance taxes were \u201ctaxes on the right of individual beneficiaries,\u201d and for that reason not \u201ccharges that affect the estate as a whole.\u201d Literally the first clause quoted contradicts U. S. v. Perkins, supra, but'the eases may be reconciled by understanding that the \u201ccharges\u201d intended are only such as are imposed on the executor as successor stricti juris, like the income tax itself, and not such as arise because he must distribute the estate, as is the inheritance tax. There was reason to impute such a distinction to Congress, since the income tax is collected yearly, while the inheritance tax is levied once and for all. Both sovereigns might well insist upon an exaction on the whole estate for the privilege of its transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">We express no opinion as to the result in the eases of realty, where the executor is not the successor, or even in the ease of specific legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
