St. (Comp. St. \u00a7 9772). Those travelers\u2019 checks were in the form following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-23\">\u201cTravelers\u2019 Check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-24\">\u201cSignature of Holder No. C65321.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-25\">\n<em>u</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-26\">\u201cThe National City Bank of New York through its correspondents as per accompanying list</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-27\">\u201c50 Will pay to the order of.........50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-28\">\u201cWhen not negotiated in the United States, this check is to be converted into local currency at the current buying rate for bankers cheeks on New York</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-29\">\u201cFifty Dollars United States Currency</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-30\">\u201cWhen countersigned with the signature of the holder as shown above</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-31\">\u201cThe National City Bank of New York \u201cCountersignature</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-32\">\n<em>a</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-33\">\u201cThis signature must agree with that of the holder as shown above</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-34\">\u201cJ. A. Stillman, President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-35\">\u201cW. H. Tappan, Cashier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-36\">On the reverse side of which travelers\u2019 cheek was the following directory matter, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-37\">\u201cWherever presented this cheek is to be considered as a draft on the National City Bank of Now York, New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-38\">\u201cIn countries where revenue stamps are required the amount of same is to be paid by the holder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-39\">These forms were deposited with the First National Bank of Ardmore, Okl., under an arrangement that made the depository responsible therefor and gave to it a stated commission for handling and issuing the cheeks to customers. The indictment charged (in a separate count as to each cheek) that Theobald \u201cabstracted\u201d the cheeks from the \u201cfunds and credits\u201d belonging to the Ardmore Bank and thereafter transferred and put them in circulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-40\">The first point here urged is that the indictment is duplicitous because it charges that accused embezzled, abstracted, and willfully misapplied the travelers\u2019 chocks whereas each one of these acts is a different of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>fense. This objection is not well 'taken because the gravamen of this charge is the abstraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">It.is also contended that the indictment is defective because it does not charge that accused did these things \u201cwithout the authority from the directors.\u201d The charge in the indictment is that the acts were done \u201cwithout the knowledge or consent of the said National Banking Association or any person authorized to give such consent, and with the unlawful, fraudulent and felonious intent of him, the said Paul Ernest Theo-bald, to convert and appropriate the said cheek and the proceeds to be derived from the transfer and sale of same to his own use and benefit, and to permanently deprive the First National Bank of Ardmore of the said check and of the value thereof. * * * \u201d This is certainly. sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">It is contended that these travelers\u2019 cheeks were not \u201cmoney, funds, or credits\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We think \u201ccredits,\u201d within the act, include papers intended to represent and which could perform and were intended to perform the function of credits. \u2022 Such was the character of these travelers\u2019 cheeks. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The last point is that there was no evidence that the accused \u201cabstracted\u201d these cheeks. There was evidence that he did abscond and that he had.cashed these checks; also that he was employed in the bank and might have access to these checks. We think this is evidence of abstraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The judgment should be and is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
