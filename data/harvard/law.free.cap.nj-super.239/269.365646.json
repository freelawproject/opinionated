Plaintiffs, Daniel and Marcia Burke, were the owners of adjoining property known as 8 Hillcrest Avenue. On that date, a large white oak tree growing on Briggs\u2019 property suddenly fell over onto the Burkes\u2019 property, causing extensive damage to their garage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The Burkes were insured<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for such an occurrence and the insurance company sent a representative to inspect the cause of the damage to the premises. He noted that the base of Briggs\u2019 tree \u201chad apparently been treated by a tree surgeon\u201d as a result of \u201csome disease or carpenter ants\u201d activity, but that it otherwise \u201cappeared to be perfectly healthy\u201d. Other than that, there appeared no reason for the tree to have fallen. However, Briggs denied that the tree had ever been treated by anyone or that he had any prior knowledge of the condition which caused the tree to suddenly fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The original complaint in this action asserted a claim against defendant based on negligence but was later amended to assert a second count reciting the elements of a nuisance. Plaintiff then moved for summary judgment on the liability aspect, contending that defendant was \u201cstrictly liable\u201d for the damages caused by the fallen tree because it amounted to a \u201cnuisance.\u201d The defendant resisted by asserting that liability should be determined on the basis of traditional negligence principles of tort liability and arguing that summary judgment was therefore inappropriate. Relying on <em>D\u2019Andrea v. Guglietta, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 504 A.2d 1196 (App.Div.1986), the trial judge reasoned that the fallen tree constituted a \u201cnuisance\u201d because defendant had failed to use his property in a manner that \u201cdoes not damage or unreasonably interfere with the use of an adjacent land owner\u2019s property.\u201d He further concluded that such a nuisance \u201cimposes a strict liability\u201d and granted summary judgment to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Our research reveals no New Jersey case factually on point. Therefore, we look to the logic, policy and rationale which underlies similar cases in this and other jurisdictions, the <em>Restatement of the Law, Torts </em>2d, and the applicable principles enunciated by recognized authorities in the field. <em>Cf. Berger v. Shapiro, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>89, 96-99, 152 A.2d 20 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">There has arisen a distinction between conditions of land artificially created as opposed to those which come into existence naturally. 4 <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d \u00a7 839 at 161. \u201cThe former are actionable (cit. omitted); the latter are not.\u201d <em>D'Andrea v. Guglietta, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 36, 504 A.2d 1196. In this regard, it has been held that the planting of a tree which causes damage to adjoining premises is not a natural condition. <em>Id. </em>at 36-37, 504 A.2d 1196. Under such distinction, the damages suffered by plaintiffs in this case could be \u201cactionable\u201d against defendant if it were presumed or proven that he or some predecessor in title may have planted the tree in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Some of the cases concerning the question of liability turn on whether the incident lends itself to identification as a nuisance, a trespass or some other type of intrusion. However, we question the soundness of this approach in a modern day society.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">It has been observed, that \u201c[t]here is perhaps no more impenetrable jungle in the entire law than that which surrounds the word \u2018nuisance\u2019 \u201d <em>Prosser and Keeton, The Law of Torts, </em>(5th Ed.1984), \u00a7 86 at 616. All of the authorities, however, seem to agree that a private nuisance is based on one\u2019s interference with another\u2019s use and enjoyment of land. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 87 at 619. On the other hand, the trespass to land concept has also been applied to cover situations where the actor interferes with one\u2019s enjoyment of his land. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 13 at 67-84. The distinction between nuisance and trespass \u201chas become wavering and uncertain\u201d and has often led to results that are difficult to explain. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 87 at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In 4 <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, introductory note to Chapter 4, at 84-85, private nuisance is used to describe \u201cthe invasion of the private interest in the use and enjoyment of land.\u201d \u201cTrespass on land\u201d as used in that work, however, also means \u201centries on land resulting directly or indirectly from the actors act [and] also the presence on the land of a thing which it is the actor\u2019s duty to remove.\u201d 1 <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, Chapter 7, Topic 1, <em>Intentional Entries on Land, </em>at 276. The <em>Restatement </em>attempts to distinguish between those two legal concepts by further defining a private nuisance as, \u201ca <em>nontrespassing invasion </em>of another\u2019s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 4 <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 821 D, at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Applying those concepts in this case still does not result in strict liability. With respect to a private nuisance, the <em>Restatement </em>indicates,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u00a7 822 General Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">One is subject to liability for a private nuisance if, but only if, his conduct is a legal cause of an invasion of another\u2019s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land, and the invasion is either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">(a) intentional and unreasonable, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(b) unintentional and otherwise actionable under the rules controlling liability for negligent or reckless conduct, or for abnormally dangerous conditions or activities. <em>[Id. </em>at 108].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">On the other hand, if the conduct in question is labelled a trespass, the <em>Restatement </em>still maintains the distinction between intentional, ultrahazardous and accidental intrusions. 1 <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7\u00a7 158, 165 and 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">As to the latter, which seems to best fit this case, it provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-1\">\u00a7 166. Non-liability for Accidental Intrusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">Except where the actor is engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity, <em>an unintentional and non-negligent entry on land </em>in the possession of another, or causing a thing or third person to enter the land, does not subject the actor to liability to the possessor, even though the entry causes harm to the possessor or to a thing or third person in whose security the possessor has a legally protected interest. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">Thus, neither the theory of nuisance or trespass would result in the application of such absolute liability here, under <em>Restatement </em>principles. Moreover, the imposition of such strict or absolute liability for the conduct complained of here is basically unfair and inappropriate. <em>Cf. Jackson v. Muhlenberg Hosp. et al, </em>96 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314, 321, 232 A.2d 879 (App.Div.1967), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 53 <em>N.J. </em>138, 249 A.2d 65 (1969). <em>Prosser and Keeton, supra, </em>at 536-538. Such liability without fault should not be imposed, whether that activity be classified as a nuisance or a trespass, absent intentional or hazardous activity requiring a higher standard of care or, as a result of some compelling policy reason. <em>See State, Dept. of Environ. Protect. v. Ventron Corp., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>473, 468 A.2d 150 (1983), for a discussion of imposition of strict liability principles for conducting abnormally dangerous activities on land. Applying these principles to <em>D Andrea, supra, </em>we question the application of the \u201cstrict liability\u201d concept there.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">Whatever the ramifications of principles discussed might be in another given situation, we are satisfied that, in the context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>of this case, \u201c[t]he process of adjudication requires recognition of the reciprocal rights of each owner to reasonable use, and a balancing of the conflicting interests.\u201d <em>Sans v. Ramsey Golf &amp; Country Club, Inc., </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>438, 449, 149 A.2d 599 (1959). As such, liability should not be imposed without proof of some negligence or unreasonable activity by the defendant. <em>Gellenthin v. J. &amp; D., Inc., </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>341, 352-353, 184 A.2d 857 (1962); <em>State v. Exxon Corporation, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>464, 482-484, 376 A.2d 1339 (Ch.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In other words, regardless of the analysis one might urge and the consequent label attached, be it nuisance, trespass or negligence, the issue here should logically depend on whether the offending landowner somehow has made a negligent or unreasonable use of his land when compared with the rights of the party injured on the adjoining lands. <em>Sans v. Ramsey Golf &amp; Country Club, Inc., </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>at 449, 149 A.2d 599. <em>See generally Melnick v. C.S.X. Corp., </em>68 <em>Md.App. </em>107, 510 A.2d 592, aff\u2019d, 312 <em>Md. </em>511, 540 A.2d 1133 (Md.App.1988) for a discussion of the applicability of nuisance, trespass and negligence theories to this area. <em>See </em>1 <em>Am.Jur.2d, Adjoining Landowners, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7-11, at 696-700, for a discussion of the various theories of liability applied in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We therefore hold that the ultimate question for the trier of facts to determine in such a case, is one of negligence or reasonableness, absent the previously noted exceptions for intentional or abnormally dangerous activities. 3 <em>Dooley, Modern Tort Law, </em>\u00a7 40.11, at 279-280; <em>Prosser and Keeton, supra, Owners and Occupiers of Land, </em>\u00a7 57 (see the discussions under the title, Natural Conditions) pages 390-391; 2 <em>C.J.S. Adjoining Landowners, </em>\u00a7 58-67; 1 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Adjoining Landowners, </em>\u00a7 25 at 708; 54 <em>A.L.R. </em>4th, <em>Liability\u2014Fall Of Tree Or Limb, </em>530 (1987). We do not regard the principles in <em>D\u2019Andrea </em>as controlling because of the unusual nature of the intrusion in that case. There, the defendant landowner had planted a tree near the property line and could be charged with knowledge that the roots inevitably would grow onto his neigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>bor\u2019s property. The roots then surreptitiously caused damage over a period of years. <em>Contra, Chandler v. Larson, </em>148 Ill.App.3d 1032, 102 Ill.Dec. 691, 500 <em>N.E.2d </em>584 (Ill.App. 1 Dist.1986), (where the court held the offending landowner only to a duty of reasonable care in such circumstances.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">To repeat, the focus in this case should be on whether this defendant was negligent in not making a reasonable use of his property. Such a determination merits a consideration of the various attendant circumstances and factors such as, the nature of the incident, the danger presented by the presence of the tree, whether Briggs, by making inspections, could or should have known of its condition, what steps he could have taken to prevent it from falling onto plaintiffs\u2019 property, etc. <em>Ivancic v. Olmstead, </em>66 <em>N.Y.2d </em>349, 497 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>326, 488 <em>N.E.2d </em>72, (App.Div.1985), <em>cert. </em>den., 476 <em>U.S. </em>1117, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1975, 90 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>658 (1986); <em>Narsh v. Zirbser Brothers, Inc., </em>111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>203, 208-209, 268 A.2d 46 (App.Div.1970); <em>Prosser and Keeton, supra, </em>at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In light of these observations, it also appears that even the distinction between natural and artificial conditions might now be considered anachronistic as a basis for determining actionability. In these circumstances the focus should be solely on one\u2019s duty of reasonable care which may shift, depending on the changing factors previously noted. <em>Sprecher v. Adamson Companies, </em>30 Cal.3d 358, 178 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>783, 636 P.2d 1121 (Cal.1981). <em>Cf. Turner v. Coppola, </em>102 <em>Misc.2d </em>1043, 424 N.Y.S.2d 864, 866 (Sup.Ct.1980); <em>Phillips v. Sun Oil Co., </em>307 <em>N.Y. </em>328, 121 <em>N.E.2d </em>249 (Ct. of App.N.Y.1954). The essential inquiry of reasonable or unreasonable use should depend on the circumstances of each case and not on whether it was a \u201cnatural or artificial condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Since the issue of reasonable care by defendant was the proper standard to be used, unquestionably such an issue here was for the jury to determine and was therefore, inappropriate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ly disposed of by summary judgment. <em>Weller v. McCormick, 52 N.J.L. </em>470, 473, 19 <em>A. </em>1101 (Sup.Ct.1890).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-11\">The amount of damages is not in dispute, having been established at $7,900.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-12\">The fact that this is a subrogation suit obviously has no bearing on the issue herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
