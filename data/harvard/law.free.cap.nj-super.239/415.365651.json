Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Although the parties agree that the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d delayed accrual of plaintiff\u2019s claim against the doctor until sometime after he had last treated her, they do not agree on the date of accrual. This appeal requires us to consider whether an attorney has the duty to investigate the basis for a client\u2019s medical malpractice claim, and the scope of his duty to protect the client from the statute of limitations where the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d applies. We must also consider whether plaintiff\u2019s claims were properly given to the jury even though she presented no expert legal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Plaintiff sustained a complete and comminuted fracture of the left humerus when she fell in her home on May 17, 1981. The indicated treatment, as described by plaintiff\u2019s medical expert Dr. Robert Tuby, calls for aligning the fractured ends of the bone and joining the fragments through open reduction surgery, and fixing them in place with a combination of pins and a plate held in place with screws. Instead of using that procedure, Dr. Shafi treated plaintiff in the emergency room of a hospital by simply placing her arm in a hanging cast. The fractured ends never united. In time it became too late medically to correct the poor result.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Dr. Shafi conceded at trial that the procedure he used was \u201csecond-best,\u201d but testified that plaintiff refused to undergo an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>open reduction. However, plaintiff and two of her adult daughters, who accompanied her whenever she visited Dr. Shafi, testified that the doctor did not offer the option of an open reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The jury specially found that Dr. Shafi did not \u201cadvise plaintiff, Norma Brizak, of the need to undergo surgery for her left arm.\u201d Defendant\u2019s medical witness, Dr. Albert Willner, expressed the opinion that Dr. Shafi did not deviate from accepted standards of medical care. However, he rested his opinion on the assumption, which the jury rejected, that the doctor had advised plaintiff \u201cof the type of injury and that she did not wish to have any other treatment rendered to her except that of a cast application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The issue in the medical malpractice claim was therefore not whether Dr. Shafi departed from an accepted standard of medical care, but simply whether he advised plaintiff to undergo an open reduction. Until the facts were investigated, however, neither plaintiff nor defendant could have surmised that the ultimate issue would merely be credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The issue in the legal malpractice claim was whether, after being engaged by plaintiff to represent her, defendant diligently investigated the facts so that he could have commenced a timely action against the doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Dr. Shafi last treated plaintiff for the fractured humerus on July 10, 1981. Over a year later, on September 3, 1982, plaintiff\u2019s hip was severely fractured when she was a passenger in a one-car accident. The same Dr. Shafi set the hip through an open reduction. About two months later, defendant was at plaintiff\u2019s home to consult with her adult son, whom he was representing in a matrimonial matter. While there he first met plaintiff who was still on crutches. She told him of her automobile accident and engaged him to represent her in an action against the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">During that conversation with defendant, plaintiff mentioned that she was still suffering from the effects of the broken arm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>She complained that she could not raise the arm above the level of her shoulder. The date of that conversation, sometime toward the end of October 1982, forms the basis of the allegation in the complaint that the limitations period for suing the doctor expired on November 1, 1984. However, plaintiff did not sign an agreement to retain defendant respecting her claim against the doctor until December 5, 1983, about the same time that defendant reached a settlement of plaintiff\u2019s automobile accident claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Defendant assigned the malpractice matter to an associate who had been handling plaintiff\u2019s automobile accident claim. The associate had previously learned from Dr. Shafi that plaintiff was suffering the effects of an unhealed fractured humerus. Dr. Shafi had sent the associate a final medical report of plaintiff\u2019s hip injury, dated November 8, 1983, in which he noted that he had treated plaintiff for a fractured humerus until July 10, 1981, \u201cat which time the fracture had not fully healed and a delayed union was considered.\u201d Elsewhere in the report the doctor included \u201cNonunion fracture proximal humerus, left\u201d in his description of plaintiff\u2019s physical condition when he last saw her on September 15, 1983. The file that defendant opened for plaintiff\u2019s claim against the doctor contains an early entry, apparently in the associate\u2019s hand, that reads, \u201cHanging cast instead of a pin.\u201d The associate did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">It thus appears that early in his representation of plaintiff, defendant, or at least his associate, knew that plaintiff\u2019s fractured humerus had not healed under Dr. Shafi\u2019s treatment and that the bad result may have had something to do with the doctor\u2019s use of a hanging cast instead of pins to fix the fracture. Defendant\u2019s office did little to investigate these indications that Dr. Shafi\u2019s treatment was malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The first action defendant took after plaintiff retained him in December 1983 was to send the hospital a letter dated May 31, 1984, requesting a copy of the complete record of her emergency room treatment in May 1981 for the fractured humerus. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The hospital sent defendant a copy of the record, including an X-ray report but not the X-rays themselves. Defendant made no further attempt to obtain the X-rays, which were in Dr. Shafi\u2019s possession. When asked why he did not obtain the doctor\u2019s office records, defendant testified that the emergency room records were all he needed because \u201cthe treatment that was involved, that is the procedure, took place at the hospital.\u201d The doctor\u2019s office records included not only the X-rays but an entry dated July 10, 1981, in which he noted that he had discussed with plaintiff\u2019s daughter the need for an open reduction because of the \u201ccompletely displaced fracture.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">After receiving the hospital records in June 1984, defendant did nothing more until March 1985 when he visited Dr. Michael Och, a long-time friend, at his home and obtained his oral opinion. Dr. Och is a radiologist and not an orthopedic surgeon. Although acknowledging that it would be \u201ca deviation from accepted standards of medical practice not to review the X-rays or consult with a radiologist before making a diagnosis and making a recommendation for treatment,\u201d Dr. Och testified that all he needed to judge Dr. Shafi\u2019s treatment was the X-ray report that defendant had shown him. That report reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">RIGHT HUMERUS [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">E 1195</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">Views of the right humerus in the AP and lateral projection shows a comminuted fracture of the right humeral neck with the humeral shaft distal to the fracture fragment being directed slightly superiorly. In addition, there appears to be a rotatory component to the humeral head.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] No obvious dislocation is seen. 5-19-81 B. TERRY, M.D./mve</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>After examining the report and considering the treatment noted in the emergency room record, Dr. Och advised defendant that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see any apparent reason for any deviation from normal.\u201d Dr. Och testified that having followed fractures of the humerus for many years, \u201cmost of the cases that I have seen have been treated with hanging casts.\u201d However, on cross-examination he acknowledged,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">I do not have any experience with open reduction. I have seen X-rays with metallic fixation devices and I assume they are used properly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">When defendant was asked on cross-examination whether he consulted any of the services that review medical records to evaluate medical malpractice claims and provide expert testimony if warranted, he testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">Q. Did you avail yourself of that service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">A. Once I knew there was indeed a basis for medical malpractice, I would consider it. I would consider it. Although I might say that there have been some other medical malpractice cases where I tested that type of service and I was very sorrowly disappointed with the way they tried to analyze the problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">Q. Now, you have testified that you know it\u2019s difficult to obtain medical testimony in a malpractice case, is it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">A. I think that\u2019s a fair statement, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-11\">Q. And you testified that most doctors don\u2019t want to get involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-12\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-13\">Q. But there are physicians, are there not, that do evaluate malpractice cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-15\">Q. And they are a group separate and distinct from those doctors, majority of doctors who do not want to get involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-16\">A. My experience has been that the best witness is not a professional witness that goes to court all the time and rarely, if ever, practices in their specialty. My experience has been when you\u2019ve got a legitimate doctor who\u2019s involved in every day taking care of people and is willing to go to court because of what another doctor did to a patient, that\u2019s your best type of witness, and I would prefer that type of witness any day of the week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-17\">Q. Isn\u2019t it true, Mr. Needle, that in the practice of law, in the handling and prosecution of medical malpractice cases, that doctors do not want to testify against one another; isn\u2019t that so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-18\">A. Generally that is true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-19\">About a month after his March 1985 conversation with Dr. Och, defendant suggested to plaintiff that she consult a physician of her choice about her arm, without disclosing to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>physician that she was seeking an opinion about a possible medical malpractice action. When plaintiff asked defendant to suggest a doctor, he indiscriminately selected from the New Jersey Medical Society Directory the names of three, in his words, \u201corthopedic specialists\u201d who practiced near her. She chose one of them, Dr. Michael Silverstein. Defendant\u2019s handwritten office note to the file, dated May 7, 1985, recounts the following telephone conversation with plaintiff regarding her appointment with Dr. Silverstein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">Dr. M. Silverstein\u2014ortho\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">New Brunswick NJ</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-i\">Appt for 5/9/85 11:30 AM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnJ\">but need X-rays fr Dr. Shafi\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">plf called Dr. Shafi for X-rays &amp; was <em>told\u2014no </em>except if plf pd $50 for a <em>copy </em>of X-rays</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">She\u2019ll see Dr. Silverstein <em>w/o </em>the X-rays\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">[Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Defendant made a memo to the file of a later telephone conversation that he had with Dr. Silverstein. The entry notes that although Dr. Silverstein believed that there was a \u201cpoor result,\u201d in his opinion Dr. Shafi\u2019s treatment did not constitute malpractice. During that conversation the doctor told defendant that he knew Dr. Shafi personally. Dr. Silverstein did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">In the following testimony defendant summed up his entire investigation from December 1983 when he was formally retained until May 1985 when he spoke to Dr. Silverstein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">Q. What facts did you get aside from the emergency room record, what facts did you get?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-14\">A. I got the opinion of Dr. Och, and then later the opinion of Dr. Silverstein. Those are facts to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">Defendant qualified himself at trial as an expert \u201cin the practice of law as it relates to personal injury matters\u201d with particular \u201cexperience and knowledge in the area of medical malpractice.\u201d Testifying as an expert, defendant gave the following testimony on direct examination as to why he properly refrained from commencing an action against Dr. Shafi:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlO2\">Q. And did you file a medical malpractice case against Dr. Shafi?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-16\">A. Absolutely not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Q. Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">A. Because I didn\u2019t think it was ethical for me with the information I had from at least two doctors indicating that Dr. Shafi did nothing wrong that I should sue the man. Why should I in any way create a stigma for him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">Q. You said that you didn\u2019t think it was ethical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">A. That\u2019s right. There\u2019s a provision in the Professional Code of Ethics for Attorneys that an attorney has a duty not to file a frivolous suit or a suit without any basis. I don\u2019t know the specific citation but I know there is something in there to that effect and I\u2019ve been practicing too long to tar myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">Q. Based on your 30 years of experience, your handling the Grosbard malpractice case <em>[Buckelew v. Grosbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981) ],<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the fact that Mrs. Brizak did not articulate any reason why she thought there was malpractice, and your having spoken to Dr. Och and Silverstein, do you feel it was a departure on your part not to have filed a suit on behalf of Mrs. Brizak?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">A. There was absolutely no departure. I think what I did was the proper thing to do. If another attorney had come to me and asked me the same question, what should I do, I have no\u2014I would have advised him the same way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">In a memo to the file dated June 28, 1985, defendant noted that he had told plaintiff over the telephone that she had \u201cno case.\u201d That conversation was his last communication with plaintiff regarding his services. He described the telephone conversation in his direct examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">Q. Did you then call back Mrs. Brizak and explain to her what the result was of your conversation with Dr. Silverstein?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-12\">A. I did. I called Mrs. Brizak, maybe, the same day or the day T had this discussion and I told Mrs. Brizak exactly the tenor of that conversation, that here another doctor, Dr. Silverstein has indicated the same thing, you have no basis of a claim. Again I explained to her that she or I are not doctors and we can\u2019t guess, we have to have a doctor\u2019s opinion as to what was wrong. Unless she could come up with a doctor, there was nothing further I could do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">Plaintiff testified that defendant \u201cnever\u201d told her that she did not have a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">She also testified that defendant \u201cnever\u201d told her that \u201cperhaps [she] should consult another lawyer.\u201d Defendant acknowledged that he did not advise plaintiff that she might obtain another legal opinion about her case, <em>\u201c... </em>I told her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>get another doctor, that\u2019s really what the problem was.\u201d He further testified that he did not warn her of a limitations problem because in his view her claim would not accrue until she secured the opinion of a medical doctor that Dr. Shafi\u2019s treatment was malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">When on cross-examination defendant was asked his opinion as an expert as to whether it is \u201cstandard legal practice when withdrawing from a case to send [the client] a close-out letter,\u201d he responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">That\u2019s a difficult question to answer in terms of standard legal practice. Sure, I could be a Monday-morning quarterback when I said, you know, boy, we wouldn\u2019t be here today if I had sent the letter back in June right after the conversation. The fact is I didn\u2019t send the letter. Whether it\u2019s standard, it\u2019s difficult to say, difficult to say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorney then read aloud RPC 1.16(d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">The record does not disclose when plaintiff consulted her present attorney, Joe Maran, Esq. He filed the present action against defendant on August 11, 1986, more than a year after plaintiff last heard from defendant about her case. Mr. Maran did not obtain Dr. Tuby\u2019s written report until June 17, 1987. Defendant contends that under the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d the limitations period did not begin to run against the medical malpractice claim until Dr. Tuby rendered his opinion in June 1987, thereby providing for the first time medical proof of Dr. Shafi\u2019s malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">The threshold issue is whether, applying the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d the two-year limitations period for personal injury actions (N.J.S.A. 2A.-14-2) began to run June 17, 1987, as defendant contends. If defendant is correct, plaintiff had until June 17, 1989, to bring an action against Dr. Shafi, and therefore should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>have sued him for medical malpractice instead of suing defendant for legal malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In their latest expression of opinions on the point, six Justices were unanimous in rejecting defendant\u2019s view. <em>Graves v. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>256, 558 A.2d 463 (1989) (affirming by an equally divided court <em>Graves v. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>49, 541 A.2d 725 (App.Div.1988)). The three Justices who concurred with this court\u2019s opinion that the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d applied quoted from <em>Tevis v. Tevis, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>422, 432, 400 A.2d 1189 (1979) in stating the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABn\">The \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d is a rule of equity that allows the tolling of the statute of limitations \u201cwhen a party is either unaware that he has sustained an injury or, although aware that an injury has occurred, he does not know that it is, <em>or may be, </em>attributable to the fault of another.\u201d <em>[Graves, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 262, 558 <em>A.</em>2d 463 (O\u2019Hern, J., concurring) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The issue in <em>Graves </em>was whether it was equitable to charge the plaintiff with knowledge that baking soda, ingested after a heavy meal to relieve stomach acidity, caused his stomach to rupture. The concurring Justices concluded that such knowledge was not chargeable to plaintiff because it was contrary to the view of all the many qualified physicians who had considered the matter during his extended course of treatment, was contrary to approvals that the product had received over the years from the Food and Drug Administration, and was contrary to common knowledge that the product had been widely used with safety for over a century.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The dissenting Justices, in an opinion written by Justice Clifford, concluded that the plaintiff in fact knew at the time he sustained the injury that it was caused by the baking soda because he reported to the treating doctors that he had suffered severe abdominal pain immediately after having ingested the substance. Employing hyperbole sometimes found in dissenting opinions, Justice Clifford characterized the concurring opinion as departing from well-settled principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\"><em>Henceforth </em>the cause of action in a personal injury case would be deemed to arise not when plaintiff is aware of the facts that may equate in law with a cause of action, but rather when plaintiff and his or her physicians are prepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>to <em>prove </em>the medical connection. <em>[Id. </em>at 275, 558 A.2d 463 (Clifford, J., dissenting) (first emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Rejecting this characterization of their opinion by the dissent, the concurring Justices expressly stated that \u201cthe Appellate Division has changed no law in its disposition of this case, nor, despite the disagreement of our dissenting members, have we.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 558 A.2d 463 (O\u2019Hern, J., concurring). It is clear to us that all six Justices implicitly rejected defendant\u2019s view that in a medical malpractice action the limitations period does not run until a physician is found who is prepared to prove that the doctor\u2019s treatment was malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The trial judge found from the evidence that plaintiff\u2019s suspicions ripened into knowledge that her unhealed fracture \u201cmay be\u201d attributable to Dr. Shafi\u2019s faulty treatment when she engaged defendant to represent her in the matter on December 5, 1983. He inferred that by engaging defendant, plaintiff demonstrated that her suspicions were no longer allayed by assurances Dr. Shafi had allegedly given that her poor recovery was normal. Those suspicions became heightened by the fact that plaintiff was enjoying a better recovery from the severe fracture of her hip than from the earlier fracture of her arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Here, unlike the more arcane situations in cases relied upon by defendant, if the bad recovery was anyone\u2019s fault, plaintiff had to know that the fault was Dr. Shafi\u2019s. Furthermore, the nature of his fault, while not self-evident, was not difficult to determine. <em>Compare Vispisiano v. Ashland Chemical Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>416, 428, 527 A.2d 66 (1987), where the Court said, \u201cAmong the factors to which courts look in deciding whether a plaintiff is equitably entitled to the benefit of the \u2018discovery rule\u2019 are the nature of the injury and the difficulty inherent in discovering certain types of injuries.\u201d To be sure, plaintiff did not know for certain that there was malpractice when she engaged defendant, but applying the <em>Tevis </em>formulation of the rule the trial judge properly determined that by then she knew that Dr. Shafi\u2019s treatment of her arm may have been faulty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>She engaged defendant, an attorney experienced in personal injury cases, to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Having determined that it was too late to sue Dr. Shafi when plaintiff commenced the present action, we turn to whether the evidence supports the jury\u2019s findings that defendant was negligent and that his negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s failure to sue Dr. Shafi by December 5, 1985, two years after she had engaged him to represent her in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">As to the negligence issue, we will first consider whether defendant failed to advise plaintiff of the peril of the statute of limitations in reasonable reliance on his erroneous view that the limitations period did not begin to run until a physician provided evidence of Dr. Shafi\u2019s medical malpractice. We will next consider whether defendant failed to conduct a reasonably diligent investigation that would have disclosed a basis for commencing an action against the doctor that would have been timely. As to both of these aspects of defendant\u2019s negligence, we will also consider whether the jury could properly have found defendant liable despite the fact that plaintiff did not present expert testimony as to the \u201cdegree of reasonable knowledge and skill that lawyers of ordinary ability and skill possess and exercise,\u201d the standard of care to which an attorney is held. <em>St. Pius X House of Retreats v. Camden Dioc., </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>571, 588, 443 A.2d 1052 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Although we sustain the trial judge\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s claim against the doctor accrued on December 5, 1983, it does not necessarily follow that defendant was unreasonable in believing that the claim would not accrue until a physician furnished proof of medical malpractice. We conclude, however, that from the state of the law when defendant made his judgment, there was no reasonable basis for his belief, and that even if there were such a basis, he was obliged to warn plaintiff that her claim could be time-barred sooner in the event his belief was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Defendant cites no case on which he relied or could have relied at the time he represented plaintiff that defers accrual of a claim subject to the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d until a claimant has concrete proof of liability. As previously discussed, the Justices in <em>Graves </em>commented that such a view has never been the law. In the seminal case of <em>Lopez v. Swyer, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>267, 272, 300 A.2d 563 (1973), the Court described the effect of the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">... a cause of action will be held not to aecrue until the injured party discovers, <em>or by an exercise of reasonable diligence and intelligence </em>should have discovered that he may have a basis for an actionable claim. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">There is no reasonable basis for defendant to have held the view that Dr. Shafi would be vulnerable to suit indefinitely on the chance that the basis for a claim might some day come plaintiffs way.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Expert evidence is not required in a legal malpractice case to establish an attorney\u2019s duty of care where the duty is so basic that it may be determined by the court as a matter of law. <em>Barth v. Reagan, </em>190 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>516, 137 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>463, 467, 546 N.E.2d 87, 91 (Ill.App. 2 Dist.1989), app. allowed by 129 <em>Ill.2d </em>562, 140 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>668, 550 <em>N.E.2d </em>553 (1990); Annotation, \u201cAdmissibility and Necessity of Expert Evidence as to Standards of Practice and Negligence in Malpractice Action Against Attorney,\u201d 14 <em>A.L.R.4th </em>170 (1982); 2 <em>R. Mallen &amp; J. Smith, Legal Malpractice </em>\u00a7 27.15 (3d ed.1989). Thus plaintiff did not need an expert to refute defendant\u2019s obviously incorrect belief that the limitations period did not begin to run until an expert medical opinion was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">It may not be obvious that plaintiff\u2019s claim accrued on the day that she retained defendant to represent her in this matter. Arguably defendant reasonably could have believed that plaintiff\u2019s claim did not accrue until some later date when \u201cby an exercise of reasonable diligence and intelligence [he] should have discovered that [plaintiff] may have a basis for an actionable claim.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Swyer, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 272, 300 A.2d 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">Although the judge told the jury that plaintiff\u2019s claim against the doctor accrued December 5, 1983, he immediately neutral<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ized any harmful effect that statement might have produced by stating, \u201cOn the other hand, it is unethical for an attorney to file a lawsuit unless the attorney reasonably believes there is a basis for doing so, that it is not frivolous.\u201d That instruction properly directed the jury to consider whether defendant undertook a reasonably diligent investigation to determine if there was a reasonable basis for commencing an action against Dr. Shafi.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">By its finding of negligence, the jury implicitly found that had defendant undertaken a reasonably diligent investigation during the eighteen months in which he represented plaintiff, he would have developed within that time enough evidence to have commenced a timely medical malpractice action against the doctor. <em>See </em>RPC 1.3. (\u201cA lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Defendant\u2019s response is that in the absence of expert testimony, the jury should not have been permitted to speculate that an attorney who has been retained in a personal injury matter has a duty to conduct an investigation of his client\u2019s claim. We disagree. In <em>Passanante v. Yormark, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>233, 239, 350 A.2d 497 (App.Div.1975), certif. den. 70 <em>N.J. </em>144, 358 A.2d 191 (1976), we defined a litigation attorney\u2019s legal obligation to his client:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">That obligation encompassed the taking of any steps reasonably necessary in the proper handling of the case. It included, of course, the duty of investigating the facts, formulating a litigation strategy and filing within a reasonable time any action necessary to effectuate recovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\"><em>Accord Giaramita v. Flow Master Machine Corp., </em>234 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>817 (Sup.Ct.1962) (attorney under duty to investigate every material phase of his client\u2019s case); <em>Muse v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, </em>328 <em>So.2d </em>698 (La.Ct.App.1976) (attorney owes client duty of diligent investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">We add that an attorney is uniquely equipped to conduct the kind of investigation called for in this matter. If Dr. Shafi refused to disclose his office notes of plaintiff\u2019s visits or provide defendant with copies of her medical records, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>could have obtained discovery either through the commencement of an action or by taking testimony before commencing an action. <em>R. </em>4:11-3. <em>See Davila v. Continental Can Co., </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 500 A.2d 721 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Although defendant testified that at the beginning of their relationship he told plaintiff that she had the responsibility of finding a medical expert to support her claim, there is credible evidence to the contrary. The retainer agreement at least impliedly contains an undertaking by defendant to conduct a factual and medical investigation to determine if Dr. Shafi had committed malpractice. It provides that the contingent fee \u201cshall be computed on the net recovery arrived at by deducting from the gross recovery all disbursements in connection with the institution and prosecution of the claim, <em>including investigation expenses, expenses for expert or other testimony or evidence, ...\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Consistent with this undertaking, defendant secured from plaintiff a signed authorization for him to review and copy her medical records. The jury also could have found that it was not reasonable for defendant to have expected plaintiff to conduct her own investigation in view of her limited education and obvious lack of experience and sophistication in such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The judge held that the jury could have evaluated the reasonableness of defendant\u2019s investigative efforts without expert testimony because the evidence on the point was within the grasp of common understanding. Again we agree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">Even in malpractice cases, the facts of a given case may be such that the common knowledge possessed by laymen may permit a finding that a duty of care has been breached. <em>Klimko v. Rose, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>496, 503-504 [422 A.2d 418] (1980). The test of need of expert testimony is whether the matter to be dealt with is so esoteric that jurors of common judgment and experience cannot form a valid judgment as to whether the conduct of the party was reasonable. <em>[Butler v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>270, 283, 445 A.2d 1141 (1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Expert testimony is not required in legal malpractice cases where the issues are not \u201cbeyond the knowledge of the average person,\u201d <em>Rizzo v. Haines, </em>520 <em>Pa. </em>484, 555 A.2d 58, 66 (Pa. 1989), or are \u201cwithin the ordinary knowledge and experience of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>laymen.\u201d <em>Barth v. </em>Reagan, 190 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>at 521, 137 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>at 467, 546 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We have previously detailed the ample evidence, fully comprehensible to laymen, from which the jury could reasonably have found defendant negligent for failing to conduct a more diligent investigation. He made no effort to obtain the opinion of someone with appropriate expertise who would be willing to testify. Indeed, he spurned all sources of such experts, relying instead on the informal advice of a friend who was a radiologist but not familiar with surgical procedures, and of an orthopedist chosen at random. Furthermore, he failed to obtain plaintiffs X-rays and Dr. Shafi\u2019s office records. The jury could reasonably have found without the guidance of a legal expert that a medical expert would need to examine those materials to make a proper evaluation of Dr. Shafi\u2019s treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">We do not want to leave the wrong impression. Although expert opinion is not necessary to establish the negligence of a personal injury attorney who fails to conduct any investigation of his client\u2019s claim, where the attorney has undertaken some investigation, a jury will rarely be able to evaluate its adequacy without the aid of expert legal opinion. We are convinced that this is one of those rare cases. We nevertheless caution that a plaintiff\u2019s attorney who litigates a legal malpractice claim without the opinion testimony of a legal expert unnecessarily exposes his client to a serious risk of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The last issue we need to discuss is whether the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s negligence was \u201ca proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s failure to timely sue Dr. Shafi for damages.\u201d Defendant contends that he withdrew from representing plaintiff in June 1985 when in a telephone conversation he told her that she had no case and should contact him if she finds a physician who would support her claim. Although the limitations period did not expire until the following December 5, the jury reasonably could have found that even if defendant had told plaintiff in June that she had no case, a fact she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>denied, his lackadaisical investigation, failure to warn of the limitations problem and failure to suggest that she seek the opinion of another attorney were proximate causes of her later inability to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We addressed this issue in <em>Passanante v. York, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 239, 350 <em>A.</em>2d 497, where, after holding that an attorney has the duty to investigate the facts concerning his client\u2019s claim, we further held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">But it did not stop there. Reasonable care in the performance of his duties towards his clients dictated that he take ordinary precautions to protect his clients\u2019 interest and not delay filing suit until the eleventh hour. He had the implicit obligation to inform his clients of his failure to act (for whatever cause) at a time sufficiently prior to the running of the statute of limitations to permit plaintiffs to engage another attorney who could then take proper action on their behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">This duty to a client upon withdrawal of representation now appears in RPC 1.16(d), which, as we previously noted, plaintiff\u2019s attorney read to the jury during his cross-examination of defendant. Defendant\u2019s clearly erroneous advice to plaintiff that she need not be concerned about time limitations until she found a physician to support her claim was itself a sufficient basis for linking his negligence to her failure to commence a timely action against the doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">We are satisfied from a careful review of this record that the other issues raised are clearly without merit and require no further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The complaint includes a claim by plaintiff George Brizak, Norma's husband, for loss of consortium. It appears from the record, however, that George Brizak died before the complaint was filed. His claim was not advanced at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-10\">The doctor read the entry to the jury. Although the record was marked for identification, the document itself was not offered into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\">The fracture was to the left humerus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\">It was explained in testimony that the reference to a \u201crotatory component\u201d means that the neck of the humerus completely fractured and the shaft of the bone had rotated out of alignment with its head.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b454-15\">In earlier testimony, defendant explained to the jury that he had made it easier for plaintiffs to recover in medical malpractice cases as the result of his representation of the plaintiff in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
