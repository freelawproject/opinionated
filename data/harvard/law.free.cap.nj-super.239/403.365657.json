In their complaint, plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that defendants, under the provisions of their general liability and excess coverage policies, must defend and indemnify plaintiffs against a discrimination claim pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>We affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 demand that defendants provide a defense in the EEOC proceedings substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Lowengrub in his comprehensive written opinion reported at 239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>488, 571 A.2d 1013 (Ch.Div.1989). We agree with the judge\u2019s determination that the EEOC\u2019s reasonable cause determination was not \u201cthe functional equivalent of a suit so as to compel the insurers ... to defend plaintiff against charges of discriminatory employment practices[,]\u201d and that \u201cthe duty to defend is triggered when the insured is involved in an adversarial proceeding, a consequence of which is the factual determination that legal liability may or may not be imposed upon the insured.\u201d We add only that we acknowledge that an EEOC probable cause determination may be admissible in a subsequent federal action instituted by the EEOC, or by an aggrieved party against the employer. <em>See Smith v. Universal Services, Inc., </em>454 <em>F.</em>2d 154, 158 (5th Cir.1972). However, the admissibility of the probable cause determination does not transform the EEOC conciliation process into a coercive, adversarial proceeding tantamount to a \u201csuit,\u201d for which a duty to defend is owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">We also affirm the order for summary judgment entered on September 8, 1988, dismissing without prejudice plaintiffs\u2019 demand for indemnification under the policies. In dismissing the claim for indemnification, Judge Lowengrub concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">... it would be premature to decide whether the language of the various policies of insurance at issue in this litigation negates or excludes coverage for the underlying discrimination action since presently there is no ... suit pending.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The judge reasoned that before issues of coverage and application of the exclusions pertinent to claims of discrimination can be resolved, there must be a \u201csuit\u201d setting forth the specific acts of discrimination alleged by the EEOC or by the aggrieved employees. Further, discovery as to these issues, before a suit is instituted, might be frustrated because of the confidentiality of the EEOC\u2019s conciliation proceeding. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2000e-5(b). We affirm on this point substantially for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>reasons expressed by the judge in his September 8, 1988 oral opinion and written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Plaintiffs declaratory judgment suit is dismissed substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Lowengrub in his comprehensive written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
