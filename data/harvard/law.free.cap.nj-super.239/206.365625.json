On the driving while revoked charge, defendant was fined $750, his driving privileges were revoked for an additional 60 days and he was sentenced as a second offender to a one-day jail term.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">On appeal, defendant raises the following points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\"><em>Point </em>/\u2014Where the trooper\u2019s stop of defendant\u2019s automobile was pretextual, lacking probable cause and constituting an unjustified investigatory stop, defendant\u2019s convictions for refusal and driving while suspended must be reversed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Point </em>II\u2014The sentence of one day imprisonment must be set aside because such sentence was founded upon the trial court\u2019s erroneous legal conclusion that such a sentence was mandatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The State\u2019s proofs established that State Trooper David Meyer observed defendant\u2019s vehicle traveling southbound on State Highway 35 in Wall Township. The vehicle was traveling at low rate of speed, was weaving and, on at least two occasions, crossed over the fog line separating the traveled portion of the highway from the shoulder. When the trooper stopped the vehicle, he detected an odor of alcoholic beverage on defendant\u2019s breath. When defendant recited the alphabet, he did so in a slow, slurred voice. After defendant had difficulty performing coordination tests at the scene, he was placed under arrest for driving while intoxicated and was transported to the State Police barracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">We are satisfied that Trooper Meyer had an objectively reasonable basis to stop defendant\u2019s vehicle. <em>See Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>648, 661, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1391, 1400, 59 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>660, 672 (1979); <em>State v. Weber, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>420, 423, 532 A.2d 733 (App.Div.), certif. den. 109 <em>N.J. </em>39, 532 A.2d 1107 (1987). The erratic nature of the vehicle\u2019s movement provided an articulable and reasonable suspicion that defendant was driving carelessly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-97, or while under the influence of alcohol, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">After defendant\u2019s vehicle was stopped, the trooper properly asked defendant to alight from the vehicle. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>106, 111, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>330, 333, 54 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 331, 337 (1977). When asked for credentials, defendant was unable to produce his driver\u2019s license. As stated, his speech was slurred, he had alcohol on his breath and he had difficulty performing roadside physical tests. The State establishes a failure to submit violation by proving \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\" that the \u201carresting officer had probable cause to believe the [defendant] had been driving ... while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>under the influence,\u201d and that he refused to submit to the test. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a. The Law Division judge\u2019s determination that this standard was met is amply supported by the record. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 <em>A.</em>2d 809 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The next question is whether the one-day jail term imposed for driving while revoked is sustainable. The Law Division judge concluded that a jail term is mandated for second offenders under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">A person violating this section shall be subject to the following penalties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">b. Upon conviction for a second offense, a fine of $750.00 and imprisonment in the county jail for not more than five days[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">In so holding, the Law Division judge followed <em>State v. Duva, </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 421-422, 470 A.2d 53 (Law.Div.1983), which construed the pertinent language to mean that imprisonment in the county jail is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Defendant asks us not to follow <em>Duva. </em>He reminds us that the statute, being penal in nature, must be strictly construed, and hence the term \u201cshall be subject to\u201d should be interpreted to mean that imposition of a custodial term is discretionary. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Even if a statute is penal in nature, all rules of construction are subordinate to the interpretive goal of ascertaining the intent of the Legislature. <em>State v. Tischio, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>504, 511, 527 A.2d 388, app. dis. 484 <em>U.S. </em>1038, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>768, 98 L.Ed.2d 855 (1988). In that quest, we must consider the policy behind the statute, concepts of reasonableness and legislative history. <em>Coletti v. Union Cty. Bd. of Freeholders, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 35, 524 A.2d 1270 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">Prior to A. 1982, c. 45, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40 provided for a fine of not less than $200 nor more than $1,000 <em>or </em>imprisonment in the county jail for not more than six months, or both. The statute made no distinction among first, second or third offenders. Thus, the court had discretion whether or not to impose a custodial term, even for second and third offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>L. </em>1982, c. 45, substituted the present penal scheme which imposes penalties depending upon the status of the offender. The pertinent provisions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">A person violating this section shall be subject to the following penalties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">a. Upon conviction for a first offense, a fine of $500.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">b. Upon conviction of a second offense, a fine of $750.00 and imprisonment in the county jail for not more than five days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">c. Upon conviction of a third offense, a fine of $1,000.00 and imprisonment in the county jail for 10 days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">d. Upon conviction, the court shall impose or extend a period of suspension not to exceed six months;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">e. Upon conviction, the court shall impose a period of imprisonment for not less than 45 days, if while operating a vehicle in violation of this section a person is involved in an accident resulting in personal injury to another person. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Thus, the present statute provides for a fine for a first offense, but upon conviction for a second offense, the violator \u201cshall be subject to ... a fine of $750.00 <em>and </em>imprisonment in the county jail for not more than five days[.]\u201d [Emphasis added]. In our view, by so mandating, the Legislature intended to divest the sentencing court of its discretion as to whether or not a custodial term should be imposed. <em>Duva </em>so held, and we agree. We note, for example, that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3\u201440b, in using the conjunctive \u201cand,\u201d should be compared with other provisions of Title 39 which call for a fine <em>or </em>imprisonment in the county jail for not more than a specific term. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-96 (reckless driving second offender \u201cshall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 3 months, <em>or </em>by fine of not less than $100.00 or more than $500.00, or both.\u201d). (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">This interpretation is supported by legislative history. According to the <em>Senate Law, Public Safety and Defense Committee Statement, </em>Senate, No. <em>904\u2014L. </em>1982, c. 45, the bill <em>\u201cincreases </em>the general penalties for the offense of driving\u201d while revoked. The Statement also declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">For a first offense, the penalty <em>would be </em>a $500.00 fine and a suspension of license for up to 6 months; for a second offense, <em>a $750.00 fine, a jail sentence of up to 5 days, </em>and a mandatory suspension of license for up to 6 months; for a third offense, a $1,000.00 fine, a jail sentence of up to 10 days, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>mandatory suspension for up to 6 months. <em>[See </em>Senate Statement L.1982, c. 45 following <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-10; emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The statement clearly states that a fine <em>and </em>jail sentence shall be imposed for a second offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">We cannot accept defendant\u2019s argument that the language \u201csubject to\u201d was intended to make a custodial term discretionary. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1278 (5th ed.1979) defines the term \u201csubject to\u201d as being \u201c[ljiable, ... answerable for.\u201d Hence, the language \u201cshall be subject to ... imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 5 days,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40b, can be read as meaning \u201cshall be [\u2018liable to\u2019 or \u2018answerable for\u2019] imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 5 days[.]\u201d As the Law Division observed in <em>Duva, </em>to accept the argument that the words \u201cbe subject to\u201d intends to vest discretion in the sentencing court makes the phrase \u201cshall be subject to imprisonment\u201d the functional equivalent of \u201cmay be imprisoned for.\u201d This result would render the mandatory character of the word \u201cshall\u201d nugatory. <em>See </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 421, 470 <em>A.</em>2d 53. If the Legislature intended that a violator <em>\u201cmay </em>be imprisoned up to 5 days\u201d for a second offense, it would have so stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">In support of his argument, defendant also points to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40e which provides that the court <em>\u201cshall impose a period of imprisonment </em>for not less than 45 days\u201d if the person drives while on the revoked list and is involved in an accident resulting in personal injury to another person. [Emphasis added]. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a)(2) (a second drunk driving offender \u201cshall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than 48 consecutive hours ... \u201d). Defendant contrasts the mandatory language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40e with the term \u201csubject to\u201d used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40b, and suggests that the Legislature, in using \u201csubject to,\u201d must have intended something less than mandatory jail terms for second offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Defendant ignores the fact that subparagraph e. is also prefaced with the same \u201cshall be subject to\u201d language that prefaces subparagraph b., and therefore can be read to mean \u201csubject to ... a period of imprisonment for not less than 45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>days[.]\u201d Clearly, the Legislature did not intend to make the 45-day term discretionary. <em>See Senate Law, Public Safety &amp; Defense Committee Statement, </em>Senate, No. 1207\u2014L.1986, c. 38 (45-day jail term \u201cwill be imposed\u201d when accident results in personal injury by another).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Finally, we note that since <em>Duva\u2019s </em>holding, which we here follow, the Legislature has amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40e, making it clear that the 45 days of imprisonment shall be imposed only when an accident results in personal injury to someone other than the driver. <em>See </em>L.1986, <em>c. </em>38. We must assume that the Legislature was aware of the <em>Duva </em>holding when it amended subparagraph e. in 1986. <em>See Quaremba v. Allan, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>1, 14, 334 A.2d 321 (1975). Its failure also to amend subparagraph b., in light of <em>Duva, </em>may be evidence that <em>Duva\u2019s </em>construction is in accord with the legislative intent. <em>See In re Keogh-Dwyer, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>117, 120, 211 A.2d 778 (1965); <em>but see Masse v. Public Employees Retirem. Sys., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>252, 264, 432 <em>A.</em>2d 1339 (inaction demonstrates nothing more than that subsequent legislatures failed to act); and <em>see Giardina v. Bennett, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>412, 426, 545 A.2d 139 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-13\">Defendant was found not guilty of driving while under the influence in the municipal court. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
