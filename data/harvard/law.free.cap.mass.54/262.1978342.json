Coburn, partners, and afterwards prosecuted by the plaintiff, who was appointed assignee of their estate, under the insolvent laws, on a note of hand of the following tenor : \u201c $300. For value received, we promise to pay French, Tapley <em>&amp;&gt; </em>Co. three hundred, payable in fifteen days from date and grace.

J. at the last April term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-14\">Before the commencement of the trial, the plaintiff, at the bar, wrote over the names of the defendants, on the back of the note, these words: \u201c For value received, we promise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>pay the money, mentioned in the within note, to T. Ames &amp; Co., according to the tenor thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">There was evidence that the firm of French, Tapley &amp; Co. consisted of Jotham French, David Tapley and Charles L. Bailey; that <em>the name </em>of French, Tapley &amp; Co., on the back of said note, was in the hand writing of David Tapley, one of the defendants, and that French, another of the defendants, was called upon, by Charles H. Moore, a clerk of T. Ames &amp; Co., on the day the note became due, in the forenoon, for the money on the note, and that French replied, that he was not then prepared to pay it, but if they would send it in the afternoon, he would pay it, or try to pay it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">The plaintiff then offered to prove that said Rufus McLellan, in business with J. De Puy, on the day of the date of the note, went to T. Ames &amp; Co., to get them to raise for him the sum of $300, and told them that if they would get him the money, he would give them a note signed by the defendants : that he went to the defendants, and got them to sign their name to this note, and gave them security for so doing; that he then carried the note to T. Ames &amp; Co., and they raised for him the sum of $300. The plaintiff also offered to prove that said French confessed, at three different times, that the film of French, Tapley &amp; Co. were indebted to said Ames &amp; Co. on said note, and promised to pay it. But the judge ruled that such evidence, so far as it was competent, would be insufficient to prove an authority from the defendants to the plaintiff to fill up the indorsement in the manner stated, and support the action. He also expressed a doubt whether the action could be maintained, as no sum of money was expressed in the body of the note. The plaintiff thereupon submitted to a nonsuit, subject to the opinion of the whole court upon the facts in the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-7\"><em>Wentworth, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAg\">Ames &amp; Co. were authorized to fill up the blank with the words which they wrote. <em>Josselyn </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>3 Mass. 274. <em>Union Bank of Weymouth </em>&amp; <em>Braintree </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>8 Met. 504, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-8\">The omission of the word <em>\u201c </em>dollars \u201d in the body of tha <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>note is immaterial. The note is for value received, and the dollar mark and the figures \u201c 300 \u201d are in the margin. This is sufficient to make the instrument a good promissory note for that sum. <em>M\u2019Coy </em>v. <em>Gilmore, 7 </em>Ham. Part 1st, 268. See also <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Brotherson, </em>10 Wend. 93. <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>2 Root, 247. <em>Norwich Bank </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>13 Connect. 279. <em>Elliot\u2019s case, </em>2 East P.

Abbott, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A74\">The case of <em>Josselyn </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>cited for the plaintiff, is very imperfectly reported. It would seem, from the report, that all the parties were <em>connected originally </em>in an agreement to become sureties for Oliver Ames. There is no other case like that j none in which the payee of a note not negotiable has been charged in the manner attempted in this case. The defendants should have been treated as indorsers, and not as promisors or guarantors. See Story on Notes, \u00a7 128. Story on Bills, \u00a7\u00a7 199, 202. Chit, on Bills, (8th Amer. ed.) 219.

French\u2019s acknowledgment, after the maturity of the note, that the firm owed it, and his promise to pay it, were a waiver of demand and notice, even if the defendants are to be treated as indorsers. 8 Pick. 1.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b272-10\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG1\">The weight of authority, resulting from the adjudicated cases, is clearly with the plaintiff, as to the right to fill up the blank indorsement of the defendants, in the manner proposed by him. The case of <em>Josselyn </em>v. <em>Ames. </em>3 Mass. 274, is direct to the point, and well authorizes it. This class of cases has recently been under the consideration of the court in the case of <em>Union Bank of Weymouth \u00a7 Braintree </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>8 Met. 504; and after a full review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the various cases, and with a knowledge that doubts have been sometimes suggested as to their correctness, we did not feel authorized to overrule them, nor disposed to deny them their full effect as authoritative decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The objection arising from the omission of the word \u201c dollars,\u201d in the body of the note, is not insisted on by the defendants\u2019 counsel. The figures and characters in the margin seem sufficiently to supply this obvious omission. The cases cited are conclusive on this point. See also <em>Phipps </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>5 Car. &amp; P. 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The common money counts are sufficient to embrace the present cause of action. If a specification of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, or a bill of particulars, be required, the plaintiff may have leave to file the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\n<em>Nonsuit taken off, and a new trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
