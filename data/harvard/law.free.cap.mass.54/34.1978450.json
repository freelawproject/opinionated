And it shall be the duty of the said board of trustees, and their legal successors forever, to carry into full effect all the provisions of this will in relation to the receipt, custody, care, management, appropriation, expenditure and payment of the various legacies and funds designated in this will, except such as necessarily appertain, or are expressly assigned, to my executor, or to others. And 1 hereby order and direct that the said board of trustees shall be appointed and constituted in manner following: The several towns of Northampton, Hadley, Hatfield, Amherst and Williamsburgh, in the county of Hampshire, and Deerfield, Greenfield and Whately, in the county of Franklin, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>annually, in the month of March or April, at a legal town meeting, (an article to that effect being inserted in the warrant therefor,) choose one person, being an inhabitant thereof, as agent for said town, to be called an elector. And the several electors thus chosen, such choice being duly certified, shall meet at Northampton on the first Wednesday in May annually, and shall then and there elect, by a majority of the votes given in, three suitable persons to act as trustees of said funds; and the persons thus elected shall constitute the board of trustees, and shall hold their office for one year, and until others are chosen in their stead. Provided, however, that the first choice of said electors by the towns, and also their first meeting at Northampton for the choice of trustees, may be made and holden <em>at such convenient and suitable time within one year after my </em>decease, <em>as the judge of probate for the county of Hampshire shall appoint; </em>and the said trustees, thus elected at said first meeting, shall hold their office till the first Wednesday in May then next ensuing, and till others hall be chosen in their place.\u201d \u201c And the said trustees, before entering upon the duties of their office, shall respectively give bonds, with sufficient sureties, to the treasurer of the county of Hampshire, and to the acceptance of said board of electors, for the faithful discharge of said duties; which bond shall enure to the benefit of the several funds, to each one its proportionate share.\u201d \u201c And in case the said board of trustees shall, at any time, be reduced to a less number than two, I direct that the judge of probate for the county of Hampshire shall be requested, by the remaining trustee, to appoint two suitable persons to be associated with him in the management of said funds, until the vacancies in said board shall be filled by the electors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-4\">The plaintiffs then set forth in the bill the following parts of the <em>fourth </em>section of said Oliver\u2019s will:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-5\">\u201c I give to my nephew, Austin Smith, in trust however, and for the uses and purposes herein specified, the sum of two hundred thousand dollars, to be secured at interest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>and managed as an accumulating fund, by the said Austin, until the board of trustees, provided for in the preceding section, shall have been duly constituted and organized; at which time the said board of trustees shall be authorized, and it is hereby made their duty, to demand and receive of the said Austin Smith the said sum of two hundred thousand dollars, together with all the interest and income that shall then have accrued on the same. And the said Austin is hereby directed to pay over the same to the said board of trustees, as soon as the said board shall have been duly organized. Provided, however, that such payment may be made by a legal transfer and delivery to said board of any of the different kinds of property, to the amount required, together with the evidences and securities thereof, of which I may die possessed, at its par value if in stocks of any kind, and its appraised value if in real estate. And the said fund shall thenceforth be and remain under the care and control of said board of trustees, to be by them at all times secured and kept at interest, according to their best judgment and discretion, and managed as one entire fund, and the interest thereof annually added to the principal, thus forming an accumulating fund, without allowing any subtraction of either principal or interest therefrom, (except for the purpose of supplying any deficiency which may happen to exist, or of meeting any unforeseen emergency that may arise from the failure of the \u2018contingent fund\u2019 hereinafter provided,) until the said principal and interest shall amount to the full sum of four hundred thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">A part of the <em>fifth </em>section of said will was then set forth in the bill, as follows : \u201c All the residue of my estate, of every kind, not herein otherwise disposed of, after payment of my just debts, and the expenses of settling my estate at the probate office, I give in trust to the said Austin Smith, and for the purpose of constituting a \u2018 contingent fund,\u2019 to be invested and managed by the said Austin, <em>until the said board of trustees, before mentioned, shall be organized, and thenceforth to the said trustees, </em>in the way and manner pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>out in the fourth section, for managing the fund there established.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-4\">The plaintiffs then averred, in the bill, that after said will was approved and allowed, and after letters testamentary had been issued, as above mentioned, the said judge of probate, \u201c by virtue of the above recited provision in said third section, and pursuing the manifest intent of said testator, on the 10th day of August 1847, did, by an order then made and recorded, ordain and appoint the 30th day of said August as a convenient and suitable time for the first choice of electors by the said several towns, [naming them,] as provided in the said third section of said will, and did further ordain and appoint the 6th day of September then next, as the time for the electors, so first chosen, to hold their first meeting at Northampton, for the choice of the trustees under said wilt,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-5\">The bill then stated that town meetings were duly warned and held, according to said order and appointment of the judge of probate, at which meetings electors were duly chosen, who met on said 6th of September, and elected Osmyn Baker, John Dickinson, jr. (the plaintiffs) and Austin Smith (the defendant) as the three trustees provided for by the third section of said will; that said trustees, so elected, accepted said trust, gave bonds for the faithful discharge of their trust, as required by said will, and organized their board; that the plaintiffs, as a major part of said board, demanded of the defendant, as executor of said will, payment and delivery to said board of the said sum of two hundred thousand dollars, &amp;c. but that he has refused so to do, and assigns the following reason for such refusal, viz. that \u201c by the great delay which attended the probate of said will, a literal compliance with the directions of said testator, respecting the election and organization of said board of trustees, has not been, and cannot be, had, and that he [the defendant] cannot pay over the said moneys, or deliver the said property or securities demanded by the said board, with safety to himself as executor, without the direction of this court fur his justification therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The prayer of the bill was, that the defendant might be held to make answer, and to account with the plaintiffs; and that said board of trustees might be declared by the court to be legally established, and for further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-5\">The defendant demurred to the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-6\"><em>Grennell, (Aiken </em>was with him,) in support of the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-7\">The judge of probate,' after the lapse of one year- from the decease of the testator, had no authority to appoint a time for the choice of electors, and for their first meeting. The eighth section of the will is thus: \u201c And I further direct, that in case of the entire failure of trustees,- from any cause whatsoever, the judge of probate for the county of Hampshire, for the time being, shall have full power and authority to nominate and appoint trustees to hold and manage said property, until other trustees shall be legally appointed in the manner hereinbefore set forth, and authorized to act in their stead.\u201d Under the exigence that happened, this provision of the will should have been complied with, or all parties should have waited for a choice of electors at March or April town meetings in 1848. In the mean time, the defendant, as executor, would have had the care of the moneys and securities, and would have been entitled to pay for such care, besides the compensation given him by the will for settling the estate. For, in the <em>first </em>section of the will, it is provided, that \u201c if the board of trustees shall not be organized within one year after my decease, a reasonable allowance shall be made to him [the defendant] for managing said funds after that time, till the same shall be paid over to said trustees.\u201d There was no necessity, therefore, for any deviation from the literal provision of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-9\">The plaintiffs\u2019 right to bring this bill is properly raised by demurrer.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeD\">The question presented in the present case is, whether the complainants were duly appointed trustees under Oliver Smith\u2019s will, so as to be entitled to demand and receive the. trust fund from the executor. See <em>Inhabitants of Northampton </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>11 Met. 390. The court are of opinion that they were not legally constituted the board of trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">As the general course, the will is explicit in directing how this board of trustees shall be constituted, by the election of electors or delegates, by the respective eight towns, at the annual meeting in March or April. Then it is provided, as a special exception to this general rule', that the first meetings of the towns for the choice of electors, and also the time of their first meeting, may be directed by the judge of probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>but such meetings were to be held within one year of the decease of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">This limitation or condition of the power of the judge of probate, to direct meetings to be held within one year of the decease of the testator, became impossible, because more than a year elapsed before the will was established. But we think the power ceased when the year elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">It would have been a convenience, perhaps contemplated by the testator, if the will were proved soon after his decease, without controversy, and no appeal taken, that the board of trustees should be constituted immediately, especially if this should occur soon after the annual town meetings; so that nearly a year would intervene before a regular choice. But it was a convenience merely, and not a necessity ; and there was, therefore, no occasion for applying the doctrine of <em>cy pres. </em>It was, no doubt, the purpose of the testator to have a board of trustees speedily constituted ; but the mode is duly prescribed, and precisely limited. ' There was no necessity arising from the state of the funds. The testator had provided for that contingency, by providing that the trustee and executor should hold, manage and invest the funds, until the board of trustees should be constituted in the mode directed ; and he contemplated that this might extend beyond one year, by providing a compensation to his trustee and executor, if the board should not be constituted within one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">We mean to express no doubt of the power of the court, as a court of equity, in cases of gifts to charitable uses, when the will cannot be executed precisely according to its terms, to sanction an execution which shall, as nearly as may be, carry into effect the charitable intent, <em>ut res magis </em>valeat, <em>quam pereat. </em>But to warrant a deviation from the plain directions of the will, the exigency must exist. Hero the power of the judge of probate to appoint the first meetings of the towns was limited to one year, and the year had expired ; and there was ample provision for that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The power given to the judge of probate, in case of the failure of trustees, is manifestly limited to a case where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>trustees have been appointed. Besides; the express provision, that the judge of probate should exercise this power, in regard to the first meetings, and limiting it to one year, excludes the implication of an intent to confer this power under the general words, giving a like power, without limitation, in the case of <em>failure </em>of trustees. And further; in case of the failure of trustees, after they had once been appointed and received the funds, the exigency arising from the want of proper persons to take care of the funds would be much greater than that which would exist before the first constitution of the board; because, until that time, there was an executor and trustee, appointed by the testator, charged with that duty, and competent to preserve and to manage and invest the funds, until a regular election of electors, at the annual town meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
