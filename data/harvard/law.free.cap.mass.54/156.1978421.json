The defendants were the owners of a privilege on said stream, above the mill of the plaintiffs, whereon a mill had stood for some years; they erected a new mill thereon, and, for the purpose of using the whole power, raised the dam higher than it had formerly been, and kept the water back, so long as was necessary to fill their pond, and no longer. To have delayed filling said pond, until a freshet or flow of water should have raised the same, would have endangered said dam; and by keeping the water back, as aforesaid, the operations of the plaintiffs\u2019 mill were retarded or wholly suspended.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-6\">The parties agreed that if, upon the facts above stated, the action could be maintained, damages should be assessed by an auditor; otherwise, that a nonsuit should be entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-7\"><em>F. H. </em>Dewey, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR_\">As the defendants\u2019 privilege is a recent one, and the plaintiffs\u2019 an ancient one, the defendants had no right to withhold the water, nor to raise tbeir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>dam. <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>9 Mass. 316. <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Tileston. 7 </em>Pick. 198. <em>Sackrider v.

They have a right only to such a use as is consistent with a reasonable use by others; and the defendants have not deprived them of such use. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Mulligan, </em>3 Caines, 307. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>4 Mason, 401. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Rees, </em>9 Pick. 528. <em>Cary </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>8 Met. 476, 477.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah-\">Every proprietor of land, through which a current of water flows, has a right to the use of it on his own and, amongst other things for mill purposes, making such reasonable use of it, and of the mill' power furnished by it, as he can make consistently with a like reasonable use by other proprietors, above and below, through whose land it passes. What is a reasonable use must depend on circumstances; such as the width and depth of the bed, the volume of water, the fall, previous usage, and the state of improvement in manufactories and the useful arts. 8 Met. 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">It appears by the facts stated in this case, that the defendants were proprietors of land and mills above those of the plaintiffs on the same stream ; that having erected a new dam, which they had a right to do, they detained the water no longer than was necessary to raise their own head of water and fill their 'own pond. The court are of opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>this was not an unreasonable use of the watercourse by the defendants, and that any loss, which the plaintiffs temporarily sustained by it, was <em>damnum absque injuria.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\n<em>Plaintiffs nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
