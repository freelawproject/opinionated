On the 26th of December 1844, said commissioners, at their regular meeting, awarded \u00a71000 to said Porter, and caused their estimate t\u00f3 be completed and returned. Said Porter, being dissatisfied therewith, immediately petitioned the said commissioners, in writing, for a jury. Whereupon they, at the same meeting, without any notice to said Rail Road Company, ordered a <em>jury; </em>and on the 8th of January 1845, their clerk, without any special application therefor, made out a warrant for a jury, and gave it to the sheriff, who, at the end of three months, returned it to the clerk\u2019s office unserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">Both said petitions were continued, from term to term, to the June term of said commissioners\u2019 court, in 1845, at which last term, within six months from said commissioners\u2019 award aforesaid, but after an intervening regular term in April 1845, said Porter filed a new petition, in writing, for a jury to estimate his damages. The petition was continued to September term 1845, when said Porter, by his counsel, made a motion, in writing, to have an order of notice issue on his original petition for a jury, (which was filed on the 26th of December 1844, then pending in said commissioners\u2019 court,) to said Rail Road Corporation, to show cause why a warrant should not issue thereon; but said commissioners refused to issue any such notice. An order of notice was issued on said second petition, filed at June term 1845, returnable on the 27th of October 1845, at which time both parties appeared, and said commissioners refused to order a jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-6\"><em>Wilkinson, </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5C\">The order passed in December 1844 was of no validity, for want of notice to the Rail Road Company. <em>Central Turnpike, </em>7 Pick. 13. <em>Hinckley, </em>15 Pick. 447. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>City of Lowell, </em>8 Met. 172. And if the commissioners make an erroneous order on the petition, they should correct it. See <em>Inhabitants of Mendon </em>v. <em>County of Worcester, </em>10 Pick. 235. <em>Ex parte Weston, </em>11 Mass. 417.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-7\">By the Rev. Sts. c. 39, \u00a7 57, application for a jury to assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>damages, in case of rail roads, may be made at the same meeting at which the commissioners return their estimate, or at their next regular meeting. And by \u00a7 56, commissioners are to estimate damages \u201c in the manner provided in the case of laying out highways.\u201d By Rev. Sts. c. 24, \u00a7 14, in case of highways, application for a jury to assess damages may be made at the meeting of the commissioners, at which the highway is laid out, or at their next regular meeting, or at any time not exceeding six months thereafter. The \u201csix months,\u201d after the meeting succeeding that at which the commissioners\u2019 return of damages is made, (it is submitted,) is applicable to rail roads, according to the provisions of <em>c. </em>39. But if the court hold otherwise, yet the present petitioner s entitled to an order of notice on his first petition.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-5\"><em>B. </em>Rand, for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ako\">The petitioner\u2019s remedy is mst by lapse of time. The \u201c six months,\u201d in Rev. Sts. c. 24, \u00a7 14, were not extended to rail roads, by c. 39; and an application for a jury, in case of rail roads, can be made only at the commissioners\u2019 meeting at which the estimate of damages is returned, or at their next regular meeting.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b489-6\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agb\">The petition for a jury, filed with the county commissioners at their regular meeting in June 1845, as an original petition, was not filed in due season; the Rev. Sts. c. 39, \u00a7 57, limiting the application to the meeting at which the estimate of damages by the commissioners shall be completed and returned, or at the next regular meeting thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">It is contended that the application may be made within the period of six months, as in case of an application for a jury to assess damages in the location of a highway. But though the general course of proceedings is similar, in relation to a jury in the two cases, yet, upon this point, the cases differ, and a different statute provision exists. The only question, therefore, in the present case, arises upon the application for further proceedings upon the original petition filed at the proper term, and upon which a jury was ordered, but never called out by the petitioner. If such order had been a legal one, and a warrant had been duly issued thereon, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the petitioner, without any sufficient cause, had neglected tc call out the jury, he would thereby be taken to have waived his right to a jury; as was held in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of Plymouth, (ante, </em>449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Upon examining the records of the doings of the county commissioners, upon the original petition, it is quite apparent that no legal order was ever made, ordering a jury thereon. Such order could only be made after due notice to the corporation, or, what is equivalent, an appearance by them. <em>Central Turnpike, 7 </em>Pick. 13. <em>Hinckley, </em>15 Pick. 447. The order being thus wholly illegal, no duty devolved upon the petitioner to call out the jury, in pursuance of such order; and he might properly treat it as a nullity. The proper order, upon the original petition, has not been made, viz. an-order of notice upon the corporation to show cause why a jury should not be ordered upon the petition. That order it is yet competent for the county commissioners to make. The case is still pending, and the subject of any proper order. If it has not been duly brought forward upon the docket of that crilunal, it may be so now. The petition is undisposed of, and the further proceedings necessary to assess damages by a jury may yet be had thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We think the proper order here will be, that an alternative mandamus issue to the county commissioners of Norfolk, requiring them to issue an order of notice to the Stoughton Branch Rail Road Company to appear before them and show cause why a jury should not be ordered upon the original petition of said Robert Porter, or that said county commissioners show cause for not so doing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
