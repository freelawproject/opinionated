In the early morning hours of July 4, 1993, Eddie Smalls and Orlando Suter were riding in a stolen, white Acura automobile in Bridgeport on their way to a party. Smalls was operating the vehicle, and Suter was sitting in the front passenger seat. As Smalls, whose nickname <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>is \u201cPooch,\u201d approached the area of the party, he saw the defendant and a male, known as \u201cFamous,\u201d sitting in a car. Smalls drove past the car because Suter and the defendant were members of feuding, rival gangs. The defendant then began to follow Smalls and, suspecting that a gunfight would ensue, Smalls and Suter pulled out their handguns. The defendant and at least one other male in the car with the defendant started shooting at Smalls and Suter. Suter was shot and killed as a result of the gunfight.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Later, the defendant was arrested in connection with the murder of Suter. Smalls provided a signed, sworn statement to the police in which he identified the defendant as one of the shooters. A copy of the statement was turned over to the defendant\u2019s attorney. Smalls also made an identification of the defendant through a photographic array after he told the police that he had known the defendant for several years. Smalls was scheduled to be a witness against the defendant at his probable cause hearing. After consulting with his attorney, however, the defendant waived his right to the probable cause hearing in open court. Smalls also was expected to testify against the defendant at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">While awaiting trial, on April 30,1997, the defendant, who was incarcerated at the Walker correctional facility, sent out mail. John Hart, a former correction officer at the facility who monitored the inmates\u2019 mail, intercepted the defendant\u2019s letters. According to Hart, the outgoing mail was collected in such a way that each bundle could have come from only a specific group of cells. From a bundle containing the outgoing mail from the six cells that included the defendant\u2019s, Hart examined an envelope on which was written the defendant\u2019s inmate number and \u201cVassel O\u2019Neil.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Inside that enve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>lope, there was a letter written in English and another envelope. The latter envelope was addressed to Rose Evans<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and contained another letter using some kind of code that Hart believed he deciphered to read as requesting that a man named Wayne kill \u201cPooch,\u201d also known as Smalls. Hart gave those items to his supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Thereafter, the defendant was charged with attempt to commit the murder of Smalls in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a. The defendant\u2019s trial on that charge was consolidated for trial with a second information that charged him with the murder of Suter.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">At trial, James Streeter, a documents examiner for the state police, testified that he had examined the envelope containing the coded letter, the envelope inside that envelope, the letter inside the latter envelope and a handwritten sentence on the reverse side of a page of the coded letter. As a result of his examination, Streeter concluded that they all were written or addressed by the same individual. Michael Birch, a cryptanalyst for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had been asked by the state to decode the coded portion of the letter. Birch testified that the code used was \u201ca simple substitution code,\u201d which means that a letter of the alphabet is substituted with either another letter, a symbol or a number.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Smalls also testified at trial that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>he was called \u201cPooch\u201d and that the defendant knew a Wayne Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">At the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief on the two consolidated cases, the defense counsel made a motion for a judgment of acquittal on both charges, which the trial court denied. Thereafter, the court agreed that the jury would be informed of Suter\u2019s 1992 conviction for having a pistol without a permit and for carrying a dangerous weapon after which the defendant would rest his case. Anticipating that the state would put on a rebuttal case, the defense again made a motion for judgments of acquittal, and again they were denied. On March 2, 1999, the defendant was found guilty of attempt to commit the murder of Smalls, but a mistrial was declared on the charge of murder in connection with Suter\u2019s death because of a deadlocked jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For his conviction of attempt to commit murder, the defendant was sentenced to the custody of the commissioner of correction for a term of twenty years. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of attempt to commit murder because the state presented a case of attempt to incite the injury or the killing of another person. In raising his claim, the defendant predominantly depends on <em>State </em>v. <em>Schleifer, </em>99 Conn. 432, 121 A. 805 (1923), on appeal after remand, 102 Conn. 708, 130 A. 184 (1925), for the proposition that a mere solicitation can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>not constitute an attempt to commit murder. The defendant contends, on the basis of <em>Schleifer, </em>which is in accordance with the great weight of authority, that the evidence is insufficient and, consequently, the judgment must be reversed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Initially, we note that because the defendant did not raise his claim at trial, it is unpreserved. The defendant contends, however, that his claim nonetheless is reviewable in accordance with federal and state precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">We agree with the defendant that his claim is reviewable. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 316, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979), held that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution commands that \u201cno person shall be made to suffer the onus of a criminal conviction except upon sufficient proof \u2014 defined as evidence necessary to convince a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the offense.\u201d On the basis of the holding in <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970), the <em>Jackson </em>court stated that \u201c[t]he constitutional standard recognized in the <em>Winship </em>case was expressly phrased as one that protects an accused against a conviction except on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 315. Inasmuch as <em>In re Winship </em>established proof beyond a reasonable doubt as an essentially fourteenth amendment due process requirement, it follows that when a conviction that is based on insufficient evidence occurs in a state trial, it cannot constitutionally stand. See id., 317-18. \u201cUnpreserved sufficiency claims are reviewable on appeal because such claims implicate a defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right not to be convicted of a crime upon insufficient proof.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Laws, </em>37 Conn. App. 276, 281, 655 A.2d 1131, cert, denied, 234 Conn. 907, 659 A.2d 1210 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">In addition, the defendant argues that the \u201cright to be acquitted unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of the charged offense is a fundamental constitutional right protected by the due process clauses of the federal and Connecticut constitutions. U.S. Const., amend. XIV, Conn. Const., art. I \u00a7 8; see <em>In re Winship </em>[supra, 397 U.S. 364]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 413-14, 473 A.2d 300 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 217, 479 A.2d 814 (1984); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 363, 521 A.2d 150 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>201 Conn. 505, 512, 523 A.2d 1252 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>48 Conn. App. 812, 820-21, 713 A.2d 834, cert, denied, 245 Conn. 921, 717 A.2d 238 (1998). He also argues that <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 443 U.S. 307, was based squarely on that due process requirement, as stated in <em>In re Winship, </em>and that the right to be acquitted unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>doubt of each element of the charged offense also is guaranteed by the due process clause of the Connecticut constitution, article first, \u00a7 8. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 217; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 363; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 512; <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 820-21. The defendant maintains, therefore, that both the United States and Connecticut constitutions guarantee that a defendant\u2019s conviction cannot stand unless it is supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u201cOur Supreme Court has said that <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>[supra, 443 U.S. 307] compels the conclusion that any defendant found guilty on the basis of insufficient evidence has been deprived of a constitutional right, and would therefore necessarily meet the four prongs of <em>[State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989)]. There being no practical significance, therefore, for engaging in a <em>Golding </em>analysis [this court will review] the defendant\u2019s challenge to his conviction [for insufficient evidence] . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>47 Conn. App. 205, 219, 703 A.2d 1164 (1997). Accordingly, we will review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hollby, </em>59 Conn. App. 737, 741, 757 A.2d 1250, cert, denied, 254 Conn. 947, 762 A.2d 905 (2000); see <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 443 U.S. 307. \u201cCriminal convictions will be upheld only when the defendant\u2019s behavior is clearly forbidden by the statute under which he or she has been prosecuted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 222 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>We turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction of attempt to commit murder pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a because what the state presented and prosecuted was a case not of attempt to commit murder, but rather of attempting to incite the injury or the killing of another person in violation of \u00a7 \u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-l 79a.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In making his claim, the defendant maintains that Connecticut common law, in accordance with the great weight of authority, has held that proof that the defendant solicited another to kill a third person is insufficient by itself to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime of attempt to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u201cThere has been much debate whether mere solicitation constitutes an attempt. . . . The question is whether the defendant\u2019s mere act of solicitation should be regarded as an attempt by the defendant to commit the offense. Most courts will answer \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d P. Low, Criminal Law (1984) p. 289. \u201cAlthough there is authority to the contrary, most courts take the Anew that the <em>mere </em>act of <em>solicitation </em>does not constitute an attempt to commit the crime solicited.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 4 F. Wharton, Criminal Law (15th Ed. Torcia 1996) \u00a7 671, p. 525. The legislature, of course, may itself evince an intent that a solicitation be treated as the equivalent of an attempt. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Jovanovic, </em>174 N.J. Super. 435, 438-40, 416 A.2d 961 (1980) (legislative revision of New Jersey Penal Code intended to make solicitation punishable as attempt), affd, 181 N.J. Super. 97, 436 A.2d 938 (App. Div. 1981). \u201cAlthough in some jurisdictions solicitations are tried as indictable attempts, either by virtue of judicial decisions failing to distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>guish them, or by statutory provisions, the great weight of authority is otherwise. Analytically the two crimes are distinct.\u201d F. Sayre, \u201cCriminal Attempts,\u201d 41 Harv. L. Rev. 821, 857-58 (1928). \u201cIt is generally held that a solicitation does not constitute an attempt.\u201d R. Perkins, Criminal Law (2d Ed. 1968) p. 585 &amp; n.66. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Schleifer, </em>supra, 99 Conn. 432, on which the defendant heavily depends, \u201c[t]he contention that solicitation is not a crime distinct from a criminal attempt [was] squarely met and disapproved by the court.\u201d Note, \u201cOrator Urging Acts of Violence Guilty of Solicitation,\u201d 33 Yale L.J. 98 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The facts in <em>Schleifer </em>are worth noting. In that case, the defendant addressed an assemblage of striking railroad workers<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and urged them to commit acts of violence that clearly were felonies and misdemeanors. The information charged that the defendant \u201cdid unlawfully solicit, urge, command, counsel and endeavor to incite, cause and procure some or all of a large number of persons assembled, to the State\u2019s Attorney unknown, to perpetrate or attempt to perpetrate the crimes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>murder, robbery, aggravated assault with deadly or dangerous weapons, assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to rob, the same being felonies or aggravated crimes akin to felonies . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schleifer, </em>supra, 99 Conn. 433-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The trial court quashed the information. Id., 434. In so doing, that court held in part<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that \u201c[w]hile it cannot be seriously denied that the public utterances in a promiscuous assembly of such entreaties and exhortations as are charged in this information, are highly prejudicial to the public peace, and ought to be seriously penalized, it is a situation that should be met by appropriate legislation. I do not feel warranted in view of all the authorities in undertaking to extend the present limitations of the common-law crime of solicitation so as to include the acts of the accused now under consideration.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">At the time that the defendant in <em>Schleifer </em>committed the alleged solicitation, Connecticut had no statute regarding solicitation. Thereafter, and before our Supreme Court decided <em>Schleifer, </em>the legislature, in response to the quashing of the information, enacted such a statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>In <em>Schleifer, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a] mere solicitation by itself is never an attempt. And the inciting or urging, whether it be by a letter or word of mouth, is a <em>mere </em>solicitation, and it does not change its character if the solicitation to crime is accompanied by a bribe as an inducement to its commission.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 438. In determining that \u201c[a] mere solicitation by itself is never an attempt,\u201d the <em>Schleifer </em>court also held that \u201c[a]n attempt necessarily includes the intent [to commit a crime], and also an act of endeavor adapted and intended to effectuate the purpose. . . . The act of endeavor must be some act done in part execution of a design to commit the crime.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. That reasoning gives rise to the inquiry, as <em>Schleifer </em>opined, \u201cof what sort must be the overt act necessary to satisfy the definition of an attempt . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The court in <em>Schleifer </em>reasoned that although it was clear that \u201cthe act need not be the next preceding on proximate act necessary to consummation of the crime intended . . . the mere offer of money, or solicitation, to commit [a crime] is not the sort of act necessary to satisfy the definition [of attempt].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Keeping in mind the previous reference to the language in <em>Schleifer </em>that \u201c[a] mere solicitation by itself is never an attempt\u201d; id.; that analysis aptly is explained in a later decision by the Supreme Court of Idaho in <em>State </em>v. <em>Otto, </em>102 Idaho 250, 254, 629 P.2d 646 (1981). The court in <em>Otto </em>held that \u201c[t]he solicitation of another, assuming neither solicitor nor solicitee proximately acts toward the crime\u2019s commission, cannot be held for an attempt. He does not by his incitement of another to criminal activity commit a dangerously proximate act of perpetration. The extension of attempt liability back to the solicitor destroys the distinction between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>preparation and perpetration.\u201d Id.; see also W. Clark &amp; W. Marshall, Crimes (6th Ed. 1958) \u00a7 4.05, p. 200. The prerequisite to an understanding of the general rule \u201cis the recognition that solicitation is in the nature of the incitement or encouragement of another to commit a crime in the future [and so] it is essentially preparatory to the commission of the offense solicited. Thus, it is essentially preparatory to the commission of the targeted offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Otto, </em>supra, 252 n.4; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>La Fontaine, </em>79 Cal. App. 3d 176, 183, 144 Cal. Rptr. 729 (1978) (holding that mere solicitation does not constitute attempt to commit lewd or lascivious act upon body of child less than fourteen years old because \u201cacts of solicitation constitute preparation only and do not rise to the level of the offense of a criminal attempt\u201d); <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>State, </em>315 So. 2d 546, 548-49 (Fla. App. 1975) (holding that solicitation of another to commit murder does not constitute attempt to commit murder because mere solicitation is not overt act toward attempt to commit murder); <em>Gervin </em>v. <em>State, </em>212 Tenn. 653, 658, 371 S.W.2d 449 (1963) (holding that solicitation of another to commit murder does not constitute attempt to commit murder because \u201c[t]o constitute an attempt there must also be an act of perpetration . . . [and] solicitation is preparation rather than perpetration\u201d [citations omitted]). As we have seen under <em>Schleifer </em>and as two commentators note, \u201c[T]he mere speaking of words is an act, and that is the kind of act which most often completes the crime of solicitation, although the crime may also be committed through the written word.\u201d 2 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) \u00a7 6.1 (c), p. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The <em>Schleifer </em>court appropriately explained that \u201c[i]t is said [that] our court has no right to invent new crimes, and that is true, but it has the right to ascertain and declare the common law, no less the criminal than the civil law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schleifer, </em>supra, 99 Conn. 445. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ther, we note that the court in <em>Schleifer </em>stated that \u201cthe existence of statutes [in other jurisdictions] to punish solicitation to crime as an independent offense [was] a rule declaratory of the common law as [that] has been quite frequently pointed out . . . Id., 441. In that context, the <em>Schleifer </em>court, alluding to statutes existing at the time of its decision, decided to follow the general, common-law rule. Id. Accordingly, our Supreme Court declared, inter alia, that under Connecticut common law, there is a distinction between the crimes of solicitation and attempt. That decision, which established the distinction between the two crimes, derived from analysis of prior precedent and is part of our common law. The <em>Schleifer </em>distinction has remained unchanged and unqualified in our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The defendant contends that the common-law distinction declared in <em>Schleifer </em>still exists and enjoys vitality in our law despite the passage of many years. In so claiming, he also contends that in enacting or revising the solicitation statute, \u00a7 53a-179a, and the attempt statute, \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (1) of the Penal Code, our legislature intended to maintain the common-law distinction, as articulated in <em>Schleifer, </em>between solicitation to commit a crime and an attempt to commit a crime. The defendant goes on to claim, and we agree, that when the Penal Code was revised in 1971, not only had our Supreme Court held that \u201c[a] mere solicitation by itself is never an attempt\u201d; id., 438; although acknowledging that \u201cattempts and solicitations have much in common\u201d; American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1985) part I, \u00a7 5.02, comment (3), p. 373; the legislature nevertheless still decided to enact a separate definition of criminal solicitation. That circumstance tends to support the defendant\u2019s argument for the continued vitality of the distinction made in <em>Schleifer. </em>The defendant offers sound reasons for that assertion, which we now discuss seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Our statutory construction in this case begins with the presumption that the statute and the common law should, where possible, be read in harmony. <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>202 Conn. 566, 573, 522 A.2d 763 (1987). Statutory construction is a question of law, and our review therefore is plenary. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995). \u201cA statute should not be construed as altering the common-law rule, farther than the words of the statute import, and should not be construed as making any innovation upon the common law which the statute does not fairly express.\u201d <em>Skorpios Properties, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Waage, </em>172 Conn. 152, 156, 374 A.2d 165 (1976); see <em>Gore </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>235 Conn. 360, 382, 665 A.2d 1341 (1995); 2A J.

Years later, in the 1960s and culminating in the enactment of our Penal Code,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Connecticut engaged in a sweeping examination and study by a commission appointed to revise and codify the criminal statutes of this state. See 31 Spec. Acts 348, No. 351 (1963), 32 Spec. Acts 323, No. 314 (1965); <em>State </em>v. Kluttz, 9 Conn. App. 686, 717, 521 A.2d 178 (1987) <em>(Bieluch, J., </em>concurring). The commentary of such a commission, interspersed as it is with references to various sections of our Penal Code, may well illuminate our inquiry especially as to evidence of legislative intent.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In its commentary on title 53a, which constitutes our Penal Code, the Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes clearly states, at the outset, in relevant part: \u201cThe Commission Comments which appear herein under the various sections of the Penal Code which was enacted by the 1969 General Assembly, and amended by the 1971 General Assembly, <em>are meant to indicate the rationale, background and source of the various portions of the Code, as an aid to interpretation thereof </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, 28 Connecticut General Statutes Annotated (West 1994) \u00a7 53a-l, commentary on title 53a, the Penal Code, pp. 201-202. That same section of the commentary further notes the commission\u2019s reliance on other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>sources: \u201cThe drafters of the new [penal] code relied heavily upon the Model Penal Code and the various state criminal codes, especially the penal code of New York.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>201 Conn. 505, 516-17, 518 A.2d 388 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u201cOther provisions are based on comparable portions of the Model Penal Code. . . . The comments do not cover every single section; rather, they are an attempt to focus on those sections which, in the opinion of the Commission, require comment.\u201d Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, supra, \u00a7 53a-l, commentary on title 53a, the Penal Code, p. 202. Interestingly, in that connection, there is no commission commentary on \u00a7 53a-179a, the solicitation statute, but there is comment on \u00a7 53a-49, the attempt statute, which indicates that \u00a7 53a-49 incorporates two new concepts, \u201cthe formulation of which is used to distinguish acts of preparation from acts of perpetration and is contrasted with criteria specified in <em>State </em>v. <em>Mazzadra, </em>109 A.2d 873, 141 Conn. 731 (1954).\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Section 53a-49 requires more than a mere start of a line of conduct to constitute an attempt. It requires that the line of conduct already taken be unambiguous in supporting a criminal purpose. Commission to Revise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the Criminal Statutes, supra, \u00a7 53a-49, comment \u2014 1971, p. 378. That is an intentional distinguishing from the <em>Schleifer </em>formulation that \u201c [a] mere solicitation by itself is never an attempt\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Schleifer, </em>supra, 99 Conn. 438; in that there must also be an act of endeavor adapted and intended to effectuate the criminal purpose. Id. Under the new formulation introduced in \u00a7 53a-49, the intent and the overt act, which are verified elements of attempt under the statute, must be closely connected with one another. It is submitted that this distinction between preparation and perpetration inherent in \u00a7 53a-49 is a factor that bolsters the distinction that <em>Schleifer </em>made between a mere solicitation and an attempt, where the latter requires (as a mere solicitation does not) some \u201cact of endeavor adapted and intended to effectuate the purpose [of the solicitation].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 438. Moreover, those new concepts, incorporated into \u00a7 53a-49 by the revisors of the Penal Code, contribute to the vitality of <em>Schleifer\u2019s </em>distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Our attempt statute, \u00a7 53a-49, was based, in part, on the Model Penal Code commission comments. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, </em>59 Conn. App. 362, 372, 757 A.2d 36, cert, denied, 254 Conn. 940, 761 A.2d 764 (2000). The commentary on the Model Penal Code, however, discloses that the issue of whether the solicitation to commit a crime constitutes an attempt has been answered in several ways.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The general definition of \u201ccriminal solici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>tation\u201d is: \u201cA person is guilty of solicitation to commit a crime if with the purpose of promoting or facilitating its commission he commands, encourages or requests another person to engage in specific conduct that would constitute such crime or an attempt to commit such crime or would establish his complicity in its commission or attempted commission.\u201d Model Penal Code and Commentaries, supra, \u00a7 5.02 (1), p. 364. The commentary to \u00a7 5.02 includes the following: \u201cWhile attempts and solicitations have much in common and are closely related in their historical development, this section provides for separate definition of criminal solicitation on the ground that each of the two inchoate offenses [attempt and solicitation] presents problems not pertinent to the other.\u201d Id., \u00a7 5.02, comment (3), pp. 372-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In our view, a fair reading of the commentary is that the Model Penal Code counseled against classifying solicitations as attempts. Id., pp. 364-73. That is further borne out by the fact that the legislature, aware of the solicitation statute when it reconsidered our Penal Code, decided to follow the spirit of a solicitation statute such as \u00a7 5.02 of the Model Penal Code and retained the essence of the preexisting statute. As the defendant points out, the legislature followed that course, knowing, we can assume, that our common law, as seen in <em>Schleifer, </em>maintains that a solicitation is not an attempt and that the Model Penal Code upheld that distinction. The legislature is presumed to be aware and to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>knowledge of all existing statutes, including solicitation, and the effect that its action or inaction may have on them. See <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance </em>Co., 242 Conn. 375, 386, 698 A.2d 859 (1997). Such considerations contribute to the conclusion that the legislature had determined by strong intimation that <em>Schleifer\u2019s </em>judicial distinction was not to be changed in any fashion by legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In further support of his position, the defendant also claims that the inclusion by our legislature of the language, \u201csoliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of the crime\u201d; \u00a7 53a-49 (b) (7); as one of the elements that might be sufficient to prove the \u201cact\u201d element of the criminal attempt statute,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is another factor that supports his claim that the legislature did not intend to abandon the common-law distinction made in <em>Schleifer </em>between solicitation and attempt. We agree with that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In enacting the attempt statute, \u00a7 53a-49, during the revision of our Penal Code in 1969 and 1971, the legislature in subsection (b) of \u00a7 53a-49 elaborated on what is meant by the concept of \u201csubstantial step\u201d as contained in subsection (a) (2) of \u00a7 53a-49. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, supra, \u00a7 5.01, explanatory note, p. 297. The legislature in \u00a7 53a-49 (b) set out a list of behaviors that, without negating the sufficiency of other conduct, \u201cshould not be held insufficient as a matter of law if they are strongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.\u201d Id., comment (6), p. 329. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>last of those listed situations is set out in \u00a7 53-49 (b) (7), which is \u201csoliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The example given in the Model Penal Code and Commentaries of why the language, \u201csoliciting an innocent agent,\u201d was included as one of the seven examples of conduct or a situation that might be sufficient to satisfy the requisite conduct for attempt is an example attributed to Professor Glanville Williams. That example, as given, is: \u201c(vii) <em>Solicitation of Innocent Agent. </em>Professor Glanville Williams suggests the situation where \u2018D unlawfully tells E to set fire to a haystack, and gives him a match to do it with. ... If, as D knows, E (mistakenly) believes that it is D\u2019s stack and that the act is lawful, E is an innocent agent, and D is guilty of attempted arson; D, in instructing E, does the last thing that he intends in order to effect his criminal purpose. (It would be the same if he only used words and did not give E a match.)\u2019 \u201d Model Penal Code and Commentaries, supra, \u00a7 5.01, comment (6) (b) (vii), p. 346 &amp; n.214, quoting G. Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part (2d Ed. 1961) p. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">As the defendant points out, the commentary on Professor Williams\u2019 example explains that \u201c[t]he prohibition against criminal solicitation does not apply in this case because <em>E </em>is himself not being incited to commit a crime. For this reason <em>E </em>is not in a position, as an independent moral agent, to resist <em>D\u2019s </em>inducements; unlike the situation in criminal solicitation, <em>E </em>is wholly unaware that commission of a crime is involved. Analytically, therefore, <em>D\u2019s </em>conduct, in <em>soliciting an innocent agent, </em>is conduct constituting an element of the crime, which is properly subsumed under the attempt section; and the solicitation, irrespective of whether it happens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>to be the last act, should be the basis for finding a substantial step toward the commission of a crime.\u201d (Emphasis added). Model Penal Code and Commentaries, supra, \u00a7 5.01, comment (6) (b) (vii), pp. 346-47. So E, being an \u201cinnocent agent,\u201d wholly unaware that a crime is involved, is not in the position to resist or reject D\u2019s requests; whereas a noninnocent agent, in that situation, knowing this criminal activity is afoot is free to accept or reject D\u2019s requests. The \u201cinnocent agent\u201d can fairly be said to include one who is clear of responsibility because for example, he lacks mens rea; E would fall into that category. Therefore, D\u2019s conduct, in soliciting E, an innocent agent, is conduct constituting an element of the crime, which comes within \u00a7 53a-49 (b) (7) of the attempt section and the solicitations, \u201cirrespective of whether it happens to be the last act, should be the basis for finding a substantial step toward the commission of a crime.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The defendant contends that the inclusion of the \u201cinnocent\u201d agent formulation in \u00a7 53a-49 (b) (7) is a factor that reinforces the common-law distinction between solicitation and attempt. We agree. In detailing a circumstance when a solicitation may rise to the level of an attempt, the legislature created an exception to the general rule that a mere solicitation does not constitute an attempt. Moreover, by specifically including one specific solicitation situation in the attempt statute, it is logical to conclude that the legislature implicitly determined that other forms of solicitation, in and of themselves, do not constitute an attempt to commit a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Another fair implication that our legislature intended to maintain the distinction between attempt and solicitation pursuant to <em>Schleifer </em>arises when considering the comments regarding the \u201cinnocent agent\u201d that accompanied the tentative draft of the Model Penal Code of 1960, which happened to be the one closest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>time available to revisers of a state\u2019s penal codes in the 1960s and 1970s, and the comments to the Penal Code in 1985. Both were to the effect that when a person solicits an \u201cinnocent actor\u201d to engage in conduct that constitutes \u201can element of the crime,\u201d that is \u201cunlike the situation in criminal solicitation\u201d; id., p. 347; but is more like a situation or conduct falling under closer potential attempt liability. That is so, as the defendant claims, and we agree, because the legislature by including the solicitation of an \u201cinnocent agent\u201d in the attempt statute, \u00a7 53a-49, recognized and intended that soliciting a noninnocent agent would not qualify as an attempt but rather would fall within the offense of solicitation, especially because, in soliciting an \u201cinnocent\u201d agent, the actor goes further into criminality than had he solicited a noninnocent agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In addition, the defendant also claims that if our legislature intended to eliminate the common-law distinction between attempt and solicitation, it would have done so under other scenarios. We agree. For example, it could have expressly expanded the attempt statute to include \u201csoliciting an agent, whether innocent or not,\u201d as the legislature in Missouri did. <em>State </em>v. <em>Molasky, </em>765 S.W.2d 597, 600-601 (Mo. 1989). Missouri\u2019s expansion of the definition, according to the commentary to the Missouri attempt statute, was designed to cover <em>all </em>cases of criminal solicitation because solicitation had not previously been enumerated in the revised Missouri Criminal Code as a specific offense. Id., 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">On the other hand, our legislature could have repealed the original statute regarding solicitation, which it did not, <em>and not </em>have enacted \u00a7 53a-179a, which it did. To have taken the latter course would have left this jurisdiction without any criminal solicitation statute, thus rendering the common-law distinction between solicitation and attempt of no legal effect. Our legislature, however, did neither, thereby indicating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>it did not intend to abandon the <em>Schleifer </em>common-law distinction between solicitation and attempt. Those considerations further support the defendant\u2019s claims of the continuing legal validity of the distinction made in <em>Schleifer </em>between solicitation and attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Furthermore, we note that <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, </em>supra, 59 Conn. App. 362, supports the defendant\u2019s claim of the ongoing vitality of <em>Schleifer. </em>In <em>Servello, </em>which involved arson for hire, the defendant had been found guilty after a jury trial of the crime of attempt to commit arson in the second degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (1) and 53a-112 (a) (2). Id., 364. On appeal, the defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because his actions amounted a mere solicitation and, thus, pursuant to <em>Schleifer, </em>could not constitute a substantial step toward the commission of the crime of attempt to commit arson. Id., 368-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim, this court in <em>Servello </em>analyzed the legislative history of \u00a7 53a-112 and concluded that it \u201cwas adopted to confront the problem of fires set to defraud insurance companies or those hiring persons to set such fires . . . [and] made it a crime to hire another person to set a fire.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 373. This court further stated that \u201c[i]t is . . . presumed that [w]hen the Legislature acts in a particular area, it does so with knowledge of and regard to the prior state of the law, including relevant decisions .... It is presumed to know the existing state of the case law in those areas in which it is legislating . . . to be cognizant of judicial decisions relevant to the subject matter of a statute . . . and to know the state of existing relevant law when it enacts a statute. . . . It is thus unlikely that the proscription of arson for \u2018hire\u2019 under the amendment to \u00a7 53a-112 [in Public Acts 1982, No. 82-290] effected no corresponding change to the standard for attempted arson as stated in <em>Schleifer.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>(Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, </em>supra, 59 Conn. App. 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">This court in <em>Servello </em>thus recognized that the legislature, in amending \u00a7 53a-112, was presumed to be cognizant of <em>Schleifer </em>and its holding. That is borne out by the fact that <em>Servello </em>determined \u201cthat <em>Schleifer </em>has been legislatively overruled by P.A. 82-290 to the extent that it held that solicitation of another to set a fire was insufficient to establish the crime of attempt to commit arson . . . .\u201d Id., 374 n.5. The import of <em>Servello </em>to the present matter is that it affirms that our legislature and courts still maintain the vitality of <em>Schleifer. </em>Further, it can be gleaned from <em>Servello </em>that because our legislature decided to eliminate the application of <em>Schleifer </em>in the context of arson, this demonstrates that it intended to preserve <em>Schleifer </em>and the distinction between solicitation and attempt in other areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">It follows from what we have set out, that the judgment of conviction of attempt to commit murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and \u00a7 53a-54a (a), must, as a matter of law, be reversed because the defendant\u2019s conduct did not constitute the crime for which he was charged and tried. When the trier of fact returns a verdict of guilty under such a scenario, that conviction is unconstitutional under both federal and state law, as such a verdict violates due process. See, e.g., <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 443 U.S. 307. \u201cThe right to be acquitted unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of the charged offense is a fundamental constitutional right protected by the due process clauses of the federal and Connecticut constitutions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">In determining that the conviction is not supported by the evidence, we conclude that the defendant has demonstrated that the common-law distinction that our Supreme Court in <em>Schleifer </em>made between solicitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>and attempt is as legally viable as it was when <em>Schleifer </em>was decided and when the precursor to our solicitation statute, \u00a7 53a-179, was enacted into law in 1923. That distinction, which accords with the weight of authority, has persisted for almost eighty years. The state has not persuaded us otherwise. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The state contends that the defendant\u2019s conviction of attempt to commit murder should be upheld because his conduct constituted a substantial step toward the commission of the crime. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">There are two essential elements that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction of the crime of attempt to commit murder. First, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime of murder. Second, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cintentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime. . . . [T]he attempt is complete and punishable, when an act is done with intent to commit the crime, which is adapted to the perpetration of it, whether the purpose fails by reason of interruption ... or for other extrinsic cause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacques, </em>53 Conn. App. 507, 522, 733 A.2d 242 (1999); see also R. Leuba &amp; R. Fracasse, Connecticut Selected Jury Instructions Manual (1998) \u00a7 3.1 (a), p. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The conduct of the defendant consisted of a mere solicitation or a mere preparation \u2014 that is not enough to constitute an attempt. As the court in <em>Schleifer </em>held, \u201cA mere solicitation by itself is never an attempt. And the inciting or urging, whether it be by a letter or word of mouth, is a mere solicitation . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Schleifer, </em>supra, 99 Conn. 438. Again, as the court in <em>Schleifer </em>stated: \u201cAn attempt necessarily includes the intent, and also an act of endeavor adapted and intended to effectuate the purpose. . . . The act of endeavor must be some act done in part execution of a design to commit the crime.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Here, there was no such act of endeavor, only a mere solicitation. In a word, the defendant\u2019s conduct did not include any direct act in execu: tion or perpetration of his alleged criminal design.

The defendant\u2019s principal brief is thirty-five pages long, and about one-third of it is concerned with his <em>Schleifer </em>claim. In his principal brief, the defendant develops and analyzes at great length why <em>Schleifer, </em>which he asserts is still good law, requires that the judgment of conviction be reversed. The state, on the other hand, does not make any mention of <em>Schleifer </em>in its brief, nor does it refer to the defendant\u2019s claim and analysis of it. The state does not even include <em>Schleifer </em>in its \u201cTable of Authorities\u201d at the opening of its brief. In his reply brief, the defendant, citing J. Purver &amp; L. Taylor, Handling Criminal Appeals (1980) \u00a7 91, p. 144, states that \u201c[t]he admission implied in ignoring it <em>[Schleifer] </em>is that the state found no way to minimize the impact of this authority for the defendant-appellant\u2019s claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Despite the gap in the state\u2019s briefing, we do not accept the defendant\u2019s suggestion. Rather, in reviewing this appeal, we subscribe to the view that \u201c[t]he process of deciding cases on appeal involves the joint efforts of counsel and the court. It is only when each branch of the profession performs its function properly that justice can be administered to the satisfaction of both the litigants and society and a body of decisions developed that will be a credit to the bar, the courts and the state . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Merl </em>v. <em>Merl, </em>128 App. Div. 2d 685, 686, 513 N.Y.S.2d 184 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-179a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of inciting injury to persons or property when, in public or private, orally, in writing, in printing or in any other manner, he advocates, encourages, justifies, praises, incites or <em>solicits . . . </em>the killing or injuring of any class or body of persons, or of any individual.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\"> The defendant\u2019s oral address to the workers was as follows: \u201cYou will never win the strike with soft methods.

One approach to the problem treats every solicitation as a specific type of attempt to be governed by ordinary attempt principles, the solicitation being an overt act that alone or together with other overt acts may surpass preparation and result in liability. A second position is that a naked solicitation is not an attempt, but a solicitation accompanied by other overt acts, for example, the offer of a reward or the furnishing of materials, does constitute an attempt. The third view is similar to the second except that in order to find the solicitor guilty of an attempt the other overt acts must proceed beyond what would be called preparation if the solicitor planned to commit the crime himself. Finally, there is the view that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>matter what acts the solicitor commits, he cannot be guilty of an attempt because it is not his purpose to commit the offense personally. Although there has been considerable conflict, even among the decisions of the same jurisdiction, the trend has seemed to be toward the last two solutions; together they represented the prevailing view when the Code was considered. The decisions in England and the former dominions are in a similar state of confusion, but there too the trend has seemed to be against classifying solicitations as attempts and toward treating them as distinct offenses.\u201d Model Penal Code and Commentaries, supra, \u00a7 5.02, comment (2), pp. 368-70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54a-49 (b), which was enacted as part of the revision of the Penal Code, provides in relevant part: \u201cConduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.
