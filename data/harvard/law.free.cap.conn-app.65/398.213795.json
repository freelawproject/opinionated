Murphy, </em>state\u2019s attorney, <em>Susan C.

We agree. Therefore, we reverse the court\u2019s judgment and remand the matter to the trial court for a new dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In 1995, the defendant, after pleading guilty to a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a, operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, received a total effective sentence of three years, execution suspended after 120 days, followed by four years probation. On February 23, 1999, the defendant pleaded guilty to a violation of \u00a7 14-227a. As a result of the conviction, he was charged with a violation of probation. Following a hearing, the court found that the defendant was in violation of the terms of his probation. Thereafter, the court revoked his probation and imposed his sentence. The defendant did not have an opportunity to allocute prior to sentencing. The court declined to hear remarks by the defendant or the witnesses presented on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">We review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim under the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; see <em>State </em>v. <em>McDuffie, </em>51 Conn. App. 210, 216-17, 721 A.2d 142 (1998), cert, denied, 247 Conn. 958, 723 A.2d 814 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">A defendant has the right personally to address the court at the time of sentencing in the dispositional phase of a probation revocation hearing. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>243 Conn. 339, 354, 703 A.2d 109 (1997); see also Practice Book \u00a7 43-10 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The judgment is reversed only as to the imposition of the sentence and the case is remanded for further proceedings, before a different judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>court should allow the defendant to exercise his right of allocution prior to the court\u2019s imposition of sentence. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\"> On appeal, both parties seek resentencing before a different judicial authority. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hedman, </em>62 Conn. App. 403, 415, 772 A.2d 603, cert, granted on other grounds, 256 Conn. 909, 772 A.2d 602 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
