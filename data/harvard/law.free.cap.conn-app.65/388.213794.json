(Cargill), and on the jury verdict in favor of the defendants Jarred Cutler, Robert R. Stalsburg and Stalsburg Express, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) directed a verdict in favor of Cargill, and (2) allowed the plaintiff to be questioned concerning prior bad acts or misconduct when the defense counsel did not have a good faith basis for inquiring about such issues, and such issues were highly prejudicial in relation to their probative value. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The following facts are relevant to the plaintiffs appeal. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging that on June 15, 1995, she was a passenger in a vehicle owned by Cargill and operated by the defendant Tobey J. Falco, which was involved in an accident with a vehicle owned by Stalsburg and operated by Cutler. The plaintiff alleged that at the time of the accident, the vehicle operated by Falco had been rented to the defendant Jeffrey Stachura.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff alleged that Falco was using the vehicle with the express or implied permission of Cargill and the express permission of Stachura. The plaintiff alleged that the accident was caused by the negligence of Falco or Cutler or both in the operation of their motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">At trial, the plaintiff presented evidence to establish the following facts. Prior to the accident in question, Falco and Stachura, Falco\u2019s former fiance, had purchased a 1991 Subaru Loyale motor vehicle from Cargill with an extended warranty. When the timing belt broke on that vehicle, Stachura called Cargill and was told that he could get a \u201cloaner\u201d vehicle, a 1995 Geo Prizm. On June 14, 1995, Stachura obtained the Prizm from Cargill. Stachura later told Falco that, according to Car-gill, he was the only person authorized to drive the vehicle. Falco called Brandon Walsh, the salesman at Cargill who had sold them the 1991 Subaru Loyale. Walsh told Falco that if the vehicle was insured to her, she was authorized to drive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On June 15,1995, Falco drove the Prizm to an appointment in Norwich. The plaintiff and her son were passengers in Falco\u2019s vehicle. After the appointment, as Falco was traveling on Interstate 395, she was involved in an accident with a vehicle owned by Stalsburg and operated by Cutler.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>At the conclusion of the plaintiffs case, the court granted Cargill\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury subsequently found in favor of the plaintiff as against Falco and awarded her $40,000 in damages. The jury further found in favor of the defendants Cutler and Stalsburg. The court denied the plaintiffs motion for additur or to set aside the verdict and the plaintiff filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly directed a verdict in favor of Cargill. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The following facts are necessary to our resolution of the plaintiffs claim. With regard to Cargill, the plaintiff alleged liability pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-183<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 14-154a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In granting Cargill\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, the court stated that it was not considering Cargill\u2019s liability under \u00a7 52-183 because of the plaintiffs concession that Falco was not an employee or agent of the owner. The court further held that Cargill was not liable pursuant to \u00a7 14-154a. The plaintiff challenges that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u201cOur standard of review of a directed verdict is well settled. A trial court should direct a verdict for a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>dant if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a jury could not reasonably and legally reach any other conclusion than that the defendant is entitled to prevail. ... In assessing the evidence, the court should weigh both direct and circumstantial evidence, including all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Harewood </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>63 Conn. App. 199, 202-203, 772 A.2d 764 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We first consider whether the court properly refused to impose liability on Cargill pursuant to \u00a7 52-183 on the basis of the concession made by counsel for the plaintiff during oral argument on Cargill\u2019s motion. \u201cSection 52-183 creates a rebuttable presumption that the operator of a motor vehicle is the agent and servant of the owner of the motor vehicle and operating it in the course of his employment. The presumption ceases to operate, however, when the trier finds proven facts which fairly put in issue the question, and the burden of proving that the car . . . was operated by an agent of the owner . . . then rests upon the plaintiff . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Felsted </em>v. <em>Kimberly Auto Services, Inc., </em>25 Conn. App. 665, 670, 596 A.2d 14, cert, denied, 220 Conn. 922, 597 A.2d 342 (1991). At oral argument on Cargill\u2019s motion, counsel for the plaintiff stated that he was not claiming that Falco was an employee or agent of Cargill under the statute. Counsel indicated that he was claiming only that Falco was operating the vehicle with the express permission of the owner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Counsel for Cargill then proceeded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>address his argument with regard to \u00a7 14-154a. That concession was not withdrawn during the remainder of the argument on Cargill\u2019s motion. In rendering its oral decision, the court stated that \u201c\u00a7 52-183 is out because there is a concession that she was not \u2014 it has not been proven that [Falco] was an employee or servant of the owner, and that\u2019s the requirement here.\u201d On the basis of the record before us, and considering the representations made by counsel for the plaintiff to the court, we conclude that the court properly determined that Cargill could not be held liable to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 52-183.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We next consider whether the court properly granted Cargill\u2019s motion with respect to \u00a7 14-154a. That statute provides that \u201c[a]ny person renting or leasing to another any motor vehicle owned by him shall be liable for any damage to any person or property caused by the operation of such motor vehicle while so rented or leased, to the same extent as the operator would have been liable if he had also been the owner.\u201d Our Supreme Court has \u201cconsistently construed the statute as imposing on one who rents or leases a motor vehicle to another the same liability as that of its operator, provided the vehicle, at the time in question, is being operated by one <em>in lawful possession of it pursuant to the terms of the contract of rental.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pedevillano </em>v. <em>Bryon, </em>231 Conn. 265, 268, 648 A.2d 873 (1994). The court in <em>Pedevillano </em>\u201crejected the plaintiffs contention that \u00a7 14-154a imposes unlimited liability on any lessor for injuries caused by a person who uses the vehicle with the permission of an authorized lessee. . . . <em>Pedevillano </em>makes clear that the lessor is not liable under the statute even when the lessee allows another party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>to drive the vehicle.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Blackwell </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>45 Conn. App. 26, 31, 692 A.2d 862 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The rental agreement in the present case, for the 1995 Geo Prizm, was signed only by Stachura. Falco is not listed as an additional authorized user under the contract. The contract prohibited the use of the vehicle by additional drivers except under limited circumstances that do not exist in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court, therefore, properly concluded that Falco was not an authorized driver under the express terms of the rental contract between Stachura and Cargill.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The court considered the further issue of whether Falco was an authorized driver of the vehicle on the basis of the testimony that Walsh, the salesman employed by Cargill, had told Falco that she could drive the vehicle if it was covered by her insurance. The court phrased the issue as follows: \u201cWas there a modification or a subsequent lease agreement made by the conversation that Tobey Falco said occurred?\u201d In holding that there was no such modification, the court stated that no evidence had been presented that Walsh had express or apparent authority to lease vehicles for Cargill. We agree with the court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u201cApparent authority is that semblance of authority which a principal, through his own acts or inadvertences, causes or allows third persons to believe his agent possesses. . . . Consequently, apparent authority is to be determined, not by the agent\u2019s own acts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>but by the acts of the agent\u2019s principal. . . . The issue of apparent authority is one of fact to be determined based on two criteria. . . . First, it must appear from the principal\u2019s conduct that the principal held the agent out as possessing sufficient authority to embrace the act in question, or knowingly permitted [the agent] to act as having such authority. . . . Second, the party dealing with the agent must have, acting in good faith, reasonably believed, under all the circumstances, that the agent had the necessary authority to bind the principal to the agent\u2019s action.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>226 Conn. 704, 734-35, 629 A.2d 333 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The only evidence presented by the plaintiff to support her claim was the testimony of Falco. Falco testified that when she called Cargill, Walsh told her that \u201cif the car was insured to [her], [she] had every right to drive it.\u201d The plaintiff did not call any individuals associated with Cargill to testify at trial. We agree with the court that without such evidence, the plaintiff failed to establish that Walsh had express or apparent authority to lease vehicles or to modify the rental agreement entered into by Cargill and Stachura.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the court properly granted Cargill\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">After the court granted the directed verdict in favor of Cargill, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff as against Falco in the amount of $40,000. The jury also returned a verdict in favor of Cutler and Stalsburg. The plaintiffs second issue on appeal is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>court improperly allowed her to be questioned concerning prior bad acts or misconduct when the defense counsel did not have a good faith basis for inquiring about such issues, and such issues were highly prejudicial in relation to their probative value. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The following facts are necessary to our resolution of the plaintiffs claim. Prior to the start of evidence, the plaintiff filed a motion in limine, seeking to preclude the admission of evidence that she had ever engaged in shoplifting. The court denied the motion. Cutler and Stalsburg filed a pleading titled, \u201cMotion Regarding Questioning of Heidi Schimmelpfennig,\u201d in which they requested permission to question the plaintiff on cross-examination regarding her involvement in a larceny that occurred on June 15, 1995. The court granted that motion and indicated that the defendants would not be allowed to introduce extrinsic evidence in that regard. During cross-examination of the plaintiff at trial, counsel for Cutler and Stalsburg asked the plaintiff whether merchandise found in the trunk of the car driven by Falco had been shoplifted. The plaintiff denied that the merchandise had been shoplifted,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and counsel proceeded to question her on issues unrelated to shoplifting. No curative instruction was requested, and none was given. The plaintiff argues on appeal that she suffered \u201charmful prejudice\u201d by that line of questioning because the basis for it was unreliable and because prejudice was planted in the jurors\u2019 minds concerning her allegedly bad character. We disagree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u201cThe right to cross-examine a witness concerning specific acts of misconduct is limited in three distinct ways. First, cross-examination may only extend to specific acts of misconduct other than a felony conviction if those acts bear a special significance upon the issue of veracity .... Second, [wjhether to permit cross-examination as to particular acts of misconduct . . . lies largely within the discretion of the trial court. . . . Third, extrinsic evidence of such acts is inadmissible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Chance, 236 Conn. 31, 60, 671 A.2d 323 (1996); see also <em>Martyn </em>v. <em>Donlin, </em>151 Conn. 402, 408, 198 A.2d 700 (1964) (\u201c[i]n an attack on [an adversary\u2019s] credit, inquiry may be made, in the discretion of the court, as to particular acts of misconduct tending to show a lack of veracity, even though such evidence might be irrelevant to the issues in the case\u201d); Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-6 (b). \u201cIt is generally held that larcenous acts tend to show a lack of veracity. ... It does not follow, however, that if the acts inquired about are indicative of a lack of veracity, the court must permit the cross-examination. Whether to permit it lies largely within the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Martin, 201 Conn. 74, 87, 513 A.2d 116 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">In the present case, on the basis of deposition testimony of Stachura, counsel for Cutler and Stalsburg had a good faith basis for inquiring into the possibility that the plaintiff had shoplifted just prior to the accident on June 15, 1995. Stachura had stated in his deposition that he believed that the plaintiff and Falco had been shoplifting on the date of the accident. Although the plaintiff claims that she was prejudiced by that questioning, she did not request a curative or limiting instruction, and there was no further mention of shoplifting. Further, although the plaintiff claims that the inquiry tainted her credibility in the eyes of the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the jury awarded her $40,000 in damages. We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting counsel for Cutler and Stalsburg to question the plaintiff on prior misconduct reflecting on her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> For purposes of this opinion, we refer to Robert R. Stalsburg and Stalsburg Express, Inc., as Stalsburg.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"> The action against Stachura subsequently was withdrawn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> Although Cargill referred to the motion as a motion for judgment of dismissal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 15-8, the parties and the court treated it as a motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-183 provides: \u201cPresumption of agency in motor vehicle operation.
