We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">We glean the following facts and procedural history from the court\u2019s memorandum of decision and from the record. The plaintiffs own a 2.56 acre parcel at 145 Mountain Road (property) in Redding. The plaintiffs occupied the premises in 1978 and acquired title to the property on July 20, 1982. The property is located in a R-2 zone, formerly known as \u201cResidential and Farming District A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">On October 21, 1998, the zoning officer wrote to the plaintiffs, requesting that they file a land management plan and that they observe the twenty-five foot setback of paddocks mandated by the zoning regulations. The plaintiffs did not submit a management plan. On February 11,1999, the zoning officer issued a cease and desist order to the plaintiffs for the following alleged violations of the zoning regulations. First, the paddocks on the north end of their property did not conform with the twenty-five foot setback requirement and, second, the plaintiffs had failed to submit a management plan to the zoning commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The plaintiffs on February 25, 1999, filed an appeal with the zoning board from the cease and desist order. On March 16, 1999, the zoning board denied their appeal, and upheld the cease and desist order. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>plaintiffs then appealed to the trial court from that decision. On July 23,1999, the court issued a permanent injunction against the plaintiffs, enjoining them from permitting any of the following conditions to exist on their property: (1) \u201cthe simultaneous maintenance of more than nine horses on the premises, unless the [plaintiffs] shall apply for and receive approval for a land management plan pursuant to the zoning regulations of the town of Redding permitting more than such number of horses; for the purposes of this injunction only, the [plaintiffs] shall be considered to have maintained a particular horse on the premises if such horse remains on the premises overnight,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe existence of any signs on the premises except as expressly permitted by the zoning regulations of the town of Redding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">On January 7, 2000, the court upheld the decision of the zoning board, ordering the plaintiffs to submit a land management plan within forty-five days of the date of that judgment, and to cease and desist from the violation of the twenty-five foot setback regulation. On January 31,2000, the plaintiffs filed a petition for certification to this court, which was granted. The plaintiffs subsequently filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In reviewing the actions of a zoning board, we note that local zoning boards are vested with a liberal discretion. <em>Wnuk </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>225 Conn. 691, 695, 626 A.2d 698 (1993). \u201cThe burden of proof to demonstrate that the board acted improperly is upon the party seeking to overturn the board\u2019s decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pleasant View Farms Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>218 Conn. 265, 269-70, 588 A.2d 1372 (1991). \u201cA trial court must . . . review the decision of a zoning board of appeals to determine if the board acted arbitrarily, illegally or unreasonably.\u201d <em>Wnuk </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 695-96. \u201cIt is well settled that courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>axe not to substitute their judgment for that of the board, and that the decisions of local boards will not be disturbed as long as honest judgment has been reasonably and fairly made after a full hearing . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Conetta </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>42 Conn. App. 133, 137-38, 677 A.2d 987 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Because the trial court, in this case, has made conclusions of law, our review is plenary. <em>Fleet National Bank </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>54 Conn. App. 135, 139, 734 A.2d 592, cert, denied, 250 Conn. 930, 738 A.2d 656 (1999); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>248 Conn. 183, 189, 728 A.2d 493 (1999). \u201c[W]e must decide whether the conclusions are legally and logically correct and supported by the facts in the record.\u201d <em>Fleet National Bank </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The plaintiffs first claim that the zoning commission is barred by the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel from asserting zoning violations that it has litigated or had the opportunity to litigate in a prior zoning action against them. Specifically, the plaintiffs assert that the stipulated judgment in the prior zoning action requires them to submit a land management plan <em>only if </em>they maintain more than nine horses on their property. Additionally, they assert that the alleged setback violation should have been raised in the prior zoning action and, because it was not, the zoning commission is thereby precluded from raising that claim in the present action. We do not reach the merits of this claim due to an inadequate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The court\u2019s memorandum of decision is silent as to the arguments concerning res judicata and collateral estoppel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the plaintiffs did not seek an articulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>from the court in that regard. It is the appellant\u2019s duty to furnish this court with a record that is adequate to afford review. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Absent an articulation of the court\u2019s reasoning, we are unable to review the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second claim is that the zoning commission<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is prohibited from enforcing against them a 1975 setback regulation that is not part of the current regulations that were adopted in 1986. They further claim that the paddock located on the north side of their property predates the adoption of the 1975 regulation, constitutes a prior nonconforming use and is, therefore, not subject to the regulations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Section IV H (2) of the 1975 zoning regulations established a setback requirement of twenty-five feet for \u201ccorrals, runs or similar enclosures.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>On the other hand, \u00a7 5.14.6 of the 1986 zoning regulations provides that animal enclosures must be set back at least fifty feet from all watercourses, and side and rear lot lines.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>The court found that no direct evidence was presented to establish the existence of the plaintiffs\u2019 paddock prior to the adoption of the 1975 regulation. Rather, the record supported the zoning board\u2019s finding that the paddock was built after the 1975 regulation was adopted. As such, the plaintiffs do not have a nonconforming use that would exempt them from conforming to the 1975 regulation. They do not need to comply with the 1986 regulation requiring a fifty foot setback because the plaintiffs\u2019 use became nonconforming subsequent to the twenty-five foot regulation but prior to the fifty foot regulation. Accordingly, the plaintiffs must comply with the 1975 regulation requiring them to abide by a twenty-five foot setback of enclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 third claim is that the application of a zoning regulation requiring a land management plan for a prior nonconforming use violates General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 (a) and \u00a7 5.17 of the zoning regulations, which protect nonconforming uses. That claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We begin our analysis by reviewing the relevant parts of the statute and. regulation cited by the plaintiffs. Section 8-2 prohibits a municipality from preventing the continuance of a nonconforming use.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 5.17 of the zoning regulations provides in relevant part: \u201cIf a lot, building, structure, or use. of a site was lawfully in existence on the effective date of these Regulations [February 1, 1986] (or on the date of an amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>thereto), to the extent that such lot, building, structure or use did not then conform to these Regulations the same is deemed legally <em>nonconforming </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Additional regulations that are instrumental in our resolution of this issue are zoning regulations \u00a7\u00a7 5.14.2 and 5.14.3. The land management plan regulation, specifically \u00a7 5.14.2, requires that a management plan be approved by the zoning commission for animal raising operations where the number of horses, among other animals, exceeds the stated limit of two horses per lot and one horse per each 0.8 acre of site area. Section 5.14.3 permits the zoning commission to approve a management plan only when no adverse impact will result.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Our case law makes clear that generally a municipality can regulate a nonconforming use.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cRegulation of a nonconforming use does not, in itself, abrogate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>property owner\u2019s right to his nonconforming use. . . . A town is not prevented from regulating the operation of a nonconforming use under its police powers. Uses which have been established as nonconforming uses are not exempt from all regulation merely by virtue of that status. It is only when an ordinance or regulatory act abrogates such a right in an unreasonable manner, or in a manner not related to the public interest, that it is invalid. <em>Petruzzi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>176 Conn. 479, 483-84, 408 A.2d 243 (1979); <em>Lampasona </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>6 Conn. App. 237, 239, 504 A.2d 554 (1986).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 221, 242-43, 662 A.2d 1179 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Here, the plaintiffs have appealed from the decision of the court that upheld the right of the zoning board to require the plaintiffs to file a management plan for the continued operation of a horse farm. The record is clear that the plaintiffs\u2019 maintenance of nine horses on their property predated the adoption of the management plan regulation and, thus, constitutes a nonconforming use. The town of Redding has the right, under its police powers, to require a land management plan although it cannot attenuate the scope of the plaintiffs\u2019 nonconforming use. The town of Redding has not sought to diminish the lawful, nonconforming utilization of the property, but concedes that it cannot prohibit the continuation of a valid nonconforming use. The plaintiffs argue that because of the nonconforming use of their land, they should be exempted from that form of regulation. We disagree, and determine, as did the trial court,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that the plaintiffs are required to file a land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>management plan with the zoning commission and that, by doing so, their nonconforming use will not be lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 fourth claim is that \u00a7 19a-341 bars the zoning commission from requiring a land management plan for farm property. The plaintiffs maintain that under \u00a7 19a-341, notwithstanding any municipal ordinance, their farm cannot constitute a nuisance with respect to, inter alia, odor, noise and dust. They further claim that the requirement of a management plan must be consistent with \u00a7 5.3<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the zoning regulations, which sets out standards for, inter alia, odor, noise and dust. The plaintiffs contend, therefore, that the requirement of a management plan \u201cwould impose upon [them] strict limits with respect to these matters which, if violated, would constitute a public nuisance in contravention of [\u00a7 19a-341].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Section 19a-341 protects certain agricultural and farming operations from being deemed nuisances. That statute provides in relevant part that \u201c[notwithstanding any general statute or municipal ordinance or regulation pertaining to nuisances to the contrary, no agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment or facility, or any of its appurtenances, or the operation thereof, shall be deemed to constitute a nuisance, either public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>or private, due to alleged objectionable [odor, noise, dust, use of chemicals or water pollution] . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-341 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 argument misses the mark. First, while \u00a7 19a-341 may preempt municipal ordinances, it is limited to nuisance ordinances, which are not at issue in this case. Second, as the court properly concluded, the town of Redding exercises legitimate police powers with regard to \u00a7 5.3 of the zoning regulations and does not violate \u00a7 19a-341 because the plaintiffs\u2019 property has not been declared a nuisance. Accordingly, because \u00a7 19a-341 does not apply to the present circumstances, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that the doctrine of municipal estoppel prohibits the town of Redding from enforcing its regulations. The plaintiffs assert that the twenty-five foot setback regulation is unenforceable as to them because of various statements made by municipal officers and employees that the paddock was legally nonconforming and, thus, permissible. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Two essential elements must be proven to establish municipal estoppel. First, \u201cthe party against whom estoppel is claimed must do or say something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on that belief . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dornfried </em>v. <em>October Twenty-Four, Inc., </em>230 Conn. 622, 635, 646 A.2d 772 (1994). Second, \u201cthe other party must change its position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Municipal estoppel is invoked only (1) with great caution, (2) when the resulting violation has been unjustifiably induced by an agent who has authority to handle such matters and (3) in special circumstances where it would be highly inequitable or oppressive to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the regulations. <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 344, 354, 365 A.2d 1093 (1976). Generally, municipal estoppel <em>may not be invoked against a public agency </em>in the exercise of its governmental functions. <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>157 Conn. 548, 556, 254 A.2d 898 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stonybrook, </em>Inc., 149 Conn. 492, 501, 181 A.2d 601, cert, denied, 371 U.S. 185, 83 S. Ct. 265, 9 L. Ed. 2d 227 (1962). An exception to that rule exists, however, for the party claiming estoppel who would suffer a substantial loss as a result of the municipality nullifying the acts of its agents. <em>Dornfried </em>v. <em>October Twenty-Four, Inc., </em>supra, 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The plaintiffs were required, therefore, to show that the agents of the town of Redding acted to induce their reliance and that the plaintiffs relied on the town\u2019s actions to their detriment to such an extent that enforcement of the town\u2019s zoning regulation would be \u201chighly inequitable or oppressive.\u201d <em>Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Lescynski, </em>188 Conn. 724, 732, 453 A.2d 1144 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The court, in regard to this claim, determined that no evidence had been presented to show that the paddock was constructed at the direction of any municipal officer or that the plaintiffs would suffer a hardship if the twenty-five foot setback requirement were enforced. The court further noted that \u201c[a]t best, the comments and opinions of Redding officials indicate acquiescence to the location of the paddocks, or a belief arrived at without the benefit of a hearing, that the paddock area was legally nonconforming.\u201d The court properly found that those facts could not form the basis of a successful claim of municipal estoppel and, therefore, concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to sustain their burden of proving municipal estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We agree with the court\u2019s conclusion and determine that the plaintiffs have offered no evidence that they would suffer a substantial loss if the town of Redding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>enforced the regulation. Likewise, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the enforcement of the twenty-five foot setback requirement would make it \u201chighly inequitable or oppressive.\u201d Id. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs did not establish the elements necessary for the invocation of the doctrine of municipal estoppel. Accordingly, the defendants are entitled to enforce the twenty-five foot setback regulation against the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-12\"> In their appeal to the trial court from the zoning board\u2019s decision, the plaintiffs also named as defendants Edward J. Fenwick and Miriam J. Messe, whose property abuts that of the plaintiffs. On appeal, Fenwick and Messe have adopted the brief that was filed by the zoning board and the zoning officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\"> In its memorandum of decision, the court did state the following: \u201cWhile the town [of Redding] may not have alleged a violation of the setback provision during legal action initiated against the plaintiffs ... a delay in enforcing a regulation will not estop a municipality from exercising its police powers. <em>Ackley </em>v. <em>Kenyon, </em>152 Conn. 392, 397 [207 A.2d 265] (1965).\u201d That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>statement coupled with the reference to <em>Ackley, </em>however, refers to the doctrine of municipal estoppel, not to the principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\"> It should be noted that the plaintiffs did not name the zoning commission as a defendant in this action. We nonetheless address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim regarding the zoning commission because the zoning officer is a party to this appeal and has the authority to enforce regulations. General Statutes \u00a7 8-12 specifically permits a zoning officer to enforce regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-11\"> Section IVII (2) of the 1975 Redding zoning regulations provides: \u201cAnimal shelters, coops and similar structures shall not be located closer than fifty (50) feet from an afijacent property line.
