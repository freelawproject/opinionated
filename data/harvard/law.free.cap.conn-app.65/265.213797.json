Gelinas, appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>from the judgment of the trial court, rendered after the case was remanded by our Supreme Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ordering him to pay daily civil fines for the violation of that statute. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) imposed a daily fine on him in violation of \u00a7 8-12, (2) imposed on him a fine in excess of $2500 in violation of \u00a7 8-12, (3) computed the time frame for which the daily fine was assessed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (4) awarded costs and attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant town of West Hartford (town)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pursuant to \u00a7 8-12,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (5) denied his motion of October 14,1994, to set aside the judgment and (6) violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy by imposing on him a fine in excess of $108,000. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">This case has its genesis in an action that the plaintiff instituted in 1990, seeking a writ of mandamus ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the town to issue a certificate of zoning approval for his revised site plan in connection with work at premises he owns at 119-121 Park Road, West Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">By way of background to the mandamus action, we note the following facts. Since 1986, the plaintiff has owned a two story building at 119-121 Park Road. Those premises formerly had been owned by a fraternal organization, and had been used for large indoor meetings and events. During the early part of 1987, the plaintiff made alterations to the building, including the removal of a first floor assembly hall stage, and the construction of two floors of offices in place of the stage and a part of the assembly hall. After the plaintiff completed the modifications, on June 24, 1987, he applied for a building permit to make changes to the interior of the building. Town officials, believing that the proposed changes constituted a change in use, inspected the property and found that much of the work for which the permit was sought already had been completed, and was in violation of the town\u2019s zoning ordinances and the building code. Town officials thereupon posted \u201cdo not occupy\u201d and \u201cstop work\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> orders at the site, and notified the plaintiff that he was in violation of the zoning and building codes, and that he was required to obtain site plan approval, permits and inspections. The date of that order was June 29, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">A prosecution for the building code violations was initiated in the Housing Session of the Superior Court. The Housing Session ordered the plaintiff to return the building to its prior condition. The plaintiff later was arrested on the building code violations and, on January 21, 1988, the Housing Session, after accepting his plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>of nolo contendere, fined him $500 and granted him accelerated rehabilitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The revised site plan was not approved, denied or modified, and in June, 1990, the plaintiff and Morton Weiner,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> who owned property adjacent to that of the plaintiff, brought the mandamus action against the town.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the mandamus action, the plaintiff and Weiner sought a certificate of approval for their February 29, 1988 joint revised site plan application pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (g)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 8-7d,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which provides that a site plan is pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>sumed to be approved unless a decision to deny or modify is rendered within sixty-five days after receipt of the application. Both the plaintiff and Weiner were denied any relief by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The town, however, had filed a counterclaim in the mandamus action. It alleged that the plaintiff had altered the building without first obtaining site plan approval and building permits, that he had utilized the building without obtaining a certificate of occupancy and that he had failed to comply with orders to discontinue or remedy the zoning violations. Pursuant to \u00a7 8-12, the town sought injunctive relief, the imposition of certain fines, and the payment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court ordered<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> much of the relief sought by the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Thereafter, the plaintiff and Weiner appealed to the Supreme Court. The town filed a cross appeal. In his appeal, the plaintiff claimed, inter alia, that the trial court improperly (1) rejected his claim that the town\u2019s failure to render a decision on the site plan application resulted in automatic approval of that application pursuant to \u00a7 8-3 (g) and \u00a7 8-7d, (2) concluded that he and Weiner were not entitled to a writ of mandamus directing the town to grant their site plan application, (3) issued an injunction against him pursuant to \u00a7 8-12 in favor of the town on its counterclaim, (4) found that the evidence was sufficient to support its decision to grant the injunctive relief, pursuant to \u00a7 8-12, as requested by the town, (5) failed to conclude that the town was estopped from seeking an injunction and (6) abused its discretion by refusing to open the judgment in which it assessed a daily fine of $100 from June 29, 1987, to June 15,1990, for the \u201cwilful violation\u201d of zoning ordinances pursuant to \u00a7 8-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The Supreme Court rejected all of the plaintiffs claims with the exception of the issue that he raised concerning the daily fine of $100 for \u201cwilful violation.\u201d As to that claim, which was resolved in favor of the plaintiff, the Supreme Court reversed in part the judgment of the trial court and \u201cremand[ed] the case to that court with direction to vacate the daily fine of $100 for \u2018wilful offenses\u2019 and to impose such civil penalties pursuant to \u00a7 8-12 as the trial court may deem appropriate in the proper exercise of its discretion.\u201d <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>225 Conn. 575, 593, 626 A.2d 259 (1993).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>In its cross appeal, the town claimed that the trial court improperly denied its request for an injunction against the use change in the basement of the plaintiffs building that was in violation of \u00a7 177-39 of the West Hartford Code. The Supreme Court agreed with the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In articulating its ultimate disposition of each appeal in its May 25, 1993 decision, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cWe conclude, therefore, that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to render judgment entitling the town to injunctive relief from the unauthorized business use of the basement. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court on this issue and remand the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the town consistent with this opinion. We leave it to the discretion of the trial court to fashion the scope of the injunctive relief to which the town is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u201cThe judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the judgment is reversed with respect to the town\u2019s appeal, and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\u201d Id., 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">After the release of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gelinas, </em>the town filed a motion dated November 13, 1993, in the trial court for judgment consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion. A hearing was held on that motion on June 16,1994.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At the outset of that hearing, the court noted that subsequent to the remand in <em>Gelinas, </em>the parties had entered into a stipulation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>court pointed out, the only matter left unresolved by the stipulation was \u201cthe question of daily fines [which were covered in paragraph three of the stipulation.]\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In its original orders of May 31, 1991, paragraph four provided the following: \u201cThe [plaintiff] shall pay $100 per day from June 29, 1987, to June 15, 1990, as a fine for his unlawful alteration of the structure without zoning and building permits at 119 Park Road and for his unlawful maintenance and use of the rooms in the first floor for offices without authorization, permits or a certificate of occupancy; such fine shall be for the wilful violation of the zoning regulations pursuant to \u00a7 8-12 of the General Statutes from June 29,1987, when the [plaintiff] was ordered to obtain site plan approval for any changed uses in order to apply for and be issued building permits pursuant to \u00a7 177-6 [of the West Hartford Code], to June 15, 1990, when he filed an application for an order in the nature of a mandamus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">After the court heard the parties on the matter, it opined that the \u201c$2500 cap\u201d proviso in \u00a7 8-12 \u201cdoes not apply in this situation.\u201d It also concluded that the Supreme Court in <em>Gelinas </em>did not conclude that the time period that it had used for the original imposition of the daily fine in 1991, i.e., from June 29, 1987, to June 15, 1990, was improper. The court stated that \u201cto follow the judgment of the Supreme Court . . . the court is . . . going to vacate the $100 per day fine for wilful violation.\u201d It then proceeded to alter the 1991 order by deleting the phrase, \u201cfor the wilful violation of the zoning regulations.\u201d Proceeding, the court ordered that the word \u201ccivil\u201d be inserted before the word \u201cfine\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and stated that \u201c[s]uch civil fine shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 8-12 of the General Statutes.\u201d Thereafter, the plaintiff filed his motion dated October 14, 1994, to set aside the court\u2019s judgment of June 16, 1994, on the ground that it violated the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution and the excessive fine clause of the eighth amendment to the United States constitution. The court denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly imposed a daily fine on him in violation of \u00a7 8-12. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that \u00a7 8-12 does not permit the imposition of daily fines in civil actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u201cStatutory interpretation is a question of law and, therefore, our review is plenary.\u201d <em>National Loan Investors Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Heritage Square Associates, </em>54 Conn. App. 67, 71, 733 A.2d 876 (1999). \u201c \u2018In construing any statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vaillancourt v.

Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). \u201c The construction of a statute depends upon its expressed intent when it is taken as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burney, </em>189 Conn. 321, 326, 455 A.2d 1335 (1983), quoting <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Fafnir Bearing Co., </em>148 Conn. 87, 90, 167 A.2d 458 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In considering statutory construction, it is prudent to be mindful that \u201c \u2018[p]rimarily, it is for the legislature, which is the arbiter of public policy, to determine what it shall be.\u2019 \u201d <em>Local 1303 &amp; Local 1378 </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>191 Conn. 173, 179, 463 A.2d 613 (1983), quoting <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Mulquin, </em>134 Conn. 118, 132, 55 A.2d 732 (1947). A statute, of course, should not be interpreted to thwart its purpose. <em>Narel </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>185 Conn. 562, 571, 441 A.2d 177 (1981), cert, denied, 456 U.S. 928, 102 S. Ct. 1974, 72 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1982); <em>Kron </em>v. <em>Thelen, </em>178 Conn. 189, 192, 423 A.2d 857 (1979); <em>Second Injury Fund </em>v. <em>Lupachino, </em>45 Conn. App. 324, 342, 695 A.2d 1072 (1997); see <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>146 Conn. 149, 157, 148 A.2d 334 (1959). \u201cLegislative intent is found not in what the legislature meant to say but in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d <em>Dana-Robin Corp. </em>v. <em>Common Council, </em>166 Conn. 207, 221, 348 A.2d 560 (1974). \u201c \u2018Words in a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning . . . unless the context indicates that a different meaning was intended. ... No word or phrase in a statute is to be rendered mere surplusage.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 584. In applying those principles, we keep in mind that the legislature is presumed to have intended a reasonable, just and constitutional result. <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187, 592 A.2d 912 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We note initially that the Supreme Court in <em>Gelinas </em>concluded that \u201c[s]ection 8-12 unambiguously provides for both civil and criminal remedies.\u201d <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 593. Further, its very title, \u201cProcedure where regulations are violated,\u201d signals the content of this lengthy<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> statute, which methodically sets out the who, the what and the when of the application of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Despite its length, \u00a7 8-12 contains only seven sentences. Briefly, and generally speaking, the first sentence authorizes any appropriate official \u201cin addition to other <em>remedies </em>... to institute an action or proceeding\u201d to bring into regulatory conformity any violation of the zoning regulations. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 8-12. The second sentence refers to who specifically is authorized to enforce claimed violations. The third sentence provides for the imposition of fines on a daily basis in various dollar amounts when violations of the regulations are found to have been committed or are ongoing,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> with the amounts of the fines being determined by whether the violation is \u201cwilful\u201d or nonwilful. The fourth sentence provides for the imposition of a civil penalty<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> not to exceed $2500 on any person who fails to comply with an order within ten days after its service. The fifth sentence provides that a defendant in a criminal prosecution<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> brought under \u00a7 8-12 may plead in abatement if the prosecution is based on a zoning ordinance or regulation that is the subject of a civil action in which the interpretation of such ordinance or regulation is at issue such that the prosecution would fail in the event that the civil action results in an interpretation different from that claimed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>state in the criminal prosecution. The sixth and seventh sentences provide that if the court renders judgment for the municipality in the criminal prosecution and finds that the violation was wilful, then the court shall allow the municipality its costs as well as reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. To the contrary, if the court finds that the allegations in the defendant\u2019s plea in abatement are true, then the court may order that prosecution cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">With that, we now consider whether the daily fines imposed in this case are civil or criminal penalties.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cThe question of whether a given sanction is civil or criminal is one of statutory construction.\u201d <em>One Lot Emerald Cut Stones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 U.S. 232, 237, 93 S. Ct. 489, 34 L. Ed. 2d 438 (1972); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 248, 100 S. Ct. 2636, 65 L. Ed. 2d 742 (1980). In deciding whether the statutory penalty is civil or criminal, we use a two step analysis. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 248-49. First, we must determine whether the legislature, either expressly or impliedly, can be said to have intended the penalty to be civil or criminal. See <em>One Lot Emerald Cut Stones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 236-37. Second, if we determine that the legislature intended to create a civil penalty, then we must decide whether civil penalties imposed on the plaintiff are so punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 249; <em>State </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>48 Conn. App. 71, 78, 708 A.2d 583, cert, denied, 244 Conn. 911, 713 A.2d 829 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We previously noted that the <em>Gelinas </em>court observed that \u00a7 8-12 \u201cunambiguously\u201d provides for both \u201ccivil and criminal <em>remedies.\u201d </em>After examining the plain language of the statute, it is apparent that it provides for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the imposition of both daily civil penalties or fines and daily criminal penalties or fines.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">For the violation of zoning regulations, \u00a7 8-12 provides that the appropriate authority may pursue enforcement of the regulations in either a civil or criminal proceeding. Given that the legislature enabled authorities to pursue enforcement in either a civil or criminal proceeding, it accordingly is logical that it provided for both civil and criminal fines and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In the portion of \u00a7 8-12 providing for daily fines, the third sentence, the legislature explicitly provided for both civil and criminal daily fines. The third sentence of \u00a7 8-12 states that the \u201c[o]wner or agent of any building or premises where a violation of any provision of such regulations has been committed or exists . . . shall be fined not less than ten nor more than one hundred dollars for each day that such violation continues; but if the offense is wilful, the person convicted thereof shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than two hundred and fifty dollars for each day that such violation continues, or imprisoned not more than ten days for each day such violation continues or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>both . . . .\u201d The fact that the legislature provides for different fines to be imposed, depending on the proceeding involved, evinces the legislature\u2019s intent to establish both daily civil fines and daily criminal fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">As the statute states, for violations of the regulations, a person shall be fined not less than $10 nor more than $100 for each day that the violation continues. That portion of the provision refers to a civil proceeding, one that does not require a finding of wilfulness or a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">On the other hand, the statute provides that if an offense is wilful and the person is convicted thereof, the amount of the fine is to be more than $100 per day, but not more than $250 for each day. According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990), to convict means \u201c[t]o find a person guilty of a criminal charge, either upon a criminal trial, a plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere. . . .\u201d The use of the word \u201cconvicted,\u201d demonstrates that the legislature distinguished between civil and criminal proceedings. The imposition of an elevated fine upon conviction manifests the legislature\u2019s intent to impose a different and greater penalty on those \u201cconvicted\u201d in a criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Further, the word \u201ccontinues,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> as used in the third sentence of \u00a7 8-12, means \u201cto keep going, to be steadfast or constant in a course or activity, remain in existence.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1971). On its face, as used in that sentence, the fine \u201cfor each day,\u201d \u201cviolation,\u201d \u201ccontinues\u201d plainly is used as reflecting that which is without limitation, ongoing. That view is supported by another word chosen by the legislature that appears in this sentence and underlines the temporal message of \u201ccontinues.\u201d That is the word \u201cexists.\u201d The word \u201cexists\u201d in this context means \u201cto have actual or real being.\u201d Id. \u201cContinues\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d clearly refer to violations that are, in a word, \u201congoing.\u201d Those words are intended to apply to those violations that are in being and serve to demonstrate that they were intended to follow and include those violations that already have been \u201ccommitted.\u201d The word \u201ccommitted\u201d appears three times in the third sentence of \u00a7 8-12 and each time conjunctively with the words \u201cor exists,\u201d thus declaring the legislature\u2019s intent to fine violations during the entire temporal spectrum of the \u201cviolations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Our Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 can be construed as \u2018and\u2019 where such construction clearly appears to have been the legislative intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>D\u2019Occhio </em>v. <em>Connecticut Real Estate Commission, </em>189 Conn. 162, 170, 455 A.2d 833 (1983); <em>In re Corey E., </em>40 Conn. App. 366, 371, 671 A.2d 396 (1996). The word \u201cor\u201d is used here in its conjunctive sense and, when so used, denotes a joinder, a union and is used to conjoin a word with a word. \u201cThe [legislature\u2019s] use of a verb tense is significant in construing statutes.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 333, 112 S. Ct. 1351, 117 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1992); <em>In re AroChem Corp., </em>176 F.3d 610, 623 (2d Cir. 1999); <em>Sampiere </em>v. <em>Zaretsky, </em>26 Conn.

Ct. 554, 9 L. Ed. 2d 644 (1963).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Upon examination of the <em>Kennedy </em>factors, we do not glean any constitutional impact from any of them that requires a conclusion that the challenged daily fine provisions have any impact on any constitutionally protected right of the plaintiff. We do note, however, that although there is an element of deterrence in the sanctions imposed, that element certainly is not the primary focus of the statutory scheme, and the \u201c \u2018clearest proof <em>State </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 75; has not been shown that the legislative scheme is so punitive as to negate the legislative intent that the sanction be remedial. See id. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 284-85 n.2, 116 S. Ct. 2135, 135 L. Ed. 2d 549 (1996): \u201cIt is hard to imagine a sanction that has no punitive aspect whatsoever.\u201d It is relevant here to point out that <em>Ursery </em>did not approve of the view that a sanction whose purpose was not \u201cpurely remedial\u201d must be construed as punitive. Id., 284. Our Supreme Court apparently inclines toward the same view. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuchman, </em>242 Conn. 345, 361, 699 A.2d 952 (1997), cert, dismissed, 522 U.S. 1101, 118 S. Ct. 907, 139 L. Ed. 2d 922 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickam, </em>235 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Conn. 614, 623, 668 A.2d 1321 (1995), cert, denied, 517 U.S. 1221, 116 S. Ct. 1851, 134 L. Ed. 2d 951 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Some years ago, our Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he primary object of zoning is to promote the health, safety, welfare and prosperity of the community,\u201d and that \u201c[i]ts ultimate purpose is to confine certain classes of buildings and uses to certain localities.\u201d <em>Langbein </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>135 Conn. 575, 580, 67 A.2d 5 (1949); <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals, </em>114 Conn. 15, 23, 157 A. 273 (1931). Section 8-12 advances the object and purposes of zoning in providing for the procedure to be used when zoning regulations are violated. The daily fine provisions serve a legitimate remedial purpose in maintaining the integrity of those regulations. We note that it appears to be implicit in that statute that the offending landowner has the power to bring his property into zoning conformity and shorten, or end, the running of the daily fines. Once the particular violation no longer \u201ccontinues\u201d or \u201cexists,\u201d the daily fines are abated. In a word, he can \u201cremedy\u201d the situation. In addition, we point out that because the legislature in \u00a7 8-12 gave the power to sanction to local zoning authorities, the challenged daily fine sanctions were intended to be civil rather than criminal in nature. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 77. That is in contrast with a criminal penalty, which is the exclusive province of a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">We now turn to the second step of our inquiry. Having found that the legislature intended the sanction as remedial, we must determine whether the \u201c \u2018clearest proof \u201d; id., 75; has been shown that the statutory scheme is so punitive as to negate that intention. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 249. The civil sanction of $100 per day cannot be said to be \u201coverwhelmingly disproportionate.\u201d <em>In re Shane P., </em>58 Conn. App. 244, 257, 754 A.2d 169 (2000). The claim of excessiveness finds support only in that the plaintiff himself allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>daily violation to continue for so many days that it reached approximately $108,000. The sanctions served to advance the enforcement of \u00a7 8-12 and are appropriately undertaken by the zoning authorities. It bears repeating here that the clear intent of the legislature in conferring the power to sanction on local zoning authorities is prima facie evidence that those daily fine sanctions are civil, and not criminal, in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We find that in the circumstances of this case, there is little, if any, evidence let alone the required \u201c \u2018clearest proof <em>State </em>v. Duke, supra, 48 Conn. App. 75; that the civil sanctions imposed on the plaintiff can be said to be so punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal despite the legislature\u2019s clear intent to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">We conclude that the sanctions imposed on the plaintiff were intended by our legislature to be civil in nature and that the court did not abuse its discretion in imposing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The plaintiff further contends that if \u00a7 8-12 permits the imposition of civil fines at all, then the amount of the penalty cannot exceed $2500. To support his proposition, the plaintiff refers to the fourth sentence of \u00a7 8-12, which provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who, having been served with an order to discontinue any such violation, fails to comply with such order within ten days after service . . . shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">We conclude that the fourth sentence of \u00a7 8-12 is not applicable to the issue before us in this branch of the case. That is so because the issue for determination is not, as the fourth sentence discloses, any failure to obey an order within ten days after its service on the plaintiff, but whether the court improperly ordered daily fines during the time of the existence of the zoning violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>involved.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In that context, the time period in which the fine of $100 per day was imposed was from June 29, 1987, to June 15, 1990. It seems to us that given the inapplicability of the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh sentences of \u00a7 8-12 to our inquiry on the issue before us, the only temporal limit on daily fines capable of being imposed by the court in an injunction action, as this is, is the number of days that the court finds that the zoning violations have been in existence as set out in \u00a7 8-12. We are mindful that our Supreme Court\u2019s remand on the plaintiffs appeal directed the trial court \u201cto impose such civil penalties pursuant to \u00a7 8-12 as the trial court may deem appropriate in the proper exercise of its discretion.\u201d <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 593. Accordingly, the plaintiffs claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The plaintiff claims finally<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> that the court\u2019s imposition of the daily fines, which totaled approximately $108,000, when he previously had been convicted in a criminal proceeding for the allegedly \u201csame\u201d offense, violated the prohibition against double jeopardy as set out in the fifth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has many times held that the double jeopardy clause protects against three abuses: A second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and multiple punishments for the same offense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickam, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 617-18, citing <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969). The plaintiff in his principal brief claims that \u201c[o]nly the third double jeopardy protection, namely, protection against multiple punishments for the same offense is at issue in this case.\u201d Further, he claims that \u201c[a] disproportionately large civil sanction imposed in a civil proceeding against a person who has already been punished criminally for the <em>same offense </em>constitutes \u2018punishment\u2019 within the meaning of the double jeopardy clause, regardless of the label placed upon the sanction . . . .\u201d We do not agree that the plaintiff was punished twice for the \u201csame offense,\u201d as he claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">On February 15, 1991, in the geographical area number sixteen courthouse in West Hartford, the plaintiff entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of continuation of an unlawful use of property on April 16, 1990,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> which was in violation of certain provisions of the state building code. The plaintiff was represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>by counsel at the time of his plea and sentencing. During the proceedings, the prosecutor specifically described the areas of the premises involved in that criminal case. The attorney for the Housing Session of the Superior Court, in reciting the factual basis for the charge, stated that the plaintiff had continued the unlawful use<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> by \u201chaving altered the occupancy of the premises in a manner requiring greater strength, in that he constructed an additional floor of occupancy containing three separate offices and a stairway in the southernmost portion of the building without first filing a written application with the building official and the town, and obtaining a permit to do so.\u201d Although he was ordered by the town to abate that condition, the plaintiff failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The criminal case against the plaintiff for the building code violations was disposed of on the basis of an agreed recommendation. Pursuant to the signed recommendation, the court, <em>Mulcahy, J., </em>imposed a fine of $500 and waived costs. In addition, the court committed the plaintiff to the commissioner of correction for ninety days, execution suspended, and further sentenced him to a conditional discharge for one year. The court accepted the plaintiffs plea of nolo contendere, made a finding of guilty and fined him $500. In his brief to this court, the plaintiff maintains that at that time, he was convicted of violations of state building code \u00a7\u00a7 103.2,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>lll.l<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and 119.2.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">To prevail on a double jeopardy claim relative to the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense, a defendant (here, the plaintiff) \u201cbears the burden of demonstrating (1) that the charges arise out of the same act or transaction and (2) that the crimes are the same offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Raymond, 30 Conn. App. 606, 609, 621 A.2d 755 (1993). The town contends that the plaintiff has failed to fulfill the second requirement for qualifying for double jeopardy protection, that is, that the penalties imposed are for the \u201csame offense.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that use of the <em>Blockburger </em>test; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932); is relevant to the issue of whether the penalties constitute the \u201csame offense,\u201d which <em>Blockburger </em>states depends on \u201cwhether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d Id. As the town suggests, that means that in applying that calculus, both sets of \u201coffenses\u201d are considered as to whether they do, as the plaintiff maintains, constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Before proceeding further in the \u201csame offense\u201d issue, two observations are made. First, although <em>Blockburger </em>analysis is quite helpful in other contexts, especially when the components in the analysis are one \u201ccrime\u201d being compared or analyzed with another \u201ccrime,\u201d we do not consider traditional <em>Blockburger </em>analysis appropriate in this case. We will, however, to resolve the \u201csame offense\u201d issue, compare the allegedly \u201csame offenses\u201d to determine if they are the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes. Second, we do not accept the plaintiffs invitation to conduct a lesser included provision<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> analysis in our discussion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>\u201csame offense\u201d issues in which he asks us to compare those sections of the building code on which he was presented and pleaded to criminally to with what he states are substantially the same (in two instances) as West Hartford zoning code provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The plaintiff, in his principal brief, admits that he was convicted after being found guilty in the geographical area number sixteen courthouse in West Hartford \u201cof violating state building code section 103.2 . . . section 111.1 . . . [and] section 119.2 . . . .\u201d In the case before us, he has been fined under the provisions of \u00a7 8-12, a state statute. It is fair to say that the town\u2019s zoning code and the state building code embody separate and distinct sets of rules. Further, while the plaintiffs unauthorized use<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> of his Park Road property forms, in broad terms, the underlying basis for both his criminal building code conviction and the zoning enforcement action for his zoning violations under \u00a7 8-12, each set of those violations is separate and distinct from the other. The criminal case involved the plaintiffs conduct on one day, i.e., April 16,1990. The civil penalties imposed under the zoning enforcement statute, \u00a7 8-12, on a daily basis addressed the period of violations from June 27, 1987, to June 15, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Comparing \u00a7 8-12 to the specific sections of the building code under which the plaintiff was convicted does not support his claim that he was convicted of the \u201csame offense.\u201d Building code \u00a7 103.2 does not apply to zoning issues, but rather to obtaining the approval and certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>cation of the building official for matters set out in that section. Section 111.1 again sets out when the approval of the building official will be needed before a permit is issued in cases involving the construction or alteration of a building or structure or a change in its occupancy. It does not discuss zoning issues. Section 119.2 involves changes in a building or structure for which a certificate of occupancy issued by the building official is required to assure that changes have been made in accordance with the provision of the approved building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>227 Conn. 1, 629 A.2d 386 (1993), offers us some guidance on this issue. Although <em>Wood-son </em>involved two criminal statutes, it held that \u201c[ultimately, whether statutory provisions are separate crimes meriting separate punishment,s for the purpose of double jeopardy analysis turns on whether the legislature intended them to be separate crimes.\u201d Id., 12. It is quite clear that the drafters of \u00a7 8-12 intended that it apply to the enforcement of zoning violations and that the drafters of the building code, and specifically the three provisions involved, intended them to apply to the procedure necessary to conform with those building code requirements set out in each. Those building code provisions do not apply to zoning violations and, conversely, \u00a7 8-12 does not provide for the enforcement of building code violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Finally, we observe that the plaintiff relies on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 109 S. Ct. 1892, 104 L. Ed. 2d 487 (1989), to support his claim that the court\u2019s order imposing the daily fines pursuant to \u00a7 8-12 subjected him to double jeopardy. <em>In Halper, </em>the defendant was convicted of sixty-five separate violations of the federal criminal false claim statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em>supra, 437. Upon conviction, the defendant was sentenced to two years imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ment and fined $5000.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Id. Later, the government filed a separate civil action against the defendant in an attempt to recover a $2000 penalty for each violation. Id., 438. Thus, the government tried to recover $130,000 from the defendant. Id. In <em>Halper, </em>the issue presented to the United States Supreme Court was a narrow one. It was \u201cwhether the attempted imposition of the civil fines against [the defendant] by the government, following his criminal prosecution and punishment for the same underlying misconduct, violated the double jeopardy clause.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickam, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In interpreting <em>Halper, </em>our Supreme Court in <em>Hickam </em>stated: \u201cThe court determined that the imposition of the full amount of the sought after monetary penalties would constitute punishment. It explicitly held that \u2018under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but <em>only </em>as a deterrent or retribution.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. \u201cThe court recognized the difficulty in conducting this inquiry and indicated that a violation of the double jeopardy clause \u2018can be identified only by assessing the character of the actual [sanctions] imposed on the individual by the machinery of the state.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u201cIn holding that the civil penalty authorized by the statute was so disproportionate to the offense as to have violated the constitutional prohibition against multiple punishments, the court announced that this is \u2018a rule for the rare case . . . where a fixed-penalty provision subjects a prolific but small-gauge offender to a sanc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>tion overwhelmingly disproportionate to the damages he has caused.\u2019 . . . The court then remanded the case to the trial court in order to allow the government an opportunity to demonstrate its losses and costs because it had not previously challenged the assessment of damages.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. The <em>Hickam </em>court further stated: \u201cAccordingly, after a review of <em>Halper </em>and its interpretation by other jurisdictions, we conclude that <em>Halper </em>stands for the proposition that a civil or administrative sanction that serves a legitimate remedial purpose and is related rationally to that purpose does not give rise to a double jeopardy violation even if the sanction has some deterrent effect. Conversely, no matter what its label, a sanction or portion thereof that seeks only to punish triggers the protection of the double jeopardy clause.\u201d Id., 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Drawing on <em>Hickam, </em>our Supreme Court later, in discussing which sanctions are to be considered \u201cpunishments\u201d for double jeopardy purposes, required that \u201cwe assess: (1) the purpose the sanction is designed to serve; and (2) the nature of the particular sanction as applied to the [offender]. A sanction that primarily serves a legitimate remedial purpose and is related rationally to that purpose does not give rise to a double jeopardy violation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuchman, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">We point out that <em>Halper </em>is significantly different, factually from this case. In <em>Halper, </em>the government\u2019s civil action, which was brought after the defendant\u2019s criminal conviction, was based on precisely the same offenses for which he had been convicted in the criminal case. That is not so here. Here, the plaintiff claims that because of his criminal conviction on February 16,1991, for the building code violation (to which he entered a plea of nolo contendere) of continuing the unlawful use of three second floor rooms at 119 Park Road on a specific date \u2014 April 16, 1990, and the court\u2019s subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>quent imposition of the civil fines for violating (on a daily basis) the zoning code for almost three years on all three floors (two floors and the basement), constitutes multiple punishments for the same offense and thereby is prohibited by the double jeopardy clause. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In disagreeing with the plaintiffs position here, we reiterate that the conduct forming the basis for his conviction, after his plea, for a one day violation of the building code, did not constitute the basis for the civil court\u2019s decision to impose the fines for the zoning code violations. In the criminal court, the prosecutor brought the charge for the illegal office use of the second floor rooms to which we have referred. On the other hand, the zoning enforcement officer was trying to have the illegal first floor wall removed, and the office use in the basement and in the three first floor rooms discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Furthermore, <em>Halper </em>is distinguishable because in this case there was no evidence before the trial court of the expenses incurred by the town in pursuing the violations from June, 1987, until January 4, 1995, the date when the court denied the plaintiffs motion to set aside its June 16, 1994 judgment. Here, we note the plaintiffs allusion in his principal brief to \u201cthe government\u2019s expenses of $6000 plus taxable costs\u201d as constituting a second punishment in violation of the double jeopardy clause. The $6000 referred to actually was attorney\u2019s fees allowed to the town and, as previously stated, is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Further, we cannot overlook the language in <em>Halper </em>that clearly states that \u201c[n]othing in today\u2019s ruling precludes the Government from seeking the full civil penalty against a defendant who previously has not been punished for the same conduct, even if the civil sanction imposed is punitive. In such a case, the Double Jeopardy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Clause simply is not implicated.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 450. Although we hold to our already stated view that the civil penalty imposed on the plaintiff is one that is remedial, the amount of the fine, some $108,000, does not violate the double jeopardy clause when we consider that it consisted of a daily fine for violations that persisted for some 1080 days without respite. The daily fine of $100 per day is reasonable; the persistence in the violative conduct for 1080 days is not. Such a fine, in the aggregate, serves a legitimate, remedial purpose, is related rationally to that purpose and does not give rise to a double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-12 provides: \u201cIf any building or structure has been erected, constructed, altered, converted or maintained, or any building, structure or land has been used, in violation of any provision of this chapter or of any bylaw, ordinance, rule or regulation made under authority conferred hereby, any official having jurisdiction, in addition to other remedies, may institute an action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use or to restrain, correct or abate such violation or to prevent the occupancy of such building, structure or land or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about such premises. Such regulations shall be enforced by the officer or official board or authority designated therein, who shall be authorized to cause any building, structure, place or premises to be inspected and examined and to order in writing the remedying of any condition found to exist therein or thereon in violation of any provision of the regulations made under authority of the provisions of this chapter or, when the violation involves grading of land, the removal of earth or soil erosion and sediment control, to issue, in writing, a cease and desist order to be effective immediately. The owner or agent of any building or premises where a violation of any provision of such regulations has been committed or exists, or the lessee or tenant of an entire building or entire premises where such violation has been committed or exists, or the owner, agent, lessee or tenant of any part of the building or premises in which such violation has been committed or exists, or the agent, architect, builder, contractor or any other person who commits, (alms part or assists in any such violation or who maintains any building or premises in which any such violation exists, shall be fined not less than ten nor more than one hundred dollars for each day that such violation continues; but, if the offense is wilful, the person convicted thereof shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than two hundred and fifty dollars for each day that such violation continues, or imprisoned not more than ten days for each day such violation continues or both; and the Superior Court shall have jurisdiction of all such offenses, subject to appeal as in other cases. Any person who, having been served with an order to discontinue any such violation, fails to comply with such order within ten days after such service, or having been served with a cease and desist order with respect to a violation involving grading of land, removal of earth or soil erosion and sediment control, fails to comply with such order immediately, or continues to violate any provision of the regulations made under authority of the provisions of this chapter specified in such order shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars, payable to the treasurer of the municipality. In any criminal prosecution under this section, the defendant may plead in abatement that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>criminal prosecution is based on a zoning ordinance or regulation which is the subject of a civil action wherein one of the issues is the interpretation of such ordinance or regulations, and that the issues in the civil action are such that the prosecution would fail if the civil action results in an interpretation different from that claimed by the state in the criminal prosecution. If the court renders judgment for such municipality and finds that the violation was wilful, the court shall allow such municipality its costs, together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be taxed by the court. The court before which such prosecution is pending may order such prosecution abated if it finds that the allegations of the plea are true.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\"> <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>225 Conn. 575, 596, 626 A.2d 259 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> The Supreme Court in <em>Gelinas </em>held that \u201c[bjecause we conclude that the trial court improperly assessed the daily fines, we do not reach [the plaintiffs] related claim that the trial court improperly computed the time frame within which the fines would be assessed.\u201d <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>225 Conn. 575, 593 n.21, 626 A.2d 259 (1993).

We agree and conclude that the plaintiff has not satisfied the first requirement because his criminal conviction of February 14, 1991, was for his conduct on one day, i.e., April 16, 1990, whereas the civil fines imposed under General Statutes \u00a7 8-12 were for his zoning violations for a period extending from June 29, 1987, to June 15, 1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> Under the <em>Blockburger </em>test, \u201ca defendant may be convicted of two offenses arising out of the same criminal incident if each crime contains an element not found in the other.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 615, 469 A.2d 767 (1983); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>216 Conn. 282, 291, 579 A.2d 84 (1990).
