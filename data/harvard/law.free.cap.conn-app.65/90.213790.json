On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court abused its discretion in concluding that the custodial parent\u2019s relocation to California is not in the best interests of the children. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly (1) failed to address or put proper weight on the \u201cfamily unit factor\u201d set forth in <em>Ireland </em>v. <em>Ireland, </em>246 Conn. 413, 717 A.2d 676 (1998) (en banc), (2) failed to focus on whether it was in the best interests of the children to move to California if the plaintiff moved to California, (3) deprived the plaintiff of equal protection of the laws because the court allegedly based its conclusions on gender biased stereotypes, (4) relied on the minor children\u2019s opinions rather than on those of the court-appointed guardian ad litem in determining, in part, whether the move is in the best interests of the children, and (5) abused its discretion in denying the plaintiffs motion to reargue in light of certain factual findings made and by not following the opinion of the consulting psychologist in the case. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. By virtue of a separation agreement, which was incorporated into the judgment of dissolution in 1996, the plaintiff and the defendant, Paul Murray, share joint legal custody of their two minor children. Under the agreement, the plaintiff has physical custody of the children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff and the defendant are both physicians who each have their own established practices. Their marriage was dissolved on December 23, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Our standard of review regarding factual findings of a trial court is limited. Such findings are binding on this court unless they are clearly erroneous in fight of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the evidence, the pleadings and the record as a whole. <em>Hopfer </em>v. <em>Hopfer, </em>59 Conn. App. 452, 457, 757 A.2d 673 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We first turn to the criteria set out in <em>Ireland </em>that the court was required to consider in determining whether the plaintiffs relocation to California with the parties\u2019 children would be in the best interests of the children. At the outset, however, we note that the plaintiff did not seek an articulation from the court regarding her claims that the court failed to consider properly the <em>Ireland </em>criteria. It is the plaintiffs burden to provide an adequate record for our review of those claims. <em>Baugher </em>v. <em>Baugher, </em>63 Conn. App. 59, 65 n.10, 774 A.2d 1089 (2001); see Practice Book \u00a7 66-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In <em>Ireland, </em>our Supreme Court adopted the criteria as set forth in <em>Tropea </em>v. <em>Tropea, </em>87 N.Y.2d 727, 740-41, 665 N.E.2d 145, 642 N.Y.S.2d 575 (1996), as the criteria that Connecticut courts should consider in relocation cases. <em>Ireland </em>v. <em>Ireland, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 433. The court also stated that the guiding principle to be applied in such cases is the best interests and welfare of the children involved. Id., 419. After noting that the General Assembly and our courts have traditionally eschewed defining the term, \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d the court endorsed the use of the <em>Tropea </em>criteria for making that determination in future relocation cases. Id., 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The first of those factors is \u201c[e]ach parent\u2019s reasons for seeking or opposing the move . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 431. In its memorandum of decision, the court addressed each party\u2019s reasons. The court found that \u201c[t]he plaintiff intends to move to California with the children if permitted by the court for the purposes of marrying her boyfriend, Dan.\u201d The court found that by so moving and marrying, the plaintiff would \u201creach her goal of raising the children in a two-parent home . . . without the necessity of working on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>a full-time basis or the assistance of a nanny.\u201d The court also found credible, however, the testimony of a former mutual friend of the parties that another reason for the plaintiffs move to California is to \u201cseparate herself from her ex-husband and avoid the need to deal with him on a regular basis.\u201d The court found that the defendant opposed the move \u201cfor the love of his children and the need to be an active participant in their maturation and development.\u201d The court did not find that \u201chatred\u201d for his ex-wife was one of the defendant\u2019s reasons for opposing the move. We conclude, therefore, that the court did consider the reasons why each of the parties took their respective positions supporting and opposing the move, as <em>Ireland </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The second <em>Ireland </em>factor involves \u201cthe quality of the relationships between the child and the custodial and noncustodial parents . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 431-32. We note that the plaintiff and the defendant in this case share joint legal custody and that the children\u2019s physical residence has been with the plaintiff. The court\u2019s memorandum of decision is replete with factual findings concerning the children\u2019s relationships with their parents. The court found that both children love each parent and that they are well adjusted, good students. The court concluded that \u201c[tjhere is no doubt that both children have strong bonds to each parent.\u201d A careful reading of the court\u2019s memorandum of decision makes it clear that the court considered the children\u2019s bonds to each parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The third <em>Ireland </em>factor to be considered in relocation cases is \u201cthe impact of the move on the quantity and quality of the child\u2019s future contact with the noncustodial parent . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 432. The court specifically found that the move from Connecticut to California will have a \u201cdeleterious effect\u201d on the defendant\u2019s relationship with his children. The court found that the quality and quantity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>defendant\u2019s contact \u201cwill be negatively impacted,\u201d in part, because of the defendant\u2019s arduous work schedule as a physician. The court further found that the defendant presently lives in Simsbury, the plaintiff lives in West Hartford, and visitation is regularly scheduled and carried out each week. The court determined that the regular weekly visitation schedule, which both children enjoy, will be \u201cthwarted.\u201d Among the court\u2019s other salient findings was that the children \u201cwill not have weekly contact for dinners, sporting and school events, and biweekly overnight stays with their father while living 3000 miles away.\u201d The court, therefore, properly considered that factor of the <em>Ireland </em>inquiry. We further conclude that those findings adequately addressed the fifth factor concerning \u201cthe feasibility of preserving the relationship between the noncustodial parent and child through suitable visitation arrangements.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The fourth <em>Ireland </em>factor for determining whether the relocation is in the children\u2019s best interests is \u201cthe degree to which the custodial parent\u2019s and child\u2019s life may be enhanced economically, emotionally and educationally by the move . . . .\u201d Id. Although the court determined from the evidence before it that the move would certainly enhance the plaintiffs own emotional and economic needs, the court also found that the move would not enhance the children\u2019s economic, social or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>educational needs. The court found that the plaintiffs voluntary cutback from her full-time position to a part-time position would not be replaced by full-time employment in California and that the stepfather would not be obligated to extend financial support to the children. There is no evidence in the record that the plaintiff, who is highly educated, desires to relocate to enhance her own educational opportunities. Further, we are satisfied that the court adequately considered the children\u2019s educational opportunities in its finding that the West Hartford public school system successfully addresses the children\u2019s educational needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The sixth and final <em>Ireland </em>factor that the court considered is \u201cthe negative impact, if any, from continued or exacerbated hostility between the custodial and noncustodial parents, and the effect that the move may have on any extended family relationships.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Here, the court found that although, for reasons it specified, there was tension between the parties, they have insulated their children from it. The court also found that the children would miss contact with certain cousins if required to move across the country.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">We note that the plaintiff does not claim that the court\u2019s factual findings are clearly erroneous. Rather, her argument focuses, in part, on the weight the court placed, or did not place, on the various factors articulated in <em>Ireland. </em>See id., 434 (no single factor carries dispositive weight). As we previously discussed, we cannot determine the amount of weight that the court actually placed on any one of those factors in the absence of an adequate record indicating how the court weighed evidence in relation to each factor and where the plaintiff failed to seek an articulation of the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>reasoning. \u201c[T]he resolution of conflicting factual claims falls within the province of the trial court . . . [and] [t]he trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hopfer </em>v. <em>Hopfer, </em>supra, 59 Conn. App. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">We now turn to the plaintiffs claim that the court failed to address or to afford proper weight to the \u201cfamily unit\u201d factor. In <em>Ireland, </em>our Supreme Corut stated that \u201c[i]t may not be realistic to try to preserve completely the quality and nature of the relationship that the noncustodial parent enjoyed with the child, especially if such preservation is maintained at the cost of the custodial parent\u2019s ability to start a new, potentially improved life for herself or himself and the child.\u201d <em>Ireland </em>v. <em>Ireland, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 422. In determining what is in the children\u2019s best interests, the trial court must consider what is in the custodial parent\u2019s interest because that interest is interrelated with the children\u2019s best interests. Id., 422-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In the present case, the court <em>did </em>address each of the six factors under <em>Ireland </em>and, in those findings, necessarily evaluated the impact, not only on the defendant but principally on the members of the \u201cnew family unit,\u201d i.e., the plaintiff and each child. The court considered the plaintiffs reasons for wanting to relocate, the quality of the relationship between the plaintiff and her children, the degree to which the plaintiffs and the children\u2019s lives may be enhanced economically, emotionally and, in the children\u2019s case, educationally, and the negative impact of the hostility between the custodial and noncustodial parents. The court considered all six <em>Ireland </em>factors as they relate to the new family unit and, using its discretion, adjudicated the matter on the basis of what was in the best interests of the children. We conclude that the court did consider the effects that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the relocation to California would have on the new family unit. We therefore find no merit to the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The <em>Ireland </em>court stated that sometimes a move that is in the custodial parent\u2019s best interests also may be in the children\u2019s best interests because the relocation will remove the children from the vortex of contentious parents or provide other opportunities to the children or their custodial parent for financial, emotional or educational improvement. The court, nonetheless, adopted the <em>Tropea </em>factors as the guide for trial courts to follow in determining relocation cases. We find that, in this case, the court carefully applied the <em>Tropea/Ireland </em>factors in light of the evidence and did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We next turn to the plaintiffs assertion that the court improperly failed to focus on whether it was in the best interests of the children to move to California if the plaintiff moved to California. We recognize that in a free country a person may travel or reside wherever she or he pleases. See id., 427 (\u201ccustodial parent with potentially bright prospects on a distant horizon should not be tethered indefinitely to the noncustodial parent\u2019s choice of residence, as long as the proposed relocation is in the best interests of the child\u201d); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ganim, </em>233 Conn. 557, 593 n.49, 660 A.2d 742 (1995) (right to travel interstate is implicit fundamental right guaranteed by federal constitution). We also note that the court did not change the order of physical custody here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although we appreciate the conundrum that theoretically can be created in a situation in which the party having physical custody does in fact move and the children are left without a physical custodian, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>was not confronted with such a situation here because the plaintiff testified that she would <em>not </em>move if her motion was denied. As the trier of fact, the court was entitled to believe her. <em>In re Deana </em>E., 61 Conn. App. 197, 208, 763 A.2d 45 (2000), cert, denied, 255 Conn. 941, 768 A.2d 949 (2001). We therefore find this claim to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We next turn to the plaintiffs claim that the court violated her constitutional right to equal protection because the court allegedly based its judgment on gender biased stereotypes of women. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the court (1) accorded vastly different weight and deference to the parties\u2019 career choices, (2) rewarded the defendant for \u201chis almost gender-comic behavior while penalizing [the plaintiff] for her gender appropriateness\u201d and (3) did not address the plaintiff as \u201cdoctor\u201d on the two occasions the court addressed her, but referred to or addressed the defendant as \u201cdoctor\u201d seventeen times. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">As we noted in <em>Wendt </em>v. Wendt, 59 Conn. App. 656, 697, 757 A.2d 1225, cert, denied, 255 Conn. 918, 763 A.2d 1044 (2000), \u201ca charge of gender bias against a trial judge in the execution of his or her duties is a most grave accusation. It strikes at the heart of the judiciary as a neutral and fair arbiter of disputes for our citizenry. Such an attack travels far beyond merely advocating that a trial judge ruled incorrectly as a matter of law or as to a finding of fact, as is the procedure in appellate practice. A judge\u2019s personal integrity and ability to seive are thrown into question, placing a stain on the court that cannot easily be erased.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u201cAttorneys should be free to challenge inappropriate legal proceedings, a court\u2019s perceived partiality without the court misconstruing such a challenge as an assault on the integrity of the court. Such challenge should, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>however, be made only when substantiated by the trial record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">As in <em>Wendt, </em>the record in this case does not support the plaintiffs charge. We first observe that there is simply no evidence in the record that the plaintiffs proposed move was dictated by some necessary professional career choices, much less that the court gave more weight and deference to the male defendant\u2019s career choices. Instead, the court found that the plaintiffs move was influenced by her remarriage plans to an individual whose career has evidently placed him on the West Coast where, when married, they intended to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Similarly, we find no basis in the record to justify the plaintiffs second allegation that somehow the court \u201crewarded\u201d the male defendant\u2019s \u201cgender-comic behavior\u201d while penalizing the plaintiffs \u201cgender appropriateness.\u201d We note, in this regard, that at one point in its decision, the court did find that the defendant communicated with the plaintiff by typed letters and addressed the plaintiff as Mrs. Murray, rather than by her professional title, Dr. Murray. The court characterized some of the defendant\u2019s remarks as \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate,\u201d including his references to court-ordered alimony checks as an \u201callowance.\u201d The judge made no such findings against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The plaintiffs claim misconstrues the court\u2019s focus in relocation cases, namely, whether the proposed relocation is in the children\u2019s best interests. The defendant\u2019s pettiness and cruel remarks made in private correspondence to the plaintiff bore no relevance to the issue of whether the proposed relocation to California is in the children\u2019s best interests. With regard to the plaintiffs third argument, we note that the court merely followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>a pattern of addressing the plaintiff that was set by her counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">What the plaintiff is then left with is the faulty premise that a judge of one sex who rules against a party of another sex is gender biased. Adverse rulings alone do not constitute bias. Id., 696. Accordingly, the plaintiffs argument lacks logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">A proper premise would be that a judge of one sex who rules against a party of the opposite sex on the basis of a predisposition against all members of that opposite sex or, without such a general disposition, nonetheless rules on the basis of the litigants\u2019 genders, is biased. It goes without saying that a litigant must substantiate such a claim from the record of conduct at trial. Unfortunately, the false premise that the plaintiffs counsel has advanced to argue gender bias against the trial judge in this case is evidence of the very gender bias, albeit in reverse, of which she has unjustly accused the judge. As we discussed previously, there is no evidence in the record that the court was gender biased in rendering its decision in the present case. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>We next consider the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly gave weight to the children\u2019s desire not to relocate as opposed to the contrary opinion of the court-appointed guardian ad litem. The court properly was concerned with what was in the best interests of the children. We therefore are not surprised that the court would give some weight to the views of young persons who had reached the age of reason and were the focus of a best interests determination, as opposed to the contrary view of a guardian ad litem. This was a matter within the court\u2019s discretion, which the court did not abuse. See <em>Hopfer </em>v. <em>Hopfer, </em>supra, 59 Conn. App. 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">We need not tarry in considering the plaintiffs remaining claim that the court improperly denied her motion for reargument on the ground that the court misconstrued the testimony of Anne Phillips, the consulting psychologist and evaluator in the case. We review claims that the court improperly denied a motion for reargument under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Pan Pacific Development (Connecticut), Inc., </em>61 Conn. App. 481, 487, 764 A.2d 1273, cert, denied, 256 Conn. 913, 772 A.2d 1126 (2001). When reviewing a decision for an abuse of discretion, \u201cevery reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hopfer </em>v. <em>Hopfer, </em>supra, 59 Conn. App. 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">At the hearing, the court asked Phillips the ultimate question regarding whether it was in the children\u2019s best interests to relocate. Her answer clearly indicated that it was not.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court\u2019s finding on this issue, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>is not clearly erroneous. We further note, as previously discussed, that the court determined that the relocation to California was not in the children\u2019s best interests after it carefully considered all of the <em>Ireland </em>factors. In short, the court\u2019s decision does not rest solely on the court\u2019s acceptance of Phillips\u2019 opinion, which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>later sought to distinguish in her affidavit attached to the plaintiffs motion for reargument. We conclude that the court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs motion for reargument was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\"> Because the plaintiff has physical custody of the children, we refer to her as the custodial parent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\"> The court concluded in relevant part: \u201cIn addition to the negative impact the move will have on the children, the children\u2019s relationship with their father will be damaged by the visitation schedule proposed by the plaintiff, guardian ad litem and evaluator. The father\u2019s profession requires him to arrange his schedule to see the children on a regular basis. The move to California with phone contact or computer video access is not a sufficient substitute for the children and their father. Watching a tape delay of a soccer game or a school award is not the same as \u2018being there,\u2019 to not only the children but their noncustodial parent. While the mother intends to raise her children in a \u2018two parent household\u2019 in California, one of those parents is not the natural father, who has been financially and psychologically supportive to date.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\"> The court\u2019s memorandum of decision reflects that the court considered each of the factors within the burden shifting context as set forth in <em>Ireland.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\"> Because there was abundant evidence in the record demonstrating that the plaintiff is an excellent parent, there was no reason to transfer custody of the children to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\"> At the outset of the plaintiffs testimony, the following colloquy between the plaintiff and her counsel occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">\u201cQ.
