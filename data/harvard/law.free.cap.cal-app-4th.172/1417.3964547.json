Respondents cross-appeal from the court\u2019s order denying them their attorney fees. We reverse the order granting summary judgment, dismiss the cross-appeal for attorney fees as moot, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">In June 2003, appellant Venturi &amp; Company LLC and respondents Pacific Malibu Development Corporation and Hermitage Estates entered into a contract involving development of a high-end resort on undeveloped property on the Bahamian island of Little Exuma. Under the contract, appellant agreed to serve as a financial advisor and find financing for the Little Exuma project through a private placement of equity, preferred stock, debt securities, or a combination of those financial instruments, which collectively the contract called \u201cSecurities.\u201d The contract described appellant\u2019s services for respondents as follows: \u201cIn connection with its engagement hereunder, [appellant] shall: [f] a. review the proposed development costs, business operations and financial requirements of the Project; [f] b. assist [respondents] in preparing information materials and documents with regard to a Placement, including an executive summary, confidential information memorandum, term sheets and related due diligence' information in connection with the Project; [j[] c. assist [respondents] in formulating a marketing strategy for the Securities, including identifying and contacting selected parties with regard to a Placement, scheduling meetings with such parties and participating in meetings and/or relevant discussions relating thereto; [f] d. advise [respondents] as to the strategy and tactics of negotiations in connection with the Placement and, if requested, assist in the negotiations with the related parties; and [][] e. provide such other financial advisory and investment banking services as may be mutually agreed upon by [respondents] and [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">Respondents agreed to compensate appellant with two possible fees. First, respondents promised upon \u201ccompletion of a Placement\u201d to pay appellant a \u201cMonthly Advisory Fee\u201d of $30,000 for at least three months \u201cat the close of any such Placement.\u201d Second, respondents promised to pay a \u201csuccess fee\u201d to appellant \u201cpromptly upon consummation of any Placement of Securities.\u201d The amount of the success fee, which appellant describes as akin to a finder\u2019s fee, depended on appellant\u2019s role in the consummated placement. If appellant either introduced (the contract\u2019s word was \u201cidentified\u201d) respondents to the party who provided financing, or participated in \u201cactive negotiations\u201d with that party, respondents promised to pay appellant a success fee equal to 5 percent of the placement\u2019s proceeds. If, on the other hand, appellant neither identified the party providing financing nor negotiated the financing, then respondents owed appellant only 1 percent of the placement\u2019s proceeds. Thus, appellant was entitled to some payment under the contract even if appellant did not secure financing for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>After signing the contract, appellant contacted more than 60 potential sources of financing for the project. Two of those sources\u2014Lou Reese Investor Group and Blenheim Partners\u2014signed \u201cterm sheets\u201d with respondents. Neither of them, however, finally committed to provide financing and, in the end, respondents did not receive financing from any source that appellant had identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">Respondents terminated the contract in January 2005. Two months earlier, however, respondents had signed a term sheet with the Talisker Group. Appellant was not involved in respondents\u2019 negotiations with the Talisker Group or in the placement of Securities with that group. Nevertheless, appellant claimed the contract\u2019s provision for a success fee entitled appellant to compensation following the placement. When respondents refused to pay appellant\u2019s fee, appellant sued respondents. Appellant\u2019s operative third amended complaint alleged respondents\u2019 refusal to pay the fee breached their contract. The complaint also alleged a cause of action for quantum meruit for the reasonable value of appellant\u2019s services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">Respondents moved for summary judgment. They argued appellant had provided the services of a real estate broker by soliciting financing for the Little Exuma project, yet did not have a broker\u2019s license. Thus, respondents asserted, section 10136 of the Business and Professions Code barred appellant from receiving any compensation as an unlicensed broker. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10136 [only licensed real estate broker may receive compensation for real estate brokerage services].) Appellant opposed summary judgment. It argued that one of its managing principals, Jane Venturi, had a real estate sales license and was employed by a real estate broker (whom appellant did not identify) when respondents signed their term sheet with the Talisker Group, the document that triggered appellant\u2019s right to a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">The court entered summary judgment for respondents. The court found appellant had acted as a real estate broker when working on the Little Exuma project. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10131 discussed below.) The court pointed, however, to appellant\u2019s lack of evidence that Jane Venturi\u2019s unnamed broker had employed or authorized her to work on the project. Hence, appellant did not present a triable issue of fact that it was a licensed real estate broker entitled to compensation. The court entered judgment for respondents but denied respondents\u2019 request for attorney fees. This appeal (and respondents\u2019 cross-appeal for attorney fees) followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-4\">Business and Professions Code section 10131 defines a \u201creal estate broker\u201d as one who: \u201cdoes or negotiates to do one or more of the following acts for another or others: [f] (a) . . . solicits prospective sellers or purchasers of . . . or negotiates the purchase, sale or exchange of real property . . . . [f] . . . [f] (d) Solicits borrowers or lenders for or negotiates loans ... or performs services for borrowers or lenders or note owners in connection with loans secured directly or collaterally by liens on real property . . . . [f] (e) Sells or offers to sell, buys or offers to buy, or exchanges or offers to exchange a real property sales contract, or a promissory note secured directly or collaterally by a lien on real property . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 10131.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">Under its contract with respondents, appellant agreed to help find possible sources of financing for the Little Exuma project.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant also agreed, if respondents asked, to help negotiate the placement of Securities to procure that financing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such services could constitute those of a real estate broker, especially if appellant negotiated on respondents\u2019 behalf. (See \u00a7 10131 [broker \u201cdoes or negotiates to do one or more of [enumerated] acts for another . . .\u201d].) But the contract also called for appellant to provide services different from those of a real estate broker. For example, appellant agreed to review the project\u2019s costs and financial requirements. (Contract par. la.) Appellant also agreed to help respondents prepare information materials and documents related to financing the project, and to help formulate a marketing strategy to secure financing. (Contract par. lb, c.) Finally, appellant also agreed to provide mutually agreed-upon financial advice and investment banking services. (Contract par. le.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">The court correctly ruled appellant could not receive compensation for providing real estate broker services to respondents because appellant was not a licensed broker. (\u00a7 10136 [broker\u2019s license required to collect compensation for broker services].) But decisions such as <em>Lindenstadt </em>v. <em>Staff Builders </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 882 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 484] (Lindenstadt), establish that the court erred in denying appellant compensation to the extent appellant\u2019s services were not those of a real estate broker. In <em>Lindenstadt, </em>the parties entered into 25 to 30 written agreements in which the plaintiff promised to help the defendant find businesses for possible acquisition. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 885.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>(For historical reasons real estate broker services cover not only real estate, but also \u201cbusiness opportunities.\u201d <em>(All Points Traders, Inc. v. Barrington Associates </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 723, 728 [259 Cal.Rptr. 780].)) After the plaintiff found a number of such businesses, the defendant refused to compensate the plaintiff. <em>(Lindenstadt, </em>at p. 886.) The defendant cited the plaintiff\u2019s performance of broker\u2019s services without a license as justifying its refusal to pay. On appeal, the appellate court rejected the defendant\u2019s sweeping contention that the plaintiff\u2019s unlicensed services for <em>some </em>business opportunities meant the plaintiff could not receive compensation for <em>any </em>business opportunity. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 888-889, 893-894.) Rather, the appellate court directed the trial court to examine individually each business opportunity to determine whether the plaintiff acted as an unlicensed broker for that transaction or instead provided only services for which it did not need a broker\u2019s license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">Likewise here, the contract called for appellant to provide a range of services, some apparently requiring a broker\u2019s license, others seemingly not. Moreover, and more to the point, appellant denied having been involved in arranging, let alone negotiating, respondents\u2019 placement of Securities with the Talisker Group for which appellant claimed a \u201csuccess fee\u201d under the contract\u2019s provision awarding it a fee even if it had no role in procuring the financing. Thus, triable issues existed involving the extent to which appellant provided either unlicensed broker services or, alternatively, nonbroker services for which it did not need a license.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Accord, <em>Marathon Entertainment, Inc. v. Blasi </em>(2008) 42 Cal.4th 974, 990-993 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 727, 174 P.3d 741] [severability allowed partial enforcement of personal manager employment contract when license required for some, but not all, services rendered under the contract].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>Respondents try to distinguish <em>Lindenstadt. </em>They note that decision involved 25 to 30 separate written agreements covering scores of potential business opportunities. Such circumstances, according to respondent, permitted the trial court to meaningfully parse each transaction. Here, in contrast, the contract between appellant and respondents involved only one property, rendering it impossible, in respondents\u2019 view, to untangle broker from nonbroker services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-4\">We find respondents\u2019 attempted distinction to be unavailing. Even though the contract here involved developing only one property, it envisioned appellant directing its efforts toward many potential sources of financing. (Accord, <em>Marathon Entertainment, Inc. v. Blasi, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at pp. 980-981 [severability applied to unlicensed talent agent\u2019s contract to provide range of services to actress].) As to some of those sources, appellant may have crossed the line into performing broker services. But for other sources, appellant may have provided only financial and marketing advice for which it did not need a broker\u2019s license. (See, e.g., <em>Executive Landscape Corp. v. San Vicente Country Villas IV Assn. </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 496, 499-500 [193 Cal.Rptr. 377] [statute barring unlicensed contractor from receiving fees for some services did not prohibit recovery for work not within scope of licensing statute].) And finally, as to the Talisker Group, appellant may have provided even less assistance than financial and marketing advice, given that appellant denied involvement with the group. Whether appellant crossed the line into providing broker services is thus a triable issue of fact that we cannot resolve on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">For the parties\u2019 guidance following remand, we address appellant\u2019s contention that it was entitled to compensation for <em>all </em>services it provided to respondents. Appellant is mistaken, because it did not have a broker\u2019s license, and therefore was not entitled to compensation for broker\u2019s services. Appellant contends it was properly licensed because one of its managers, Jane Venturi, obtained a real estate sales license in February 2004. Thus, she, and appellant claims by extension itself, were licensed when respondents purportedly breached the contract by refusing to pay appellant months later for the Talisker Group placement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Jane Venturi\u2019s sales license was not, however, sufficient; only a licensed broker may provide broker services. (\u00a7 10136; accord, \u00a7 10132 [real estate salesperson is employed by a licensed real estate broker].) A sales license does not permit its holder to represent another unless the salesperson acts under a broker\u2019s authority. <em>(People v. Asuncion </em>(1984) 152 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>Cal.App.3d 422, 425 [199 Cal.Rptr. 514].) Jane Venturi notes that licensed broker Clay Herman Realtor, Inc., employed her. Her employment does not change the result, however, because the broker under whose authority a salesperson may act must itself be a party to the real estate contract, which was not the case here. (See generally 2 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed. 2000) \u00a7 5:51.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">Appellant also contends that its second managing principal, Matthew Venturi, had securities licenses that exempted appellant from needing a broker\u2019s license. In 1979, Matthew Venturi passed the Series 7 General Securities Representative Examination. And in 1999, he passed the Series 63 Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination. In support of its claimed exemption, appellant cites section 10133.1, subdivision (a)(9). That statute states that a licensed securities broker or securities dealer does not need a broker\u2019s license \u201cin connection with a transaction involving the offer, sale, purchase, or exchange of a security representing an ownership interest in a pool of promissory notes secured directly or indirectly by liens on real property . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 10133.1, subd. (a)(9).) Appellant\u2019s reliance on this exemption is misplaced in two ways. First, the court found appellant offered no evidence that the tests Matthew Venturi passed meant he was \u201clicensed as a securities broker or securities dealer.\u201d Second, the exemption applies to transactions involving a pool of promissory notes, but appellant offered no evidence that was the nature of the transaction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">RESPONDENTS\u2019 CROSS-APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">Claiming they were the prevailing party, respondents moved for their attorney fees after the court entered summary judgment for them. Appellant objected to respondents receiving their attorney fees because respondents were, in appellant\u2019s view, misapplying the contract\u2019s indemnification clause in seeking their fees. Concluding that the indemnification clause was not an attorney fee provision, the court agreed with appellant and denied respondents\u2019 motion for their fees. Respondents cross-appealed from the court\u2019s order. Because we have reversed summary judgment for respondent and are returning this matter to the trial court for further proceedings, respondents\u2019 cross-appeal is moot as there is no longer a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\">The judgment for respondents Pacific Malibu Development Corporation and Hermitage Estates Limited is vacated, and the trial court is directed to enter a new order denying respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Respondents\u2019 cross-appeal from the court\u2019s order denying respondents their attorney fees is dismissed as moot. Appellant Venturi &amp; Company LLC to recover its costs on appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">Bigelow, J., and O\u2019Neill, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1324-7\"> Appellant also alleged tort causes of action for fraud, concealment, and promissory fraud, but the court sustained respondents\u2019 demurrer to those causes of action without leave to amend. On appeal appellant does not argue the trial court erred in dismissing the tort causes of action; therefore, we do not discuss them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1325-7\"> All undesignated statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1325-8\"> See contract paragraph lc (appellant shall \u201cassist the Company in . . . identifying and contacting selected parties with regard to a Placement, scheduling meetings with such parties and participating in meetings and/or relevant discussions relating thereto\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1325-9\"><em> </em>See contract paragraph Id (appellant shall \u201cadvise the Company as to the strategy and tactics of negotiations in connection with the Placement and, if requested, assist in the negotiations with the related parties\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1326-5\"> Comparison of different provisions in the Business and Profession Code dealing with real estate brokers and contractors supports Lindenstadt\u2019s approach. Section 7031 prohibits unlicensed building contractors from suing to recover fees for unlicensed services <em>and </em>permits a contractor\u2019s client to recover \u201call compensation paid to the unlicensed contractor.\u201d (\u00a7 7031, subd. (b).) In contrast, the code contains no similarly draconian possibilities for unlicensed real estate brokers. While section 10136 prohibits an unlicensed broker from suing to collect broker\u2019s fees, the statute does not state a client may force a broker to disgorge any fees previously paid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1326-6\"> Accord, <em>Lindenstadt, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at page 886, footnote 3 (\u201c \u2018 \u201c[T]he rule is well established that one who simply finds and introduces a prospective [buyer] to a person who wishes to [sell] his property need not be licensed by the state in order to recover a commission for his services. Such an intermediary is protected by the so-called \u2018finder\u2019s\u2019 exception to the real estate licensing act.\u201d . . .

That decision is distinguishable from appellant\u2019s circumstances because the broker\u2019s license in <em>Lopez </em>had merely lapsed when the parties entered into their contract, but was renewed before the contract\u2019s completion. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 319.) Here, however, Jane Venturi had no license when appellant entered into its contract with respondent, and the license she later received was a sales license, not a broker\u2019s license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1328-7\"> 2 Miller and Starr, California Real Estate, supra, section 5:51, page 193 states: \u201cAlthough the salesperson may negotiate the listing agreement with the property owner, all listings must be in the name of the broker. Only a broker can enter into a listing agreement or other employment agreement that provides for compensation. A real estate salesperson is strictly the agent of the broker. The salesperson cannot contract in his or her own name and cannot accept money from any person other than the broker under whom he or she is licensed.
