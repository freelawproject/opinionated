Based on these findings, the superior court directed the Board to develop a program to train its members in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>application of parole suitability criteria as explained by relevant state and federal judicial opinions, to include provisions for continuing education of commissioners as new relevant case law is published. The superior court further directed that, prior to implementation, the newly developed training program be submitted, along with any associated rules and regulations, for the superior court\u2019s review and approval. Once the court-approved training program was in place, each of the petitioners would \u201creceive a new hearing before a Board that does not operate with the unfettered discretion and caprice demonstrated by the evidence here presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The Board appealed from each of the superior court\u2019s orders. Since each of these appeals challenges the superior court\u2019s findings and its authority to impose and oversee the development of a training program for the Board, we ordered that the appeals be considered together for purposes of oral argument and decision. We also stayed all five orders pending the decision on appeal. In these consolidated appeals,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we conclude the superior court erred in finding that the specified regulation (Regs., \u00a7 2402, subd. (c)) is vague as applied and that the Board is violating the separation of powers doctrine. Accordingly, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">I. <em>Factual and Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">A brief summary of the factual and procedural background of each matter follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">A. <em>The </em>Bragg <em>matter (H032045)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">In February 1986, while robbing a gas station, Bragg beat the attendant with a stick, mortally wounding him. From December 1985 to the time of his arrest in March 1986, Bragg also committed four other robberies, armed with a wrench on one occasion and with a two-by-four on the other three occasions. In two of these robberies, Bragg hit his victims on the head with his weapon, knocking them to the ground \u201cin a pool of blood.\u201d In the other two robberies, he attempted to hit the victims with his two-by-four, but missed. In 1987, Bragg pleaded guilty to second degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and robbery (\u00a7 211) and was sentenced to an indeterminate term of 15 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>In 2002, the Board of Prison Terms<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> denied parole to Bragg, and in May 2003, Bragg petitioned the superior court for a writ of habeas corpus. The superior court issued an order to show cause on the petition, and subsequently ordered an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether or not the Board\u2019s parole hearing process was \u201cbased on a generalized policy of denying parole without truly examining the merits of the [inmate\u2019s] case.\u201d In preparation for that hearing, the superior court ordered an \u201cexamination of the decision pages from the other Board hearings at and around the time of [Bragg]\u2019s [hearing].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In compliance with the superior court\u2019s order, the Board provided copies of the relevant portions of the transcripts of 679 life-term inmates who had parole suitability hearings between July 31, 2002, and October 31, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">B. <em>The </em>Ngo <em>matter (H032046)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u201cIn 1988, when he was 18 years old, Viet Mike Ngo killed a 14-year-old boy in a drive-by shooting. While a passenger in an automobile traveling on Highway 101, Ngo fired four bullets into a nearby vehicle, striking and fatally injuring the victim. Ngo pleaded guilty to second degree murder (... \u00a7 187) in 1989, and he was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison.\u201d <em>(Board, of Prison Terms </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1212, 1221 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 70], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">In 2003, the Board denied Ngo parole, and in 2004, Ngo filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the 2003 parole denial. In August 2004, the superior court issued an order to show cause, in which it ordered discovery to determine if, in over 90 percent of the cases during the year Ngo\u2019s hearing was held, the Board stated the crime was exceptionally or especially callous, dispassionate, calculated or cruel. The Board sought a writ of mandate, prohibition or other relief, which was granted and, in a published decision, this court ordered the superior court to vacate both the order to show cause and the discovery order. <em>(Board of Prison Terms v. Superior Court, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1220-1224.)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">In December 2005, the superior court issued a new order to show cause, directing the Board to provide transcripts of parole hearings conducted in August, September and October 2003 for inmates serving life terms for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>In 2006, the Board again denied parole to Ngo. Ngo filed a second petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The superior court again issued an order to show cause directing that Ngo\u2019s two petitions be combined for purposes of rendering a final decision, on the grounds that the claims raised in the 2006 petition were similar to those raised in the 2004 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">On January 26, 2007, the superior court ordered the Board to provide transcripts of all inmates who had parole hearings in April 2006, \u201calong with the transcript of every hearing in which those inmates were denied parole. For all the inmates who were granted parole, [the Board] is to provide the transcript of the most recent prior hearing at which they were denied parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In compliance with the court\u2019s order, the Board provided hearing transcripts of 585 life-term inmates<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> who had parole suitability hearings between July 1, 2003, and April 30, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">C. <em>The </em>Jameison <em>matter (H032047)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">In December 1978, Jameison shot the victim twice in the head, killing him. The victim was found lying in bed, and police concluded there had not been a struggle prior to the shooting. Jameison had been living with the victim while Jameison was going through a divorce. In 1979, Jameison was convicted of second degree murder (\u00a7 187) and was sentenced to a term of 15 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">In November 2003, the Board denied parole to Jameison, and in August 2004, Jameison filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging that denial. Again, the superior court issued an order to show cause and, on May 12, 2005, ordered that the Board produce the transcripts \u201cof all inmates incarcerated for first or second degree murder that had parole consideration hearings between and including the dates of October 1, 2003 and December 31, 2003.\u201d An examination of these transcripts disclosed that \u201cover 90% of the inmates within the specified three month period were denied parole and for each of them the crime itself was a primary reason.\u201d The superior court then ordered the Board to \u201cprovide [Jameison] a copy of the transcript of the hearing at which each of these 9-10% non-denied inmates were earlier denied parole.\u201d On January 12, 2007, the superior court ordered the Board to produce transcripts from parole hearings for life inmates which took place in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>June 2006, because the \u201csample/point estimate from 2003 may not be not [sic] valid for drawing conclusions about the behavior of the Board today.\u201d As before, if an inmate was granted parole at a June 2006 hearing, the Board was to provide a copy of the transcript of the prior hearing in which that inmate was denied parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The Board produced the hearing transcripts of 762 life-term inmates who had hearings between October 1 and December 31, 2003, in addition to June 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">D. <em>The </em>Criscione <em>matter (H032048)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In 1979, Criscione admitted to killing his girlfriend, whose body was found by police in a water-filled bathtub. \u201cThe coroner determined the cause of death to be strangulation and drowning.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Criscione </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 275, 280 [177 Cal.Rptr. 899].)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">In 2006, the Board denied parole to Criscione, who subsequently filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. The superior court issued an order to show cause and, on November 22, 2006, ordered the Board to review the transcripts for inmates who had parole consideration hearings in February 2005 and January 2006 to determine how many of those inmates were denied parole, at least in part, because of the commitment offense. In the event that an inmate was granted parole at a hearing during the relevant timeframe, the Board was to examine the transcript of that inmate\u2019s prior parole hearing to determine if the commitment offense was used as a basis for denying parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">In the Criscione matter, the hearing transcripts of 530 life-term inmates who had hearings in February 2005 and January 2006 were examined. At the June 1, 2007 evidentiary hearing, the Board stipulated that in all these parole hearings, it relied upon the commitment offense as a basis for denying parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">E. <em>The </em>Lewis <em>matter (H032044)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">\u201cDonald Ray Lewis pleaded guilty to murder in the first degree (\u00a7 187) in 1978. He was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole on the murder count. The murder occurred in 1977 when Lewis had a confrontation with the victim, Allen LaBonte, about a marijuana purchase. Lewis hit LaBonte on the head with a rock, crushing his skull. Lewis then took LaBonte\u2019s knife and stabbed him several times in the face and neck. After the stabbing, Lewis drove off in LaBonte\u2019s car. LaBonte\u2019s body was later discovered in a flood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>control channel.\u201d <em>(Board of Prison Terms </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at p. 1226.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In December 2003, the Board denied parole to Lewis,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> who subsequently filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. The superior court ordered the Board to produce the transcripts of all parole hearings conducted from November 2003 through February 2004. For any inmate who was granted parole at a hearing held during the relevant timeframe, the Board was further ordered to provide the transcript of their most recent prior parole hearing at which they were denied parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In the Lewis matter, the Board produced the hearing transcripts of 409 life-term inmates who had hearings between November 1, 2003, and February 26, 2004. Of these 409 transcripts, 267 were duplicates of transcripts which had already been examined in the Jameison or Ngo matters; consequently, only 142 additional transcripts were examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">F. <em>The evidentiary hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The evidentiary hearings on the various petitions were held over three days on October 20, 2006, February 23, 2007, and June 1, 2007. For the purposes of the hearings, the superior court took judicial notice of the pleadings and discovery produced in connection with each of the petitions. The petitioners introduced into evidence the results of their analyses of a total of 2,690 parole suitability hearing transcripts conducted during 13 randomly selected months between July 31, 2002, and June 30, 2006.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Karen Symons Rega, a licensed private investigator employed by petitioners\u2019 counsel, testified as to the methodology used in reviewing these transcripts. After familiarizing herself with section 3041 and Regulation section 2402, Rega examined the transcripts and \u201cidentified] the inmate\u2019s CDC number, the charge, whether or not the inmate was denied or approved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>parole, and also identified] the reasons for the denial, if they were denied.\u201d Rega was assisted in this task by several law school graduates. Rega described her approach as follows: \u201cI read each transcript, and I focused on the decision pages, trying to isolate certain language in the decision pages that indicated the reason for the denial; and specifically, I was looking for the words \u2018heinous, atrocious, cruel, dispassionate, calculated, exceptionally, callous, disregard, trivial, and/or inexplicable, the victim was abused, multiple victims.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Rega and her assistants prepared a chart which recorded, for each transcript, a brief description of the facts of the commitment offense as well as the language used by the Board to discuss that particular inmate\u2019s offense in connection with the decision to grant or deny parole. According to Rega, she and the other members of the team concluded that the commitment offense was a \u201cprimary\u201d reason for denying parole if the Board \u201cwould say things, such as, the primary reason for denial, the paramount reason for denial, paramount certainly is the commitment offense, first and foremost, things of that nature.\u201d Rega also stated that she and her team concluded the commitment offense was a \u201cprimary\u201d reason for denying parole if the Board listed the commitment offense first when discussing the reasons for denying parole or if they \u201cspent more time explaining the commitment offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">On cross-examination, Rega admitted that she and her assistants only recorded reasons for denial which were related to the commitment, offense; if the Board related any other reasons for denying parole, such as the inmate\u2019s prior criminality, record of violent behavior, history of unstable relationships, failure to profit from prior attempts to correct criminality, lack of realistic parole plans, prison discipline record, etc., those reasons were not noted on the charts. Rega explained this omission as follows: \u201c[T]he objective of our work was to determine whether or not the Board had cited the commitment offense as exceptional, and if we felt it was the primary, or if it was the primary reason for denial. Therefore, it didn\u2019t\u2014once we established that they were denied, the crime was described as exceptional, it was the primary reason for rejection. <em>It didn\u2019t seem productive to add any other reason.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">At one point during cross-examination, the superior court asked Rega the following question: \u201cDid you\u2014did you make any effort to determine how the Board rationalized or explained its use of the crime in conjunction with the other factors to deny parole? In other words, were you looking for the Board saying, Well, here\u2019s our analysis of the crime, and when you consider that in conjunction with certain behavior in prison, after that causes us to believe this person poses a significant risk, did you do anything like that?\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Rega replied, \u201cNo. Our exclusive task was to determine if it was denied on the basis of the commitment offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Professor Mohammed Kafai, petitioners\u2019 expert in the field of statistics, testified that the statistical sample provided by the 2,690 transcripts was large enough to draw statistically significant conclusions about the entire population of life-term inmates currently facing parole eligibility hearings. Professor Kafai opined that, because the Board characterized nearly 100 percent of the commitment offenses as \u201cexceptionally\u201d or \u201cunusually\u201d heinous, atrocious or cruel, then the phrase itself, as a statistical matter, had no significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">G. <em>The superior court\u2019s August 30, 2007 orders</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">On August 30, 2007, the superior court issued five 34-page orders granting habeas corpus relief to the petitioners. In these orders, the court first determined that the regulation addressing the Board\u2019s consideration of the commitment offense in parole suitability determinations was not unconstitutionally vague on its face since the \u201cfactors in [subdivision (c)(1), subsections] (A)-(E) provide . . . clear limiting construction to the term \u2018especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\u2019 in [Regulations, section] 2402[, subdivision] (c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The superior court turned next to the petitioners\u2019 contention that the regulations are unconstitutionally void for vagueness \u201cas applied\u201d by the Board. After reviewing the evidence and the testimony presented at the hearing, the court reasoned that because the Board relied on the commitment offense, at least in part, in all 2,690 instances when it denied parole, the Board had necessarily found that each inmate\u2019s crime was \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel\u201d under Regulations, section 2402, subdivision (c). According to the court, \u201c[t]he result of the initial examination was that in over 90 percent of cases the Board had found the commitment offense to be \u2018especially heinous, atrocious or cruel\u2019 as set forth in [Regulations, section 2402, subdivision (c)(1)]. In the remaining 10% of cases either parole had been granted, or it was unclear whether [Regulations, section 2402, subdivision (c)(1)] was a reason for the parole denial. For all such cases, the decisions in the prior hearing for the inmate were obtained and examined. In every case, the Board had determined at some point in time that every inmates\u2019 crime was \u2018especially heinous, atrocious or cruel\u2019 under [Regulations, section 2402, subdivision (c)(1)]. [][] Thus, it was shown that 100% of commitment offenses reviewed by the Board during the 13 months under examination were found to be \u2018especially heinous, atrocious or cruel\u2019 under [Regulations, section 2402, subdivision (c)(1)].\u201d Because, by definition, the term \u201c \u2018especially\u2019 . . . cannot possibly apply in 100% of cases,\u201d the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>concluded that the Board\u2019s decisions are \u201cmade not on the basis of detailed guidelines and individualized consideration.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the court adopted Professor Kafai\u2019s findings that, statistically, it was fair to conclude that at <em>every </em>parole consideration hearing where an inmate is found unsuitable for parole, the Board makes a finding that the commitment offense is \u201cparticularly egregious\u201d or \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel.\u201d The superior court reasoned, therefore, that the Board was applying the regulations arbitrarily and thus the regulations were void for vagueness \u201cas applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The superior court further found that the Board, by acting as described above, disregards the limits and guidelines placed upon it by section 3041, subdivision (b) and has been \u201cappropriating\u201d to itself absolute power over parole matters, in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The court concluded that the only way the Board could lawfully perform its duties was if it were compelled to \u201cidentify the logical connection between the facts upon which it relies and the specific criteria found to apply in the individual case.\u201d To that end, the superior court directed the Board to \u201cdevelop, submit for approval, and then institute a training policy for its members based on the current and expanding body of published state, and federal, case law reviewing parole suitability decisions, and specifically the application of [Regulations,] \u00a7 2402 criteria [not limited to subdivision (c)(1)].\u201d Although it acknowledged that the \u201cshowing and analysis in this case was limited to [Regulations,] \u00a7 2402[, subdivision] (c)(1),\u201d the superior court found that \u201cthe conclusions that the evidence compelled, that the Board has been carelessly distorting and misapplying the regulations, is [szc] not so limited. Accordingly, the training program that is necessary for the Board [cannot] reasonably be limited to just [Regulations,] \u00a7 2402[, subdivision] (c)(1). Thus, to the extent case law recognizes, clarifies and establishes remedies for other due process violations they must also be incorporated into the necessary rules and training the Board is required to abide by.\u201d The superior court reserved jurisdiction to review and approve the Board\u2019s newly developed rules, regulations and training program, and once this court-approved regime was in place, petitioners were to then be given new parole hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">A. <em>Standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The challenged order is in the nature of an injunction as it directs the Board to develop and implement a comprehensive training program, complete with continuing legal education, for its commissioners. Ordinarily, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>reviewing an order granting injunctive relief, we apply the deferential abuse of discretion standard. (See <em>ReadyLink Healthcare </em>v. <em>Cotton </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 720].) The superior court\u2019s decision will be reversed only when it exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards uncontradicted evidence. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">B. <em>The statutory and regulatory framework for parole hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In the case of an inmate sentenced to life in prison, one year prior to the inmate\u2019s minimum eligible parole release date a panel of commissioners of the Board shall meet with the inmate and \u201cshall normally set a parole release date.\u201d (\u00a7 3041, subd. (a).) Parole considerations applicable to life prisoners convicted of murder are contained in Regulations, section 2400 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Regulations, section 2402, guides the Board\u2019s assessment of whether the inmate poses \u201can unreasonable risk of danger to society if released from prison,\u201d and thus whether he or she is suitable for parole. (Regs., \u00a7 2402, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The regulation also lists several circumstances relating to <em>unsuitability </em>for parole<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\u2014such as the heinous, atrocious, or cruel nature of the crime, or an unstable social background; and <em>suitability </em>for parole\u2014such as an inmate\u2019s rehabilitative efforts, demonstration of remorse, and the mitigating circumstances of the crime.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Regs., \u00a7 2402, subd. (d).) Finally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>regulation explains that the foregoing circumstances \u201care set forth as general guidelines; the importance attached to any circumstance or combination of circumstances in a particular case is left to the judgment of the panel.\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 2402, subds. (c), (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u201cRegardless of the length of time served, a life prisoner shall be found unsuitable for and denied parole if in the judgment of the panel the prisoner will pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society if released from prison.\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 2402, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">C. <em>The superior court did not err in addressing a constitutional challenge to the regulations as that challenge was expressly or implicitly raised in the petitions for habeas corpus relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">As we have previously noted, only claims that are expressly or implicitly raised in the original or a supplemental petition for writ of habeas corpus may be adjudicated by the superior court. <em>(Board of Prison Terms </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at p. 1237.) The Board herein objects to the superior court\u2019s orders on the grounds that the petitions below did not claim that the parole regulations are unconstitutionally vague, either on their face or \u201cas applied.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The petitions are replete with allegations that the Board is acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner in making parole suitability determinations, and that it is implementing a \u201cno parole\u201d policy in violation of section 3041. While none of the petitions expressly claim that the regulations are vague, or vague \u201cas applied\u201d by the Board, the failure to include those specific words in the petitions is not dispositive. The \u201csuperior court in crafting the order to show cause has the power to explain its preliminary assessment of the petitioner\u2019s claims [and] restate inartfully drafted claims for purposes of clarity . . . .\u201d <em>(Board of Prison Terms v. Superior Court, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at p. 1239.) The superior court did so here, and it is apparent from the record that the Board had notice of and an opportunity to respond to the issues as framed by the orders to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">D. <em>In evaluating how the parole regulations are applied by the Board, the superior court failed to construe the regulations as a whole</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">\u201c[A]n as applied challenge assumes that the statute or ordinance violated is valid and asserts that the manner of enforcement against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>particular individual or individuals or the circumstances in which the statute or ordinance is applied is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>(Tobe </em>v. <em>City of Santa Ana </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1069, 1089 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 402, 892 P.2d 1145].) \u201c[An as applied challenge] contemplates analysis of the facts of a particular case or cases to determine the circumstances in which the statute or ordinance has been applied and to consider whether in those particular circumstances the application deprived the individual to whom it was applied of a protected right.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1084.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In determining whether or not an inmate is suitable or unsuitable for parole, \u201c[t]he relevant determination for the Board ... is, and always has been, an individualized assessment of the continuing danger and risk to public safety posed by the inmate. If the Board determines, <em>based upon an evaluation of each of the statutory factors as required by statute, </em>that an inmate remains a danger, it can, and must, decline to set a parole date.\u201d <em>(In re-Lawrence </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1181, 1227 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 169, 190 P.3d 535], italics added.) Further, \u201c[i]t is not the existence or nonexistence of suitability or unsuitability factors that forms the crux of the parole decision; the significant circumstance is how those factors interrelate to support a conclusion of current dangerousness to the public.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1212.) What this means is that the Board\u2019s findings that certain suitability or unsuitability factors, e.g., whether or not the commitment offense was \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel,\u201d exist in a particular case are secondary to the Board\u2019s analysis and explanation of how those factors combine to support its ultimate decision to either grant or deny parole to a particular inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Viewed through this analytical lens, the shortcomings of the superior court\u2019s orders become apparent. In its orders, the superior court takes the Board to task for finding 100 percent of the commitment offenses reviewed to be \u201cespecially\u201d heinous, atrocious or cruel, noting that the term \u201cespecially,\u201d by definition, cannot be used to describe 100 percent of anything.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the view of the superior court, this logical inconsistency demonstrates the Board\u2019s failure to \u201coperate within the limiting construction of the regulations,\u201d and its propensity to do \u201cviolence to the requirements of due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>and individualized consideration which are paramount to the appropriate exercise of its broad discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">If the Board\u2019s analysis of an inmate\u2019s parole suitability depended <em>solely </em>upon a finding that the inmate\u2019s commitment offense was \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel\u201d and the Board routinely made such a finding, this would present compelling evidence that the Board was undertaking a formulaic application of the parole suitability regulations in violation of inmates\u2019 due process rights. However, the regulations direct the Board to consider many factors before determining whether or not a particular inmate is suitable for parole\u2014whether or not the commitment offense was or was not \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel\u201d is but one of those factors. For petitioners and the superior court, it was enough that the Board characterized most or all of the commitment offenses as \u201cespecially\u201d heinous, atrocious or cruel. Conceding that this is a linguistically illogical approach, the salient question remains: In finding an inmate unsuitable for parole, does the Board fail to demonstrate how all the applicable regulatory factors interrelate to support its conclusion that the inmate is currently dangerous to society?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The superior court\u2019s orders do not answer that question because petitioners\u2019 evidence was limited to calculating how often the Board characterized the commitment offense as \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel.\u201d If the Board cited any reasons for denying parole, apart from the commitment offense, those additional reasons were ignored and were not recorded on the charts offered into evidence by petitioners. When Rega was asked by the superior court if she and her research assistants made \u201cany effort to determine how the Board rationalized or explained its use of the crime in conjunction with the other factors to deny parole,\u201d she responded, \u201cNo. Our exclusive task was to determine if [parole] was denied on the basis of the commitment offense.\u201d In fact, as Rega herself testified, out of all the transcripts examined, there was no case \u201cin which the Board used the commitment offense and no other reason for denying parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Again, in reviewing the Board\u2019s decision that an inmate is not suitable for parole, the question is whether or not the Board\u2019s conclusion that a particular inmate poses a current danger to society is supported by the Board\u2019s analysis of the various unsuitability and suitability factors, not whether or not the Board habitually describes all commitment offenses as \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel.\u201d (See <em>In re Lawrence, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 1212.) In the course of the proceedings below, the superior court seems to have lost sight of the trees for the forest. In finding that the Board\u2019s application of the parole regulations is unconstitutionally vague because it \u201cis implicit in [Regulations,] \u00a7 2402 . . . [that] the qualifier \u2018especially,\u2019 in \u2018especially heinous, atrocious or cruel,\u2019 requires that some form of comparison [of commitment offenses] be made,\u201d the superior court seems to endorse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the notion of comparative analysis, an approach which the California Supreme Court has rejected. (See <em>In re Dannenberg </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1061, 1084 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 417, 104 P.3d 783] [\u201c[Determination of suitability for parole involves a paramount assessment of the public safety risk posed by the particular offender, without regard to a comparative analysis of similar offenses committed by other persons.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">As the California Supreme Court recently noted, \u201c[flocus upon whether a petitioner\u2019s crime was \u2018particularly egregious\u2019 in comparison to other murders in other cases is not called for by the statutes, which contemplate an individualized assessment of an inmate\u2019s suitability for parole, nor is it a proper method of assessing whether \u2018some evidence\u2019 supports the Governor\u2019s conclusion that a particular inmate represents an unreasonable threat to public safety. The circumstance that some inmates who committed murders were or were not adjudged to be threats to public safety has a minimal bearing upon whether any <em>other </em>inmate poses such a threat. . . . [T]he statute does not require the Board to compare the inmate\u2019s actual period of confinement with that of other individuals serving life terms for similar crimes. [Citation.] Rather, the statutory suitability determination is individualized, and focuses upon the public safety risk posed by the particular offender.\u201d <em>(In re Lawrence, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 1217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">E. <em>On remand, the superior court must give individual consideration to the merits of each petition for writ of habeas corpus</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">As explained above, we find that the evidence presented below does not support the superior court\u2019s findings that the Board is violating the separation of powers doctrine, and that the specified regulation (Regs., \u00a7 2402, subd. (c)) is vague as applied. However, we do not express an opinion on the merits of the individual habeas corpus petitions at issue herein, and therefore will remand those matters to the superior court for its consideration. On remand, in evaluating the individual petitions for habeas corpus relief, the superior court should keep in mind the appropriate standard of review, namely that \u201cthe relevant inquiry for a reviewing court is not merely whether an inmate\u2019s crime was especially callous, or shockingly vicious or lethal, but whether the identified facts are <em>probative </em>to the central issue of <em>current </em>dangerousness when considered in light of the full record before the Board . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Lawrence, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 1221.) There is nothing inherently improper about the Board basing \u201ca denial-of-parole decision upon the circumstances of the offense, or upon other immutable facts such as an inmate\u2019s criminal history, but some evidence will support such reliance <em>only </em>if those facts support the ultimate conclusion that an inmate <em>continues </em>to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>III. <em>Disposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The orders granting habeas corpus relief are reversed. The matters are remanded to the superior court for consideration of the merits of the individual petitions for writs of habeas corpus in accordance with <em>In re Lawrence </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1181 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 169, 190 P.3d 535].</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Rushing, P.
