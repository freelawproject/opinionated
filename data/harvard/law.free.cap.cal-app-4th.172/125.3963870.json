Code, \u00a7 626.10, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and possession of tobacco by a minor (\u00a7 308, subd. (b)). Defendant claims the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d he possessed on school grounds did not fall within the weapons prohibited by section 626.10, subdivision (a), and that the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress all physical evidence obtained from the search of his backpack at school. Defendant also seeks to withdraw his guilty plea to a count of petty theft (\u00a7\u00a7 484-488), as alleged in a Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 petition filed subsequent to but adjudicated simultaneously with the first petition. We affirm. The \u201cmulti-tool\u201d in defendant\u2019s possession qualifies as a \u201cfolding knife with a blade that locks into place\u201d under section 626.10, subdivision (a). Moreover, defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by a campus police officer\u2019s search of defendant\u2019s backpack. Finally, defendant\u2019s argument that his admission to petty theft was involuntary and unknowing is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">On the morning of August 30, 2006, a campus police officer at an Orange County high school received a radio call from school authorities indicating a student was unable to stay awake in class. The officer arrived and identified the student as defendant. Defendant was not conscious when the officer arrived in the classroom. The officer woke defendant; the officer observed defendant was \u201cout of it\u201d and \u201cnot . . . very coherent.\u201d The officer escorted defendant to the nurse\u2019s office in a golf cart.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">At the nurse\u2019s office, the officer asked defendant if he had anything in his possession that he should not have at school. Defendant replied that he had cigarettes. The officer immediately searched defendant\u2019s backpack, and found a pack of cigarettes, one loose cigarette, a \u201cmulti-tool,\u201d and glue. The \u201cmulti-tool\u201d included numerous tool features, including pliers, a flat head screwdriver, a Phillips head screwdriver, a file, a can opener, and a sharpened blade. When extended, the approximately one-inch long blade locked into place. The \u201cmulti-tool\u201d was in a closed position when the officer found it\u2014none of the tools were deployed. After finding the items in defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>backpack, the officer read defendant his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602], in the presence of the school psychologist. Defendant indicated he understood his rights. The officer asked defendant why he had the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d in his backpack; defendant responded that the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d was not his and that he did know why it was in his backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Based on defendant\u2019s possession of the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d and cigarettes, the district attorney filed a petition seeking to declare defendant minor a ward of the state pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, subdivision (a). The two issues contested by defendant were whether possession of the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d qualified as a violation of section 626.10, subdivision (a), and whether the court should suppress evidence resulting from the search of defendant\u2019s backpack. The officer was the only witness who testified at trial. The court denied defendant\u2019s Welfare and Institutions Code section 700.1 motion to suppress the physical evidence obtained from defendant\u2019s backpack and found the allegations against defendant to be true beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The court examined the \u201cmulti-tool,\u201d describing it as \u201ca . . . precision instrument, and it is quite small. The blade on the knife is approximately one inch. [][] But on this device, when the blade is open, certainly it is in a locked position, and one cannot move the blade. . . . [f] In looking at [the \u2018multi-tool\u2019], it struck the court as somewhat de minimus in nature in that it is such a small item . ... HQ But in looking at this instrument, it would seem to me that [it] would still be a folding knife if it was opened up properly and if it was used for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Prior to the resolution of the first petition, the district attorney filed a second petition to declare defendant a ward of the court based on allegations defendant committed petty theft on September 3, 2007, by stealing two items from an electronics store. Following the court\u2019s findings on the first petition, defendant admitted the allegations in the second petition. The court found defendant intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily waived his constitutional right to a speedy trial on the allegations of petty theft, found a factual basis for the plea, and found the allegations in the second petition to be true beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Based on the court\u2019s findings on both petitions, it declared defendant a ward of the court, and ordered defendant to complete 10 days in the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>work program, pay a fine of $150, pay restitution to the electronics\u2019 store, and comply with various terms of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\n<em>Classification of the Item Possessed by Defendant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The first issue before us is whether the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d possessed by defendant falls within the list of items specifically prohibited on school grounds by section 626.10, subdivision (a). In particular, we must review whether the trial court correctly concluded defendant\u2019s \u201cmulti-tool\u201d was a \u201cfolding knife with a blade that locks into place.\u201d The statute provides, in relevant part: <em>\u201cAny person . . . who brings or possesses any </em>dirk, dagger, ice pick, knife having a blade longer than 2 1/2 inches, <em>folding knife with a blade that locks into place, </em>a razor with an unguarded blade, a taser, or a stun gun, . . . any instrument that expels a metallic projectile such as a BB or a pellet, ... or any spot marker gun, <em>upon the grounds of, or within, any public or private school </em>providing instruction in kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, <em>is guilty of a public offense, </em>punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by imprisonment in the state prison.\u201d (\u00a7 626.10, subd. (a), italics added.) The parties are in agreement that the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d is not a \u201cknife having a blade longer than 2 1/2 inches\u201d (the blade is about one-inch long) and is not a \u201crazor,\u201d \u201cdirk,\u201d or \u201cdagger.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Defendant claims the court incorrectly interpreted the statute, not that the court inaccurately described the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d in making its factual findings. \u201cThe determination of the meaning of a statute is a question of law that is subject to de novo review . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Z.R. </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1512 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 495].) If the statute is unambiguous, the plain meaning of the statute governs our interpretation because \u201c ' \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said <em>(In re Do Kyung K. </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 583, 590-591 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 31].) If the meaning of the statute is not plain, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he statute \u2018must be given a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the Legislature, practical rather than technical in nature, and which, when applied, will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 591.) \u201c[A]ny doubts as to the correct interpretation of the statutory prohibition must be resolved in [defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Few cases have interpreted section 626.10, subdivision (a), and those that have done so limited their analyses to inapplicable portions of the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>(In re Z.R., supra, </em>168 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1512-1514 [box cutter with exposed blade is a \u201crazor with an unguarded blade\u201d]; <em>In re Michael R. </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1203, 1205-1207 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 291] [box cutter with blade retracted into handle is not a \u201crazor with an unguarded blade\u201d because the blade is guarded]; <em>In re Do Kyung K., supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at pp. 590-594 [standard rectangular, freestanding \u201crazor blade\u201d is not a \u201crazor with an unguarded blade\u201d because \u201crazor\u201d should be interpreted to necessarily include an object which holds or is otherwise connected to the component of the \u201crazor\u201d known as a \u201crazor blade\u201d]; <em>In re Arturo H. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1694, 1696-1699 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 5] [pellet gun is prohibited under the statute even if it is not in working condition and therefore cannot actually \u201c \u2018expel[] a metallic projectile\u2019 \u201d]; <em>In re Rosalio S. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 775, 778-781 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 534] [in determining whether a knife\u2019s blade exceeds two and one-half inches, measurement of \u201cblade\u201d should include only \u201csharpened portion\u201d capable of cutting and not the entire \u201cmetal portion\u201d of the knife].)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Defendant makes two arguments in support of his contention that the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d at issue is not a \u201cfolding knife with a blade that locks into place\u201d; (1) a \u201cmulti-tool\u201d is not a \u201cknife\u201d because it contains multiple tools, only one of which is a small (one-inch) blade with an awkward handle; and (2) the Legislature could not have intended to include the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d at issue because it would not function effectively as a weapon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">We do not think section 626.10, subdivision (a), is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation put forth by defendant. The parties agree a knife is \u201ccommonly defined as a tool consisting of a blade and a handle . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Rosalio S., supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 779.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   The \u201cmulti-tool\u201d at issue includes a blade, which can be deployed by pulling it out of the interior of the tool and locking it into place. The blade can then be \u201cfolded\u201d back into the tool once the locking mechanism is released. The remainder of the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d serves as the handle for the knife when the blade is deployed. Functionally, the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d is a \u201cfolding knife with a blade that locks into place.\u201d  The statute does not require any particular blade size, blade sharpness, ease of deployment of the folding blade, or capability of the knife to inflict deadly wounds if the weapon at issue is a \u201cfolding knife with a blade that locks into place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The text describing the other categories of weapons prohibited by section 626.10, subdivision (a), supports our interpretation. An ordinary, nonfolding knife must include a blade that is at least two and one-half inches long; the statute does not require a particular blade length for a \u201cfolding knife with a blade that locks into place.\u201d (\u00a7 626.10, subd. (a).) A \u201cdirk\u201d or \u201cdagger\u201d must be capable of inflicting \u201cgreat bodily injury or death\u201d; there is no similar requirement for a \u201cfolding knife with a blade that locks into place.\u201d (\u00a7 626.10, subds. (a), (h).) A razor is not prohibited if its blade is guarded; there is no similar exception for a \u201cfolding knife\u201d that has not yet been deployed. (\u00a7 626.10, subd. (a); see <em>In re Z.R., </em>supra, 168 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1512-1514.) Logically, it appears the Legislature wished to protect against the danger of knives with concealed blades capable of being folded and locked into place, regardless of the knife\u2019s size or relative capability for inflicting bodily damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Moreover, the ability of the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d to assist its owner in various legitimate, nonviolent tasks does not alter our conclusion. All knives can be used for legitimate, nonviolent purposes. That the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d is capable of an assortment of functions in addition to the already numerous usages of a knife cannot change the essential fact that a knife is incorporated into the \u201cmulti-tool.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Finally, the conglomeration of distinct and separable physical features (the pliers, the screwdrivers, etc.) into one product does not mean the product\u2014if it includes a blade and a handle\u2014is no longer a \u201cknife.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The contemporary \u201cmulti-tool\u201d market abounds with a multiplicity of models with varying combinations of features. We think, regardless of the name given to a particular product or the number of features included in a particular product, a \u201cmulti-tool\u201d is a \u201cfolding knife with a blade that locks into place\u201d if (simply enough) it has a blade that folds out and locks into place.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\"><em>Admissibility of Physical Evidence Obtained From Backpack </em>Search<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\"><em>Validity of Defendant\u2019s Guilty Plea to Charge of Petty </em>Larceny*</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Moore, Acting P.
