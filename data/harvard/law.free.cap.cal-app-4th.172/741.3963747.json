After a bench trial, the trial court awarded judgment to the Department on its claim, filed pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 14009.5,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for reimbursement of expenditures on health care services provided to Dowe before she died. The trial court awarded judgment to the Department on the ground that its claim was timely because Wooten failed to provide notice of Dowe\u2019s death to the Department as required by Probate Code section 9202.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Wooten contends that (1) the trial court should have barred the Department\u2019s evidence on the issue of notice under the doctrine of collateral estoppel; (2) she was prejudiced by the admission of the Department\u2019s evidence regarding notice; (3) the trial court misapplied the law and ignored applicable sections of the Probate Code governing the Department\u2019s claim; (4) the trial court was predisposed to rule in the Department\u2019s favor because it is a state agency. Having thoroughly considered each of appellant\u2019s contentions of error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Merlee Dowe received Medi-Cal benefits from January 1991 until her death on May 21, 2003. During that period, the Department paid $200,044.99 through its Medi-Cal program for medical care and treatment provided to Dowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">On July 28, 2003, the Department sent a Medi-Cal Estate Questionnaire form to Dowe\u2019s daughter, Evelyn Sasser. On August 18, 2003, Sasser sent a completed Medi-Cal estate questionnaire form to the Department, and included with it a certificate of death. The questionnaire disclosed that Dowe owned property worth an estimated $250,000. On December 10, 2003, the Department forwarded to Sasser a detailed claim in the amount of $200,044.99 for Medi-Cal expenses paid on behalf of Dowe. On December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>16, 2003, the Department filed in probate court a creditor\u2019s claim in the same amount against the estate of Marlee Dowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">On September 8, 2003, defendant Mary Wooten, as nominated executor of Dowe\u2019s estate, filed a Petition for Probate of Will and for Letters Testamentary and Proof of Holographic Instrument <em>(Estate of Dowe </em>(Super. Ct. Alameda County, No. RP03115472)). On August 12, 2004, the court issued Wooten letters testamentary and appointed her executor of Dowe\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On January 28, 2005, Wooten rejected the Department\u2019s claim in its entirety by filing a rejection of creditor\u2019s claim. On April 15, 2005, the Department filed a complaint against Wooten as personal representative of Dowe\u2019s estate to enforce and collect money due on its Medi-Cal creditor\u2019s claim against Dowe\u2019s estate. On August 11, 2006, the Department filed a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">On November 27, 2006, the trial court issued an order denying the Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In its order, the trial court stated: \u201cThe Department conceded at the [summary judgment] hearing that, subsequent to . . . Mary Wooten\u2019s appointment as the personal representative of the Defendant Estate, she mailed notice to the Department advising of decedent\u2019s death thus satisfying her (the personal representative\u2019s) obligations under Probate Code section 9202. The Department further conceded at the hearing that it did not, at any point within the time frame prescribed by Probate Code section 9150(c), serve the personal representative with the creditor\u2019s claim.\u201d The order concluded that the Department failed to bear the burden of proof on each element of its claim, in particular \u201cby failing to demonstrate that the creditor\u2019s claim upon which [the Department\u2019s] claim is based was filed in the manner mandated by Probate Code section 9150.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">A bench trial was held on May 1, 2007. The Department called its tax compliance representative, Estela Contreras. Counsel for the Department showed Contreras exhibit P, a copy of a letter addressed to the Department from Wooten\u2019s attorney and dated August 16, 2004.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contreras testified that if the Department had received exhibit P, the Department \u201cwould have sent a formal claim to the attorney and made a case note to reflect that it did go out on that date.\u201d Contreras added that under standard procedures, \u201call documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>that come into the [Department\u2019s] Estate Recovery Unit... are logged in to the ACMS system and therefore reflected in [the] case notes.\u201d Contreras stated that there was no case note in the file reflecting exhibit P, which meant that the Department had not received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Wooten\u2019s counsel Angela Morgan testified that she did not dictate exhibit P to her secretary. Rather, Morgan stated; \u201cI pretty much told her what to say, and she typed it.\u201d Morgan said she believed her secretary at the time was Lynette Lessy but it may have been Dawn Brown. Morgan stated that she did not witness her secretary mail the letter, but added that \u201cI don\u2019t see her do half of [the] things in my office, but they always got done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The trial court filed its statement of decision on November 26, 2007. In its statement of decision, the trial court found that Wooten, as personal representative of the Dowe estate, \u201cdid not provide notice of the decedent\u2019s death in the manner provided in Section 215[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] that triggered the four months after notice is given in which to file a claim [under section 9202].\u201d The statement of decision also concluded that a concession \u201cby counsel for the Department during a hearing on a motion for summary judgment to the effect that the Department had received . . . notice from [Wooten]\u201d was a mistake, was not binding on the Department at trial, and had not prejudiced presentation of Wooten\u2019s case at trial. On November 26, 2007, judgment was entered in favor of the Department in the amount of $200,044.99 plus allowable interest and costs. Notice of entry of judgment was filed on December 5, 2007, and Wooten filed a timely notice of appeal on January 3, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">A., B. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">C. <em>Applicable Sections of the Probate Code</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">Wooten contends the trial court ignored applicable sections of the Probate Code in awarding judgment to the Department on its claim. In particular, Wooten asserts the Department\u2019s claim was untimely pursuant to section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>9100,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the Department failed to comply with the notice requirements under section 9150,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that the Department should have utilized procedures for filing a late claim set forth in section 9103.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Wooten\u2019s reliance on sections 9100, 9103 and 9150 is misplaced. Sections 9100, 9103 and 9150 are found under chapters 3 and 4 of part 4 of division 7 of the Probate Code and are among the general provisions governing creditor claims. The Department\u2019s claim, on the other hand, is governed by the <em>specific </em>provisions for creditor claims by <em>public entities </em>found under chapter 5 of the same part\u2014sections 9200 to 9205.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Section 9200 provides: <em>\u201cExcept as provided in this chapter </em>[chapter 5], a claim by a public entity shall be filed within the time otherwise provided in this part. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 9200, subd. (a), italics added.) Section 9201 states: \u201cNotwithstanding any other statute, if a claim of a public entity arises under a law, act, or code listed in subdivision (b): [1] . . . [f] \u2022 . \u2022 [t]he claim is barred <em>only after written notice ... to the public entity and expiration of the period provided in the applicable section. </em>If no written notice or request is made, the claim is enforceable by the remedies, <em>and is barred at the time, otherwise provided in the law, act, or code.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 9201, subd. (a)(2), italics added.) Subdivision (b) of section 9201, under the heading \u201cLaw, Act, or Code,\u201d lists the \u201cMedi-Cal Act (commencing with Section 14000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code)\u201d and states that section 9202 is the \u201cApplicable Section\u201d governing claims brought pursuant to section 14000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. (\u00a7 9201, subd. (b).) Section 9202 mandates that a personal representative or estate attorney must provide notice to the Director of Health Services of the decedent\u2019s death within 90 days of the date letters testamentary are issued. (\u00a7 9202.) The director then \u201chas four months after notice is given in which to file a claim.\u201d (\u00a7 9202, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Under the well-established rule of statutory construction, a specific statute controls over a general statute covering the same subject. <em>(Neuwald v. Brock </em>(1939) 12 Cal.2d 662, 669 [86 P.2d 1047]; <em>Rose v. State of California </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 713, 724 [123 P.2d 505] [\u201cA specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that subject, as against a general provision, although the latter, standing alone, would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more particular provision relates\u201d].)  Contrary to Wooten\u2019s assertions, therefore, the Department\u2019s claim is not governed by the general provisions governing creditor claims found elsewhere in part 4. Rather, it falls under chapter 5\u2019s specific provisions for claims by public entities, in particular section 9202. (See <em>Estate of Starkweather </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 580, 587 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 766] [noting without discussion that the \u201capplicable section\u201d for claim by public entity under the Medi-Cal Act (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14000 et seq.) is \u00a7 9202 of the Probate Code].) Thus, the trial court correctly determined that section 9202 required Wooten to provide the Department with notice of Dowe\u2019s death in order to trigger the four-month time period within which the Department must file a creditor\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In sum, Wooten\u2019s claim that the trial court ignored applicable sections of the Probate Code in awarding the Department summary judgment is without merit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">D. <em>Trial Court </em>Bias<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">McGuiness, P.

(a)(1).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b717-6\"> Absent notice under section 9202, the Department\u2019s claim for reimbursement under section 14009.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is subject to a three-year statute of limitations under Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a). <em>(Shewry </em>v. <em>Begil </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 639, 643-644 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 209].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\"> Wooten also contends that the Department\u2019s \u201cnoncompliance with Probate Code [section] 9100 caused a detriment to the estate\u201d because it denied her the opportunity to file for a hardship waiver. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14009.5, subd. (c)(l)-(2) [providing for waiver of claim in whole or in part on grounds of \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d to dependents or heirs of the decedent and \u201cthe opportunity for a hearing to establish that a waiver should be granted\u201d].) However, as discussed above, the Department\u2019s claim is governed not by section 9100, but by section 9202. Had Wooten provided notice as required under section 9202, the Department would have sent her a hardship waiver application at that point. We see no grounds for reversal on this ground. Further, Wooten claims that her inability to file a hardship application \u201cviolated [the] beneficiary\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d We dismiss this claim because Wooten raised it for the first time in her reply brief and also provides no citation to authority in support of such a constitutional claim. <em>(Heiner </em>v. <em>Kmart Corp. </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 335, 350-351 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 854].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 741.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
