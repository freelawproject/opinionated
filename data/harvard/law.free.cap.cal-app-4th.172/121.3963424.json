Code, \u00a7 243, subd. (d); further section references are to this code; count I) and assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1); count II). He was sentenced on count I to state prison for the low term of two years with 141 days of presentence credit. Sentence on count II was stayed pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>On appeal, defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion by imposing a prison sentence rather than granting him probation. We shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In the published portion of this opinion we discuss the importance of careful handling of notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">FACTS<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The offense occurred on the night or early morning of August 20, or 21, 2005. Defendant entered his plea on October 14, 2005. He was sentenced on November 23, 2005, and he filed his notice of appeal that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The superior court clerk must \u201cpromptly mail\u201d to the Court of Appeal notification of the filing of a notice of appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.304(c)(1).) \u201cThe failure of a court reporter or clerk to perform any duty imposed by statute or these rules that delays the filing of the appellate record is an unlawful interference with the reviewing court\u2019s proceedings. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>rule 8.23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">However, it was not until March 11, 2008, that notice of filing the notice of appeal was mailed. In a declaration, the appeals clerk for the Amador County Superior Court stated that she had just discovered that this appeal, and two others, had been \u201cfiled and forgotten,\u201d and that defendant, who had received a two-year sentence, \u201cis more than likely out of prison by now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Once we were notified of the delay in these cases, we processed them expeditiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">In 1935, the mishandling of a timely notice of appeal resulted in defendant Rush Griffin\u2019s execution before his appeal could be heard. The ensuing furor led to the \u201cautomatic\u201d appeal procedure now employed in capital cases. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Massie </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 550, 566-567 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 816, 967 P.2d 29].)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>We do not equate the consequences to Griffin with the possible consequences to Grimes. But that extreme example highlights the importance of proper handling of notices of appeal in felony cases. As it happens, we affirm the judgment, so defendant Grimes has not been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">This does not mean that a clerical mistake resulting in a delayed appeal will always be without consequences. If an appeal had merit, the delay could mean a person suffered an unwarranted period of incarceration, or unwarranted collateral consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Because of this incident, and the trial court\u2019s prompt acknowledgment of the problem, we are confident that procedures will be modified so that the mistake will not be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">II. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Nicholson, Acting P.
