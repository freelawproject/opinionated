(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">O\u2019Shell argues that the order must be reversed because (i) the trial court prejudicially erred in precluding him from testifying to the jury that he faced a life sentence under California\u2019s \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law if he reoffended; (ii) the SVPA violates the state and federal constitutional guarantees of due process because, after an initial commitment, the Act places the burden on the committed person, rather than the state, to demonstrate that he or she no longer requires confinement; (iii) the SVPA violates the state and federal constitutional right to equal protection because it treats SVP\u2019s differently from other civilly committed persons without adequate justification; and (iv) his commitment is illegal because it was initiated by a process that relied on an improper \u201cunderground regulation.\u201d As discussed below, we conclude that O\u2019Shell\u2019s contentions are without merit and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-11\">In 1982, at the age of 19, O\u2019Shell met a 16-year-old boy at a party and drove him to an isolated area. O\u2019Shell threatened the boy with a knife, forced him to orally copulate him and then sodomized him. O\u2019Shell robbed the boy as well. O\u2019Shell was apprehended and pleaded guilty to forcible oral copulation; he was sentenced to 11 years in prison. In 1990, 15 months after his release from prison, O\u2019Shell began a relationship with a woman who had a 13-year-old son. For approximately four years after entering the relationship, O\u2019Shell molested the son from one to two times a week; the molestation included oral copulation, masturbation and sodomy. In the course of this conduct, O\u2019Shell threatened the victim\u2019s life and told him that if he did not comply, O\u2019Shell would begin molesting the victim\u2019s brother. O\u2019Shell was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>eventually caught and pleaded guilty to committing a lewd act upon a child; he was sentenced to 21 years in prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">Two psychologists, Jeremy Coles and Thomas MacSpeiden, examined O\u2019Shell for purposes of the SVP trial. After their examinations, Drs. Coles and MacSpeiden diagnosed O\u2019Shell with a mental disorder, \u201cparaphilia not otherwise specified\u201d (paraphilia NOS).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Coles testified that the disorder was characterized by \u201c \u2018recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviors generally involving [1.] non-human objects, [2.] the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one\u2019s partner, or [3.] children or other nonconsenting persons that occur over a period of at least 6 months.\u2019 \u201d Both doctors opined that as a result of this mental condition, O\u2019Shell was likely, upon release from custody, to reoffend in a sexually predatory manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">Two psychologists, Robert Hal\u00f3n and Christopher Heard, examined O\u2019Shell for the defense<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and determined that he did not suffer from a mental disorder. Drs. Hal\u00f3n and Heard testified that O\u2019Shell was instead, like many criminals, simply prone to antisocial behavior. The doctors also criticized Drs. Coles\u2019s and MacSpeiden\u2019s reliance on paraphilia NOS, arguing that it was an incomplete diagnosis that simply deduced the existence of a nonspecific mental disorder from O\u2019Shell\u2019s prior crimes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> O\u2019Shell testified that he had changed in prison and would attempt to minimize the possibility of reoffending by avoiding contact with potential victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">We discuss O\u2019Shell\u2019s various appellate challenges below after providing a general overview of the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">\n<em>Overview of the SVPA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">The SVPA provides for the involuntary civil commitment of certain criminal offenders following the completion of their prison terms. To be eligible for commitment under the Act, an offender must be classified as an SVP, which is defined as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against one or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1).) \u201c \u2018Diagnosed mental disorder\u2019 includes a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">SVPA proceedings are initiated by the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (the Secretary). When the Secretary determines that an inmate appears to meet the SVP criteria, the inmate is referred to the DMH for assessment. (\u00a7 6601, subd. (b).) The DMH \u201cshall evaluate the person in accordance with a standardized assessment protocol, developed and updated by the State Department of Mental Health.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c).) The protocol must involve an evaluation by two doctors \u201cto determine whether the person is a sexually violent predator.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>id., </em>subds. (a)-(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">If both doctors concur that \u201cthe person has a diagnosed mental disorder so that he or she is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence without appropriate treatment and custody,\u201d the DMH must request the filing of a commitment petition in the superior court in the county where the offender was convicted of the crime for which he or she is currently imprisoned. (\u00a7 6601, subds. (d), (i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">Once the petition is filed, the superior court holds a hearing to determine whether there is \u201cprobable cause to believe that the individual named in the petition is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon his or her release.\u201d (\u00a7 6602, subd. (a).) If no probable cause is found, the petition is dismissed. However, if the court finds probable cause within the meaning of this section, the court orders a trial to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>whether the person is an SVP. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The precise issue at trial is \u201cwhether the person is, by reason of a diagnosed mental disorder, a danger to the health and safety of others in that the person is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence upon his or her release from the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections or other secure facility.\u201d (\u00a7 6602, subd. (a); see \u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1).) The statute also includes an \u201cimplied requirement\u201d that the forecasted sexual violence be <em>predatory, </em>i.e., that it be \u201c \u2018directed \u201ctoward a stranger, a person of casual acquaintance with whom no substantial relationship exists, or an individual with whom a relationship has been established or promoted for the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Hurtado, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 1186, 1182; see \u00a7 6600, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">The alleged SVP is entitled \u201cto a trial by jury, to the assistance of counsel, to the right to retain experts or professional persons to perform an examination on his or her behalf, and to have access to all relevant medical and psychological records and reports.\u201d (\u00a7 6603, subd. (a).) The jury\u2019s verdict must be unanimous. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">At the conclusion of the trial, the trier of fact \u201cshall determine whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the person is a sexually violent predator.\u201d (\u00a7 6604.) \u201cIf the court or jury is not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is a sexually violent predator, the court shall direct that the person be released at the conclusion of the term for which he or she was initially sentenced, or that the person be unconditionally released at the end of parole, whichever is applicable. If the court or jury determines that the person is a sexually violent predator, the person shall be committed for an indeterminate term to the custody of the State Department of Mental Health for appropriate treatment and confinement in a secure facility designated by the Director of Mental Health.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see generally <em>People v. Superior Court (Ghilotti) </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 888, 922 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 44 P.3d 949] <em>(Ghilotti).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">A person found to be an SVP is entitled to an annual review to determine whether he or she \u201ccurrently meets the definition of a sexually violent predator and whether conditional release to a less restrictive alternative or an unconditional release is in the best interest of the person and conditions can be imposed that would adequately protect the community.\u201d (\u00a7 6605, subd. (a).) The SVP may also retain, or request court appointment of, a qualified expert to examine him or her. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If the DMH determines that the committed person is no longer an SVP or, alternatively, can safely be released to a less restrictive treatment setting, it shall file a petition with the superior court to that effect. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) A probable cause hearing and subsequent trial follow at which the state must prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the committed person\u2019s diagnosed mental disorder remains such that he or she is a danger to the health and safety of others and is likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>engage in sexually violent criminal behavior if discharged.\u201d <em>(Id.., </em>subd. (d).) If the fact finder determines that the state has not met its burden, the committed person must be released. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">The statute also provides for the SVP to petition for release without the concurrence of the Director of Mental Health. (\u00a7 6608.) For these purposes, the SVP is entitled to the assistance of counsel and may file a petition with the superior court after one year of the initial commitment and at yearly intervals thereafter. <em>(Id., </em>subds. (a), (c), (h).) Unless the court deems the petition to be frivolous, or substantially identical to a previously denied petition (see <em>id., </em>subd. (a)), a trial is held with the court acting as finder of fact. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).) At the trial, the committed person must demonstrate that he or she is no longer an SVP by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (i).) If the trial court rules in favor of the committed person, \u201cthe court shall order the committed person placed with an appropriate forensic conditional release program operated by the state for one year.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).) At the end of the year, the court holds a hearing to determine whether the (former) SVP should be unconditionally released. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">\n<em>O\u2019Shell\u2019s Testimony That He Faced a Life Sentence If He Reoffended Was Relevant but Its Exclusion Was Harmless</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">O\u2019Shell contends that the trial court erred by excluding his testimony that he already had two strikes under the Three Strikes law and would not risk the automatic life sentence that would follow from a third strike. We address this contention after setting forth the pertinent procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">A. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-10\">Prior to trial, the prosecution moved to preclude any mention that O\u2019Shell was a two-strike offender who would face a life sentence if convicted of a third felony. The defense opposed the motion, arguing that the potential consequences of reoffending, and O\u2019Shell\u2019s knowledge of those consequences, were relevant to a determination of his likelihood of reoffending.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>The trial court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion, stating that the evidence \u201cgoes to part of the punishment aspect\u201d and \u201cis not particularly relevant.\u201d The prosecutor then sought to \u201cclarify\u201d the court\u2019s ruling. The prosecutor noted that her \u201cmotion was not only that it was not relevant . . . but also that it would be prejudicial under Evidence Code [section] 352.\u201d The trial court stated, \u201cSo noted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">At trial, the prosecution called O\u2019Shell as a witness. (See <em>Allen, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 860 [\u201cthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against compulsory self-incrimination does not apply in proceedings under the SVPA\u201d].) The prosecutor asked O\u2019Shell about the parole supervision he would receive upon release. The prosecutor pointed out that O\u2019Shell had committed one of his prior offenses while on parole, and that parole supervision and the threat of revocation, \u201cdidn\u2019t stop you\u201d from committing a second offense. The prosecution then attempted to elicit that O\u2019Shell violated his probation as a juvenile offender, but O\u2019Shell stated he did not recall any such violations. Finally, the prosecution elicited that an 11-year prison sentence \u201cdidn\u2019t deter [O\u2019Shell] from molesting\u201d the second victim. The prosecutor asked, \u201cIf you\u2019re [found] not to be an SVP and you\u2019re placed on parole, the fact that you could be violated, that won\u2019t affect you either, will it, sir?\u201d O\u2019Shell explained that he had changed while in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">In response to this line of questioning, defense counsel asked O\u2019Shell about the consequences of a violation of his release conditions. O\u2019Shell stated, \u201cIt\u2019s a violation. I can go back to prison.\u201d O\u2019Shell added, \u201cIf a violation constitutes a felony, then I go to prison for a very long time.\u201d The prosecutor objected, and the trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard O\u2019Shell\u2019s answer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">B. <em>The Excluded Evidence Was Relevant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">O\u2019Shell contends that the trial court erred in excluding as irrelevant his proposed testimony (and striking his testimony) that he was particularly motivated to seek treatment and avoid reoffending because he faced a life term if he reoffended under the Three Strikes law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">Unless otherwise provided by statute, \u201call relevant evidence is admissible.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 351.) \u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence, including evidence relevant to the credibility of a witness . . . , having any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>determination of the action.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210.) \u201c[T]he trial court \u2018has broad discretion in determining the relevance of evidence [citations], but lacks discretion to admit irrelevant evidence.\u2019 . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weaver </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 876, 933 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 29 P.3d 103]; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 350 [\u201cNo evidence is admissible except relevant evidence.\u201d].) The SVPA itself contains a provision that emphasizes that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall prevent the defense from presenting otherwise relevant and admissible evidence.\u201d (\u00a7 6603, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Relevance is a two-part inquiry. First, the fact sought to be proven must be \u201cof consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210.) Second, the proffered evidence must have some \u201ctendency in reason\u201d to prove that fact. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here both parts of the inquiry were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">The fact sought to be proven was that O\u2019Shell was not likely to reoffend. This is a central issue in an SVP trial. As our Supreme Court has emphasized, an SVP finding \u201crequires both a qualifying mental disorder <em>and </em>a \u2018likelihood]\u2019 of reoffense, and the one does not predetermine the other.\u201d <em>(Ghilotti, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 921, fn. 12.) Consistent with this case law, the jury was instructed that to find O\u2019Shell was an SVP it had to determine that (i) he had a diagnosed mental disorder; (ii) as a result of that disorder he was \u201clikely\u201d to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior; and (iii) it was \u201cnecessary to keep him in custody in a secure facility to ensure the health and safety of others.\u201d (See CALCRIM No. 3454.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The instruction states that a person was \u201clikely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior if there is a substantial, serious, and well-founded risk that the person will engage in such conduct if released into the community.\u201d (See CALCRIM No. 3454; <em>Ghilotti, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">Thus, a jury in an SVP trial can properly conclude that an inmate has a mental disorder, but is not an SVP because he or she would be able to resist the urge to reoffend. <em>(Ghilotti, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pp. 920-921 [\u201cThe requisite likelihood of reoffense is thus a separate determination which does not inevitably flow from one\u2019s history of violent sex offenses and a predisposing mental disorder.\u201d]; <em>Cooley v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 228, 254 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 177, 57 P.3d 654] [\u201cWe made clear in <em>Ghilotti </em>that the determination of likelihood of future dangerousness was an element that must be proved in addition to the existence of mental disorder in order to commit an individual as an SVP.\u201d]; cf. <em>Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 412 [\u201cmost severely ill people\u2014even those commonly termed \u2018psychopaths\u2019\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>retain some ability to control their behavior\u201d].) Consequently, whether O\u2019Shell was likely to reoffend was a fact of consequence to the determination of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">It is also clear that the proffered evidence met the second aspect of the relevance inquiry\u2014it had some tendency in reason to disprove the likelihood of reoffense. As our Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[m]any factors . . . may influence the disordered offender\u2019s <em>motivation, </em>ability, means, and opportunity to function lawfully without supervision or restraint despite [a mental] impairment.\u201d <em>(Ghilotti, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 921, fn. 12, italics added.) One such factor is the offender\u2019s \u201cexpressed intent, if any, to seek out and submit to any necessary treatment\u201d and <em>\u201cany other indicia bearing on the credibility and sincerity of such an expression of intent.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 929, italics added; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberge </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 979, 987 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 861, 62 P.3d 97] [clarifying that the definition of \u201cthe phrase \u2018likely [to] engage in sexually violent behavior\u2019 in section 6600, subdivision (a), should be given the same meaning as the phrase \u2018likely to engage in acts of sexual violence without appropriate treatment and custody\u2019 in section 6601, subdivision (d), the provision at issue in <em>Ghilotti.\u201d].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">In the instant case, the severe penalties that would be imposed under the Three Strikes law if O\u2019Shell were to reoffend, and his fear of those penalties, had a tendency in reason to increase O\u2019Shell\u2019s \u201cmotivation ... to function lawfully without supervision or restraint despite the [mental] impairment.\u201d <em>(Ghilotti, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 921, fn. 12.) In addition, O\u2019Shell claimed that he was willing to attend outpatient treatment for his disorder. His awareness of the severe penal consequence of reoffense bore on \u201cthe credibility and sincerity\u201d of his expressed intent not to reoffend and to seek treatment to avoid doing so. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 929; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 210 [emphasizing that relevant evidence includes evidence that is relevant to the credibility of a witness]; cf. Evid. Code, \u00a7 780 [\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute, the court or jury may consider in determining the credibility of a witness any matter that has any tendency in reason to prove or disprove the truthfulness of his testimony at the hearing . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">In sum, O\u2019Shell\u2019s testimony as to the consequences of reoffense under the Three Strikes law was not properly excluded as irrelevant. The jury would, of course, be free to disregard the testimony (once admitted) as self-serving and entitled to little weight. Nevertheless, the excluded testimony was not irrelevant and the trial court did not have the discretion to exclude it on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>C. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling Cannot Be Affirmed Under Evidence Code Section 352</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">Rather than contend that the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct on relevance grounds,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Attorney General argues that the trial court \u201cwould not have abused its discretion by excluding the evidence under Evidence Code section 352\u201d had it so ruled. The Attorney General contends that, as we are required to affirm a correct ruling on any ground, we should affirm the trial court\u2019s relevance ruling on the ground that the evidence would have been properly excluded under Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">We disagree with the Attorney General\u2019s contention for two reasons. First, a ruling under Evidence Code section 352 is expressly committed to the <em>trial court\u2019s </em>discretion by statute. Evidence Code section 352 states that the trial court <em>\u201cin its discretion </em>may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) There is no provision in this statute or in the case law for an appellate court to conduct the requisite Evidence Code section 352 balancing in the first instance, which is what the Attorney General would have us do here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">The analysis might be different if the Attorney General were able to show that the evidence would have been excluded <em>as a matter of law </em>under Evidence Code section 352, but no such showing has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">While we agree (as we explain in pt. II.D., <em>post) </em>that the probative value of the excluded testimony was not particularly compelling, we nevertheless do not see a \u201csubstantial danger of undue prejudice,\u201d jury confusion or consumption of time inherent in O\u2019Shell\u2019s testimony that he was particularly motivated not to reoffend by his fear of a third strike. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352.) The testimony was brief and straightforward and spoke directly to a central issue in an SVP case\u2014the likelihood of reoffending. Further, the evidence regarding the potential deterrent effect of likely criminal sanctions responded to a line of inquiry pursued <em>by the prosecutor </em>on direct examination. Thus, the proper treatment of the excluded evidence under Evidence Code section 352 was, at most, a question upon which reasonable judges could disagree and cannot be resolved as a matter of law on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">Second, for evidence to be properly excluded under Evidence Code section 352, \u201cthe record must \u2018affirmatively show that the trial court weighed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>prejudice against probative value.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prince </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 1179, 1237 [57 Cal.Rptr.3d 543, 156 P.3d 1015].) This requirement provides \u201cthe appellate courts with the record necessary for meaningful review\u201d and \u201censurefs] that the ruling\u201d is \u201c \u2018the product of a mature and careful reflection on the part of the judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 25 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].) Here, there is no such affirmative showing. In fact, the record reflects that despite the prosecutor\u2019s request, the trial court declined to engage in Evidence Code section 352 balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">D. <em>The Error Was Harmless</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">Although we conclude that the trial court erred in excluding O\u2019Shell\u2019s testimony as irrelevant, we also believe reversal is not warranted because there has been an insufficient showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">An appellate court may not order a new trial on the ground of the erroneous exclusion of evidence unless the record shows that, absent the error, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different. (See Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13 [\u201cNo judgment shall be set aside, or new trial granted, in any cause, on the ground of ... the improper admission or rejection of evidence . . . unless, after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 354 [\u201cA verdict or finding shall not be set aside ... by reason of the erroneous exclusion of evidence unless the court which passes upon the effect of the error ... is of the opinion that the error . . . complained of resulted in a miscarriage of justice . . .\u201d].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">In the instant case, evidence concerning O\u2019Shell\u2019s enhanced motivation to avoid a felony conviction, while relevant, was tangential to the primary disputed issue at trial. The focus of the defense case was not that O\u2019Shell was unlikely to reoffend. Rather, the defense tried to show that even if O\u2019Shell were likely to reoffend, it would not be because of any mental disorder. This contention, if accepted by the jury, constituted a complete defense because \u201c[a] sex offender who <em>lacks a qualifying mental disorder </em>cannot be committed <em>no matter how high his or her risk of </em>reoffense.\u201d <em>(Ghilotti, </em>supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 921, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>Defense counsel framed the case around the mental illness question, contending in closing argument that \u201c[t]he issue is whether [O\u2019Shell] has a current diagnosable mental disorder.\u201d As noted above, the prosecution\u2019s experts diagnosed O\u2019Shell with paraphilia NOS. The defense experts disputed the diagnosis and contended that paraphilia NOS was not a distinct mental disorder, but merely an empty diagnosis that reasoned backward from O\u2019Shell\u2019s prior criminal acts. The jury, by its verdict, credited the prosecution\u2019s experts on this key disputed question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">On the separate question of the likelihood of reoffending, there was little serious dispute. Even Dr. Hal\u00f3n, a defense expert, testified that \u201cany prudent person would have to consider [O\u2019Shell] to represent a danger of reoffending.\u201d O\u2019Shell\u2019s own testimony and statements to the evaluating psychologists were also damning on this point. O\u2019Shell explained that his sex crimes fulfilled a need and that he had been \u201caddicted to the behavior\u201d in the four years he was molesting his second victim. Further, O\u2019Shell\u2019s prior offenses themselves painted a graphic picture of an uncontrolled predator who ceased offending solely upon incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">When the prosecutor asked O\u2019Shell \u201cWhat are you going to do to avoid victimizing another person?\u201d O\u2019Shell responded, \u201cThat\u2019s a very good question .... I can\u2019t specifically say.\u201d O\u2019Shell then asserted that he would try to \u201cavoid certain situations,\u201d adding, somewhat unrealistically, that if he encountered children, he \u201cwould run away as fast as I could.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">In addition, O\u2019Shell\u2019s testimony, even if buttressed by his fear of a potential Three Strikes sentence, remained subject to obvious impeachment on the grounds that (i) he had a strong interest in the outcome of the proceedings; and (ii) he had not previously been deterred by the prospect of significant criminal penalties. Even Dr. Hal\u00f3n, who testified on O\u2019Shell\u2019s behalf, stated he did not credit O\u2019Shell\u2019s claim that he had changed in prison, stating that O\u2019Shell had no genuine remorse and was a \u201cmaster manipulator.\u201d (Cf. <em>Allen, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 873 [concluding that error in precluding entirety of defendant\u2019s testimony in SVP proceeding was harmless].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">In sum, the evidence was overwhelming and largely uncontested that O\u2019Shell posed a \u201csubstantial[,] . . . <em>serious, and well-founded </em>risk\u201d of reoffending upon release. <em>(Ghilotti, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 916.) Consequently, the fact that the trial court erroneously excluded a portion of his testimony relevant only to this point was harmless. As the case was litigated primarily on the question of whether O\u2019Shell had a qualifying mental disorder, it is not reasonably probable that had the court allowed O\u2019Shell\u2019s testimony regarding his fear of the Three Strikes law, the jury would have reached a different verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>III.-V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">Judgment is affirmed.
