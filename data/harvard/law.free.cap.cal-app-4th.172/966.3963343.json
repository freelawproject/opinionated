J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF7\">Appellant Luis E. Bermudez\u2019s petition for a determination of factual innocence (Pen. Code, \u00a7 851.8)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was denied by the trial court as untimely. The court rejected appellant\u2019s contention that the two-year statutory limitations period imposed by section 851.8, subdivision <em>(J), </em>did not apply to petitioners like him, who had had charges lodged against them, but were not convicted. In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude the trial court\u2019s interpretation was correct and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Appellant was arrested on October 2, 2001, for numerous offenses against M.C., which allegedly occurred on July 25, 2001; and, on December 5, an information was filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 18, 2002, the case was dismissed pursuant to section 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">On November 17, 2004, almost three years after the dismissal, appellant apparently served the San Francisco Police Department (police department) and district attorney with an \u201cinformal petition for relief\u2019 under section 851.8 regarding these charges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record contains the first page of a form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>\u201cPETITION TO SEAL AND DESTROY ARREST RECORDS PURSUANT TO PENAL CODE SECTION 851.8.\u201d The form contains a box stating, \u201cIMPORTANT [|] See reverse side for additional information pertaining to Penal Code Section 851.8.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">On February 6, 2007, appellant filed the subject \u201cformal petition\u201d pursuant to section 851.8 seeking to seal and destroy the arrest records relating to the 2001 information. Attached is a March 23, 2006 declaration by appellant stating, \u201cI did not know the procedures to seal and clean a record and did not know this was affecting my job search. This is one of the reason [\u00bf7c] I did not summit [s/c] this petition before.\u201d In support of supplemental points and authorities, appellant attached 11 rejection letters sent by various public and private prospective employers. With the exception of two undated letters, the letters were dated between November 2004 and March 2007. The People opposed the petition, inter alia, on the ground that, pursuant to section 851.8, subdivision (Z), the November 2004 petition was untimely because it was filed* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> more than two years from appellant\u2019s October 2, 2001 date of arrest or filing of the October 3 complaint (the first accusatory pleading).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">On June 20, 2007, the court issued a four-page order concluding that the subject petition was filed beyond the two-year limitations period set out in section 851.8, subdivision (Z), and was therefore untimely. It also rejected appellant\u2019s assertions of good faith to excuse the petition\u2019s untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Thereafter, appellant moved for reconsideration of his factual innocence petition supported by the declaration of his counsel, Demands Evans, which sought to explain the delay in filing the petition between November 2004 and February 2007. The motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">I. <em>Section 851.8, Subdivision (l) Applies to Limit the Time for Petitions Filed Under Section 851.8, Subdivision (c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">Section 851.8 establishes the guidelines for sealing and destroying the arrest records of a person who is factually innocent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Matthews </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1052, 1055 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 348].) It applies to the following classes of individuals: \u201c(1) persons who have been arrested but no accusatory pleading has yet been filed (\u00a7 851.8, subd. (a)); (2) persons who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>have been arrested and an accusatory pleading has been filed but no conviction has occurred (\u00a7 851.8, subds. (c), (d)); and (3) persons who are \u2018acquitted of a charge and it appears to the judge presiding at the trial. . . that the defendant was factually innocent\u2019 (\u00a7 851.8, subd. (e)).\u201d <em>(Tennison v. California Victim Comp. &amp; Government Claims Bd. </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1171, fn. 4 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 88].)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The parties agree that section 851.8, subdivision (c) (hereafter section 851.8(c)) directly addresses appellant, who was arrested and against whom an accusatory pleading was filed. Section 851.8(c) provides: \u201cIn any case where a person has been arrested, and an accusatory pleading has been filed, but where no conviction has occurred, the defendant may, <em>at any time after dismissal of the action, </em>petition the court that dismissed the action for a finding that the defendant is factually innocent of the charges for which the arrest was made. A copy of the petition shall be served on the prosecuting attorney of the county or city in which the accusatory pleading was filed at least 10 days prior to the hearing on the petitioner\u2019s factual innocence. The prosecuting attorney may present evidence to the court at the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted as provided in subdivision (b). If the court finds the petitioner to be factually innocent of the charges for which the arrest was made, then the court shall grant the relief as provided in subdivision (b).\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Section 851.8, subdivision (l) (hereafter section 851.8(0), however, imposes a two-year limitations period. It provides, in relevant part: \u201cFor arrests occurring on or after January 1, 1981, and for accusatory pleadings filed on or after January 1, 1981, petitions for relief under this section may be filed <em>up to two years from the date of the arrest or filing of the accusatory pleading, whichever is later. . . . </em>Any time restrictions on filing for relief under this section may be waived upon a showing of good cause by the petitioner and in the absence of prejudice.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">On its face, section 851.8(c) permits the filing of a section 851.8 petition at any time after the action has been dismissed. No court has decided whether a petitioner described in section 851.8(c) is nonetheless subject to the limitations period of section 851.8(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the plain meaning of these subdivisions does not resolve their apparent conflict, we must ascertain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>intent of the Legislature and construe section 851.8 in order to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(People v. Ormiston </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 676, 685-686 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 567].) Since statutory interpretation is a purely legal issue, our review is de novo. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Ferguson) </em>132 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1529 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 481].) Our review of the legislative history supports the conclusion of the trial court that the two-year time limit in section 851.8(/) applies to petitions filed under section 851.8(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Prior to the enactment of section 851.8, existing law provided for the sealing of records if a person was found factually innocent by a court after acquittal, and did not provide for the destruction of arrest records except in marijuana cases. (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 2861 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) 4 Stats. 1980, Summary Dig., p. 382.) Section 851.8 was enacted by the Legislature in 1980 as urgency legislation, effective September 29, 1980. (Stats. 1980, ch. 1172, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6, pp. 3939, 3943.) The bill\u2019s purpose was to \u201cprovide a procedure whereby a person who has been arrested or detained and is factually innocent may request a law enforcement agency or the court to provide for the sealing and destruction of the arrest record, as specified.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., <em>supra, </em>at p. 383.)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 2861 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.), as introduced March 6, 1980, contained the \u201cat any time after dismissal\u201d language in section 851.8(c), but did not contain section <em>851.8(1) </em>or any other time limit for filing petitions for the sealing and destruction of arrest records.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">On April 16, 1980, Assembly Bill No. 2861 was amended to include section 851.8(1) and its two-year time limit. (Assem. Bill No. 2861 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 16, 1980.) An Assembly Ways and Means Committee analysis stated, \u201cThe bill has a two year statute of limitations for filing petitions based on arrests after January 1, 1981, but until January 1, 1983 they can be filed for arrest up to 5 years prior to the effective date of the statute.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Ways and Means, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2861 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 16, 1980, p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Finally, a September 11, 1980 letter to Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., from Yolo County District Attorney Richard L. Gilbert, a sponsor of Assembly Bill No. 2861 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.), urging the signing of the bill, provides, \u201cThe bill has been amended in a number of particulars since its first introduction in order to provide . . . limitations on the time period for the filing of petitions . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>Nothing in the language of section 851.8(Z) or the aforementioned legislative history limits the two-year filing period to any one of the three classes of individuals entitled to relief under section 851.8. This suggests the Legislature intended the limitations period to apply to anyone entitled to petition for such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">In addition, when a statute is capable of more than one construction, or its provisions conflict, courts must attempt to harmonize and reconcile it in a manner which carries out the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>(Wells </em>v. <em>Marina City Properties, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 781, 788 [176 Cal.Rptr. 104, 632 P.2d 217].) Section 851.8(c) and (Z) are harmonized as follows:  Pursuant to section 851.8(c), persons such as appellant who have been arrested and have had an accusatory pleading filed against them, but no conviction resulted, who seek to have their arrest records sealed and destroyed, may not file their petition for relief <em>before </em>the dismissal of the action against them. Pursuant to section 851.8(Z), this petition may not be filed <em>more than </em>two years from the later of the date of the petitioner\u2019s arrest or the filing of the accusatory pleading, unless the petitioner establishes good cause for the delay, and the People are not prejudiced by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Moreover, this statutory interpretation is reasonable. Section 851.8(c) serves to prevent a petitioner from filing a section 851.8 petition for relief while the criminal action is pending. The two-year limitations period in section 851.8(Z) guards against the presentation of stale claims of factual innocence and encourages a swift conclusion to section 851.8 petitions. However, if good cause for the delay exists, and the prosecution is not prejudiced by it, the late filing is permitted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">For the first time on appeal, appellant asserts that a determination by this court that section 851.8(Z) limits the time for filing a petition under section 851.8(c) constitutes a new mle of law and should not be applied to him because he was not on notice that the section 851.8(Z) time limits applied to his case. Thus, he argues it would violate his right to due process to deny his petition on grounds of untimeliness. Appellant\u2019s failure to raise this constitutional objection below waives the issue on appeal. <em>(People v. Rudd </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 620, 628 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 807].) Moreover, long before appellant filed his petition, the <em>Bermudez </em>court recognized the interplay of sections 851.8(c) and 851.8(Z) as an issue and, in dicta, noted that the Legislature apparently intended section 851.8(Z) to apply to all section 851.8 petitions. (Bermudez, <em>supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at p. 1230, fn. 5.) Thus, even if appellant\u2019s argument were cognizable on appeal, we would conclude that principles of due process do not prohibit application of the time limits of section 851.8(Z) to his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>II. <em>The Trial Court Could Properly Conclude Appellant Did Not Establish Good Cause for the Delay in Filing His Section 851.8 Petition </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Needham, J., and Stevens, J.,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 20, 2009, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 8, 2009, S172665.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-11\"> All undesignated section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-12\"> The 2001 information charged appellant with the following offenses against M.C.: first degree burglary (\u00a7 459) (count 1); rape (\u00a7 261, subd.

Counts 2 through 6 alleged the acts occurred during a burglary (\u00a7 667.61, subds. (a), (d)(4)). Since timeliness of appellant\u2019s petition is the sole issue on appeal, we need not recite the facts underlying the 2001 charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-13\"> The November 2004 petition states, \u201cCopies to: Department of Justice [f] District Attorney [][] Petitioner,\u201d but the record contains no proof of service.
