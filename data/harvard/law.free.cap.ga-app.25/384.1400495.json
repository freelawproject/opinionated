January 6, 1920.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-5\">The Gulf Eefining Company was sued for damages on account of the killing of the father of the plaintiffs by a truck owned by A. M. Hopkins and driven by his employee, which was being used by Hopkins in the business of selling and delivering oils and gasoline furnished by the company, and in collecting empty barrels and other containers to be returned to it; the plaintiffs alleging that the truck was in such a defective and dangerous condition that to drive it on a public road was gross negligence, the steering apparatus being so worn and broken that the driver could not control the movements of the truck; and that the company was operating it through Hopkins, who was alleged to be an employee of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-6\">The question argued in the briefs in this court was whether the relation of Hopkins to the company, under a written contract between them and the other facts of the case, was such as to render the company liable for injury inflicted in the operation of his truck. On the part of the company it was contended that he was merely a consignee of its goods or an independent contractor, and not an employee or agent for whose operation of the truck the company could be held liable, and that the relation between them was governed entirely by the written contract. There was evidence that the company was a corporation of the State of Texas, and had at Dalton, Georgia, a plant, including a warehouse, where oils and other products sold by it were kept, and that Hopkins was- in charge of the plant and of the business .conducted there; that the company\u2019s name was painted on the truck, although it was his individual property, his purpose as stated by him being to let the public know that he was handling the company\u2019s products; that tax-returns of the company\u2019s property in the county were signed by him, and he was named as its agent in certain advertisements run by him and on one of the trucks used in delivering oil; and service of this suit was made on\u00bbhim as the company\u2019s agent. He testified that his relationship with the company and his powers to represent it were all stated in the contract referred to above, which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-7\">\"This memorandum of agreement made and entered into this second day of April, 1918, by and between the Gulf Eefining Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>pany, Atlanta, Ga., party of the first part, and A.
