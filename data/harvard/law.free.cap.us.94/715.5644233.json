She thereupon passed an ordinance levying a special tax of fifty-four cents \u201c on the \u00a7100 worth of property.\u201d Under the laws of the State, taxable real and personal property, other than merchants\u2019 capital, is embraced in one 'tax-list, and merchants\u2019 capital in another. A., finding .that such capital was not subjected to the special tax, although it was to that levied for all other purposes, and that the required sum would not be raised, moved for a further peremptory <em>mandamus, </em>requiring such capital, as it was assessed for other purposes in the year 1875, to be included in the property ,to be taxed for his benefit. Such <em>mandamus </em>was directed by judgment March 2, 1876. On the 20th of the following May, the city moved to set aside the latter judgment; but - the court refused to grant the motion, and re-entered, on that day, the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ment as the final judgment in the premises. Thereupon the city, within due time, sued out a writ of error, and gave the necessary bond. <em>Held, </em>I. That the court had the right to set aside the judgment of March 2, during the-term at which it was rendered, and to re-enter it as of the date when the motion to 6et it aside was made. 2. That the writ of error was properly sued out on the re-entered judgment, and is a <em>supersedeas.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-5\">On motion, 1. To dismiss a writ of error to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Tennessee. 2.

Under the laws of Tennessee, tax&amp;We personal and real property, other than merchants\u2019 capital, isembraced in one tax-list, and merchants\u2019 capital in another. In alarch, 1876, Brown discovered that the tax-collector, pursuant t\u00edsl an ordinance passed by the city Dec. 10, 1875, levying \u201c a special tax of fifty-four cents on the #100 worth of property,\u201d wa^ collecting the tax levied for his account on personal and real' property, but not on merchants\u2019 capital, although the city, for all other purposes, was collecting a tax on merchants\u2019 capital.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-8\">It appearing that the tax upon the personal and real property alone would not be sufficient to raise the required sum, a motion was made in the original suit by Brown for a further peremptory <em>mandamus, </em>requiring the city to include in the property to be taxed for his benefit the taxable merchants\u2019 capital, as returned and assessed for taxation for other purposes in the year 1875. This motion was granted March 2, 1876, and a judgment entered accordingly. Afterwards, during the same term, May 20, the city appeared and moved the court to set aside the order of March 2; .but this motion was refused, and that order re-entered as the final judgment of the court in the premises. A writ of error was sued out upon this last judgment, and a <em>supersedeas </em>perfected, by giving the required bond within sixty days thereafter.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>Mr. P. Phillips </em>and. <em>Mr. W. M. Mandolph </em>in support of the motions.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-5\">By art. 2, sect. 28, of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee, all property is taxable. No one species is to be taxed higher than another of equal value, and all taxation is to be equal and uniform throughout the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-6\">The judgment of March 30, 1875, requiring that the tax should be levied on all the taxable property of the city, was rendered in a direct proceeding, to which the city was a party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-7\">The subsequent orders were mere declarations of what that judgment contained, and to neither of them does error lie.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-8\">The only judgment which can be reviewed is that of March 30, 1875, which settled definitively the rights of the parties, and to which the city may now prosecute a writ of error. Her right to do so demonstrates that the present writ cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-9\">The <em>supersedeas </em>is only to the order of May 20, 1876. Neither the judgment of March 30, 1875, nor the order of March 2, 1876, is affected by the present proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-10\">It is very evident that, if either March 30,1875, or March 2, 1876, be adopted as the day on which the final determination was had, the <em>supersedeas </em>cannot be maintained, as more than sixty days from either date had elapsed before the filing of the writ and bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b737-11\"><em>Mr. W. Y. O. </em>Humes, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b737-12\">Me. Chief Justice Waite</author>\n<p id=\"AHm\">delivered the- opinion of the court. '</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">We think that the order made by the Circuit Court, May 20, 1876, upon the motion to subject merchants\u2019 capital to the tax was such a final judgment as may be brought here for reexamination by a writ of error. The precise question decided by that order had never before been presented in the cause. The city was then for the first time required, in express terms', to subject this particular class of property to the adjudged taxation. The writ was, therefore, properly sued out upon the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">Under the ruling in <em>Brockett </em>v. Brockett, 2 How. 241, the motion made during the term to set aside the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>March 2 suspended the operation of that judgment, so that it did not take final effect for the purposes of a writ of error until May 20, when the motion was disposed of. In addition to this, the form of the entry of May 20 is equivalent to setting aside the judgment of March 2, and entering it anew as of that date. This the court had the right to do during the term, and for the very purpose of giving it effect for a <em>supersedeas. Sage et al. </em>v. <em>Central Railroad Company of Iowa et </em>al., 98 U. S. 412. As the writ was issued on the day of the order, and its allowance embraced in the entry recording the order itself, there cannot be' any doubt of the intention of the court to give the judgment at that time such an effect. <em>Motions denied.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
