Upon arrival of bonds at the Commercial Bank, they received a letter from Newman <em>&amp; </em>Havens, stating that they had never dealt in like bonds, and they were selling them for strange parties, consequently sell them without recourse. The Commercial Bank tendered us the bonds under same condition; and we refused to purchase bonds in the manner presented, but gave the Commercial Bank a check under the following conditions, \u2014 not to charge the check against us until we had been informed by you that the bonds were O. K. We then forwai\u2019ded the bonds, and wrote you precise, that we had not ever handled any of the bonds, and we sell them without recourse, and particularly asked you to examine them, and more distinctly said, we sell without recourse as to genuineness, as they come from strange parties, and use this precaution, not willing to take any risk whatever. Upon receipt of the bonds, you telegraphed us, \u2018 Centrals all right,\u2019 and also wrote by mail, confirming your despatch, by saying, received bonds and draft, and found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>them all correct. \"When we received this information, we then informed the Commercial Bank to charge up check, which they did, and at the same time credited Newman <em>&amp; </em>Havens; and we are furthermore informed, the parties of whom Newman <em>&amp; </em>Havens purchased did not' call for the money within ten days after this information of bonds being correct. Now, you see plainly that you are all to blame. Had you used the necessary precaution in examining the bonds, specially when your attention was called by us selling without risk, not only would none of us have any trouble or unpleasantness, but would have caught the thieves and brought them to justice. Now, please inform us what else could we have done. It shows that we acted prudently and with care. It is true, you may say, you received the bonds before the letter; but even and more so should you have examined them, and informed us. You are aware that New York is the market to detect all irregularities in the bonds spoken of, and you could easily have discovered, had you not been careless. Now, you plainly see our position. The Commercial Bank will not take them back from us, unless they are compelled to do so ; and why should Donaldson <em>&amp; </em>Fraley suffer for negligence of yours, when they used all precautions and measures at the time ? It is true, it is hard for you to part with your money, but not more so than us, whilst we are in no manner to blame. Upon your information, confirming the genuineness of the bonds, we parted with the money received for the bonds. Should the Commercial Bank, or Newman <em>&amp; </em>Havens, at any time come forward and offer to redeem the bonds, we certainly would be most happy, and be much better satisfied than the way it is now.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">\u201c Regarding our writing, that we would aid you all we could, did not infer that if you made a demand upon us for the money that we would pay same, but meant, that if it was in our power to make parties originally selling them replace them, we would do so; and we are more so willing now than ever; but we cannot concede nor agree to give you any claim against the Commercial Bank, whether we have legal right or not. It would certainly be admitting, on our part, that if we assign claim against Commercial Bank, that you certainly have likewise claim against Donaldson &amp; Fraley, and also right to assign, which we really cannot admit, as we positively do not believe so. We are ready at any time to testify to the facts as they are, and were; and, should the law declare us wrong, we feel confident that Newman <em>&amp; </em>Havens and Commercial Bank will abide by same; but under no circumstances will they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>refund without action', as they firmly believe, as we do, that your claim is not just, under the circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">\u201c If you were right in your demands, tell us, in the name of the law, justice, or common custom, would we, or any dealer, receive from any stranger or honest party known to us, but not responsible, any securities to be sold on arrival in New York, and the funds to be credited upon sale and delivery in New York, and especially if sold under the conditions'we sold bonds to you ?

The letter of the defendants to the plaintiffs, dated May 25, 1871, was written contemporaneously with the telegrams of that date, and was intended to be, and in law should be, read as a part of the acceptance of plaintiffs\u2019 offer. It is clear from that letter, that, at the time of sending their telegram, \u2022 the defendants had no intention of selling the bonds, except without recourse as to genuineness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-6\">Should the court rule against this point, then it is insisted that the letter of May 25, and the delivery tendered under the terms thereof, together constituted a proposition to modify the terms of the contract entered into by telegraph; that plaintiffs had the right in law either to stand by the original contract and reject the proposed modification, or to accept it without new or additional consideration; that, having accepted the delivery tendered under the terms of that letter, they are in law to be regarded as having waived any other or different performance from that tendered, and to be now estopped from claiming that they did assent to the modification of the contract, or the performance tendered and received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-7\">Assuming that the telegram of plaintiffs\u2019offering 102\u00a3, and the telegram of defendants accepting that offer, constituted the contract, there can be no question but .that the delivery tendered under the letter of May 25 was in effect a refusal by defendants to fulfil that contract, unless plaintiffs would agree to modify it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-8\">After an agreement has been reduced to writing, it is competent for the parties at any time before breach of it, by a new contract not in writing, either to altogether waive, dissolve, or annul the former agreement, or in any manner to add to or subtract from, or vary, or qualify, the terms of it, and thus to make a new contract. <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Lord Nugent, </em>5 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Ad. 65; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Dole, </em>11 Vt. 549; <em>Medemak Bank </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>24 Me. 86.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-9\">And when before breach a new contract is substituted for a previous one, no consideration is necessary if the substituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>contract has become executed. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Dole, supra; Young </em>v.

K.). - Plaintiffs received this notification before the bonds, failed to make an examination, but telegraphed defendants, and also wrote them, \u201c Centrals O.

On the 25th of May Cashier Nichols received from Newman &amp; Havens the bonds, and also a letter, in which they said, \u201c The party selling these bonds is waiting here to get the money for them. He is an entire stranger to us.\u201d \u201cWe desire them sold without any recourse on us.\u201d On the same day Cashier Richols showed this letter to the defendants, and proposed to deliver the bonds without recourse. They refused to receive them on such terms, but offered to take them, and pay for them when ascertained to be good; otherwise, to return them. The cashier acceded to this proposition. On the 24th of May the defendants telegraphed to the plaintiffs, who were brokers in the city of New York, \u201c Make best bid for fifteen Central Pacifies, quick.\u201d The-plaintiffs answered, on the 25th of May, that they would\u201ebuy at 102|. Their despatch to this effect reached the defendants about ten A.M. the same day. The defendants answered by despatch on that day, \u201c lye accept your offer.\u201d The bonds were delivered by the cashier to the defendants on the 25th of May, and were by them forwarded by express on that day to a bank in New York, with a draft on the plaintiffs for $15,375, the bonds to be handed over on the payment of the draft. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the morning of that day the defendants addressed a letter to the plaintiffs, which is the hinge of this controversy. It is as follows: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">\u201c In accordance with your offer for 15 Central Pac. 1st mort. bonds, 102 we replied, We accept your offer, and have forwarded them by ex. to Bank North America, with draft attached for $15,375. We would further add, that we have purchased the bonds from a party strange to us; and, not having ever handled any of the Pacific Central, we would sell the bonds without recourse as to their being genuine; consequently, please examine them, and, upon being found correct, telegraph immediately (Central all O. K.). We do not doubt the bonds, but, coming to us through strange parties, we use this as a precaution, and not willing to take any risk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">This letter reached the plaintiffs on the 29th of May, a short time before the draft and bonds were presented. The plaintiffs had sold the bonds \u201c to arrive \u201d to Rasmus &amp; Lissignola. They could not be delivered after two o\u2019clock. It was within a few minutes of that time when the messenger of the bank presented himself. One of the plaintiffs went with the messenger to the office of their vendees, and requested Rasmus to examine the bonds. He did so, said they seemed to be correct, and thereupon gave a check for the amount his firm had agreed to pay for them. This check was duly paid. On the same day the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants, \u201c The Centrals all correct, and we telegraphed you to that effect.\u201d . Such a despatch had been sent. Upon receiving it, the defendants paid the bank for the bonds, and the money was remitted by the bank to Newman &amp; Havens. On the 12th of June information was received for the first time in New York, or elsewhere, that there were in existence counterfeits of such bonds. On that day the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants, \u201cLook out for counterfeit Central Pacifies; some appeared on market to-day.\u201d On the next day the plaintiffs telegraphed to the defendants, \u201c Central Pacifies sold us probably counterfeit. Bonds shipped to Europe. . Can\u2019t hear from them for several days.\u201d On the same day the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants to the same effect, and said further: \u201c In case your parties are doubtful, it would be well to act at once as if the bonds were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>not genuine. There has been no suspicion of counterfeits until yesterday.\u201d On the same day, June 13, the defendants replied by despatch: \u201cWe sold without risk. Have purchased same .day from Commercial Bank, and they from Newman &amp; Haven\u00ed, of Leavenworth, without risk.\u201d The bonds were counterfeit, and the plaintiffs refunded to Rasmus &amp; Lissignola the amount they had paid. On the 12th of July the plaintiffs telegraphed to the defendants, \u201c The Central Pacifies bought of you in May are declared counterfeit. We shall look to you for indemnity.\u201d On the same day the defendants replied by telegraph, and asked upon what ground it was proposed to hold them liable.' Some -subsequent correspondence took place between the parties, which it is unnecessary to refer to in detail. The plaintiffs asked a transfer of the claim of the defendants, whatever it might be, but without guarantee, against the bank. This the defendants refused to give. The money paid to Newman &amp; Havens by the bank was not called for by the party from whom they received, the bonds for two or three weeks after the money was paid to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Before examining the case in its strictly legal aspects, it is proper to make several remarks suggested by the facts as found.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">1. The defendants sold the bonds absolutely by their despatch of the 25th of May. The qualification insisted upon was, by their letter of that date, received by the plaintiffs on the 29th. If the defendants intended to qualify, it should have been done in the despatch. This would have given the plaintiffs notice in time for reflection before the presentation of the draft, might have prevented their selling the bonds before the letter was received, and would have enabled them to avoid the hurry and confusion incident to the payment of the draft and the delivery of the bonds to their vendees. If the draft had not been \u2018 paid at sight, it would doubtless have been protested.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">2. The circumstances attending the purchase of the bonds by the defendants are shown in our analysis of the facts of the case. The statement in the letter upon the subject is not accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">3. They refused upon any terms to put the plaintiffs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>their place with respect to any claims they might have against the Commercial Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">4. They were notified on the 12th of June that the bonds were counterfeit; If they had thereupon at once caused Newman &amp; Havens to be advised also, it is not improbable that the latter would have retained the funds, and thus have saved from loss all the honest parties through whose hands the bonds had passed. The defendants failed to take any step whatever in this direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It cannot be questioned that the despatches \u2018between the parties on the 25th of May constituted a complete contract of sale, upon the condition or with an implied warranty, which it is not material here to consider, that the bonds were genuine. Nor can it be doubted that, if the bonds had been delivered without any thing further occurring, the defendants, upon the bonds proving to be counterfeit, would have been liable in this action. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Merchants' F. Ins. Co., </em>9 How. 390; Benjamin on Sales, 56; <em>Flyn </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>57 Penn. St. 482; <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Odell et al., </em>49 N. Y. 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\"Was this contract changed so that this condition or warranty was waived by the plaintiffs ? In other words, did the letter of the defendants propose the modification insisted upon, of the pre-existing contract, and if so, did the plaintiffs agree to it, and accept the delivery of the bonds accordingly ?</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">We pass by without remark the plaintiffs\u2019 propositions that the alleged modification was within the Statute of Frauds, and could not, therefore, be effectually accepted otherwise than in writing; that there was no consideration for such an agreement ; and that, if made, it was contrary to public policy, and therefore void. The view which we take of the case renders it unnecessary to consider either of these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The first sentence of the letter relied upon by the defendants recognizes distinctly the contract, as made by the despatches. The defendants say: \u201c In accordance with your offer for 15 Central Pac. first mort. bonds, 102-]- we replied, We accept your offer, and have forwarded them by ex. to Bk. North America, with draft attached for $15,375.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">This, standing alone, would have been a mere carrying out of the contract as made, and as it must have been understood by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>both parties. The stress of the case is upon what follows. The letter proceeds: \u201c We would further add, that we have purchased the bonds from a party strange to us.\u201d They had in fact bought them from the Commercial Bank, but were not to take them unless genuine, and were not to pay for them until found to be so. Next: \u201c And not having ever handled any of the Pacific Central, we would sell the bonds without recourse as to their being genuine; consequently, please examine them, and, upon being found correct, telegraph immediately (Central O. K.).\u201d The phrase, \u201cwe would sell without recourse,\u201d considered in the light of the context and the circumstances, may well be interpreted to mean that the writers would prefer or like so to sell, if it could be done. This view derives support from the succeeding member of the sentence, \u201c please examine,\u201d &amp;c. Examine for whom ? It is not said, examine for yourselves. The language employed is usual where the thing asked is for the benefit of the asker, but not where it is for the benefit of the party addressed. Lastly, it is said: \u201cWe do not doubt the bonds, but, coming through strange hands, we use this precaution, and are not willing to take risk.\u201d This is consistent with the construction we have given to the preceding clause. If the examination the plaintiffs were requested to make showed clearly that the bonds were not counterfeit, then there could be no risk, whether the sale was with or without warranty of genuineness. In connection with these views, it is to be observed that while the bonds and draft were sent on pursuant to the original contract, which is distinctly recognized, it is not said in the letter in plain terms, such as would naturally have been used if such had been the intent of the writers. We will sell only at your risk as to genuineness. We will not guarantee it: examine for yourselves. If the bonds are counterfeit, and you take them, the loss will fall upon you, and not upon us. If this language, or terms equally clear and explicit, had been used, the case would have presented a very different aspect. \u201c Every intendment is to be made against the construction of a contract under which it would operate as a. snare.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>\u00c6tna Ins. Co., </em>82 N. Y. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\">Upon the whole letter, considering what it does and what it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>does not contain, we are unable to come to the conclusion that the defendants intended to require that the modification since insisted upon should be made, and to make such modification the condition upon which the plaintiffs should take the bonds, if they took them at all. This result leaves the rights of the parties as they were under the original contract, and entitles the plaintiffs to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">But conceding for the purposes of this opinion that the letter did contain such a proposition or annunciation as is insisted upon, then the inquiry arises whether it was so understood and agreed to by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">There can be no contract without the mutual assent of the parties. This is vital to its existence. There can be none where it is wanting. It is as indispensable to the modification of a contract already made as it was to making it originally. Where there is a misunderstanding as to any thing material, the requisite mutuality of assent as to such thing is wanting; consequently the supposed contract does not exist, and neither party is bound. In the view of the law in such case, there has been only a negotiation, resulting in a failure to agree. What has occurred is as if it were not, and the righxs of the parties are to be determined accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">In <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Bistotti, </em>2 B. &amp; C. 511, the defendant was a foreigner, and understood the English language imperfectly. Certain jewelry was struck off to him at auction for eighty-eight guineas. He was sued for that amount, and set up as a defence that he thought he had bid forty-eight guineas. Abbot, C. J., left it to the jury to find whether the mistake had actually occurred, \u201c as a test of the existence of the contract.\u201d Benj. on Sales, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In <em>Baldwin et al. </em>v. <em>Middleburger, </em>2 Hall, 176, the defendant bought merchandise of the plaintiff, and it was agreed that it should be paid for by the note of a third person payable to the defendant, to be by him indorsed to the plaintiff. After the goods were delivered the note was tendered, indorsed without recourse. The plaintiff refused to receive it, insisting that the agreement was that the note should be. indorsed without this qualification, and thereupon brought the suit.. The court left it to the jury to find whether there was a misunderstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>between tbe parties as to the manner of the indorsement. The jury so found; and it was held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover as if there had been nothing said about the note, there being no such assent of the two minds as was necessary to make a contract in relation to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In <em>Coles </em>v. Browne, 10 Paige, 526, a block of lots was struck off at auction to the defendant. The plaintiff insisted and proved that the sale was of the lots separately. The defendant insisted' that his bid was for the entire block as one parcel, and that he so understood the premises to be offered and sold. The vendor instituted the suit for specific performance. The evidence rendered it doubtful whether the defendant\u2019s\u2019 allegations as to his understanding and bid were not true, and upon that ground the Chancellor dismissed the bill. If there was a misunderstanding on the subject between the parties, there was clearly no contract. See also <em>Calverly </em>v. Williams, 1 Ves. Jr. 210; <em>Saltus </em>v. Pryn, 18 How. (N. Y.) Pr. 512; <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>3 Johns. (N. Y.) 84; <em>Crane </em>v. Portland, 9 Mich. 493; 2 Pars. Contr. (4th ed.) 475 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">It is essential to the validity of a contract that the parties should have consented to the same subject-matter in the same \u2022sense. They must have contracted <em>ad idem. Hazzard </em>v. <em>N. E. M. Ins. Co., </em>1 Sumn. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u201c Where a written agreement exists, and one of the parties sets up an arrangement of a different nature, alleging conduct on the other side amounting to a substitution of this arrangement for the written agreement, he must clearly show, not merely his own understanding as to the new terms of arrangement, but that the other party had the same understanding.\u201d Da<em>rnley </em>v. <em>The Proprietors, \u00a7c., </em>2 Law Rep. H. L. 43, 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The plaintiffs were not asked to assent expressly with respect to the waiver of the warranty, if it were demanded, and made no such answer. They were asked to \u201c please examine,\u201d &amp;c., and to telegraph the result. This they did. The despatch was wholly silent as to any thing else. That they understood the waiver was demanded as a <em>sine qua non </em>in no way app\u00e9ars. On the other hand, the contrary.is clearly manifest. The moment they had reason to apprehend that-the bonds might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>counterfeit, they notified the defendants; and, as soon as it became certain they were so, the defendants were advised of the fact^ and that they would be looked to for indemnity. The defendants denied their liability by reason o'f their letter. . In due time this suit was brought. Conceding that both. parties have acted in good faith, it is clear that there was a misunderstanding between them as to the meaning and effect of the letter, and that the plaintiffs never understood and agreed to it as it is now interpreted and insisted upon by'the defendants. The <em>aggregatid mentium </em>requisite to give that interpretation effect was, therefore, wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">To constitute the abandonment of a contract, the act must be mutual. <em>Robinson </em>v. Page, 3 Russ. 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">It has been held that, to make a negotiation for the modification of a contract effectual, it must appear that it was the intention of the party proposing it wholly to abandon the original contract, if the modification proposed were not assented to. <em>Murray </em>v. Harway, 56 N. Y. 347; <em>Robinson </em>v. Page, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u201cA waiver.of a stipulation in an agreement, to be effectual, must be made intentionally, and with knowledge of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Darnley </em>v. <em>The </em>Proprietors, <em>&amp;c., supra; Howard et al. </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>2 Md. 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">When one party assents to a contract, relying upon the representations of the other, his assent is given upon the condition that the representations are true. <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Hoge, </em>24 Miss. 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\"><em>Judgment </em>reversed, <em>with directions to the court below to render a judgment for the plaintiff in error.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b69-10\">Me. Justice Strong,</author>\n<p id=\"ABc\">with whom concurred Me. Justice Clifford and Me. Justice Hunt, diss\u00e9nting.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">I dissent from the judgment given in this case. Before the plaintiffs received the bonds, and before they accepted or paid the draft drawn upon them by the defendants, they were notified that the defendants would sell without recourse, and that they were unwilling to run any risk. They were requested to examine, and telegraph to the defendants whether the bonds were genuine, and this as a precaution of the defendants against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>risk. The letter of the defendants clearly manifested an intention not to deliver the bonds unless they were genuine, or unless the plaintiffs would take them at their own risk. On any other terms the plaintiffs had a right to take them. Inquiry and notice to defendants afterwards would have been idle, and would have been no precaution. Consequently the receipt of the bonds by the plaintiffs, after the notice given to them, can have no other meaning than that they took them at their own risk.</p>\n<judges id=\"b70-5\">Mr. Justice Davis did not sit in this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
