Brown, having a decree in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Tennessee against the city of Memphis, made\u2019 application on the law side of .that court .for a <em>mandamus </em>requiring the- city and its mayor and general council to levy and collect a tax for the payment of the amount due him. In this application the name of the person then holding the office of mayor was given, and also the names of the persons who constituted the general council. An alternative writ was issued; and the parties named all appeared by the city attorney, and showed cause against the application. March 30,1875, a final judgment was entered in the cause, \u201c by which it was ordered and adjudged that a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>should issue, commanding the city of Memphis and its said general council to proceed each year, for the then ensuing three years, 1875,1876, and 1877, to levy a tax, in addition to all other taxes allowed by law to be levied; sufficient in amount to realize $125,000 each year for the years 1875 and 1876, and for the year 1877 to realize a sum sufficient to pay whatever sum might then remain unpaid of the said, decree. It was further ordered that the clerk of said court, whenever the said Brown should request the same, should issue each .year, during the years 1875, 1876, and 1877, respectively, a peremptory writ of mandamus, in accordance with said judgment, to be served on the city of' Memphis and its mayor and general council, in the manner prescribed by law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-10\">Flippin became mayor of the city, and the other petitioners members of the general council, Jan. 15, 1876. The clerk of the court, at the request of Brown, issued, May 24, a peremptory writ, returnable the fourth Monday in November, directed to the city and to the petitioners by name, as mayor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>and members of tbe general council, requiring tbem to levy tbe adjudged tax for the year 1876. Nov. 27, 1876, tbe petitioners moved tbe court \u201c to set aside and quasb \u201d tbis writ, for tbe reason, in substance, tbat tbey were not parties to tbe judgment upon wbicb it was issued. Tbis motion was denied Dec. 14, 1876 ; and tbe court, by proceeding against tbe petitioners for contempt in fading to obey tbe writ, is now endeavoring to compel tbem to perform the duties wbicb tbe judgment enjoined upon the city and its mayor and general council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\">Pending these proceedings, tbis application is made here for a <em>mandamus </em>requiring the judge of tbe Circuit Court to quash tbe writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-6\"><em>Mr. W. Y. C. Sumes </em>and <em>Mr. S. P. Walker </em>for tbe relators.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-7\">Tbe proceeding by <em>mandamus </em>in tbis court is the proper and only remedy of tbe relators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-8\">An order of the Circuit Court, quashing or refusing to quash a writ, cannot be reviewed on a writ of error. <em>Mountz </em>v. <em>Hodgson, </em>4 Cranch, <em>324; Boyle </em>v. Zacharie, 6 Pet. 648; <em>Toland </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>12 id. 300; <em>McCargo </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>20 How. 556.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-9\">In tbe latter case, tbis court declared tbat if an execution should be issued, not authorized by the judgment, and tbe court below should refuse to quasb it, a <em>mandamus </em>would seem to be tbe proper remedy. \u201c It is a writ wbicb may be issued to inferior courts and magistrates, to require tbem to execute tbat justice wbicb tbe party is entitled to, and which by law tbey are enjoined to do, and where there is no other remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-10\">Ordinarily, tbis court will not do more than compel tbe Circuit Court to act, and render some judgment, in a case of which it has improperly refused to take jurisdiction. <em>Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Wiswall, </em>23 Wall. 507; <em>Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>16 id. 270.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-11\">While a <em>mandamus </em>will not lie to control the judicial discretion of tbe Circuit Court, by dictating what judgment it shall render, it is tbe appropriate means of preventing tbe execution of a writ sued out by order of an inferior court against persons not parties to tbe proceeding.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-12\">\n<em>Mr. William M. Randolph, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-13\">Tbe order of tbe Circuit Court, refusing to quasb a writ in execution of a judgment or a decree which is final, is not subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>to revision or reversal by <em>mandamus </em>by any other court. <em>Ex parte. </em>Newman, 14 Wall. 152; <em>Ex parte De Groot, </em>6 id. 497; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Addison, </em>22 How. 174.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-5\">The discretion of the court below was invoked and exercised!, and no other court has authority to supervise its action. High on Extraordinary Legal Remedies, sects. 156, 176, and the cases cited: <em>Wylie </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>14 How. 1; <em>Connor </em>v. <em>Peugh, </em>18 id. 394; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>20 id. <em>448; The Secretary </em>v. <em>McGrarrahan, </em>9 Wall. 298; <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>The Register and Receiver, </em>id. 575.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b370-6\">Me. Chief Justice Waite</author>\n<p id=\"AWD\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The writ of which the petitioners complained was one of execution to carry into effect the judgment in the original suit for the <em>mandamus. </em>\u201c The jurisdiction of a court is. not exhausted by the rendition of its judgment, but continues until the judgment is satisfied.\u201d <em>Wayman </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>10 Wheat. 23. \u201c Process subsequent to judgment is as essential to jurisdiction as process anterior to judgment, else the judicial power would be incomplete and entirely inadequate to the purposes for which it was conferred by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Riggs </em>v. <em>Johnson County, </em>6 Wall. 187. But if the court has jurisdiction to issue process, it has necessarily jurisdiction to decide as to its appropriate form. Here the process has been issued; and the court, upon motion, has decided that it was good in form, and ought not to be quashed. Of this decision the petitioners complain, and seek to have it reversed. This we cannot do by <em>mandamus. </em>Under that form of proceeding we may compel an inferior court to decide upon a matter within its jurisdiction and pending before it for judicial determination, but we cannot control its decision. Neither can we in that way compel the inferior court to reverse, a decision which it has made in the exercise of its legitimate jurisdiction. That is the office of a writ of' error or an appeal, in cases to which such proceeding applies, but not of a writ of <em>mandamus. </em>If there is any thing in the case of <em>McCargo </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>20 How. 555, to the contrary of this, it is disapproved. <em>Petition denied.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
