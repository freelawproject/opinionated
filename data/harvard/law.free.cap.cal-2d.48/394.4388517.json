Martens . . . Seventy Dollars . . . and an automobile . . .\u201d Jury trial was waived. After trial, the court found defendant guilty of \u201cViolation of 503 Vehicle Code, a felony, a lesser but necessarily included offense, \u2019 \u2019 and sentenced defendant to serve nine months in the county jail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Defendant noticed an appeal \u201cfrom the verdict and judgment of conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant contends that the offense of violation of section 503 of the Vehicle Code is not an offense necessarily included within the charge of robbery and that therefore his conviction cannot be upheld. We have concluded, for reasons hereinafter developed, that the trial court was correct in its express determination that violation of section 503 is \u201ca lesser offense than that [specifically] charged in the information but necessarily included therein, \u2019 \u2019 and that therefore the conviction of violation of section 503 can be upheld even though violation of that statute does not come within the statutory definition of the crime of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Section 211 of the Penal Code defines robbery as \u201cthe felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d Section 1159 of the same code provides that the defendant may be found \u201cguilty of any offense, the commission of which is necessarily included in that with which he is charged. \u2019 \u2019 Section 503 of the Vehicle Code defines the offense of which this defendant was convicted as follows: \u201cAny person who drives or takes a vehicle not his own, without the consent of the owner thereof, and with intent to either permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his title to or possession of such vehicle, whether with or without intent to steal the same, ... is guilty of a felony ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Defendant and amicus curiae urge that (quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Kerrick </em>(1904), 144 Cal. 46, 47 [77 P. 711], and <em>People </em>v. <em>McGrath </em>(1928), 94 Cal.App. 520, 522 [271 P. 549]) \u201cto be \u2018necessarily included\u2019 in the offense charged [within the meaning of section 1159 of the Penal Code, <em>ante], </em>the lesser offense must not only be part of the greater in fact, but <em>it must he embraced ivithin the legal definition </em>of the greater as a part thereof.\u201d (Italics added.) The \u201clegal definition\u201d of the greater offense, according to defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>amicus curiae, is the statutory definition rather than the description of the crime specifically alleged in a particular accusatory pleading. But neither the Kerrick case nor the McGrath case discusses or implicitly decides the question whether the \u201clegal definition\" must be the statutory definition as opposed to the definition specifically selected and pleaded by the prosecutor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We note also <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitlow </em>(1952), 113 Cal.App.2d 804, 806 [249 P.2d 35], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Krupa </em>(1944), 64 Cal.App.2d 592, 598 [149 P.2d 416].  These last cited cases correctly hold that \u201cIf, in the commission of acts denounced by one statute, the offender must always violate another, the one offense is necessarily included in the other\"; they do not consider whether the statutory definition is the exclusive measure of included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The People argue that from analysis of such cases as <em>In re Hess </em>(1955), 45 Cal.2d 171, 174 [288 P.2d 5], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Greer </em>(1947), 30 Cal.2d 589, 597 [184 P.2d 512], it appears that a lesser offense is \u201cnecessarily included\" if it is within the offense specifically charged in the accusatory pleading, even though its elements are not necessarily within those of the statutory definition of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The question argued by the parties and amicus curiae is directly presented by the record in this case and the statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>applicable to such record.  The offense of robbery as defined by section 211 of the Penal Code does not include all the elements of violation of section 503 of the Vehicle Code. The property taken in robbery may be any kind of personal property, whereas only the taking of \u201ca vehicle\u201d is denounced by section 503 of the Vehicle Code.  A person charged simply with robbery \u201cin the words of the statute describing the offense\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would not be charged with and could not be properly convicted of the offense defined by section 503 because the accusatory pleading would not inform the defendant that he must be prepared, at the trial, to contravene evidence that he took a particular kind of personal property, a vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Hess </em>(1955), <em>supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 171, 174-175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Although the statutory definition of robbery does not necessarily include the offense denounced by section 503 of the Vehicle Code, e the particular robbery specifically pleaded in the information here includes all the elements of a violation of section 503. It is particularly alleg\u00e9d that the property taken was \u201can automobile. \u201d  The allegations of the information that the automobile was taken by robbery neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>sarily import the elements of theft, including the taking of the personal property of one other than defendant, with intent to steal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rosen </em>(1938), 11 Cal.2d 147, 149 [78 P.2d 727, 116 A.L.R. 991] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ammerman </em>(1897), 118 Cal. 23, 25-26 [50 P. 15] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sheasbey </em>(1927), 82 Cal.App. 459, 463 [255 P. 836] ; see Fricke (1951), California Criminal Law, p. 238). These elements of theft include the following elements of the offense denounced by section 503 of the Vehicle Code: The property (vehicle) taken or driven must be \u201cnot his [defendant\u2019s] own,\u201d and it must be taken \u201cwithout the consent of the owner thereof, and with intent to either permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of his title to or possession of such vehicle, whether with or without intent to steal the same. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The eases of <em>People </em>v. <em>Kehoe </em>(1949), 33 Cal.2d 711, 713-715 [204 P.2d 321], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Crawford </em>(1953), 115 Cal.App.2d 838, 841 [252 P.2d 963], tend to support the view that the theft of an automobile (which is included in the offense of robbery by the taking of an automobile) includes the lesser offense denounced by section 503 of the Vehicle Code, although neither of those cases concerns the aspect of the problem of included offenses which is now before us. The Kehoe case disapproves the view, previously taken by some District Courts of Appeal, to the effect that violation of section 503 is entirely different from the crime of theft of an automobile. The Crawford case (p. 841 of 115 Cal.App.2d) says that \u201cThe charge, being grand theft committed in the stealing of an automobile, included the offense of violation of section 503 of the Vehicle Code.\u201d Insofar as <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neal </em>(1934), 2 Cal.App.2d 551, 561 [38 P.2d 430], is inconsistent with the statement last quoted from the Crawford case and with our conclusion that the intent to temporarily deprive the owner of the use of a vehicle is an element included in the intent to steal the vehicle, the O \u2019Neal case is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearson </em>(1940), 41 Cal.App.2d 614, 618 [107 P.2d 463], it is said that \u201cThe crime of violating section 503 of the Vehicle Code is not included in the crime of robbery . . ., the elements to be proved being different in each offense. \u2019 \u2019 But this statement was made in the light of the statute as it was then worded and, of course, in respect to the problem then before the court. At that time section 503 (Stats. 1939, ch. 228, p. 1481) provided that it was violated only when the vehicle was taken .or driven \u201cin the absence of the owner.\u201d This provision made the section necessarily incompatible with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>robbery in those cases where the person robbed was the owner of the property taken, for an element of robbery is that the property be taken \u201cfrom his person or immediate presence\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211). The Pearson case is not authority for interpretation of present section 503 of the Vehicle Code. The \u201cabsence of the owner\u201d as an element of the offense denounced by section 503 has been deleted (Stats. 1947, eh. 813, p. 1926). Therefore, violation of that section is no longer incompatible with robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">It appears that the precise controversy here presented\u2014 whether the yardstick for measuring offenses \u201cnecessarily included\u201d in a charge within the meaning of section 1159 of the Penal Code is the specific language of the accusatory pleading or whether such yardstick is the language of the statute defining the offense charged\u2014has not been expressly decided by an appellate court of this state. The view urged by the People, however, has been expressly or impliedly accepted by some of the reported decisions (hereinafter cited) without discussion of the possible alternative of using statutory language as the exclusive measure of included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The Hess case (1955), <em>supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 171, and the Greer case (1947), <em>supra, </em>30 Cal.2d 589, upon which the People rely, concern the question whether a charge of rape includes a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 702). The statutory and case law concerning what crimes are \u201cincluded\u201d in a charge of rape, as shown by the following' summary, tends to support the position of the People in the present case, although such law furnishes no authority directly in point:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Rape, according to its statutory definition (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261), is \u201can act of sexual intercourse, accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator, under either of the following circumstances: 1. Where the female is under the age of eighteen years\u201d; 2. Where she is mentally incapable of consent; 3. Where her resistance is overcome by force; 4. Where she is prevented from resisting by threats of great and immediate bodily harm, or by drugs; 5. Where she is unconscious of the nature of the act and this is known to defendant; 6. Where she submits under the belief, intentionally induced by defendant\u2019s \u201cartifice, pretense, or concealment,\u201d that the person committing the act is her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Where a single act of intercourse is committed in such circumstances that more than one subdivision of section 261 is violated, there is but one offense of rape, \u201cfor the proof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>though dual in character, necessarily crystallizes into one \u2018included\u2019 or identical offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Craig </em>(1941), 17 Cal.2d 453, 457 [110 P.2d 403].) Confirming the view that the six subdivisions of section 261 of the Penal Code do not proscribe six distinct offenses, but rather that they describe six different ways in which the one crime of rape can be committed, are cases which hold that where a defendant is charged with rape under the specific circumstances of one subdivision of section 261, he can be convicted upon a showing that he violated some other subdivision. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vann </em>(1900), 129 Cal. 118,121 [61 P. 776]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(1888), 75 Cal. 323, 324-325 [17 P. 208]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tollack </em>(1951), 105 Cal.App.2d 169, 172 [233 P.2d 121] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Blankenship </em>(1951), 103 Cal.App.2d 60, 66 [228 P.2d 835]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cassandras </em>(1948), 83 Cal.App.2d 272, 276 [188 P.2d 546] ; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jailles </em>(1905), 146 Cal. 301, 304 [79 P. 965].)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We do not undertake in this opinion to consider whether the holdings of cases such as those last cited (that a defendant can be convicted of one kind of rape when he is specifically charged with another) have been affected in respect to the essentials of pleading as related to the requirements of due process<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by the decisions in Greer (1947), <em>supra, </em>30 Cal.2d 589, and Hess (1955), <em>supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 171. However, the eases which consider the question of <em>lesser </em>offenses included within a charge of rape, unlike the cases cited in the preceding paragraph, take the view that the specifically charged violation of a particular subdivision of section 261, rather than the statutory definition stated in the section as a whole, is controlling. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Creer </em>(1947), <em>supra, </em>30 Cal.2d 589, defendant was charged in two counts with, violation of two sections of the Penal Code, section 261 (rape) and section 288 (lewd and lascivious conduct) . It was specifically alleged that these two offenses were committed against the same girl, aged 13 years, on the same day. It is held (pp. 595-598 of 30 Cal.2d) that the trial court erred in refusing to permit defendant to prove, in support of his plea of former jeopardy, that he had been previously convicted of contributing to the delinquency of this same child (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 702) by acts committed at the time he allegedly committed statutory rape and lewd conduct against her. The court specifically concluded that (pp. 597-598 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>30 Cal.2d) \u201cSince every violation of sections 261(1) and 288 is also a violation of section 702, the offense defined in the latter is an offense necessarily included in the offenses defined in sections 261(1) and 288.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The significance of the Greer decision here is that, for the purpose of determining what lesser offenses were included within the rape there charged, this court looked to the specific allegations of the pleading, not merely to the general statutory definition of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In the ease of <em>In re Hess </em>(1955), supra, 45 Cal.2d 171, 175, it is held that the offense of contributing to the delinquency of a minor is not included within a specific charge of forcible rape, because the charge of forcible rape does not inform the accused that he should be prepared to meet evidence that he did an act which would tend \u201cto cause or encourage any person under the age of 21 years\u201d to become delinquent (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 702). In Hess, therefore, as in Greer, this court considered, as the yardstick for measuring the offenses included within the rape charged, the specific allegations of the accusatory pleading rather than the general code definition of rape as a crime which can be committed in various ways. In accord is <em>People </em>v. <em>Chester </em>(1956), 138 Cal.App.2d 829, 830 [292 P.2d 573].</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">It is not unusual for a prosecutor to charge in one count the elements of two kinds of aggravated assault defined by two separate sections of the Penal Code, assault with intent to commit murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 217) and assault with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7245). In this situation, the appellate courts have expressly recognized that the yardstick for determining \u201cincluded\u201d offenses is the language of the accusatory pleading. <em>(People v. Gordon </em>(1893), 99 Cal. 227, 229 [33 P. 901] [an earlier opinion in this case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1891), 88 Cal. 422 [26 P. 502], shows that the defendant was specifically charged with an assault with a deadly weapon with intent to commit murder] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lightner </em>(1874), 49 Cal. 226, 228; <em>People </em>v. <em>Casserio </em>(1936), 16 Cal.App.2d 223, 226 [60 P.2d 505] ; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Arnett </em>(1899), 126 Cal. 680, 681 [59 P. 204].) If a defendant were charged in statutory language with assault \u201cwith intent to commit murder\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 217) and, separately, with assault \u201cwith a deadly weapon\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245), the essential legal elements of neither offense charged would be \u201cnecessarily included\u201d in the elements of the other (although both offenses charged might in fact be committed by the same act and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>hence, be subject to the provisions of section 654 of the Penal Code<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>); therefore, the term \u201cincluded offense,\u201d as used in the foregoing cases which determine that assault with intent to commit murder or assault with a deadly weapon is \u201cincluded\u201d in a charge of assault \u201cwith a deadly weapon \u2018with intent to commit murder\u201d must refer to offenses included in the language of the pleading, not to offenses necessarily included in the language of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The yardstick of the specific allegations of the accusatory pleading is suggested also in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(1942), 55 Cal.App.2d 625, 628-629 [131 P.2d 622] [lesser offense of battery, even though it is not included in the code definition of attempted rape as such definition is interpreted by case law, may be \u201cnecessarily included\u201d in a charge of attempted rape which specifically alleges the commission of the attempt \u201cby force and violence\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Another type of decision <em>(People </em>v. <em>Eppinger </em>(1894), 105 Cal. 36, 38-39 [38 P. 538] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1954), 127 Cal.App.2d 777, 780-782 [274 P.2d 509]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Papayanis </em>(1951), 101 Cal.App.2d Supp. 918, 926 [226 P.2d 91] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Adair </em>(1934), 3 Cal.App.2d 323, 325 [39 P.2d 274] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanich </em>(1928), 94 Cal.App. 738, 741 [271 P. 920] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morley </em>(1903), 8 Cal.App. 372, 374 [97 P. 84]) tends to support the theoretical basis of the People\u2019s position that the specific allegations of the accusatory pleading, rather than the statutory definitions of offenses charged, constitute the measuring unit for determining what offenses are included in a charge. In the cases last cited, conviction of an offense pleaded by specific allegations is upheld, even though the pleading designates the offense by an incorrect name of citation of statute, on the theory that the specific allegations give the accused sufficient notice. The cases decided before and those decided since the 1927 \u201cliberalization\u201d of the rules of pleading in favor of the state <em>{ante, </em>footnote 5, p. 399), make no differentiation as to theory.  It may also be noted that it is the offense specifically charged rather than the name applied to it which identifies and delimits the judgment imposed on conviction of the charge. <em>(In re Bramble </em>(1947), 31 Cal.2d 43, 46-47 [187 P.2d 411].)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Some opinions which deal with the question whether an offense is \u201cnecessarily included\u201d do not disclose whether their determination in that regard is based upon the elements specifically alleged in the accusatory pleading or upon the statutorily defined elements of the crime or, perhaps, upon some other factor. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1899), 125 Cal. 342, 344 [57 P. 1071]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bentley </em>(1888), 75 Cal. 407, 410 [17 P. 436] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crawford </em>(1953), <em>supra, </em>115 Cal.App.2d 838, 841.) Some cases suggest mistaken views that an offense may be \u201cnecessarily included\u201d in another offense because it would be within the charge if the charge were stated in accord with common law rules of pleading <em>(People </em>v. <em>De Foor </em>(1893), 100 Cal. 150, 153-154 [34 P. 642]) or because the two offenses have a \u201ccommon root\u201d or \u201ccommon basis\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gossman </em>(1949), 95 Cal.App.2d 293, 295, 296 [212 P.2d 585] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Babb </em>(1951), 103 Cal. App. 2d 326, 330 [229 P.2d 843]) or because the evidence proves a \u201clesser\u201d offense which insofar as the opinion discloses may or may not have been charged <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duncan </em>(1945), 72 Cal.App.2d 423, 426 [164 P.2d 510]).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Since the decisions as to included offenses, so far as they relate to choice of a standard to measure what offenses are \u201cnecessarily included\u201d within the meaning of section 1159 of the Penal Code, have not expressly considered or decided the question of selection as between the language of the accusatory pleading and the statutory definition, we base our choice of the specific language of the accusatory pleading upon considerations of fairness to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The present situation well illustrates the fairness to both the defendant and the People of using the specific accusatory pleading as a yardstick. Because the information charged defendant with taking \u201can automobile,\u201d he was put on notice that he should be prepared to defend against a showing that he took that particular kind of personal property. Because the information charged that the automobile was taken by robbery, defendant was put on notice that he should be prepared to defend against evidence showing the elements of that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">At the trial the prosecutor was able to produce ample evidence that the automobile was taken without the victim\u2019s consent, but the evidence concerning the precise circumstances of its taking was somewhat uncertain. It appears that the prosecutor in the diligent and enlightened performance of his trust anticipated that the evidence at the trial might develop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>in this fashion, and that he was well advised to draw the information in the manner in which it is worded.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Had the trial been by jury, both parties could and should have been prepared to request instructions concerning the lesser offense of violating section 503 of the Vehicle Code, because violation of that section, even though it was not included in the statutory definition of robbery, was, by the language of the information, a specifically pleaded but not separately stated lesser offense. Such instructions would be given if the evidence were such (as it was here) that the instructions would be applicable (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmen </em>(1951), 36 Cal.2d 768, 772-774 [1-6] [228 P.2d 281]); they would be refused if there were no evidence of the lesser offense (see <em>People </em>v. <em>McCoy </em>(1944), 25 Cal.2d 177, 187 [8a] [153 P.2d 315]).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Amicus curiae argues that, although in this particular case defendant would benefit by our declaring a rule that the language \u201coffense . . . with which he is charged,\u201d as used in section 1159 of the Penal Code, relates exclusively to and is limited by the basic statutory definition of robbery, and cannot be otherwise related to the crime as actually charged in the information, it would usually be unfair to the prosecutor to assume that by a pleading such as the present one (which is entitled \u201cRobbery (See. 211 P. C.) \u201d) the prosecutor intended to charge any offense other than robbery as defined by statute and the offenses necessarily included in the basic statutory definition of robbery. Rather, it appears, fairness to the prosecutor requires that we recognize that he may wisely anticipate the very situation which developed at the trial here and may frame his pleading in specific terms to obviate such possibilities as a variance between pleading and proof and the running of the statute of limitations against the lesser offense of violating section 503 of the Vehicle Code. (Conceivably, the prosecutor in the present case could have been even more precise than he <em>was; </em>he could have pleaded, in separate counts, robbery and grand theft by the taking of an automobile and violation of section 503 of the Vehicle Code (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 954), in anticipation that the evidence would show one or another of those offenses, although defendant could be convicted of only one of them. In making such observation, however, we do not mean to suggest that a pleading drawn with the care shown in the present case <em>should </em>have been even more carefully drawn.)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Amicus curiae asserts that the view which we adopt will result in harmful consequences to the prosecution in situ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>ations where the defendant pleads once in jeopardy or a prior conviction or acquittal of an offense \u201cnecessarily included\u201d in a former charge (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1023). Amicus curiae suggests a hypothetical situation in which a defendant is accused of murder by a pleading which specifically alleges that the murder was committed in the perpetration of rape, is tried under such accusation, and is acquitted of murder. In this situation, amicus curiae complains, \u201cIf rape is an included offense, he [defendant] cannot thereafter be charged with rape even though no instructions were given on rape and no discussion was had on this crime by the jury at the murder trial. \u2019 \u2019 Underlying this argument of amicus curiae appear to be assumptions that prosecuting attorneys often make mistakes in pleading and presenting cases and that trial courts are not diligent in giving instructions covering the issues, and the implied request that this court should recognize that such mistakes are common and should protect the People from the consequences of such mistakes. We prefer to assume, as we believe is the ease, that the great majority of prosecuting attorneys are diligent and careful in their preparation and presentation of cases, and that trial judges are at least equally diligent and careful in the discharge of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Amicus curiae further argues that it is unfair to the defendant to require that he study the accusatory pleading to determine whether he is charged with offenses other than the greatest (most inclusive) crime alleged and offenses ncessarily included in the statutory definition of such greatest crime. Manifestly, in onr view, it does not appear unfair to give the accused notice of the general facts which the prosecution expects to prove by pleading details of the greatest offense charged. Rather, a pleading which forthrightly alleges not only the statutory language of the greatest offense charged but also known details as to the manner of its commission is more helpful to a defendant, particularly if he is innocent, and is more fair and, hence, more worthy of the proper stature of the state\u2019s attorney than a pleading which alleges the general statutory language and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In connection with his argument concerning asserted unfairness to those accused of crime, amicus curiae refers to eases which hold that a defendant cannot by demurrer obtain a separate statement, in separate counts, of \u201clesser\u201d offenses which are alleged not as distinct crimes but by specific description of the manner in which the \u201cgreatest\u201d offense was committed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Casserio </em>(1936), <em>supra, </em>16 Cal.App.2d 223, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>226; <em>People </em>v. <em>Izlar </em>(1908), 8 Cal.App. 600, 604 [97 P. 685].) A defendant is not put at any peculiar disadvantage in this respect by permitting the use of the accusatory pleading as the measure of included offenses, rather than limiting such measure solely to the statutory definition of the \u201cgreatest\u201d offense charged. We know of no rule or practice which would permit a defendant charged in the language of the statute defining a crime to obtain a separate statement of all offenses necessarily included in the statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Defendant\u2019s motion to strike from the notice of appeal the reference to a purported appeal from the \u201cverdict\u201d is granted.

The trial court (p. 522 of 94 Cal.App.) erroneously took the view that \"reckless driving\u201d was a lesser offense included within the crime charged, and so instructed the jury that they found that defendant was guilty of driving \"without precaution and in such a manner as to endanger the life and property of other persons.\u201d The offense of driving \"without due caution ... or in such manner as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person\u201d was denounced by section 121 of the former California Vehicle Act (Stats. 1923, p. 557). The appellate court correctly holds that the offense of which defendant w'as convicted was not necessarily included in the offense charged, because a person can drive carefully even though he is under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The discussion of the appellate court (pp. 523-524 of 94 Cal.App.) is directed, not to the specific accusatory pleading, but solely to the statutory definitions of the respective crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">An accusatory pleading in such general terms is expressly permitted by section 952 of the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\">This conclusion follows from the statutes and case law. It may be noted, however, that the following peculiar situation is presented by such law: A defendant charged with murder is entitled to no more specificity in the accusatory pleading than the statement that he \"murdered C. D. \u201d (Pen. Code, $ 951.) The People can prove at the trial that he murdered C. D. in any one of the ways in which murder can be committed, and the People, in the proceeding before the grand jury or committing magistrate which leads to the accusatory pleading, need not have disclosed all their evidence as to the various manners in which they are prepared to prove that C. D. was murdered. This anomalous situation results from the 1927 legislation \"liberalizing\u201d the rules of pleading in favor of the state (Stats. 1927, p. 1043, amending Pen.
