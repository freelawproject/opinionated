The plaintiff is a resident of the city of El Cerrito and the county of Contra Costa. He meets all of the requirements for the veterans\u2019 tax exemption except that in his application for the tax year 1954-1955 he failed and refused to subscribe to the nonsubversive oath contained in the application form supplied by the assessors pursuant to article XX, section 19 of the Constitution and section 32 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. His applications were rejected. He thereupon commenced these actions for declaratory relief. The trial court held that the constitutional provisions and the code section were invalid as an infringement upon the right of free speech guaranteed by the federal Constitution, and that section 32 was invalid for the reason that in failing to require an oath from the members of all groups otherwise entitled to tax exemptions an unreasonable classification was imposed. The judgment ordered that the plaintiff be granted the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The contentions urged on appeal in these cases are the same as those presented in <em>Prince </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, ante, </em>p. 472 [311 P.2d 544]. For reasons stated in the opinions in that case and in <em>First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, ante, </em>p. 419 [311 P.2d 508], the defendants should have prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Schauer, J., Spence, J., and McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b928-8\">TRAYNOR, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AeF\">For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in <em>First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, ante, </em>p. 419 [311 P.2d 508], I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Gibson, C.
