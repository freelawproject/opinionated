Hager and J. W. Martin, Jr., which had been doing business under the firm name of Martin School of Aviation. Defendant is sued as executor of the estate of Charles E. Rhoades, deceased. Hereafter the partnership will be referred to as plaintiff and decedent Rhoades as defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Plaintiff owned an instrument-equipped Bonanza airplane which it rented to defendant for a flight to the Imperial Valley. Arrangements were made for defendant by O. A. Kier, an experienced and competent pilot, who acted as pilot of the plane. Within three minutes after the flight commenced the plane crashed. Defendant, the pilot and C. 0. Gregg, all occupants of the plane, were killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The amended complaint in three counts alleges: (1) that the bailment was made to defendant upon condition that \u201cthey would not take, or cause said plane to be taken, off from the ground until after daybreak and unless the weather was clear\u201d; that the plane took off before daybreak and before the weather was clear, and that it was so negligently operated as to cause it to crash to the ground; (2) after incorporating by reference the averments as to the terms of the rental conditions, that defendant \u201cfailed to return said airplane to plaintiffs in violation of their said agreement of bailment, and wrongfully breached said agreement of bailment to plaintiffs\u2019 damage\u201d; and (3) after incorporating the previous averments of the terms of the bailment, that defendant \u201cpromised to return said airplane in good condition and wilfully and negligently failed and refused to return said airplane to plaintiffs and converted the same to his own use. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The trial court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">(a) Defendant and Pilot Kier agreed that they would not take or cause said plane to be taken from the ground if the weather was not good;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">(b) Defendant and Pilot Kier did not agree that the plane would not be taken from the ground \u201cuntil after daybreak\u201d ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">(c) When the flight started \u201cthe weather was good at that time\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">(d) The plane was not operated negligently;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>(e) The terms of the bailment were not breached; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-3\">(f) There was no conversion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><em>Questions: </em>First. <em>Was there substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings (a), </em>(6), (c) <em>and (d), supra?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">This question must be answered in the affirmative, and is governed by this rule: When findings of fact are attacked on the ground that there is not any substantial evidence to sustain them, the power of an appellate court <em>begins </em>and <em>ends </em>with the determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, that will support the findings of fact. <em>(Primm </em>v. <em>Primm, </em>46 Cal.2d 690, 693 [1] [299 P.2d 231].)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Applying this rule to the present case, a recital of a portion of the evidence with reference to each of the questioned findings discloses substantial evidence to support them:</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\"><em>Findings (a) and (b), </em>John Martin, a man experienced in aviation matters and in investigating accidents with the Civil Aeronautics Authority, on the day of the accident filed a report with the C.A.A. which was received in evidence. The material portion reads: \u201cMr. Rhoades and Bed Kier made arrangements to use pur Bonanza N8632A to go to Brawley, California, on a dove hunting trip and wanted to leave and return early in order to get the hunting over before it got too hot in Brawley. <em>Kier told me he would check the weather before leaving and wouldn\u2019t go if the weather was not good. </em>I was called at home about 5:45 a. m. by my brother and he said the airport guard called and said that he thought Kier had cracked up. I left at once for the scene of the accident and found it was a complete washout and was not anything left of value. All three persons in the airplane were killed. <em>It is impossible for me to figure out what could have caused this accident as the ship went in at a great speed and nearly straight in. </em>The only information I have is what people ip the vicinity had to say.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Clearly, the italicized portion of Mr. Martin\u2019s statement and the absence of any other evidence as to weather conditions before the plane was taken into the air constituted substantial evidence to sustain the trial court\u2019s questioned findings (a) and (b).  Conflicting evidence and inferences must, of</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">course, be disregarded by this court. (See <em>Primm </em>v. <em>Primm, supra, </em>p. 694 [2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\"><em>Finding </em>(c). The evidence established that at the time of takeoff there was a cloud bank above the airfield and surrounding area, with the ceiling being somewhere between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>200 and 1,000 feet. The official weather reports placed the ceiling at about 800 feet. Horizontal visibility was estimated at from one to seven miles, and there was no fog. The top of the cloud layer was approximately 2,000 feet, and above that level the skies were clear and visibility unrestricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The following Air Traffic Control Regulations (Code of Federal Regulations, tit. 14, pt. 60) apply to intrastate as well as interstate flights and prescribe, among other things, minimum safe altitudes and rules for visual and instrument flights with respect to ceilings and cloud formations:</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Section 60.17 prescribes minimum safe altitudes. So far as pertinent here it reads; <em>\u201cMinimum safe altitudes. </em>Except when necessary for take-off or landing, no person shall operate an aircraft below the following altitudes: ... (b) <em>Over congested areas. </em>Over the congested areas of cities, towns or settlements, or over an open-air assembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet from the aircraft. ... (c) <em>Over other than congested areas. </em>An altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In such event, the aircraft shall not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure. . . . (d) <em>IFR operations. </em>The minimum IFR altitude established by the Administrator for that portion of the route over which the operation is conducted. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The Visual Flight Rules are prescribed by section 60.30, which read: <em>\u201cCeilmg and distance from clouds. </em>Aircraft shall comply with the following requirements as to ceiling and distance from clouds: (a) <em>Within control zones. </em>Unless authorized by air traffic control, aircraft shall not be flown when the ceiling is less than 1,000 feet, or less than 500 feet vertically and 2,000 feet horizontally from any cloud formation. (b) <em>Elsewhere. </em>When at an altitude of more than 700 feet above the surface aircraft shall not be flown less than 500 feet vertically and 2,000 feet horizontally from any cloud formation ; when at an altitude of 700 feet or less aircraft shall not be flown unless clear of clouds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Ceiling is defined in section 60.72: <em>\u201cCeiling. </em>The distance from the surface of the ground or water to the lowest cloud layer reported as \u2018broken clouds\u2019 or \u2018overcast.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">\u201cIFR\u201d means instrument flight rules (\u00a7 60.82), and \u201cIFR conditions\u201d are defined as: \u201cWeather conditions below the minimum prescribed for flights under VFR.\u201d (\u00a7 60.83.) \u201cVFR conditions\u201d are defined as: \u201cWeather conditions equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>to or above the minimum prescribed for flights under VPR.\u201d (\u00a7 60.89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\">Section 60.41 reads: <em>\u201cIFB flight plan. </em>Prior to take-off from a point within a control zone or prior to entering a control area or control zone, a flight plan shall be filed with air traffic control. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">It is to be noted that there was no evidence that the path of flight was to go through congested areas within the meaning of the Visual Plight Rules. If the ceiling was 800 to 1,000 feet the airplane could fly at an altitude up to 700 feet and still comply with those rules if no control zones or congested areas were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">It is not necessary for visual flight conditions to prevail in order that the flying weather be \u201cgood.\u201d There is a difference between \u201cgood\u201d weather and \u201cclear\u201d weather in this regard. \u201cIn \u2018clear weather,\u2019 when the pilots can navigate their planes by \u2018pilotage,\u2019 that is, by visual operation from markings and landmarks along the airways, and can clearly see other aircraft or obstructions in time to avoid collision, flights may be governed by the Visual Plight Rules.\u201d (Wilson &amp; Bryan, Air Transportation (1949), p. 160.) It may be \u201cgood\u201d flight weather even though it is not \u201cclear\u201d within this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In the instant case the sky was clear above 2,000 feet, there was no evidence of any frontal activity or local turbulence in the air, and the only possibly unfavorable weather condition was the cloud bank of about 1,200 foot depth. The pilot was an experienced instrument flyer, and a bank of stratus at such a ceiling is not bad weather for an instrument-rated pilot in an instrument-equipped plane. Thus, even if visual flying conditions did .not prevail, there was no showing that the pilot did not comply with the Instrument Plight Rules or that the weather was not \u201cgood\u201d for an instrument flight. Under these circumstances it cannot be said as a matter of law that it was not \u201cgood\u201d flying weather, and the foregoing evidence fully sustains the trial court\u2019s finding (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\"><em>Finding (d). </em>There is a total absence of any evidence that defendant was negligent, or that the terms of the bailment were breached, or that there was a conversion. The trial court\u2019s finding on these points is sustained by Mr. Martin\u2019s report to the C.A.A. set forth above, wherein he said, \u201cIt is impossible for me to figure out what could have caused this accident as the ship went in at a great speed and nearly straight in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Second: <em>Did the trial court abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><em>No. </em>Plaintiff contends that it was surprised and misled by the court into not introducing certain evidence. During the argument at the close of the trial the judge expressed the opinion that the bailment contract contained a condition as to daylight departure and that the condition was violated. The court then, on its own motion, reopened the case for further evidence on the issue of visibility and the meaning of the word \u201cdaylight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The record shows that plaintiff had ample opportunity to introduce its evidence prior to submission of the case, as the judge made clear his willingness to hear any evidence offered, and additional evidence regarding the terms of the bailment contract was actually introduced. The case was twice continued for further evidence, and after submission the trial court made the findings set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The findings of fact and conclusions of law constitute the decision, which is the final deliberate expression of the court. Expressions of a judge during the trial cannot be considered for the purpose of contradicting deliberate findings of fact and conclusions of law that he subsequently makes and files. <em>(Strudthoff </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>28 Cal.2d 602, 615 [5] [170 P.2d 873] ; <em>DeCou </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>190 Cal. 741, 751 [7] [214 P. 444]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Driggs, </em>111 Cal.App. 42, 44 [1] [295 P. 51].)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">It thus appears that there was no ground for granting a new trial and that the trial judge\u2019s action in denying the motion was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Traynor, J., and Spence, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b719-10\">CARTER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVfk\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">I adopt herewith as my dissenting opinion in the above entitled case the able and learned opinion written by Mr. Justice Ashburn of the District Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Two, and which is reported in (Cal.App.) 303 P.2d 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">For the reasons stated therein, I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
