J.</author>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Smith, </em>205 Or App 557, 134 P3d 1109, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 198 (2006) <em>(Smith I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Smith, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 64 (2008). In <em>Smith I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on a judicial finding that the victim was particularly vulnerable. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Smith I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse and one count of coercion, committed against his then 10-year-old niece. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment on the coercion count, to be served consecutively to concurrent 75-month prison terms that the court imposed on the two first-degree sexual abuse convictions. The court imposed the consecutive departure sentence based on its finding that \u201cthe victim in this case was particularly vulnerable given the age of the victim who was the subject of this coercion and the relationship between you and the child. So I\u2019m going to do a departure on that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 123, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), we concluded that the imposition of a departure sentence under similar circumstances to the imposition of the departure sentence in this case \u2014 that is, where the defendant stood silent during sentencing but had not explicitly waived his or her rights to a jury trial on at least one of the charged offenses\u2014 constituted \u201cplain error.\u201d Although the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>reversed our decision in <em>Ramirez </em>on the ground that we did not properly exercise our discretion in determining whether to correct the error, the court did not disturb our conclusion that the error was plain. The state urges us to reconsider that conclusion; however, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The question remains whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case. The state argues that we should decline to exercise our discretion because there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found that the victim in this case was particularly vulnerable. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (if there is no legitimate debate about the existence of a sentence enhancement fact, the defendant\u2019s interest in a second sentencing hearing is minimal). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The trial court imposed a consecutive departure sentence on defendant\u2019s coercion conviction on the basis of its finding that the victim was particularly vulnerable, given her age and her relationship to defendant. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Ramirez, </em>there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found the departure factor where evidence in support of that factor was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d <em>Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513-14. Here, the victim testified that the abuse had occurred near her tenth birthday, and the undisputed evidence also showed that the victim was defendant\u2019s niece. That evidence was sufficient to remove any legitimate debate regarding the existence of the departure factor. As with the departure factor at issue in <em>Ramirez, </em>\u201con this record, no reasonable factfinder * * * could conclude anything other\u201d than that the victim was particularly vulnerable by virtue of her age and her relationship to defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 513. Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
