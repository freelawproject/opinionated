Claimant contends that the acts for which she was fired were mere \u201cisolated instances of misconduct\u201d and that, therefore, under the statutes and rules governing the board, they were not misconduct. ORS 657.176; OAR 471-030-0038. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The following facts are supported by substantial evidence in the record. ORS 183.484(5)(c). Claimant worked for Entek International, LLC (employer) as a payroll clerk with the official job title of \u201cHuman Resources Assistant.\u201d In that capacity, she had access to confidential information involving personnel and policy matters. She knew that employer expected her to perform her duties in a professional manner and to avoid acting contrary to the employer\u2019s company interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Shortly after a fellow employee, D, was fired, employer\u2019s representative discovered two e-mails written by claimant. One of them advised D that she should not quit her job because, if she did, she would not qualify for unemployment benefits; rather, she should try to provoke employer to fire her. The second e-mail revealed that, after D disregarded claimant\u2019s advice, claimant sent a message to a nonemployee informing her that D had quit. The next day, employer fired claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Claimant applied for unemployment insurance benefits, and her application was denied by an Employment Department representative. Claimant appealed, and a hearing was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ). After listening to testimony from a representative of employer and from claimant, the ALJ ruled against claimant, explaining,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">\u201cClaimant knew, or should have known, that * * * advising an employee to force the employer to discharge her was not in the employer\u2019s best interests. Claimant made a conscious decision to instruct the employee about how to qualify for unemployment benefits. Claimant\u2019s conduct was a violation of the employer\u2019s reasonable expectation and was misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u201cClaimant\u2019s e-mail to a former employee with information that [D] had quit her job also violated the employer\u2019s reasonable policy that claimant behave professionally in the workplace. Claimant shared personnel information to which she was privy in her position with a non-employee. Claimant\u2019s behavior was a willful violation of the employer\u2019s reasonable expectation and was misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">\u201cClaimant\u2019s behavior was too serious to be excused as an isolated instance of poor judgment. * * * Claimant\u2019s behavior breached the trust relationship with the employer, making continued employment impossible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The board adopted and affirmed the AL J\u2019s decision. Claimant now seeks judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The issue before us is whether claimant was fired for misconduct. If so, the board ruled correctly that she does not qualify to receive unemployment insurance benefits. ORS 657.176. \u201cMisconduct\u201d is defined by rule as \u201ca willful or wantonly negligent violation of the standards of behavior which an employer has the right to expect of an employee\u201d as well as \u201c[a]n act or series of actions that amount to a willful or wantonly negligent disregard of an employer\u2019s interest.\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(3)(a). However, an act is not \u201cmisconduct,\u201d and therefore cannot serve as the basis for discharge, if it is (among other things) an \u201c[i]solated instance[ ] of poor judgment.\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(3)(b). An isolated instance of poor judgment, in turn, is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">\u201c(A) The act must be isolated. The exercise of poor judgment must be a single or infrequent occurrence rather than a repeated act or pattern of other willful or wantonly negligent behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">\u201c(C) The act must involve poor judgment. A decision to willfully violate an employer\u2019s reasonable standard of behavior is poor judgment. A conscious decision to take action that results in a wantonly negligent violation of an employer\u2019s reasonable standard of behavior is poor judgment. A conscious decision not to comply with an unreasonable employer policy is not misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">\u201c(D) Acts that violate the law, acts that are tantamount to unlawful conduct, acts that create irreparable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>breaches of trust in the employment relationship or otherwise make a continued employment relationship impossible exceed mere poor judgment and do not fall within the exculpatory provisions of OAR, 471-030-0038(3).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">OAR 471-030-0038(l)(d). The board correctly concluded that, unless claimant\u2019s acts fell within the exculpatory exception for acts that are isolated incidents of poor judgment, her acts \u2014 advising D to provoke employer to fire her and disclosing confidential employment information to a nonemployee\u2014 amounted to misconduct because those acts were conscious, unprofessional, and contrary to employer\u2019s interest. The board then ruled that these acts of misconduct could not \u201cbe excused as an isolated instance of poor judgment\u201d because they were \u201ctoo serious.\u201d That reasoning was wrong. The fact that an isolated instance of poor judgment is a <em>serious </em>violation of an employer\u2019s reasonable standard of behavior does not automatically transform the act into misconduct or, put another way, does not mean that the act cannot qualify for the exculpatory provision that immunizes isolated instances of poor judgment. <em>Jones v. Employment Dept., </em>199 Or App 571, 575-76, 112 P3d 453 (2005); <em>Freeman v. Employment Dept., </em>195 Or App 417, 424, 98 P3d 402 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The board went on to reason, however, that claimant\u2019s acts \u201cbreached the trust relationship with the employer, making continued employment impossible.\u201d In so concluding, the board invoked OAR 471-030-0038(l)(d)(D), under which \u201cacts that create irreparable breaches of trust in the employment relationship or otherwise make a continued employment relationship impossible exceed mere poor judgment and do not fall within the exculpatory provisions [for isolated instances of poor judgment].\u201d We presume that this provision imposes an objective test; an employer cannot unilaterally announce a breach of trust if a reasonable employer in the same situation would not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\"> Thus, the dispositive question is whether employer\u2019s loss of trust was a reasonable reaction to claimant\u2019s acts. That determination involves an interpretation of the Employment Department rule defining \u201cmisconduct.\u201d Ring <em>v. Employment Dept., </em>205 Or App 532, 536, 134 P3d 1096 (2006). Because the department promulgated the rule, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>will defer to its interpretation unless it is implausible, that is, inconsistent with the rule\u2019s text, context, or other source of law. <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132, 142, 881 P2d 119 (1994); <em>Ring, </em>205 Or App at 536. Further, the department\u2019s decision is the one rendered by the authorized representative, not the one made by either the ALJ or the board. <em>McPherson v. Employment Division, </em>285 Or 541, 546-47, 591 P2d 1381 (1979); <em>Johnson v. Employment Dept., </em>187 Or App 441, 446-47, 67 P3d 984, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 60 (2003). Here, claimant, a human resources employee, advised another employee to provoke employer to fire her, knowing that to do so would be contrary to employer\u2019s interest. More seriously, she disclosed confidential personnel information to an outsider. The department\u2019s authorized representative concluded that those actions amounted to misconduct. That conclusion is not implausible. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
