The state concedes the error. As explained below, we accept the state\u2019s concession as well founded. We therefore remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Defendant was charged in the present proceeding with DUII, alleged to have occurred in 2006. Defendant petitioned to enter diversion pursuant to ORS 813.210. The state opposed the motion, arguing that defendant was ineligible to enter into diversion because he previously had participated in a \u201csimilar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program,\u201d ORS 813.220(8), noting that defendant previously had been convicted of possession of a controlled substance, <em>former </em>ORS 475.992 (2003), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 475.840 (2005), for which he received a presumptive sentence. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s petition to enter diversion. Defendant was then convicted of DUII after a trial to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">On appeal, defendant notes that our case law establishes that a \u201csimilar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program\u201d is one in which a defendant participates \u201cto avoid a substantial, judicially imposed adverse consequence * * <em>State v. Wright, </em>204 Or App 724, 731, 131 P3d 838 (2006) (citing cases). The parties farther agree, as do we, that defendant\u2019s previous conviction, in and of itself, does not establish that defendant participated in an alcohol or drug rehabilitation program, much less that he participated in a program that was sufficiently \u201csimilar\u201d to diversion to trigger the prohibition set forth in ORS 813.220.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Thus, both parties agree that this case needs to be remanded. We agree. Because the trial court has discretion to determine, under other provisions of ORS 813.220, whether defendant should be permitted to enter into a diversion program, we vacate defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction and remand for the court to consider whether, under ORS 813.220(1) to (5), defendant should be admitted to a diversion program. If the court concludes that defendant would not be an appropriate candidate for diversion and denies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>petition, it may reinstate his conviction. <em>See, e.g., State v. Warrington, </em>219 Or App 566, 184 P3d 1160 (2008) (directing same disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Vacated and remanded with instructions for trial court to determine whether defendant should be permitted to enter into diversion and, if entry into diversion is denied, to reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
