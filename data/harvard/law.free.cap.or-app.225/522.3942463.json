J.</author>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Steinhoff, </em>202 Or App 221, 120 P3d 1255 (2005) <em>(Steinhoff I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Steinhoff, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 64 (2008). In <em>Steinhoff I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on judicial findings that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Steinhoff I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary, third-degree theft, and second-degree criminal mischief; the trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on the first-degree burglary conviction. The court explained its basis for departure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201c[T]here\u2019s not too many records that the Court sees that have been longer than this. That\u2019s like, even if you subtract four convictions, there\u2019s still twenty some convictions for different things. Most of them were in the \u201980\u2019s but you\u2019ve had some in the \u201990\u2019s certainly. And, even one last year\u2014 two last year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">\u00ab\u2021 # # \u2021 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">\u201cThere is a break there * * * and I\u2019m certainly taking that into account somewhat. But, clearly, he\u2019s got a repetitive history for Burglary and Theft type offenses. And, some of them are in the \u201980\u2019s and \u201990\u2019s. But, it appears that he\u2019s coming back to that type of conduct. And, he\u2019s had some other conduct in the meantime. I\u2019ll take into account that some of the record is old. But, it doesn\u2019t mitigate it that much. So, that\u2019s the reason for the departure is repetitive conduct with theft type offenses, burglaries in particular.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The \u201cbreak\u201d the court referred to was a nine-year period between 1994 and 2003 when defendant had not been convicted of a theft-type offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s criminal history included at least five prior convictions for theft; the state argued that defendant had nine prior theft convictions, which defendant disputed, and the trial court apparently agreed to consider the lower number but also noted that \u201cfive is actually quite a few.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 123, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), we concluded that the imposition of a departure sentence under circumstances similar to the imposition of the departure sentence in this case, that is, where the defendant stood silent during sentencing but had not explicitly waived his or her rights to a jury trial on at least one of the charged offenses, constituted plain error. Although the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Ramirez </em>on the ground that we did not properly exercise our discretion in determining whether to correct the error, the court did not disturb our conclusion that the error was plain. The state urges us to reconsider that conclusion. However, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The question remains whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case. The state argues that we should decline to exercise our discretion because there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found the departure factor relied upon by the trial court. <em>Cf. Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (if there is no legitimate debate about the existence of a sentence enhancement fact, the defendant\u2019s interest in a second sentencing hearing is minimal). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>In <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007), the Supreme Court held that \u201c \u2018[pjersistent involvement in similar offenses\u2019 presents a factual issue that * * * a defendant may insist that a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">\u201cIn determining whether the record establishes \u2018[plersistent involvement in similar offenses,\u2019 a sentencing court must do more than find that a defendant has two or more prior convictions for similar offenses. The trier of fact must infer from the number and frequency of those prior convictions whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in those offenses is \u2018persistent\u2019; that is, the trier of fact must determine whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in similar offenses is sufficiently continuous or recurring to say that it is \u2018persistent.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><em>Id. </em>(brackets in original). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Ramirez, </em>there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found the departure factor where evidence in support of that factor was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d 343 Or at 513-14. Thus, to establish that there is no legitimate debate that a defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses, the evidence adduced at trial and sentencing must not only establish that the defendant had two or more prior convictions, but also must support \u2014 indeed, to be \u201coverwhelming\u201d it must <em>require </em>\u2014 the inference that the defendant\u2019s involvement was sufficiently continuous or recurring to say that it was \u201cpersistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">On this record, we conclude that a jury would readily draw that inference. Although defendant did have a nine-year \u201cbreak\u201d during which he did not have a conviction for a burglary or theft-type offense, the uncontroverted evidence of at least five prior convictions for such offenses is sufficient to convince us that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found defendant to have been persistently involved in similar offenses. Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to correct the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\"> The state argues on appeal that it is possible that defendant was incarcerated during that nine-year period. According to the criminal history worksheet, defendant\u2019s last convictions were for three counts of second-degree burglary in 1994 and attempted rape, first-degree sexual abuse, and fourth-degree assault in 1993. Defendant was also convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants and driving while suspended in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Though the state\u2019s observation is a logical one, in the absence of evidence in the record establishing the lengths and dates of defendant\u2019s incarcerations, we cannot assume that the nine-year break was the result of defendant being incarcerated. Accordingly, we do not consider that possibility in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
