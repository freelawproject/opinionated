J.</author>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Vandervort, </em>207 Or App 433, 142 P3d 482, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 579 (2006) <em>(Vandervort I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Vandervort, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 64 (2008). In <em>Vandervort I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on judicial findings that the victim was particularly vulnerable, that the harm was greater than typical, and that defendant had engaged in \u201crepetitive conduct.\u201d That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Vandervort I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Defendant was convicted of first-degree arson and first-degree burglary after he broke into the victim\u2019s home with the intent to commit a theft and then burned the home to the ground, destroying nearly all of the victim\u2019s personal property. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 60 months\u2019 probation on the burglary conviction. In its written judgment, the court explained that it had imposed the departure sentence because the \u201charm [was] greater than normal, victim particularly vulnerable, repetitive conduct\u2014 each sufficient on its own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 123, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), we concluded that the imposition of a departure sentence under circumstances similar to the imposition of the departure sentence in this case, that is, where the defendant stood silent during sentencing but had not explicitly waived his or her rights to a jury trial on at least one of the charged offenses, constituted \u201cplain error.\u201d Although the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>reversed our decision in <em>Ramirez </em>on the ground that we did not properly exercise our discretion in determining whether to correct the error, the court did not disturb our conclusion that the error was plain. The state urges us to reconsider that conclusion; however, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The question remains whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case. The state argues that we should decline to exercise our discretion, because there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found the departure factors relied upon by the trial court. <em>Cf. Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (if there is no legitimate debate about the existence of a sentence enhancement fact, the defendant\u2019s interest in a second sentencing hearing is minimal). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Because it is dispositive, we address only the departure factor of greater than typical harm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We readily conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found that the harm that the victim suffered \u2014 loss of her home and nearly all of her possessions to fire \u2014 was greater than the typical harm contemplated by the legislature when it established the presumptive sentence for first-degree burglary. <em>See State v. Rhoades, </em>210 Or App 280, 285, 149 P3d 1259 (2006) (\u201cIn determining whether a factor constitutes a substantial and compelling reason for departure, we look at whether \u2018exceptional circumstances [exist that] overcome the presumption that the [presumptive] sentence accomplishes the purposes of the guidelines.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Parsons, </em>135 Or App 188, 191, 897 P2d 1197, <em>rev den, </em>322 Or 168 (1995)). Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to correct the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> That factor is dispositive because, as noted, the trial court stated in its written judgment that any of the factors it enumerated was sufficient, individually, to support its decision to impose a durational departure sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
