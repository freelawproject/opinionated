Thomas, </em>204 Or App 109, 129 P3d 212 (2006), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>205 Or App 399, 134 P3d 1038 (2006) <em>(Thomas I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Thomas, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 64 (2008). In <em>Thomas I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing, because the trial court had imposed dangerous offender sentence enhancements on the basis of its own fact-finding. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that we properly exercised our discretion in <em>Thomas I, </em>and, accordingly, we again remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Defendant was convicted of attempted murder with a firearm, felon in possession of a firearm, and assault in the first degree with a firearm after he shot a man multiple times in the head and chest. On both the attempted murder and assault convictions, the trial court imposed 30-year indeterminate maximum dangerous offender sentences under ORS 161.725(l)(a). In support of those sentences, the court found that \u201cdefendant suffers from a severe personality disorder with a propensity toward crimes that seriously endanger the life or safety of another,\u201d thus warranting an extended period of incarceration. The trial court also imposed consecutive 90-month \u201crequired incarceration terms\u201d on both of those convictions. On the felon-in-possession conviction, the court imposed a presumptive sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutively to the 90-month prison terms that it imposed on the other convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">For the reasons set out in <em>State v. Shelters, </em>225 Or App 76, 200 P3d 598 (2009), we conclude that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant as a dangerous offender in the absence of a jury finding to that effect, and we exercise our discretion to correct that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
