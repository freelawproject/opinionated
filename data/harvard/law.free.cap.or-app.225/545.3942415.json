J.</author>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Defendant was convicted of harassment, ORS 166.065; assault in the fourth degree, ORS 163.160(l)(a); menacing, ORS 163.190; pointing a firearm at another, ORS 166.190; and unlawful use of a weapon, ORS 166.220. He now appeals, advancing five assignments of error concerning the admissibility of various items of evidence and the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s jury instructions. Specifically, in his first two assignments of error on appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in excluding tape recordings of 9-1-1 calls that he made the day before and the morning of the incident that led to his convictions. In his third and fourth assignments, he argues that the trial court erred in excluding testimony of a physician and closing argument of counsel relating to his physical condition. In his fifth assignment, he argues that the trial court erred in refusing to give a \u201cchoice of evils\u201d jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s first, second, and fifth assignments of error. The state concedes that the trial court erred as asserted in defendant\u2019s third and fourth assignments, but argues that the error was harmless. We agree that the trial court erred, but disagree that the error was harmless. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Because a jury found defendant guilty, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. McDonnell, </em>313 Or 478, 480, 837 P2d 941 (1992). We begin with an overview of the facts leading to the charges against defendant and address in more detail the evidence in dispute in our analysis of the relevant assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Defendant and the victim had known each other for a number of years, having worked together in California. In July 2005, when defendant was 62 years old and the victim was 50 years old, the victim visited defendant at defendant\u2019s residence in Oregon. The victim initially stayed for a month, during which he helped defendant with a construction project; he refused any pay for his work. The victim returned in August 2005 and began living in a yurt on defendant\u2019s property. Beginning in September 2005, defendant agreed to keep track of the hours that the victim worked for him and to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>him $10 an hour. That same month, defendant agreed to buy a camper for the victim and allow him to \u201cwork it off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">On September 15, the two men argued about the terms of their work arrangement. The victim attempted to leave the property with the camper. Defendant blocked the victim\u2019s access to the camper, and the victim left without it. Defendant called the sheriffs office; the deputies who responded to the call ascertained that no one was injured and advised defendant that the dispute was a civil matter. Later that evening, the victim called defendant and, according to defendant, made threatening statements. Defendant told the victim to stay off his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The next day, the victim again contacted defendant to discuss their disagreement. After that discussion, defendant called the sheriffs office and inquired whether the victim could be arrested for trespassing if he came onto defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">On September 17, the victim called defendant to tell him that he was coming to get the money that he claimed defendant owed him. When the victim arrived at defendant\u2019s property, defendant was waiting outside the gate. Defendant told the victim that he was going to get the victim\u2019s money and told the victim to wait outside the gate. Defendant then drove back onto his property, accompanied by another person, Warnken, who had arrived after the victim. After about 10 minutes, the victim decided to walk onto the property as well, to see whether he had left anything in the camper. The victim encountered defendant, who told him to get off the property. The victim continued walking toward the camper; when he reached it, he discovered that it was locked. When the victim returned to where defendant was standing, defendant pulled out a gun, told the victim he was making a citizen\u2019s arrest for trespassing, and told the victim to lie on the ground. When the victim refused to comply, defendant fired a shot past the victim\u2019s head, called 9-1-1, and then hit the victim with the gun. The victim got into Warnken\u2019s vehicle, and he and Warnken drove away. Along the road, they encountered sheriffs deputies and made a statement. The deputies continued to defendant\u2019s property, where they arrested defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Defendant was charged with the previously stated crimes and was convicted. At trial, defendant offered the testimony of his physician, Williams, relating to defendant\u2019s physical condition. The trial court excluded the testimony. In closing argument, defendant attempted to argue that the jury should consider defendant\u2019s physical condition in determining whether the state had disproved defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses of self-defense, defense of premises, and/or the justifiable use of force in making a citizen\u2019s arrest. The trial court, however, ruled that defendant could not make that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">On appeal, defendant challenges both rulings. Defendant points to <em>State v. Wright, </em>310 Or 430, 436, 799 P2d 642 (1990), in which the Supreme Court held that, for the purpose of the defenses at issue in this case, whether the degree of force employed by a defendant is excessive or disproportionate is a question for the jury to be answered from the standpoint of a reasonable person in the situation of the defendant \u201cunder all the circumstances surrounding him.\u201d According to defendant, Williams\u2019s testimony \u2014 which would have included testimony that he had been defendant\u2019s physician for five to 10 years; that defendant has had a cervical fusion and multiple low back surgeries; that defendant had severe congestive heart failure, hypertension, and coronary artery disease; and that defendant was one of Williams\u2019s most fragile patients \u2014 pertained to such circumstances and therefore was logically relevant to his defenses. In addition, defendant asserts, Williams\u2019s expert testimony was qualitatively different from testimony that defendant himself was able to offer. According to defendant, Williams\u2019s testimony was \u201cthe only evidence that could have objectively established the true state of defendant\u2019s physical condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">As noted, the state concedes that the trial court erred in excluding the evidence and, concomitantly, in precluding counsel from making an argument based on it. We agree. <em>See </em>ORS 161.209 (person is justified in using physical force for self-defense or defense of others from what the person reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force; person may use degree of force that the person reasonably believes to be necessary); <em>cf. State v. Doherty, </em>52 Or 591, 596, 98 P 152 (1908) (in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>whether a defendant\u2019s use of force in his defense was justified, jury may consider the \u201crelative age and strength of the parties\u201d as well as the ferocity of the attack). The state argues, however, that the error was harmless. According to the state, it was undisputed at trial that defendant\u2019s physical condition was poor and defendant\u2019s counsel argued as much to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"> We will affirm a judgment of conviction notwithstanding the erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence if there is little likelihood that the error affected the verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). We first determine the issue to which our harmless error analysis applies. <em>State v. Ennis, </em>212 Or App 240, 262, 158 P3d 510, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 223 (2007). We then asses the erroneously admitted or excluded evidence in light of other evidence in the record pertaining to that issue. If erroneously admitted or excluded evidence relates to a \u201ccentral factual issue\u201d in the case, it is more likely to have affected the jury\u2019s determination than if it deals with a tangential issue. <em>State v. Marrington, </em>335 Or 555, 566, 73 P3d 911 (2003). By contrast, if the particular issue to which the error pertains has little relationship to the issues being determined by the jury, then there is less likelihood that the error affected the verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\"><em>Davis </em>is illustrative. In that case, the defendant was charged with murder. At trial, he sought to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s statements to various persons regarding her depressed and suicidal mental state, in support of his defense theory that the victim killed herself. The trial court excluded the statements, which had been made between one and three years before the victim\u2019s death, as being \u201ctoo old.\u201d The defendant subsequently was convicted by a jury. 336 Or at 21-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On appeal, the Supreme Court concluded that exclusion of the statements was error. <em>Id. </em>at 25-27. It then considered whether the error was harmless in light of other testimony relating to the victim\u2019s mental state, including testimony by two witnesses regarding the victim\u2019s grief over the death of her child one month before the victim\u2019s own death, and the testimony of a doctor who had conducted a post-mortem evaluation of the victim\u2019s medical records and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>concluded that the victim was depressed but not suicidal. <em>Id. </em>at 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The Supreme Court first determined that the excluded statements were not \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d of the admitted evidence, because they contained more specific threats of suicide and thus were \u201cqualitatively different\u201d from the evidence the jury heard. <em>Id. </em>at 34. The court also determined that the more remote statements tended to show the persistence of the victim\u2019s depressed and suicidal mental state. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the court determined that the excluded statements went \u201cdirectly to the heart of defendant\u2019s factual theory of the case\u201d and \u201ctended to complete the picture of defendant\u2019s version of the events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For those reasons, the court could not say that there was little likelihood that exclusion of the statements affected the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><em>State v. Smith, </em>154 Or App 37, 960 P2d 877 (1998), also is instructive. In that case, the defendant was an inmate in a minimum security correctional facility; the perimeter of the grounds was marked with signs but no fences. After the defendant left the premises and was found in a nearby forest, he was charged with escape in the second degree. He gave notice that he intended to rely on an insanity defense under ORS 161.300; his theory was that he suffered from depression and had no memory of leaving the facility. <em>Id. </em>at 39-40. The trial court excluded the testimony of a psychologist as to the defendant\u2019s psychological condition. This court determined that the exclusion of the testimony was error and that, moreover, the error was not harmless. We reasoned that the defendant\u2019s sole defense at trial was that, at the time he left the camp, he lacked awareness that that was in fact what he was doing and that the psychologist\u2019s testimony that he suffered from a mental disorder that could have caused that lack of awareness \u201cwent to the heart of\u2019 his defense. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51. We therefore reversed and remanded for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In this case, the disputed issue is whether defendant was justified in using physical force to defend himself. Again, evidence relevant to that issue includes evidence relating to the relative age and strength of defendant and the victim. <em>Doherty, </em>52 Or at 596. We therefore examine the state of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>record as to that issue, noting, as we do so, that the issue was central to defendant\u2019s defense of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Defendant testified at trial that, starting in December of 2001, he had three back surgeries. The first involved removing two discs from the base of his neck and inserting a tungsten plate and screws to \u201chold everything in place.\u201d He testified that, about a year later, he had a laminectomy in which surgeons \u201ctrim[med] the bulge off\u2019 a herniated disc in his lower back. Six or seven months later, the disc was removed and, using two metal rods and four bolts, a piece of bone from his hip was inserted; defendant explained that he had degenerative disc disease. At some point after that, defendant was in an accident in which he fractured his right hip and four ribs, punctured a lung, and \u201ccracked [his] head.\u201d Defendant testified that he was in a coma for five weeks and that \u201cthey think that during that time I had a silent \u2014 what they referred to as a silent heart attack,\u201d as a result of which a defibrillator was implanted that \u201cmonitors my heart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Defendant testified that, although he did \u201cyard work and stuff like that,\u201d he was not supposed to do any hard labor or heavy lifting. When asked whether, due to his back problems, he was \u201csupposed to not have any physical force applied to [his] body,\u201d he responded in the affirmative and added, \u201cAnd possibly a heart attack.\u201d He also stated, \u201cI could end up in a wheelchair or die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On cross-examination, defendant acknowledged that he had studied martial arts for three or four years and that, when he hit the victim, he was attempting to do so according to a martial arts technique. He agreed that, despite his illnesses, he did \u201cget out and try to be active\u201d; that he had helped load 80-pound storage racks into his vehicle; and that he used a cane only at certain times such as when his back was \u201creally bothering me\u201d or he had to climb stairs or stand in a line.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The victim\u2019s testimony also touched on defendant\u2019s physical condition. The victim testified that he was aware of defendant\u2019s \u201cback operations,\u201d his defibrillator, and the fact that defendant took \u201cmedications.\u201d He also testified that he knew that the reason that defendant had hired him to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>physical labor on defendant\u2019s property was because defendant could not do the work himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">We turn to the excluded testimony of defendant\u2019s physician. In defendant\u2019s offer of proof, Williams testified that he was a medical doctor, that he had a general practice including surgery, and that he was the medical administrator and chief of staff at Curry General Hospital. He estimated that he had been treating defendant for five to 10 years. He noted that defendant had had multiple back surgeries, including a fusion of his cervical spine and lower back surgery, and that, as a result, defendant\u2019s spine was \u201cvery fragile\u201d and he had to \u201cbe very careful.\u201d Williams also testified that defendant had \u201csevere\u201d congestive heart failure or congestive cardiomyopathy, leading to the implantation of a biventricular pacemaker and to defendant\u2019s inability to walk quickly without becoming short of breath. Williams noted that defendant also has coronary artery disease with significant hardening of the arteries, making him more prone to heart attack. He testified that defendant had \u201cnot the greatest lungs in the world,\u201d and that he had had some \u201cirregularities of his heartbeat, which would be expected with severe congestive heart failure and hypertension.\u201d Williams testified that defendant was \u201cone of my most fragile patients,\u201d that he \u201cshouldn\u2019t really be involved in anything physical that involves much physical activity,\u201d and that, if someone exerted physical force against him, he could not defend himself as would a \u201cnormal person of his age.\u201d Williams reiterated that defendant had \u201cextremely bad heart failure\u201d and a \u201cbad back\u201d and that, if he experienced \u201cphysical force from a third party,\u201d he \u201ccould probably die\u201d and he \u201ccouldn\u2019t defend himself for sure physically, and I wouldn\u2019t recommend that he be involved in any highly emotionally charged situations.\u201d Williams stated that the average person who is defendant\u2019s age \u201cis in much better condition than he is.\u201d When asked whether defendant knew that, if he were in a physical confrontation, he could be seriously injured or die, Williams answered, \u201cYes, he does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Having considered Williams\u2019s proffered testimony in light of admitted evidence, we cannot say that the erroneous exclusion of Williams\u2019s testimony was harmless. First, Williams gave a more detailed, technical, and complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>description of defendant\u2019s condition. For example, although defendant referred to his silent heart attack, the need to monitor his heart, and the possibility that he might have another heart attack, Williams explained that defendant had congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy, noted that that condition prevented defendant from engaging in certain activities, noted that defendant also had \u201csignificant\u201d coronary artery disease or hardening of the arteries, and noted that he had an irregular heartbeat. Williams also testified that defendant had hypertension and impaired lung capacity; defendant did not mention those conditions at all. Thus, Williams\u2019s testimony was not merely cumulative of other, admitted evidence; rather, it contained more detailed and scientifically based information about defendant\u2019s condition, as well as information that other testimony did not address at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\">Equally significantly, Williams expressed various medical judgments about defendant\u2019s condition. He characterized defendant\u2019s spine as \u201cvery fragile\u201d and opined that defendant\u2019s congestive heart failure was \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cextremely bad.\u201d As a matter of his medical judgment, Williams also compared defendant\u2019s overall condition to that of other persons defendant\u2019s age: according to Williams, defendant was one of his \u201cmost fragile patients,\u201d who could not defend himself as would a \u201cnormal person of his age.\u201d None of the other evidence about defendant\u2019s physical condition came in the form of expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Accordingly, this is not a case in which the excluded testimony of one medical expert was \u201cnot qualitatively different from\u201d the testimony of another medical expert. <em>See Sanderson v. Mark, </em>155 Or App 166, 179-80, 962 P2d 786 (1998) (even assuming that the trial court erred in excluding testimony of medical expert, error was harmless because that expert\u2019s testimony was not qualitatively different from that of at least five other expert witnesses). Rather, here, Williams was the only potential witness who was a medical expert and, consistently with that status, his testimony was significantly more scientific in nature. Stated another way, the source of the erroneously excluded evidence significantly differentiated that evidence from other, admitted evidence\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>defendant\u2019s and the victim\u2019s lay descriptions of defendant\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">\u201cThe potential for scientifically based evidence to exert influence on a jury is manifest.\u201d <em>State v. Aman, </em>194 Or App 463, 474, 95 P3d 244 (2004), <em>rev dismissed, </em>339 Or 281 (2005). Thus, ordinarily, when scientifically based testimony by an expert witness is erroneously <em>admitted, </em>it weighs against a determination that the error was harmless. <em>See State v. Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 286, 844 P2d 195 (1993) (erroneous admission of physician\u2019s testimony was not harmless; witness had \u201cextensive professional experience\u201d in the relevant subject, she testified \u201cin an authoritative and detailed manner about that subject,\u201d and her testimony \u201cpresumably was persuasive to the trier of fact\u201d); <em>State v. McFarland, </em>221 Or App 567, 578, 191 P3d 754 (2008) (\u201cWhen the source of erroneously admitted testimony is a witness presented to the jury as an expert on matters that are scientifically based, it weighs heavily against a determination that an error is harmless.\u201d); <em>State v. Norby, </em>218 Or App 609, 621, 180 P3d 752 (2008) (erroneously admitted testimony of physician was not harmless; \u201cthe source of the erroneously admitted statements figures heavily in our harmless error analysis\u201d). It stands to reason that the erroneous <em>exclusion </em>of scientifically based testimony of an expert witness is to similar effect. That is what occurred here. The error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
