J.</author>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Petitioner Golfside Investments, LLC, seeks judicial review of a final order of the Oregon Public Utility Commission (PUC), which granted respondent Roats Water System, Inc.\u2019s (Roats) complaint in part, and ordered petitioner to pay certain residential development charges (RDCs) in accordance with PUC-approved water service tariffs. Petitioner assigns error to, <em>inter alia, </em>the PUC\u2019s determination that, even though petitioner is Roats\u2019s customer, the PUC had jurisdiction to consider Roats\u2019s complaint against petitioner pursuant to ORS 756.500.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As amplified below, we conclude that, pursuant to ORS 756.500(5), the PUC has jurisdiction with respect to any complaint filed by a public utility concerning \u201cany matter affecting its own rates or service,\u201d including a complaint against a customer \u2014 and that jurisdiction is not qualified by the terms of ORS 756.500(1). We further reject without discussion petitioner\u2019s other assignments of error as well as Roats\u2019s cross-petition. Accordingly, we affirm on both the petition for judicial review and the cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The PUC found the following facts, which are uncontested on judicial review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>322 Or 132, 134, 903 P2d 351 (1995) (when the petitioner for judicial review does not dispute the agency\u2019s findings of fact, the reviewing court adopts those facts for purposes of judicial review). In 1999, the City of Bend approved the development of a manufactured home park (the property). In 2000, the developer of the property and Roats signed a Water Service Agreement (WSA) providing that, <em>inter alia, </em>Roats would supply water service to the property. The WSA further provided that, as per PUC tariff rules and regulations, such water service was subject to RDCs.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Petitioner acquired the property in 2002. Petitioner immediately took steps to convert the property into a residential subdivision. In March 2005, the City of Bend conditionally approved the application to convert the property. About a month later, Roats notified petitioner that it had become aware of the property conversion, asserted that the conversion of the property to a residential subdivision triggered an obligation under the WSA and applicable tariffs to pay RDCs, and demanded that petitioner pay Roats those RDCs. Petitioner rejected that demand and, thus, refused to pay the RDCs at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">In November 2005, Roats filed a petition for declaratory ruling with the PUC, requesting a ruling that petitioner is responsible for paying RDCs in conformance with the PUC tariffs and rules. The PUC declined to grant Roats\u2019s petition for declaratory ruling; rather, the PUC concluded that, due to apparent factual disputes, it was more appropriate for Roats to file a complaint against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Roats filed a complaint with the PUC in February 2006, pursuant to ORS 756.500, alleging that petitioner has refused to pay RDCs as specified in (1) the applicable PUC tariffs and rules and (2) the WSA entered into with petitioner\u2019s predecessor, the original developer of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Petitioner, as the defendant before the PUC, filed a motion to dismiss asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the PUC lacked jurisdiction to consider Roats\u2019s complaint. At the core of that jurisdictional dispute before the PUC \u2014 and, again, on judicial review \u2014 are the provisions of ORS 756.500. That statute provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">\u201c(1) Any person may file a complaint before the Public Utility Commission, or the commission may, on the commission\u2019s own initiative, file such complaint. <em>The complaint shall be against any person whose business or activities are regulated by some one or more of the statutes, jurisdiction for the enforcement or regulation of which is conferred upon the commission. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">\u00abH\u00ed Hi \u00edfc \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">\u201c(5) <em>Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, any public utility * * * may make complaint as to any matter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>affecting its own rates or service with like effect as though made by any other person, </em>by filing an application, petition or complaint with the commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Petitioner contended that ORS 756.500 \u2014 and, in particular, the requirement in subsection (1) that the \u201ccomplaint shall be against any person whose business or activities are regulated\u201d \u2014 prohibits a public utility from bringing a complaint against a customer because a customer is not regulated by the PUC. Roats contended that its complaint was predicated on subsection (5), not subsection (1) \u2014 that is, that the PUC had jurisdiction in that Roats\u2019s complaint was a complaint by a public utility \u201cas to any matter affecting its own rates or service.\u201d The administrative law judge (ALJ) agreed and denied petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Petitioner appealed to the PUC. The PUC agreed with the ALJ\u2019s prior determination and concluded that Roats\u2019s complaint, as a request to require payment of charges set forth in its tariffs governing water utility service, is \u201cclearly within the jurisdiction of the [PUC].\u201d The PUC ultimately granted Roats\u2019s complaint, in part, and concluded that petitioner is obligated to pay certain RDCs in accordance with the water service tariffs approved for Roats.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">On judicial review, petitioner continues to assert that the PUC lacked jurisdiction to consider Roats\u2019s complaint. In response, Roats and the PUC<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> emphasize that, given its unqualified \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language, ORS 756.500(5) is not subject to any limitation derived from ORS 756.500(1). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that,under ORS 756.500(5), the PUC did have jurisdiction with respect to Roats\u2019s complaint against its own customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Whether the PUC had jurisdiction over Roats\u2019s complaint hinges on the proper construction and application of ORS 756.500. We review the PUC\u2019s interpretation of applicable statutes in accordance with the principles of <em>Springfield Education Assn. v. School Dist., </em>290 Or 217, 621 P2d 547 (1980). That is, unless the statutory terms at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>are delegative in nature, we review for errors of law. <em>Utility Reform Project v. PUC, </em>171 Or App 349, 353, 16 P3d 516 (2000). In this case, the operative statutory terms are not delegative; instead, they are inexact in nature. <em>See Karjalainen v. Curtis Johnston &amp; Pennywise, Inc., </em>208 Or App 674, 681, 146 P3d 336 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 473 (2007) (a term is \u201cinexact\u201d where its meaning is \u201cnot so precise as to require no interpretation at all\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Because the operative terms are inexact, we construe ORS 756.500 according to the familiar methodology explained in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). Our role in construing statutes is to ascertain and, if possible, give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the statute. In doing so, we begin by examining the statutory text in context and, then, if the statute remains subject to more than one plausible interpretation, we consider, in turn, the statute\u2019s legislative history and other aids to construction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">We return to the text of the operative statutory provisions. In contending that ORS 756.500 does not authorize complaints against unregulated customers, petitioner invokes subsection (1) of that statute, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">\u201cAny person may file a complaint before the Public Utility Commission, or the commission may, on the commission\u2019s own initiative, file such complaint. <em>The complaint shall be against any person whose business or activities are regulated </em>by some one or more of the statutes, jurisdiction for the enforcement or regulation of which is conferred upon the commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">(Emphasis added.) Petitioner asserts that Roats may not permissibly file its complaint against petitioner because petitioner is not a \u201cperson whose business or activities are regulated\u201d by the PUC.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The PUC and Roats respond that petitioner\u2019s focus on subsection (1) is inapposite \u2014 and, instead, the PUC properly exercised jurisdiction under subsection (5), which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number><em>\u201cNotwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, </em>any public utility * * * may make complaint <em>as to any matter affecting its own rates or service with like effect as though made by any other person, </em>by filing an application, petition or complaint with the commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Whether the PUC properly exercised jurisdiction under ORS 756.500 turns on the proper construction of subsection (5) \u2014 and, particularly, its proper interrelationship with subsection (1). The critical \u2014 indeed, ultimately dispositive \u2014 language in determining that relationship introduces subsection (5): <em>\u201cNotwithstanding subsection (1) of this section </em>* <em>* </em>(Emphasis added.) The function of a \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause is straightforward. It operates to except the remainder of the sentence containing the clause from the provisions of law referenced in the clause. <em>O\u2019Mara v. Douglas County, </em>318 Or 72, 76, 862 P2d 499 (1993). That is, the function of the introductory \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause of subsection (5) is to provide that that subsection is not subject to the terms, and qualifications, of subsection (1). Thus, the limitations of subsection (1) \u2014 particularly including the condition that a complaint be against \u201cany person whose business or activities\u201d are subject to PUC regulation \u2014 do not apply to a complaint filed by a public utility under subsection (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Petitioner contends, nonetheless, that subsection (5) implicitly or indirectly incorporates the limitation in subsection (1) that the \u201ccomplaint shall be against any person whose business or activities are regulated.\u201d In support of that contention, petitioner points to the phrase in subsection (5) that public utilities may make complaint \u201cwith <em>like effect </em>as though made by any other person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Petitioner\u2019s argument, as we understand it, is that, because a complaint pursuant to subsection (1) can yield relief only against a \u201cperson whose business or activities\u201d are subject to PUC regulation, a complaint under subsection (5), to have \u201clike effect,\u201d must be similarly limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">We reject that argument for a variety of reasons. First, it would \u201cbootstrap\u201d into subsection (5) a condition of subsection (1), which would violate the explicit unqualified \u201c[n]otwithstanding subsection (1)\u201d language of subsection (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Second, petitioner\u2019s proposed construction of \u201ceffect\u201d \u2014 a term not defined in ORS 756.500 or contextually related statutes \u2014 does not comport with the common understanding of that term. <em>See State v. Murray, </em>340 Or 599, 604, 136 P3d 10 (2006) (\u201cAbsent a special definition, we ordinarily would resort to dictionary definitions, assuming that the legislature meant to use a word of common usage in its ordinary sense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\">\u201cEffect\u201d is a noun defined as \u201csomething that is produced by an agent or cause : something that follows immediately from an antecedent: a resultant condition : RESULT, OUTCOME * * <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>724 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cLike,\u201d as employed here, means \u201cthe same or nearly the same (as in nature, appearance, or quantity) * * * : equal or nearly equal * * * : CORRESPONDING * * * : IDENTICAL, INDISTINGUISHABLE * * * : SIMILAR * * *.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1310. Thus, the ordinary meaning of the term \u201ceffect\u201d generally relates to the <em>consequence </em>of filing a complaint, including the nature of relief that can be obtained, and not to the identities of the parties. That is, \u201ceffect\u201d pertains to the \u201cwhat\u201d and not the \u201cwho\u201d (or the \u201cwhom\u201d). The <em>identity </em>of the complainant, whether a public utility or any other person, has no bearing on the <em>result </em>or <em>outcome </em>available to the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Third, petitioner\u2019s understanding of the meaning and function of \u201cwith like effect\u201d is contradicted by the historical contextual development of ORS 756.500 and its antecedents. <em>See Krieger v. Just, </em>319 Or 328, 336, 876 P2d 754 (1994) (historical changes in the text of a statute provide context for the interpretation of the version at issue). Most significantly, as described immediately below, subsections (1) and (5) of ORS 756.500, while now coexisting within the same statute, originally derived from different statutes, which the legislature enacted 28 years apart. Further, the two were not included in the same statute until more than 30 years after the enactment of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The historical antecedent of subsection (5) \u2014 containing the phrase \u201cwith like effect\u201d \u2014 originated in 1911:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">\u201cAny public utility may make complaint as to any matter affecting its own product or service <em>with like effect </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>though made by any mercantile, agricultural or manufacturing society, body politic or municipal organization or by any ten persons, firms, corporations or associations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Or Laws 1911, ch 279, \u00a7 46 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">As part of the same statutory scheme, the 1911 legislature enacted the following provision, which provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">\u201cUpon a complaint made against any public utility by any mercantile, agricultural or manufacturing society or by any body politic or municipal organization or by any three persons, firms, corporations or associations * * * the Commission shall proceed, with or without notice, to make such investigation as it may deem necessary or convenient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Or Laws 1911, ch 279, \u00a7 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Thus, when the legislature originally enacted the historical counterpart of ORS 756.500(5), the phrase \u201cwith like effect\u201d operated to give complaints filed <em>by </em>public utilities the same effect as though filed by persons entitled to make complaints <em>against </em>public utilities. That is, complaints filed <em>by </em>public utilities triggered the same investigatory procedure by the PUC as complaints filed <em>against </em>public utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">In 1953, those two provisions of the 1911 legislation were combined into <em>former </em>ORS 757.505 (1953), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1971, ch 655, \u00a7 250. That statute stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">\u201c(1) The commissioner shall, with or without notice, make such investigation as he deems necessary or convenient, upon a complaint made against any public utility by any mercantile, agricultural or manufacturing society, body politic or municipal organization or three other persons * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-11\">\u201c(4) Any public utility may make complaint as to any matter affecting its own product or service <em>with like effect </em>as though made by any society, organization or group listed in subsection (1) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>In <em>former </em>ORS 757.505(4), the legislature directly referred to <em>former </em>ORS 757.505(1), thereby making it clear that the legislature intended to relate the two subsections. Thus, after 1953, the phrase \u201cwith like effect\u201d continued to carry the same meaning \u2014 that complaints made <em>by </em>public utilities were to be given the same <em>\u201ceffect\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., result or outcome \u2014 as though filed by a person entitled to make a complaint <em>against </em>a public utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">In contrast to the historical evolution of the present ORS 756.500(5), the historical antecedent of the present ORS 756.500(1) was not enacted until 1939 and as part of a separate act \u2014 the Uniform Practice Act of the Public Utilities Commissioner. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1939, ch 320, \u00a7 4. That statute stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">\u201cAny person may file a complaint before the commissioner * * *. Such complaint shall be against such person whose business or activities are regulated by some one or more of the acts, jurisdiction for the enforcement or regulation whereof is conferred upon the commissioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">OCLA \u00a7\u00a7 112-4, 114 (1940). That statute was eventually renumbered as <em>former </em>ORS 756.520 (1953), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 756.500 (1971).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Thus, the historical counterparts to present subsection (1) and subsection (5) were separate and distinct statutes until 1971, when the legislature repealed <em>former </em>ORS 757.505, <em>see </em>Or Laws 1971, ch 655, \u00a7 250, and amended <em>former </em>ORS 756.520 by adding, as subsection (5) of that statute, what is now essentially ORS 756.500(5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Or Laws 1971, ch 655, \u00a7 37. The legislature then renumbered the reconfigured <em>former </em>ORS 756.520 as ORS 756.500.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Given that historical context, it is patent that, when the legislature added subsection (5) to <em>former </em>ORS 756.520, it did not intend the \u201cwith like effect\u201d language to incorporate the constraint prescribed in <em>former </em>ORS 756.520(1) that the \u201ccomplaint shall be against any person whose business or activities are regulated.\u201d That is so because the phrase \u201cwith like effect\u201d existed in a separate and distinct statute for 28 years \u2014 from 1911 to 1939 \u2014 before the legislature ever enacted the original antecedent of <em>former </em>ORS 756.520(1). Further, from 1911 until the repeal <em>o\u00ed former </em>ORS 757.505 and the creation of <em>former </em>ORS 756.520(5) in 1971, the phrase \u201cwith like effect\u201d in the historic antecedents of ORS 756.500(5) did not exist within the same statute as the requirement that the \u201ccomplaint shall be against any person whose business or activities are regulated.\u201d Accordingly, when subsection (5) was added to <em>former </em>ORS 756.520 in 1971, its \u201cwith like effect\u201d language continued to carry the same meaning it had for the previous 60 <em>years </em>\u2014 viz., that a complaint filed by a public utility is entitled to the same result or outcome as though filed by a person entitled to file a complaint <em>against </em>a public utility. Nothing more; nothing less.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\">Finally, petitioner\u2019s proposed construction of the phrase \u201cwith like effect\u201d would render subsection (5) superfluous. If the constraints of subsection (1) were imported into subsection (5) \u2014 hmiting public utilities to filing complaints against persons whose business or activities are regulated\u2014 any complaint authorized under subsection (5) would already be authorized pursuant to subsection (1). That is, subsection (5) would have no independent effect because it would merely authorize a subset of complaints already authorized under subsection (1). We reject that construction. <em>See State v. Stamper, </em>197 Or App 413, 418, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005) (\u201cAs a general rule, we assume that the legislature did not intend any portion of its enactments to be meaningless surplusage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In sum, the terms of ORS 756.500(1) \u2014 including the jurisdictional limitation that complaints \u201cshall be against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>any person whose business or activities are regulated\u201d \u2014 do not apply when the PUC exercises jurisdiction over a complaint \u201cas to any matter affecting its own rates or service\u201d filed by a public utility pursuant to ORS 756.500(5). Accordingly, the PUC has jurisdiction with respect to such complaints, including Roats\u2019s complaint in this matter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\"> ORS 756.500 describes, among other matters, the persons entitled to file a complaint under the PUC\u2019s procedures for complaints and investigations. The relevant parts of the statute are set out in detail below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\"> The underlying dispute, pertaining to petitioner\u2019s liability for payment of RDCs, is complicated and convoluted. Because we address only petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error, <em>viz., </em>petitioner\u2019s contention that the PUC lacked jurisdiction to consider Roats\u2019s complaint, we have significantly condensed the factual and procedural history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\"> The PUC is an additional respondent on judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\"> In 1953, <em>former </em>ORS 756.520 provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">\u201cAny person may file a complaint before the commissioner * * *.
