On appeal, defendant asserts various challenges to his convictions. We affirm defendant\u2019s convictions without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Defendant also challenges his sentences on each of the two counts, which the trial court ordered to run consecutively. On appeal, defendant argues, as he did below, that both of the crimes for which he was convicted involved the same photograph of a child. In his view, he should not have received consecutive sentences for downloading and printing the photograph (Count 2) and possessing it (Count 3), where both counts were alleged to have occurred at the same place and time. The state, though not conceding that defendant was sentenced for printing and possessing a single image, concedes that \u201c[t]he statutory basis on which the trial court imposed a consecutive sentence is not particularly clear.\u201d Accordingly, the state submits that \u201cthe court may not have made required findings, [and] this court should remand to the trial court for resentencing.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 137.123. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
