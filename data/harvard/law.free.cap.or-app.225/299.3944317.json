At a joint sentencing hearing on May 15, 2006, defendants and the state requested that the court set a later date for a hearing on the issue of restitution. The court granted the request and held the restitution hearing on October 30,2006. By that time, more than 90 days had elapsed since the entry of their judgments of conviction, and defendants argued that a restitution award was therefore impermissible. <em>See </em>ORS 137.106(l)(b) (providing that \u201cthe specific amount of restitution shall be established by supplemental judgment based upon a determination made by the court within 90 days of entry of the judgment\u201d). The trial court, however, extended the 90-day deadline and imposed restitution by way of amended judgments. <em>See id. </em>(providing that the trial court \u201cmay extend the time within which the determination and supplemental judgment may be completed for good cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On appeal, defendants argue that the trial court erred in extending the deadline and imposing restitution. The state concedes that the record does not support an extension of the deadline for \u201cgood cause.\u201d We agree and accept the concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Amended judgments vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
