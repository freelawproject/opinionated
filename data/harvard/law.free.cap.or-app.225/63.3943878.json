At sentencing, based on its findings relating to the circumstances of the commission of the offenses, the trial court ordered that the sentences on certain convictions be served consecutively to the sentences on the other convictions. <em>See </em>ORS 137.123(2). On appeal, defendant contends, as he did below, that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences on the basis of its own factual findings, as opposed to the jury\u2019s factual findings. The state concedes that, under <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>cert </em>granted, _ US _, 128 S Ct 1657 (2008), the trial court erred and that the case must be remanded for resentencing. We agree that, under <em>Ice, </em>defendant is correct and that the state\u2019s concession is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
