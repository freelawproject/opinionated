J.</author>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Galloway, </em>202 Or App 613, 123 P3d 352, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 201 (2006) <em>(Galloway I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Galloway, </em>345 Or 315, 195 P3d 62 (2008). In <em>Galloway I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on a judicial finding that defendant\u2019s crime had created a serious risk to human life. That factfinding enterprise constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that, under <em>Ramirez, </em>our exercise of discretion in <em>Galloway I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Defendant was convicted of nine counts of attempted aggravated murder; five counts of attempted murder; six counts of first-degree arson; two counts of first-degree burglary; four counts of recklessly endangering another person; and one count of arson in the second degree. Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s imposition of an upward departure sentence on the second-degree arson conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the presumptive sentence for arson in the second degree, 30 days in jail, was insufficient. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">\u201cI\u2019m shaking my head because, given all of this stuff that you\u2019ve just been convicted of under the sentencing guidelines that are supposed to give us truth in sentencing, the presumptive sentence is 30 days in jail. And I\u2019m not imposing that, but that\u2019s absolutely absurd in my mind under those circumstances and the potential risk to other human beings setting a fairly significant fire in the Crook County in the middle of August in one of the driest years in the history of recorded weather.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to impose a dispositional departure sentence of six months. That sentence is to run consecutively to the other sentences. And the basis for the departure sentence is that the presumptive guidelines sentencing is not reflective of the seriousness of the overall criminal episode that concluded with the Arson in the Second Degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-3\">In <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 123, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), we concluded that the imposition of a departure sentence under circumstances similar to this case \u2014 that is, where the defendant stood silent during sentencing but had not explicitly waived his or her rights to a jury trial on at least one of the charged offenses \u2014 constituted \u201cplain error.\u201d Although the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Ramirez </em>on the ground that we did not properly exercise our discretion in determining whether to correct the error, the court did not disturb our conclusion that the error was plain. The state urges us to reconsider that conclusion; however, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The question remains whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case. The state argues that we should decline to exercise our discretion, because there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found that defendant\u2019s crime created a serious risk to human life. <em>Cf. Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (if there is no legitimate debate about the existence of a sentence enhancement fact, the defendant\u2019s interest in a second sentencing hearing is minimal). As explained below, we need not reach that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Fults, </em>where other, unchallenged sentences render the gravity of the sentencing error slight, it is unlikely that a remand would make any practical difference and, thus, we should decline to exercise our discretion to correct an otherwise plain error. 343 Or at 523. This is such a case. Defendant was convicted of 27 crimes, including nine counts of attempted aggravated murder and six counts of attempted murder, and he was sentenced to a total incarceration term of 40 years and six months, the six months being the consecutive departure term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>imposed on the second-degree arson conviction. The trial court imposed consecutive sentences on four of the attempted aggravated murder convictions; defendant does not challenge those sentences. The trial court also ordered 218 months of defendant\u2019s total prison sentences, on Counts 5, 15, 16, and 21, to be served concurrently.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its written judgment, the trial court explained that \u201c[i]t is the Court\u2019s intention that defendant\u2019s total sentence be 40 years and 6 months in the custody of the Department of Corrections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">As we held in <em>State v. Quintero-Martinez, </em>220 Or App 497, 503, 188 P3d 350, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 318 (2008), we will decline to exercise our discretion to correct a sentencing error where \u201cwe are certain that, if we were to remand this case to the trial court, it would correct its error in a manner that leaves intact defendant\u2019s total aggregate sentence.\u201d In light of defendant\u2019s numerous convictions, the unchallenged consecutive sentences imposed by the trial court, and the court\u2019s stated intent to impose a total incarcerative term of 40 years and six months, remanding this case would contravene the judicial system\u2019s interest in avoiding \u201cunnecessary repetitive sentencing proceedings.\u201d <em>Fults, </em>343 Or at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\"> Defendant does not assign error to the trial court\u2019s order that he serve the departure sentence consecutively to his remaining sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\"> The remaining convictions were merged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
