J.</author>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Defendant appeals his conviction for possession of a precursor substance, ORS 475.967, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence. As explained below, we conclude that, under the analysis of <em>State v. Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, 964 P2d 1007 (1998), the trial court correctly denied suppression. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The evidence at the suppression hearing consisted solely of the testimony of Jarred Barney, a patrol officer with the Central Point Police Department. Barney testified that he observed several traffic infractions and then pulled over defendant\u2019s truck. Barney, who noticed that defendant was nervous, informed him that he was not going to ticket him for the traffic infractions, but that he was concerned that defendant might be driving under the influence of intoxicants. Accordingly, Barney asked defendant to step out of the truck and perform field sobriety tests (FSTs). Barney also took defendant\u2019s identification to run a check on him and then returned the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The FSTs took approximately five minutes, after which Barney concluded that defendant had not been driving under the influence. Barney informed defendant that he had passed the FSTs and was free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">After being told that he was free to leave, defendant, according to Barney, \u201cjust stood there and we continued to talk.\u201d Barney asked defendant if he had anything illegal on his person. Defendant replied that he had \u201ca little bit of marijuana in his coat pocket.\u201d Barney asked defendant if he could search defendant and his truck for drugs or drug paraphernalia. Defendant, whom Barney described as \u201cextremely cooperative,\u201d told Barney to go ahead and search. A search of defendant\u2019s coat revealed less than an ounce of marijuana. Barney then called for backup officers, who arrived before the truck was searched. Defendant waited at the curb with his dog while the search of the truck was conducted. That search of the truck led to the discovery of the evidence pertinent to defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Before trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the search. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>argued, based on <em>State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 813 P2d 28 (1991), that, even if reasonable suspicion justified Barney\u2019s detention of defendant throughout the FSTs, that reasonable suspicion had dissipated by the time Barney sought permission to search \u2014 and, thus, the evidence should be suppressed because defendant\u2019s consent occurred in the course of an unlawful stop. At the hearing on the motion, the state, which bore the burden of demonstrating that the warrantless search was lawful, did not argue that there was evidence from which the court could infer that defendant subjectively felt free to leave. Rather, the state argued that defendant\u2019s subjective perception was not dispositive here and that the sole issue before the court was whether a reasonable person could have felt that he was being detained at the time defendant consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress without making specific factual findings. Here, given that the facts are undisputed and that the state did not dispute defendant\u2019s subjective belief, the only question is whether the trial court correctly determined that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position could not have believed that he was being detained at the point when he consented to the search. <em>See generally State v. Ashbaugh, </em>225 Or App 16, 200 P3d 149 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">An encounter between a law enforcement officer and a person is a seizure under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">\u201c(a) if a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricts, interferes with, or otherwise deprives an individual of that individual\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement; or (b) whenever an individual believes that (a), above, has occurred and such belief is objectively reasonable in the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\"><em>Holmes, </em>311 Or at 409-10. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erroneously concluded that a reasonable person in his circumstance could not have believed that he was being detained. In particular, defendant contends that, under the <em>Holmes </em>\u201ctype (b) analysis,\u201d \u201ca reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position could have believed that the officer[ ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>significantly had restricted his liberty or freedom of movement.\u201d <em>Toevs, </em>327 Or at 536. In particular, defendant urges us to apply our reasoning from <em>State v. Hadley, </em>146 Or App 166, 172, 932 P2d 1194 (1997), that a traffic stop continues \u201cuntil the motorist has had a \u2018real time\u2019 opportunity to move on. There must, in other words, be a distinct temporal \u2018break in the action\u2019 between an officer\u2019s indication that a motorist is free to go and any unrelated inquiries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The problem with defendant\u2019s suggestion is that <em>Hadley </em>did not interpret Article I, section 9, or apply the test from <em>Holmes-, </em>the analysis there was purely statutory. Moreover, we later specifically disavowed the test set forth in <em>Hadley </em>in <em>State v. Hallmark, </em>157 Or App 538, 542, 973 P2d 908 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cIn * * * <em>Toevs, </em>327 Or [at] 532, * * * however, the Supreme Court addressed \u2018the proper methodology for determining whether a traffic stop either continued or ended\u2019 under ORS 810.410. The court held that the proper methodology consists of a two-part inquiry: First, did the defendant subjectively believe that he was under continued detention by the police? Second, if so, was the defendant\u2019s subjective belief objectively reasonable? <em>Id. </em>at 535. The first question is one of fact to be determined by the trial court, the second is one subject to the independent assessment of the appellate court. <em>Id. </em>That two-part methodology supersedes the test that we previously described in <em>Hadley </em>* * *.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Thus, the inquiry here, properly framed, is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position could have believed that Barney was restricting his liberty or freedom of movement when they continued to converse after Barney told defendant that he was free to go. Defendant urges that the facts of this case are similar to those in <em>Toevs </em>and that we should, consequently, conclude that he was stopped. Although we agree that there are some similarities to <em>Toevs, </em>there are also several materially distinguishing differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>In <em>Toevs, </em>the defendant was lawfully stopped for a traffic infraction. The two officers on the scene, Smith and Solesbee, obtained the defendant\u2019s identification and determined that he had a valid driver\u2019s license and was on parole. The officers decided not to issue a traffic citation but, because one of the officers had had a previous drug-related encounter with the defendant, they wanted to search the defendant\u2019s vehicle. 327 Or at 528-29. At that point, Smith returned the identification and told the defendant that he was free to leave. However, Smith then immediately asked defendant for consent to search the vehicle and the following colloquy and conduct ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">\u201cDefendant asked Smith if Smith was accusing him of anything. Smith responded that he was not accusing defendant, but wondered why defendant would not consent to a search. Smith then asked if he could search both defendant and defendant\u2019s vehicle, and asked whether there were any drugs in defendant\u2019s vehicle. Defendant responded that he did not have any drugs and, again, did not consent to a search. That conversation, beginning from the time when Smith told defendant that he was free to go, lasted about 30 seconds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">\u201cSolesbee, who had been watching Smith and defendant from his position behind defendant\u2019s vehicle, then approached the driver\u2019s side of defendant\u2019s vehicle and interrupted the conversation between Smith and defendant. Smith stepped back and stopped his questioning. Solesbee asked defendant, in a \u2018low key\u2019 and \u2018friendly<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> manner, \u2018if he had any dope in the vehicle.\u2019 Defendant shielded his eyes, lowered his face, and answered \u2018[n]o.\u2019 At that point, Solesbee observed that defendant \u2018appeared very fidgety, extremely nervous acting, excited in his body movements but not excited in his speech. His pupils were extremely dilated.\u2019 In Solesbee\u2019s training and experience, he believed that defendant might have ingested methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201cSolesbee then stated to defendant that defendant would feel better about the situation if he were honest and told Solesbee that he had drugs in his vehicle, if indeed he did. Solesbee asked defendant again if he had any drugs in the vehicle. Defendant responded that \u2018[t]here is a little in the truck.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The Supreme Court determined that, under the circumstances, the defendant had been stopped. The court particularly relied on the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">\u201cFirst, after telling defendant that he was free to go, Smith immediately asked defendant if he could search the vehicle. He continued to do so, even though defendant did not give consent after the first request. He also asked defendant if defendant possessed any drugs. Second, while Smith was questioning defendant, Solesbee, who had had prior drug-related contact with defendant, was standing outside the patrol vehicle, behind defendant\u2019s vehicle on the driver\u2019s side. When it became apparent that Smith was unable to obtain defendant\u2019s consent to a search, Solesbee also approached defendant and interrupted Smith. Solesbee then asked defendant two more times if he had any drugs in the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 536. The court went on to note that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">\u201cwhen an officer tells a driver that he or she is free to go, that factor certainly can weigh in favor of concluding that a traffic stop indeed had ended. However, our case law demonstrates that, when viewing the totality of the circumstances, an officer\u2019s conduct after stating that a driver is free to go may negate such a statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Thus, the Supreme Court in <em>Toevs </em>considered the lack of a break between telling the defendant he was free to go and the request for consent to be one of the factors that weighed in favor of finding that a stop had occurred. But it also found significant the presence of <em>two </em>officers stationed outside of the defendant\u2019s car, both of whom continued to seek consent to search after the defendant had refused to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Here, we agree with defendant that the lack of a break between when Barney told him he was free to leave and the continuation of the conversation militates in favor of a determination that the encounter here satisfied the objective component of the <em>Holmes </em>\u201ctype (b)\u201d determination. However, the remaining factors listed by the court in <em>Toevs </em>decisively cut against that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Here, unlike in <em>Toevs, </em>where the officers essentially engaged in \u201ctag-team\u201d tactics, <em>id. </em>at 536, Barney was the only officer present at the time that the traffic stop ended. <em>Cf. State v. Brown, </em>209 Or App 699, 149 P3d 294 (2006) (where officer approached vehicle without reasonable suspicion, and several officers gathered around the defendant\u2019s car and made multiple requests to search, court concluded that the defendant was stopped despite the fact that one officer had told him he was free to go). Moreover \u2014 and at least as significantly \u2014 Barney, unlike the officers in <em>Toevs, </em>did not, after the end of the stop, immediately and repeatedly seek consent to search from a motorist who was otherwise in a position to drive away. That is, at the time Barney and defendant continued their conversation, defendant was not in his vehicle. Rather, after Barney told him he was free to leave, defendant \u201cjust stood there\u201d and the two of them \u201ccontinued to talk,\u201d in a conversational, nonconfrontational manner, with Barney ultimately, and successfully, requesting consent to search. Finally, and tellingly, unlike the defendant in <em>Toevs, see </em>327 Or at 536, defendant was not subjected to multiple requests to search, never refused consent, and, when asked, never denied that he had drugs on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">We observe, finally, that Barney did not engage in the sort of physical conduct that we and the Supreme Court have pointed to as unlawfully effecting or extending a traffic stop. <em>See, e.g., State v. Dominguez-Martinez, </em>321 Or 206, 895 P2d 306 (1995) (under statutory analysis, defendant was stopped while officer continued to lean on car door after informing defendant he was free to leave); <em>State v. Wood, </em>188 Or App 89, 69 P3d 1263 (2003) (officer telling a defendant he was free to go after issuance of citation was effectively negated by officer\u2019s physical conduct in preventing him from leaving).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In short, this is not a case in which the \u201cofficer\u2019s conduct after stating that a driver is free to go may negate such a statement.\u201d <em>Toevs, </em>327 Or at 537. Accordingly, we conclude that the circumstances here did not satisfy the objective component of the <em>Holmes </em>\u201ctype (b)\u201d analysis, and that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\"> <em>Toevs, Hadley, </em>and <em>Hallmark, </em>of course, all were statutory cases. <em>Toevs, </em>however, applied the <em>Holmes </em>test to the statutory question. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 16, 115 P3d 908 (2005) (reiterating that test set out <em>in Holmes </em>and <em>Toevs </em>\u201cis substantially the same\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
