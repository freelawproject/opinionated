Stubbs, </em>193 Or App 595, 604, 91 P3d 774 (2004), we explained that ORS 138.050(1) \u201cembodies a jurisdictional limitation on appeal.\u201d That is, unless a defendant makes a colorable showing that the disposition exceeds the maximum allowable by law or is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual, we must dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">In this case, defendant is not challenging his sentence; instead, he appears to be asserting that his conviction should be reversed because his plea was involuntary. That argument is not cognizable under ORS 138.050(1). <em>See, e.g., State v. Zell, </em>89 Or App 394, 749 P2d 1196 (1988) (reaching same result under earlier version of ORS 138.050).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-12\"> Defendant received a deferred sentence pursuant to the plea agreement. The court entered defendant\u2019s conviction after his deferred sentence was revoked.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
