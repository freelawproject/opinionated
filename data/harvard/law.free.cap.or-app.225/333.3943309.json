J.</author>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Strasser, </em>211 Or App 244, 154 P3d 130, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 727 (2007) <em>(Strasser I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Strasser, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 64 (2008). In <em>Strasser I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on a judicial finding that defendant had been persistently involved in similar offenses and was not amenable to probation. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that we improperly exercised our discretion in <em>Strasser I. </em>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Defendant was convicted of two counts of felony assaulting a public safety officer (Counts 1 and 3) and two counts of resisting arrest (Counts 2 and 4). On Count 1, the trial court imposed a departure sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment after finding that defendant had been \u201cpersistently involved\u201d in similar crimes, had a \u201cdeep contempt for legal authority,\u201d and was \u201cnot amenable to probation.\u201d On Count 3, the trial court imposed a 60-month departure sentence, to be served concurrently with the sentence on Count 1, based on the same grounds it relied on in imposing a departure sentence on Count 1. On Counts 2 and 4, the court sentenced defendant to 12-month concurrent prison terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 123, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), we concluded that the imposition of a departure sentence under circumstances similar to the imposition of the departure sentence in this case, that is, where the defendant stood silent during sentencing but had not explicitly waived his or her rights to a jury trial on at least one of the charged offenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>constituted \u201cplain error.\u201d Although the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Ramirez </em>on the ground that we did not properly exercise our discretion in determining whether to correct the error, the court did not disturb our conclusion that the error was plain. The state urges us to reconsider that conclusion; however, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The question remains whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case. The state argues that we should decline to exercise our discretion, because there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found that defendant was not \u201camenable to probation.\u201d <em>Cf. Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (if there is no legitimate debate about the existence of a sentence enhancement fact, the defendant\u2019s interest in a second sentencing hearing is minimal). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In this case, the trial court did not explicitly state that it was relying on the departure factors it found either singly or in combination; we therefore assume that the court did not consider each factor to be independently sufficient to support a departure. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>111 Or App 147, 826 P2d 1010 (1992). Thus, a remand for resentencing may be warranted if either of the factors relied on by the trial court is subject to debate. Here, the trial court relied, in part, on the aggravating factor of defendant\u2019s persistent involvement in similar crimes. We therefore first consider whether there is any legitimate debate concerning whether the jury would have made the same finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007), the Oregon Supreme Court held that \u201c \u00a3[p]ersistent involvement in similar offenses\u2019 presents a factual issue that * * * a defendant may insist that a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201cIn determining whether the record establishes \u2018[plersistent involvement in similar offenses,\u2019 a sentencing court must do more than find that a defendant has two or more prior convictions for similar offenses. The trier of fact must infer from the number and frequency of those prior convictions whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in those offenses is \u2018persistent\u2019; that is, the trier of fact must determine whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>offenses is sufficiently continuous or recurring to say that it is \u2018persistent.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><em>Id. </em>There is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found the departure factor where evidence in support of that factor was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d <em>Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513-14. Thus, to eliminate any legitimate debate that a defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses, the evidence must establish not only that the defendant had two or more similar prior convictions, it must also support \u2014 indeed, to be \u201coverwhelming\u201d it must <em>require </em>\u2014 the inference that the defendant\u2019s involvement was sufficiently continuous or recurring to say that it was \u201cpersistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">On this record, we conclude that a jury would readily draw that inference. In pronouncing sentence, the trial court explained that it relied on</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">\u201cthe representation of the District Attorney that you, your criminal history classifies you as an A based on prior convictions for manslaughter, hit and run involving an injured person, and two separate resisting arrest convictions, that would be two person felonies and two person misdemeanors equaling for guidelines purposes, three person felonies making you an A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">\u201cI do think it is an aggravating factor that you have been persistently involved in similar type conduct unrelated to this * * * and the numerous convictions I see here for harassment, disorderly conduct, failure to appear, contempt, and other matters that just show a general and pervasive contempt for legal authority * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The evidence at sentencing established that defendant had multiple prior convictions for similar offenses; indeed, he had two prior convictions for the <em>same </em>offense \u2014 resisting arrest\u2014 that he was convicted of in this case. Defendant also had two prior convictions for person felonies and \u201cnumerous convictions\u201d for harassment and disorderly conduct. It is difficult to imagine that a jury would not have found, by virtue of the number and frequency of defendant\u2019s prior convictions, that he had been persistently involved in similar offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Because the trial court did not specify that each departure factor was individually sufficient to support the imposition of a departure sentence, we also must determine whether there is a \u201clegitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found defendant to \u201cnot be amenable to probation.\u201d As the trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">\u201cWeighing those, weighing your, and I was interested and I did take note of the statements of the individual from the Corrections Department. It is clear that you are not amenable to probation. That you are not a good candidate for probation. There is nothing really nothing that probation has to offer you * * *, in any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">\u201cThat you are extremely unlikely to cooperate with any sort of program. I think you are in deep need of programs, but I think that you are unlikely and unwilling to cooperate with any of those as you were unwilling to even participate in your trial the other day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">At sentencing, a probation officer testified that defendant had failed to comply with the conditions of his probation and that he had actively interfered with his probation officers. The officer stated that, \u201cit is our office recommendation to the court that [defendant] is not an appropriate candidate for supervision due to the ongoing lengthy history of just total absolute noncompliance and just the constant challenge of every piece of authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">That evidence was uncontroverted and, in our view, was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d Thus, we conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found that defendant was not amenable to probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">For the above reasons, defendant\u2019s interest in a second sentencing hearing is minimal. In contrast, the judicial system\u2019s interest in avoiding \u201cunnecessary, repetitive, sentencing proceedings\u201d weighs against the exercise of our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error. <em>Fults, </em>343 Or at 523. We therefore decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
