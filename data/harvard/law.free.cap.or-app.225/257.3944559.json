J.</author>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Plaintiffs (collectively, Zidell) and defendants (collectively, London) petition this court to reconsider its decision in this case. <em>ZRZ Realty v. Beneficial Fire and Casualty </em>Ins., 222 Or App 453, 194 P3d 167 (2008). We deny Zidell\u2019s petition without discussion, but allow London\u2019s petition in order to modify two aspects of our original decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Our decision in this case resolved, among other assignments of error, London\u2019s contention that the trial court should have granted its motion to dismiss Zidell\u2019s claims under ORCP 54 B(2) because Zidell\u2019s acts were, as a matter of law, expected or intended. We rejected London\u2019s argument in that regard for two reasons. First, as we explained with respect to one of London\u2019s other assignments of error, 222 Or App at 476, the trial court had erroneously allocated the burden of proof to London on the question whether the harm was expected or intended; \u201c[f]or that reason alone,\u201d we held, \u201cit would be improper to conclude on appeal that the trial court should have granted a motion regarding Zidell\u2019s failure to make the wrong <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478. Nonetheless, we then went on to state, \u201cIn any event, we disagree with London\u2019s argument that the trial court was required, on the record before it, to conclude that the damage for which Zidell sought coverage was, as a matter of law, expected or intended.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In its petition for reconsideration, London submits that this court\u2019s analysis of whether the harm was expected <em>or </em>intended \u201carguably conflates those two separate inquiries.\u201d London acknowledges that, as a result of the court\u2019s independent basis for rejecting the assignment of error (different allocation of the burden of proof), the court may well adhere to its previous decision; \u201c[r]egardless, London is concerned that statements made by the Court after reaching the foregoing conclusion may lend themselves to further \u2018wrangling\u2019 on remand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Given our alternative and independent reason for rejecting London\u2019s assignment of error regarding its ORCP 54 B motion, and in the interest of avoiding any confusion on remand, we agree with London that our subsequent discussion of the evidence in the record was unnecessary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>should be deleted. Accordingly, we modify our original opinion to delete the discussion of London\u2019s second assignment of error that begins with the sentence, \u201cIn any event, we disagree with London\u2019s argument that the trial court was required, on the record before it, to conclude that the damage for which Zidell sought coverage was, as a matter of law, expected or intended.\u201d 222 Or App at 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">London also petitions this court to reconsider its rejection of London\u2019s fourth assignment of error, which challenged the trial court\u2019s conclusion that two \u201cbumbershoot\u201d policies provide coverage for losses that Zidell expected but did not intend. Initially, we agreed with London that the bumbershoot policies are marine insurance policies and are therefore governed by established, controlling federal law. 222 Or App at 481. We were not persuaded, however, that a controlling federal rule excludes marine insurance coverage for expected but unintended losses. Our conclusion relied, in part, on the court\u2019s discussion of marine insurance coverage in <em>Youell v. Exxon Corp., </em>48 F3d 105, 110 (2nd Cir 1995), <em>vac\u2019d on other grounds, </em>516 US 801, 116 S Ct 43, 133 L Ed 2d 9 (1995), <em>adh\u2019d to on remand, </em>74 F3d 373 (2nd Cir 1996), <em>cert den, </em>517 US 1251 (1996). We explained that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">\u201cquestion presented to us \u2014 whether a principle of admiralty law precludes recovery for expected but unintended loss \u2014 strikes us as substantively similar to the issue of first impression identified but not decided in <em>Youell. </em>Expected but unintended losses are akin to recklessly caused losses; the insured expects that some loss is <em>highly probable to result from his or her intentional conduct, but the insured proceeds to act in the face of that expectation of harm. </em>For that reason, we conclude that there is no established and controlling rule of admiralty law that excludes marine insurance coverage for expected but unintended damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">222 Or App at 483 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In its petition for reconsideration, London argues that our analysis did not take into account the trial court\u2019s definition of \u201cexpected\u201d damage, which neither London nor Zidell challenged on appeal. Before trial, in deciding Zidell\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u201cA person <em>intends </em>a result when they act for the purpose of accomplishing that result. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">\u201cA person <em>expects </em>a result if they act with awareness that the result is substantially certain to follow. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">(Emphasis and boldface in original.) This court\u2019s understanding of <em>Youell, </em>London contends, \u201cdoes not account for the trial court\u2019s determination of what constitutes an \u2018expected\u2019 loss in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">London is correct in that regard; our opinion did not account for the trial court\u2019s definition of the term \u201cexpected.\u201d As we observed in our original opinion, <em>Youell </em>explained the concept of recklessness as falling \u201csomewhere \u201cbetween intent to do harm, which * * * <em>includes proceeding with knowledge that the harm is substantially certain to occur, </em>and the mere unreasonable risk of harm to another involved in ordinary negligence.\u2019 \u201d 222 Or App at 483 (quoting <em>Youell, </em>48 F3d at 111) (emphasis added). That description, London points out in its petition for reconsideration, comports with Prosser\u2019s explanation of \u201cintent\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u201cThe three most basic elements of this most common usage of \u2018intent\u2019 are that (1) it is a state of mind (2) about consequences of an act (or omission) and not about the act itself, and (3) it extends not only to having in the mind a purpose (or desire) to bring about given consequences <em>but also to having in mind a belief (or knowledge) that given consequences are substantially certain to result from the act.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">W. Page Keeton, <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 34, at 212 (5th ed 1984). Thus, London argues, \u201cProsser\u2019s (and <em>Youell\u2019s) </em>\u2018extended\u2019 understanding of \u2018intent\u2019 is plainly the trial court\u2019s \u2018intended <em>and </em>expected\u2019: an \u2018intended\u2019 act, the trial court held, is a purposeful act, while an \u2018expected\u2019 act is one done \u2018with awareness that the result is substantially certain to follow.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis by London.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">We agree with London that the trial court\u2019s definition of the term \u201cexpected\u201d appears to refer to one of the commonly understood permutations of \u201cintent\u201d \u2014 -that is, an act undertaken with knowledge that the result is substantially certain to occur. That is not how we meant to use the term \u201cexpected\u201d in our discussion of London\u2019s fourth assignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>error. Rather, we used the term \u201cexpected\u201d to mean something <em>less than </em>the commonly understood definition of \u201cintent\u201d \u2014 that is, we understood \u201cexpected\u201d to refer to a degree of awareness <em>less than a </em>\u201csubstantial certainty\u201d that damage would occur. 222 Or App at 483 (using the phrase \u201chighly probable\u201d rather than \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d in describing expected harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">With that clarification, we adhere to our previous discussion of the applicable federal law, but, in light of the trial court\u2019s definitions of \u201cexpects\u201d and \u201cintends,\u201d withdraw our conclusion regarding the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding the bumbershoots. Rather, we express no opinion on that issue, and, to the extent that the issue arises on remand, nothing in this opinion is intended to preclude London or Zidell from arguing about the legal effect of the trial court\u2019s earlier definition of \u201cexpects\u201d or \u201cintends,\u201d or to preclude London from arguing that, in light of those definitions, the bumbershoots do not cover damages that Zidell knew were \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Respondents - cross-appellants\u2019 petition for reconsideration denied. Appellants - cross-respondents\u2019 petition for reconsideration allowed; opinion modified and adhered to as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
