J.</author>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Lennon, </em>204 Or App 111, 129 P3d 209, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 359 (2006) <em>(Lennon I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Lennon, </em>345 Or 315, 195 P3d 63 (2008). In <em>Lennon I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on a judicial finding that \u201cwe\u2019ve got prior incarcerations, probations, paroles, sanctions haven\u2019t worked.\u201d That factfinding enterprise constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that we correctly exercised our discretion in <em>Lennon I. </em>Accordingly, we again remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Defendant was convicted of delivery of a substantial quantity of controlled substances, and the trial court imposed a departure sentence of 80 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, the court engaged defendant in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: I\u2019ve got two kids out there. One\u2019s seven and one\u2019s eight. I\u2019d sure like to be able to say that I could watch some of the things growing up, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Frankly, sir, based upon your record I don\u2019t want you to have a damn thing to do with your kids. Eighty months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">As noted, the trial court explained that it had decided to impose a departure sentence because \u201cwe\u2019ve got prior incarcerations, probations, paroles, sanctions haven\u2019t worked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">In <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 123, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), we concluded that the imposition of a departure sentence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>circumstances similar to the imposition of the departure sentence in this case, that is, where the defendant stood silent during sentencing but had not explicitly waived his or her rights to a jury trial on at least one of the charged offenses, constituted \u201cplain error.\u201d Although the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Ramirez </em>on the ground that we did not properly exercise our discretion in determining whether to correct the error, the court did not disturb our conclusion that the error was plain. The state urges us to reconsider that conclusion; however, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The question remains whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case. The state argues that we should decline to exercise our discretion, because \u201cno reasonable factfinder could have found\u201d anything but that defendant had failed to be deterred by his prior incarcerations. Thus, the state asserts, \u201cthere can be no legitimate debate that a jury would have found the same fact found by the trial court.\u201d <em>Cf. Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (if there is no legitimate debate about the existence of a sentence enhancement fact, the defendant\u2019s interest in a second sentencing hearing is minimal). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In this case, the trial court did not explicitly state whether it was relying on the departure factors that it found singly or in combination. We therefore assume that the court did not consider each factor to be independently sufficient to support a departure. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>111 Or App 147, 826 P2d 1010 (1992). Thus, a remand for resentencing may be warranted if either of the factors that the court relied on is subject to debate. Here, the trial court relied, in part, on the aggravating factor of defendant\u2019s \u201cprior incarcerations, probations, paroles, sanctions haven\u2019t worked.\u201d As explained below, the court erred in doing so, and we exercise our discretion to correct that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In <em>State v. Allen, </em>198 Or App 392, 396, 108 P3d 651, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>202 Or App 565, 123 P3d 331 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 46 (2006), we held that an upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status \u201crequires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [supervisory] status to serve as an effective deterrent\u201d and that, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>defendant did not admit those further facts, he \u201cwas entitled to have a jury determine whether those inferences were appropriate to draw by a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d As we explained in <em>State v. Burns, </em>213 Or App 38, 47, 159 P3d 1208 (2007), <em>rev dismissed as improvidently allowed, </em>345 Or 302 (2008), \u201cIn <em>Allen, </em>we concluded that whether a defendant was on parole at the time of an offense, whether the defendant\u2019s character is malevolent, and whether parole failed to serve as an effective deterrent are <em>factual </em>issues and, as such, are subject to the Sixth Amendment.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We have applied the same reasoning to the departure factor of a defendant\u2019s failure to be deterred by prior probations or incarcerations, explaining that \u201cconsistently with the reasoning in <em>Allen, </em>a finding that previous probations did not deter a defendant also encompasses facts and inferences about a defendant\u2019s qualities and circumstances that are subject to the jury trial right.\u201d <em>Markwood v. Renard, </em>203 Or App 145, 150, 125 P3d 39 (2005). <em>See also State v. Ross, </em>205 Or App 477, 479-80, 134 P3d 1106 (2006) (remanding for resentencing where departure sentence was based, in part, on failure of prior probations and incarcerations to deter defendant); <em>State v. Frazey, </em>203 Or App 122, 123, 125 P3d 31 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 117 (2006) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Because a finding that a defendant has not been deterred by prior probations or incarcerations depends on inferences about the defendant\u2019s personal characteristics and circumstances that are subject to the jury trial right, it is plain error for a court to impose a departure sentence on that ground without submitting the determination to the jury. Accordingly, unless we can say that there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that the jury would have found that departure fact had the inquiry been before it, remand for resentencing is required. <em>Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513. There is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d where \u201cthe evidence on the sentencing factor is overwhelming[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We conclude that it is legitimately debatable whether a jury would have found that defendant was undeterred by his prior incarcerations. Defendant did not admit to his criminal history or to having been undeterred, and the evidence presented by the state in support of that departure factor was limited. At sentencing, the state adduced evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>of defendant\u2019s prior convictions and also argued that the inclusion of defendant\u2019s convictions for harassment in the presentence investigation report, although not \u201ccounted for purposes of criminal history score as adult, nonperson, class A misdemeanors * * * g[a]ve the court a more accurate depiction of the extent of the defendant\u2019s criminal history.\u201d The prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">\u201c[Biased on the five prior person misdemeanor convictions that the defendant is a B, and the presumptive sentence is 35 to 40 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">:{s H* \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201cThe bottom line is you look only at [defendant\u2019s] criminal history and he is antisocial. Every time that he has been incarcerated, every time he has been given the benefit of probation he has proven to the court his inability to comply. When I look at these sentences, the majority of them, if they were probations, ended in revocation. And then obviously courts just later began sentencing him strictly to sentences of incarceration, being periods of months in jail, or even incarcerated in prison.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Although defendant did not object to that characterization of his criminal history, he also did not admit that he had been undeterred by his prior incarcerations or probations. Indeed, defendant argued that he was entitled to receive the same sentences that the court imposed on his codefendants, who were sentenced to 28 and 32 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. The state countered \u201cthat neither of those two defendants, and although their criminal history was extensive, neither one had the criminal history that was nearly as extensive as [defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">On this record, we cannot say that the evidence pertaining to the sentencing factor was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d As we explained in <em>Allen, </em>the determination of whether a defendant had been undeterred by prior sanctions involves more than merely recounting the defendant\u2019s criminal history. There also must be evidence that is sufficient to allow a factfinder to draw an inference about \u201cthe malevolent quality of the offender,\u201d and the failure of probation to serve as an effective deterrent. <em>Allen, </em>198 Or App at 396. Here, although the state presented evidence of defendant\u2019s prior convictions, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>nothing in the record \u2014 apart from the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that \u201c[w]hen I look at these sentences, the majority of them, if they were probations, ended in revocation\u201d \u2014 regarding defendant\u2019s performance while he was on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">As the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Ramirez, </em>in order to conclude that there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that the jury would have found the departure factor relied on by the sentencing court, we must be able to say that \u201con this record, no reasonable factfinder * * * could conclude anything other\u201d than that the evidence established that factor. 343 Or at 513. As amplified by our decisions in <em>Burns </em>and <em>Allen, </em>that standard requires evidence that is so overwhelming as to require both an inference about the malevolent quality of the defendant <em>and </em>an inference about the failure of probation to serve as an effective deterrent. The evidence in the record here\u2014 which consists merely of defendant\u2019s criminal history and the state\u2019s characterization of defendant\u2019s performance while on probation \u2014 does not satisfy that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Finally, the gravity of the error in this case is not trivial. <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. The presumptive sentence for defendant\u2019s conviction was 35 to 40 months\u2019 imprisonment. The 80-month departure sentence that the court imposed thus doubled defendant\u2019s term of incarceration. Accordingly, this is not a case where we should decline to exercise our discretion because other, unchallenged sentences outweigh the seriousness of the challenged sentence. <em>Cf. State v. Fults, </em>219 Or App 305, 309, 182 P3d 267 (2008) (in light of other, unchallenged sentences, the gravity of the sentencing error was slight and it was unlikely that a remand would make any practical difference; court therefore declined to exercise its discretion to correct the error). We therefore exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
