He assigns error to the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a traffic stop, during which a police officer asked defendant about the presence of weapons without reasonable suspicion that defendant possessed such weapons. According to defendant, because the officer did not ask the question during an unavoidable lull in the stop or while writing a citation, the officer\u2019s questioning was unlawful. Because the questioning was unlawful, defendant contends, the evidence that resulted from his answers should have been suppressed. The state agrees that, under this court\u2019s decisions in <em>State v. Kirkeby, </em>220 Or App 177, 185 P3d 510, <em>rev allowed, </em>345 Or 301 (2008), and <em>State v. Rodgers, </em>219 Or App 366, 182 P3d 209, <em>rev allowed, </em>345 Or 301 (2008), the trial court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. We agree that <em>Rodgers </em>and <em>Kirkeby </em>are controlling and that, under those decisions, the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
