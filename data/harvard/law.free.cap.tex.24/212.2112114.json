D. C. Henderson.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b212-5\">A decree enforcing the vendor\u2019s lien is without foundation, when the verdict does not ascertain that the note sued on was given in payment of the purchase-money for the land, upon which the lien is sought to be enforced.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aqd\">Where the defendant answers by a general denial, and failure of consideration from defect of title to the land for which the note sued on was given, and against which the plaintiff is seeking to assert his vendor\u2019s lien, if the verdict be only for the amount of money due, it will not sustain a decree to enforce the vendor\u2019s lien.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b212-6\">The verdict and judgment cannot be corrected, by the note sued on, and other papers in the cause.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-7\">Error from Tarrant. Tried below before the Hon. Hat. M. Burford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-8\">This was a suit by D. C. Henderson against John McConkey, on a promissory note, and to enforce the vendor\u2019s lien on three tracts of land described in the petition, in payment of the purchase-money of which, it was alleged in the petition, the note was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-9\">The defendant below answered by a general denial, and a failure of title to the land, in part payment of which he alleged the note to have been given; and from the bond for title attached as an exhibit to his answer, the land in payment for which the defendant alleged in this answer that the note was given, appeared to be the same as that upon which the plaintiff below asked the enforcement of his lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-10\">Upon the trial, the jury gave the following verdict, to wit: \u201cWe, the jury, find for the plaintiff $1650 principal, and $25.7 0 interest.\u201d Whereupon, the court gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant for \u201c the sum of <em>sixteen hundred and fifty principal, and </em>$25.70 <em>interest.\u201d </em>And also, \u201cit further appearing,\u201d as recorded in the entry, \u201cto the satisfaction of the court, from the note specially sued on, that said sum of money is due for the purchase of three certain tracts of land,\u201d decreed that the said lands (describing them) should be sold to satisfy the judgment, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The defendant, on the 17th of February, gave bond, and filed his petition for a writ of error, and assigned, (among others not necessary to be stated,) as grounds of error: 3d. That the judgment is erroneous and void, not showing whether it is for dollars or cents. 4th. That the decree for the sale of the land was entirely without the finding of the jury, of facts sufficient or necessary to give a vendor\u2019s lien upon it for the payment of the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-4\">Subsequently, on the 9th of June, 1859, on motion of counsel for the plaintiff below, the court being satisfied, as stated in the entry, \u201c from an inspection of the verdict, and the note upon which the suit was instituted, that there was an error and miscalculation, in this, that the said verdict and judgment in said cause, instead of being for <em>sixteen hundred and fifty principal, </em>and \u00a725.70 interest, should have been for $1726.49 principal, and $101.27 interest,\u201d it was ordered, that the judgment should be corrected and rendered for the latter amount.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-5\"><em>Ferris \u00a3 Nicholson, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-6\"><em>A. Y. Fowler, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOb\">It is, no doubt, the proper practice in cases where implied liens are sought to be enforced, to have a special verdict of the jury finding the facts, when those facts are put in issue. But in this case, the parties were not at issue upon those facts; they were alleged by the plaintiff, and admitted by the defendant, in his answer. A verdict is a finding of the truth of the matters at issue between the parties. An issue is a matter averred by one party, and denied by the other, and a verdict, without an issue being first formed, is needless; and a nullity. In the case of Harrell v. Babb, 19 Texas Rep. 148, this court said: \u201c That general verdicts for the parties frequently are good; they may be rendered certain, by applying them to the facts as averred in the pleadings.\u201d Admissions in pleadings are always held to conclude the party making them. (Story, Eq. Plead. \u00a7 264. See also O. &amp; W. Dig. Laws Texas, \u00a7\u00a7 492, 494, and authorities there referred to.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>As to the authority and propriety of the District Court, in making the amendment to the judgment, see Hart. Dig., Art. 786; O. &amp; W. Dig., Art. 507; Sayles\u2019 Prac. \u00a7\u00a7 576, 591, 755; Swift v. Faris, 11 Texas Rep. 18; Goss v. McClaren, 17 Id. 107. The same might have been done by the Supreme Court. (McNairy v. Castleberry, 6 Id. 286.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b214-4\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVK\">A judgment in a court of record, must be founded on sufficient facts, legally ascertained. The. verdict omits a material part of the facts which are necessary to sustain the judgment, to wit, that the note sued on was given in payment of the purchase-money of the land described in the petition. Without such finding, the decree of. the court enforcing the vendor\u2019s lien is without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The error of the court, in amending the verdict and judgment, by the note and other papers in the cause, though manifest, is not assigned as error, and, therefore, is not subject to revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">For the insufficiency of _ the verdict to sustain the decree enforcing the vendor\u2019s lien, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
