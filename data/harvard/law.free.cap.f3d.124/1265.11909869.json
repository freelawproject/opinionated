On appeal, Nichols raises four issues: whether the district court erred in accepting his guilty plea, whether this sentence was improperly enhanced, whether the district court erred in sentencing him to consecutive terms of imprisonment, and whether \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional. We reject these claims and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-24\">Although the issue of whether a district court must advise a defendant during a guilty plea of his right to testify is one of first impression in this circuit, it appears that Nichols\u2019 rights were protected. The district court complied with the dictates of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(e)(3). It advised Nichols that he had the right \u201cto a trial by jury ... to compel the attendance of witnesses, and to have those witnesses present to testify in your behalf at any trial\u201d and that, by pleading guilty, he waived \u201cany defense whatsoever\u201d that he might have. These questions logically advised Nichols that, by pleading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>guilty, he could not testify in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">Because Nichols possessed the firearm during escape status, and admitted that he possessed it to facilitate living in the wild during his escape, the district court\u2019s determination that he possessed a firearm in connection with his escape was not clearly erroneous. It also appears that the district court did not plainly <em>err </em>in determining that Nichols merited consecutive sentences for his crimes as the record reflects that the court considered the appropriate factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">Finally, Title 18 \u00a7 922(g)(1) makes it illegal for a felon to \u201cpossess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\u201d Although the issue of whether the statute is unconstitutional because the term \u201ccommerce\u201d is not defined as \u201cinterstate or foreign commerce\u201d is one of first impression in this circuit, the Supreme Court has held that the phrase \u201cin or affecting commerce\u201d indicates a Congressional intent to assert its full Commerce Clause power.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, this court has held that \u201c \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause----\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">Nichols\u2019 conviction and sentence are, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1354-15\">. <em>Scarborough v.
