Boyce Garner and his wife as part of an Army child-care program. One day while Ms. Garner left the home to go shopping, Sgt. Garner placed Megan in a bathtub filled with hot water. When Megan attempted to get out of the bathtub, Sgt. Gamer struck her and held her in the water. Megan sustained serious burns as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">Sgt. Garner was convicted of criminal child abuse in connection with the incident. Megan and her mother, Deborah Lynn Lee, first sued the Garners in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, where they obtained a default judgment. The Lees then brought suit against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims seeking damages for breach of an insurance contract relating to the rendering of child care services. The Court of Federal Claims granted summary judgment in favor of the government. We agree with the Court of Federal Claims that the United States did not breach a contract that would entitle the Lees to recover against the United States for their injuries, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b973-18\">At the time of the incident giving rise to this case, Deborah Lee was enlisted in the United States Army and was stationed at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland where she was receiving training in vehicle mechanics. To accommodate her training schedule, she enrolled her daughter in the Family Child Care (\u201cFCC\u201d) program offered to base personnel. Through the program, Deborah Lee selected Marilyn Garner, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>wife of Sgt. Garner, as her daughter\u2019s child care provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">As part of the FCC certification process, Marilyn Garner submitted an application to Aberdeen\u2019s Child Development Services, which obtained a background clearance for both Sgt. and Marilyn Garner. Ms. Garner executed a document entitled \u201cStatement of Understanding Regarding Home-Based Child Care Insurance Coverage Under The U.S. Army Nonappropriated Fund Risk Management Program.\u201d The Statement of Understanding provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-6\">D. I understand ... that as a certified FCC provider I am automatically insured under the U.S. Army Nonappropriated Fund Risk Management Program (RIMP)____ Although FCC providers are not nonappropriated fund employees, insurance coverage is provided and paid for by the Army to cover FCC providers for their own protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-9\">E. I understand that I am insured under RIMP for up to $500,000 for any individual claim arising out of the death or injury of any child under my care which occurs as a result of a negligent act or omission on my part, or on the part of any member of my household.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-10\">F. I understand that I am not insured for any injury or death to children under my care arising out of any criminal act or omission, or, as a result of any otherwise intentional tort or intentional violation of applicable laws or regulations (e.g. assault, battery, indecent assault, rape, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit) on my part or the part of a member of my household---- I understand that legal representation, if it is provided, will be provided solely to protect the interests of the insurance fund. I understand that I may retain private counsel at my own expense anytime I feel it advisable in order to protect my own interest (e.g., when my actions may be outside the scope of RIMP coverage, when my own interests are in conflict with those interests being represented by the U.S. Attorney or by private counsel retained to represent the interest of the insurance fund.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">After Ms. Garner was certified to serve as an FCC provider, she began to provide care for Megan Lee at her home under the program. On April 12, 1989, approximately one month after Ms. Garner began to care for Megan, Ms. Garner left her home to go to the grocery store. She left Megan and her own daughter in the care of Sgt. Garner, who was not a certified FCC provider. Sgt. Garner told his wife that he would bathe Megan and their daughter while Ms. Garner went to the store. During Ms. Garner\u2019s absence, Sgt. Garner engaged in the conduct that led to Megan\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-15\">On April 9, 1990, Megan and her mother filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland seeking damages from the Garners for injuries arising out of the bathtub incident. The Lees did not bring a claim against the United States at that time. Through counsel, the Garners informed the United States Army of the district court action and asserted that the RIMP was responsible for providing insurance coverage and defending the Garners in that action. The Army\u2019s representatives denied the Garners\u2019 requests for coverage and representation, contending that \u201cthe Army is not liable for injuries which resulted from criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-16\">The Garners failed to defend the district court action, and the court accordingly entered a default judgment on the Lees\u2019 complaint. The Lees were awarded a judgment against the Garners for more than $700,000. The Garners subsequently assigned to the Lees their rights against the government under the insurance agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-17\">The Lees then filed a complaint against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims seeking to recover damages from the RIMP. The government first responded that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the complaint because the RIMP was a nonappropriated fund instrumentality (\u201cNAFI\u201d) and that the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity with respect to claims that arise under contracts with NAFIs such as the RIMP. The court held that the United States was not immune from suit on that ground and therefore denied the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>ment\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment. At the outset, the court concluded that a contractual relationship existed between Ms. Garner and the United States. The court found that the government had undertaken \u201cto insure the FCC child care provider, and in return the provider agreed to comply with the FCC certification process.\u201d The court also held that the Lees were third party beneficiaries of the contract and thus were entitled to enforce the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">On the merits, the court held that the Statement of Understanding and the RIMP regulations excluded coverage for claims arising out of criminal acts, such as Sgt. Garner\u2019s treatment of Megan. With respect to the claim that Ms. Garner was negligent for leaving Megan in Sgt. Garner\u2019s care, the court held that Sgt. Gamer\u2019s criminal act was \u201can intervening event\u201d that caused the injury, \u201cthereby superseding [any] original negligence.\u201d The court further held that, even if Sgt. Garner\u2019s criminal act was a \u201cconcurrent\u201d rather than \u201csuperseding cause\u201d of Megan\u2019s injuries, the plain language of the Statement of Understanding and the RIMP regulations excluded coverage because the injuries arose, at least in part, from a criminal act. The court therefore granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">We first address the government\u2019s argument that the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over the Lees\u2019 claim, because the complaint is based on a contract with a NAFI as to which there has been no waiver of sovereign immunity. The Court of Federal Claims rejected the government\u2019s jurisdictional challenge, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, generally limits the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims to cases in which the court\u2019s judgments could be paid from appropriated funds. <em>United States v. General Elec. Corp., </em>727 F.2d 1567, 1570 (Fed.Cir.1984). With a few specific exceptions, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1), disputes arising from contracts entered into by a federal instrumentality fall outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims if \u201cCongress intended that the activity resulting in the claim was not to receive or be funded from appropriated funds.\u201d <em>L\u2019Enfant Plaza Properties, Inc. v. United States, </em>229 Ct.Cl. 278, 668 F.2d 1211, 1212 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">The RIMP provides a form of insurance coverage to protect the assets of NAFIs against administrative claims arising out of NAFI activities. As of 1985, the Army implemented a plan to add liability coverage under the RIMP for quarters-based FCC providers, such as Ms. Garner. The Army Central Insurance Fund (\u201cACIF\u201d) is itself a NAFI that receives and disburses funds of the RIMP. Specifically, the ACIF maintains a RIMP claim fund for FCC program providers, which is used to pay claims against FCC providers adjudicated in accordance with Army regulations. <em>See </em>Army Reg. 215-1, ch. 13, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">On November 29, 1989, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, Pub.L. No. 101-189, Congress enacted the Military Child Care Act of 1989, 103 Stat. 1352, 1590. That Act authorized the Department of Defense to use appropriated funds \u201cfor operating expenses for military child care development centers,\u201d \u201cfor child care and child-related services of the Department,\u201d and \u201cto provide assistance to family home day care providers so that family home day care services can be provided to members of the Armed Forces at a cost comparable to the cost of services provided by military child development centers.\u201d 103 Stat. at 1590, 1595. The Department of Defense has interpreted that Act and subsequent legislation providing funding for military child care programs to allow the use of appropriated funds to pay child-care provider RIMP fees in the FCC program, which in turn are used to pay FCC claims. Accordingly, payments made to satisfy FCC claims may now derive, at least in part, from appropriated funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">The government acknowledges that if an agency is authorized to use both appropriated and nonappropriated funds to support its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>activities, the NAFI doctrine precluding Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction does not apply. The government argues, however, that the RIMP was not authorized to spend appropriated funds until the enactment of the Military Child Care Act in late 1989, and that appropriated funds could not be used to pay the claim in this case, which arose out of conduct that occurred in April 1989. Specifically, the government asserts that in view of the \u201cbona fide needs\u201d rule, <em>see </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1502, any liability arising from an FCC insurance agreement may not be discharged with funds appropriated in a fiscal year other than the fiscal year in which the agreement was entered into and performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The \u201cbona fide needs\u201d rule stands for the proposition that appropriations for a particular year are to be obligated by an agency only to meet legitimate needs arising in the year of appropriation. <em>See </em>United States General Accounting Office, Office of General Counsel, <em>Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, </em>OGC-91-5, Yol. I, at 5-9 to 5-13 (1991). The rule is intended to \u201cprevent agencies which do not have funds on hand for a particular purpose from committing the Government to make payments at some future time and thereby, in effect, coercing the Congress into making an appropriation to cover the commitment.\u201d 63 Comp. Gen. 129, 130-31 (1983). That rule, however, has no place in the context of judgments entered by the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Once a claim for contract damages takes the form of a final judgment in the Court of Federal Claims, the judgment is paid by the United States, normally from the permanent, indefinite congressional appropriation known as the \u201cjudgment fund.\u201d <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304; <em>see also Lopez v. AC. &amp; S, Inc., </em>858 F.2d 712, 716 (Fed.Cir.1988); 63 Comp. Gen. 470, 472-73 (1984). Under section 612(c) of the Contract Disputes Act, \u201cthe agency whose appropriations were used for the contract\u201d must reimburse the judgment fund either out of available funds or by obtaining additional appropriations to cover the reimbursement expense. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 612(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">The reimbursement of the permanent judgment appropriation required by section 612(c) must be made \u201cfrom funds otherwise available for ongoing programs, i.e., current funds.\u201d 63 Comp. Gen. 308, 311 (1984). As explained in the Senate Committee report on the Contract Disputes Act, the purpose behind that requirement is to induce agencies to resolve disputes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-9\">Requiring the agencies to shoulder the responsibility for interest and payment of judgments brings to bear on them the only real incentives available to induce more management involvement in contract administration and dispute resolution. Either the Agencies must use some part of their program funds to pay the interest and the judgment, or they must seek additional funds from Congress for this purpose. The former course can have an impact on current programs; the latter would necessitate an explanation to a congressional committee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">S. Rep. No. 95-1118, at 33 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5235, 5267.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">The reimbursement provision therefore shifts the source of payment from the general appropriation of the judgment fund to the agency\u2019s current appropriations. Accordingly, as of the enactment of the Military Child Care Act of 1989, any judgment against the United States on a contract claim arising out of the FCC could ultimately be paid from current appropriated funds of the Department of Defense. For that reason, the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over the claim in this case. <em>See Convery v. United States, </em>220 Ct.Cl. 106, 597 F.2d 727, 730 (Ct.C1.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">We next turn to the Lees\u2019 argument that the United States is collaterally es-topped by the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland from arguing that Ms. Garner\u2019s negligence was not the cause of Megan Lee\u2019s injuries. We reject the Lees\u2019 argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">First, collateral estoppel may be employed to preclude the relitigation of issues only when those issues were \u201cactually litigated\u201d in a prior law suit. <em>See Mother\u2019s Restaurant, Inc. v. Mama\u2019s Pizza, Inc., </em>723 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>1566, 1569 (Fed.Cir.1983). In this case, the Lees are attempting to estop the government on the basis of a default judgment. When judgment is issued as the result of a default, however, the underlying issues have not been actually litigated. For that reason, a default judgment cannot serve to preclude the litigation of issues under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. <em>See Schendel v. Curtis, </em>83 F.3d 1399, 1405 (Fed.Cir.1996); <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 27 cmt. e (1982); 18 James Wm. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>\u00a7 132.03[2][k] (3d ed.1997). Accordingly, the district court action cannot be used to estop the government from litigating the issue of negligence in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">Second, the Lees\u2019 collateral estoppel argument fails because the government was neither a party nor in privity with a party to the district court action, which is a prerequisite for invoking collateral estoppel. <em>See Commissioner v. Sunnen, </em>333 U.S. 591, 597-98, 68 S.Ct. 715, 719-20, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948). Although it is undisputed that the United States was not a party to the prior district court action, in which only the Garners were named as defendants, the Lees argue that the United States was in privity with the Garners in that case. In support of their claim of privity, the Lees assert (1) that under the insurance arrangement the government had a duty to defend Ms. Garner in any liability actions arguably falling within the scope of the insurance coverage, and (2) that the duty to defend rendered the government in privity with Ms. Garner for collateral estoppel purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">The Lees cite various eases holding that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend an insured under an insurance policy is determined with reference to the allegations of the complaint and that the duty to defend is triggered when there is a \u201cpotentiality\u201d of coverage under the policy. <em>See, e.g., Farmers Ins. Co. v. Vagnozzi </em>138 Ariz. 443, 675 P.2d 703, 706 (1983); <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Pryseski </em>292 Md. 187, 438 A2d 282, 285 (1981); <em>Brohaum v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 347 A2d 842, 850 (1975). In those cases, however, the insurance policy specifically included a promise by the insurer to defend the insured. The duty to defend an insured is contractual, and if the contract disclaims any duty to defend, it is improper for the courts to create one. <em>See </em>7C John Alan Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 4682 (Buckley ed. 1979 &amp; Supp.1997); 1 A. Windt, <em>Insurance Claims &amp; Disputes: Representation of Insurance Companies &amp; Insureds </em>\u00a7 4.01, at 146 n. 1 (3d ed.1995); Robert E. Keeton &amp; Alan I. Widiss, <em>Insurance Law </em>\u00a7 9.1(b) (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">The Statement of Understanding in this case specifically addresses the issue of legal representation and makes clear that the government has no duty to defend the insured. It states that \u201clegal representation, if it is provided, will be provided solely to protect the interests of the insurance fund\u201d and that the insured may obtain private counsel at his or her own expense when \u201cadvisable in order to protect\u201d the interest of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">The Army regulations that govern the RIMP also support the conclusion that the government had no duty to defend the Garners in the Maryland district court action. The regulations permit NAFI funds to be used to pay legal expenses when an FCC provider is sued, but that step is taken only if the Judge Advocate General of the Army determines that the claim is within the coverage of the insurance arrangement, <em>i.e., </em>based on a negligent act or omission, rather than a criminal act or intentional tort. Army Reg. 215-1, ch. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 11(b)(2) &amp; (e). The regulations further state that any counsel employed by the Army in litigation relating to child care would represent the interest of the insurance fund rather than the FCC provider. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11(c)(7). Like the Statement of Understanding, the regulations also state that \u201cFCC providers are authorized to retain private counsel at their own expense any time they feel it advisable to do so in order to protect their own interests.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">The facts asserted in the Lees\u2019 complaint potentially give rise to liability under the insurance agreement. The duty to provide liability coverage, however, is based on the language of the agreement between the government and the Garners; there is no like duty to defend created by that agreement. Contrary to the Lees\u2019 theory, therefore, the government was not in privity with the Gar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>ners in the Maryland district court action and cannot be estopped by the judgment rendered in that case. <em>See Beacon Oil Co. v. O\u2019Leary, </em>71 F.3d 391, 395 (Fed.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">We now reach the Lees\u2019 principal ground for establishing liability. They argue that Ms. Garner was insured against liability resulting from her own negligence and that the Lees, as third party beneficiaries of the insurance agreement, are entitled to recover from the RIMP for injuries falling within the coverage of the agreement. The Lees\u2019 argument, however, is precluded by the language of the Statement of Understanding and the regulations governing the RIMP program. Because we find that the Lees have no right of recovery against the United States on the merits of their claim, we do not address the government\u2019s argument that the Court of Federal Claims was in error in concluding that the Lees were third party beneficiaries of the insurance agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">The Statement of Understanding provides that insurance coverage extends to any claim arising out of injury or death \u201cwhich occurs as a result of a negligent act or omission\u201d on the part of the insured. Yet it excludes coverage for injury or death \u201carising out of any criminal act or omission, or as a result of any otherwise intentional tort ... on [the provider\u2019s] part or the part of a member of [the provider\u2019s] household.\u201d The Army regulations similarly limit the scope of coverage. The regulations provide: \u201cThe claim or action must be based on a negligent act or omission. Excluded is any death or injury of a child arising out of a criminal act or omission or any otherwise intentional tort ... by the provider or a member of the household.\u201d Army Reg. 215-1, ch. 3, \u00a7 11(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">There is no dispute as to the direct cause of Megan Lee\u2019s injuries. Sgt. Garner intentionally struck Megan and submerged her in hot bath water, acts for which he was criminally prosecuted and convicted. The exclusion set forth in the insurance contract and Army regulations plainly covers injuries arising under such circumstances. The Lees, however, argue that the chain of causation for Megan\u2019s injuries can be traced to the negligence of Ms. Garner in leaving Megan alone with an uncertified care provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">The Lees concede that in order for Ms. Garner\u2019s alleged negligence to have caused Megan\u2019s injuries within the meaning of the insurance agreement, the actions of Sgt. Garner must have been foreseeable at the time Ms. Garner left Megan in her husband\u2019s custody. They further concede that there is nothing in the record to suggest that Ms. Garner had any reason to anticipate that her husband might assault Megan as he did. They argue, however, that the element of foreseeability is provided by Ms. Garner\u2019s violation of the regulations governing family child care providers by leaving Megan at home with an unauthorized person while she went to the grocery store.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Contrary to the Lees\u2019 argument, Ms. Garner\u2019s regulatory violation goes to the issue of her negligence, not to the issue of causation. The question of causation does not turn on whether Ms. Garner should have left Megan with Sgt. Garner, but on whether she should have foreseen that her husband might commit a criminal act against Megan in her absence. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 448 (1965); <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Lane, </em>338 Md. 34, 656 A2d 307, 315 (1995). As the trial court observed, the record \u201cdoes not indicate that Ms. Garner believed her husband would commit criminal battery upon Megan or that Mr. Garner\u2019s criminal act was a natural and ordinary consequence of her negligence.\u201d Because, as the court concluded, Sgt. Garner\u2019s criminal act \u201cwas a superseding cause which cut off the chain of causation,\u201d the injury to Megan must be regarded as arising from Sgt. Garner\u2019s criminal conduct, and not from Ms. Garner\u2019s negligence. Megan\u2019s injury was therefore not within the coverage of the insurance agreement between the government and Ms. Garner.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Each party shall bear its own costs for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
