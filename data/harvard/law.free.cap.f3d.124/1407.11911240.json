Additionally, we review procedural challenges. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-16\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-17\">On November 5, 1986, petitioner, Anton G. Zukas, piloted a Piper Navajo, civil aircraft on a flight from Miami, Florida, to Austin, Texas. When the plane was searched by a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, two bags of cocaine were found. Zukas was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 846 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and a fine of $10,000.00. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. <em>See United States v. Zukas, </em>843 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-18\">Because of Zukas\u2019s drug conviction in connection with his operation of an aircraft transporting cocaine, the Administrator of the FAA revoked his Commercial Pilot Certificate No. 263743302 pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44709 (1994)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.15(a) (1995)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on May 11, 1995. Zukas appealed the revocation of his commercial pilot certificate to the NTSB and requested a hearing with an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). The FAA Administrator filed the revocation order as the agency\u2019s complaint in the appeal and moved for summary judgment. Although Zukas conceded his conviction, he filed a motion to dismiss and argued that the FAA Administrator had failed to prove that the revocation of Zukas\u2019s pilot certificate was warranted under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44709 and 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.15(a) and that the revocation order was barred by the six-month limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>tions period. He also asserted that the revocation order violated the constitutional protection against <em>ex post facto </em>laws and that it constituted multiple punishment in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The ALJ determined that the revocation of Zukas\u2019s pilot certificate was warranted, but he reserved judgment as to the appropriate sanction. Thus, the ALJ granted partial summary judgment for the FAA Administrator and set a hearing to decide the sanction issue. The ALJ denied Zukas\u2019s motion to dismiss. Zukas then filed a notice of appeal to the full board of the NTSB.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-4\">During the proceedings before the ALJ, the FAA Administrator issued an amended revocation order. The ALJ, however, did not receive this order before ruling on the parties\u2019 motions. The only difference between the original and amended orders was an additional statutory basis for the revocation of Zukas\u2019s pilot certificate, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44710(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Zukas filed a separate notice of appeal from the amended order and, alternatively, requested that the order be joined with his appeal from the ALJ\u2019s decision. He also filed a motion to dismiss the amended order as untimely, duplicitous, and barred because of his appeal to the full board of the NTSB. The FAA Administrator filed a copy of the amended revocation order as his amended complaint and an amended summary judgment motion. The ALJ vacated only the part of his earlier order granting partial summary judgment to the FAA Administrator. Treating Zukas\u2019s notice of appeal as a request for an interlocutory appeal, the ALJ refused to certify the record for the appeal, and he denied Zukas\u2019s motion to dismiss the FAA Administrator\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-5\">The ALJ subsequently granted summary judgment to the FAA Administrator based on the undisputed allegations of the amended complaint and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44710(b). Zukas appealed to the full board of the NTSB and made the same arguments advanced to the ALJ. The NTSB denied the appeal, adopted the ALJ\u2019s order denying Zukas\u2019s motion to dismiss, and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision because of its conclusion that Zukas\u2019s pilot certificate was revocable under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44710(b) and 14 C.F.R. 61.15(a). Zukas petitions this court for review of the final order by the NTSB that affirmed summary judgment granted to the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AN5d\">A. <em>Review Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"AP-\">This court has jurisdiction to review a final order of the NTSB. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a); <em>Oceanair of Florida, Inc. v. National Transp. Safety Bd., </em>888 F.2d 767, 768 (11th Cir.1989) (stating that the revocation of an operating certificate by the NTSB is \u201cdirectly appealable to this court\u201d). We uphold a decision by the NTSB unless it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d or the challenged decision is \u201ccontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), (B). \u201c[W]hen reviewing an agency decision under the \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 standard, we must defer to the wisdom of the agency provided [its] decision is reasoned and rational\u201d; we are not authorized to substitute our judgment for that of the agency. <em>McHenry v. Bond, </em>668 F.2d 1185, 1190 (11th Cir.1982). The NTSB has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in its determination of the appropriate sanction for violation of FAA regulations. <em>Cobb v. National Transp. Safety Bd., </em>572 F.2d 202, 204 (9th Cir.1977) (per curiam). The factual findings of the NTSB are binding on this court if supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(c). We review the interpretation of constitutional and statutory provisions by the NTSB <em>de novo. See Bennett v. National Transp. Safety Bd., </em>66 F.3d 1130, 1136 (10th Cir.1995); <em>see also Essery v. National Transp. Safety Bd., </em>857 F.2d 1286, 1288 (9th Cir.1988) (holding that a court of appeals reviews <em>de novo </em>purely legal questions).</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>B. <em>Procedural Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"AegT\">1. Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-4\">Zukas argues that the FAA Administrator\u2019s amended order of revocation violated the notice requirement of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44709(d) because it was issued after he appealed to the full board of the NTSB. Zukas received notice prior to the revocation of his commercial pilot certificate and appealed to the NTSB in accordance with 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 44709(c), (d) and 44710(c), (d), which provide that the FAA must advise the holder of a pilot certificate of the charges against him, allow the holder an opportunity to be heard before issuing a revocation order, and permit the holder to appeal the order to the NTSB. Furthermore, when Zukas appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the full board of the NTSB, the ALJ had granted only partial summary judgment and had set a hearing to determine the appropriate sanction; the ALJ had not entered a final decision. Under the administrative regulations, the ALJ\u2019s ruling on the parties\u2019 motion can not be appealed until the ALJ considers the entire proceedings or certifies the record for an appeal to the full board of the NTSB. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 821.16, 821.35(a), 821.41, 821.47 (1995). In this case, the ALJ had retained jurisdiction and had not certified the record to the NTSB at the time that the FAA Administrator filed the agency\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-5\">Furthermore, Zukas\u2019s reliance on <em>Ocean-air </em>is misplaced. In <em>Oceanair, </em>this court determined that the FAA had violated section 609(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429(a) (recodified as amended at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 44709(c), (d) &amp; 44710(e), (d) (1994)), \u201cby amending its complaint against Oceanair at the appeal stage <em>to include new charges </em>and a revised order without first granting <em>Oceanair </em>an opportunity to be heard by the FAA on the <em>new charges.\u201d Oceanair, </em>888 F.2d at 768-69 (emphasis added). Unlike the complaint in <em>Oceanair, </em>the FAA\u2019s amended order of revocation against Zukas was identical to the original revocation order, except that it added 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44710(b) to augment 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.15(a) in requiring revocation of a pilot\u2019s operating certificate when the holder is convicted of a federal or state crime related to controlled substances. Therefore, we find no merit in Zukas\u2019s contention that the FAA Administrator\u2019s amended order of revocation violated 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 44709(c), (d) and 44710(c), (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-8\">2. Timeliness of the Phot Certificate Revocation Order</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-9\">Zukas also argues that the FAA failed to issue its pilot certificate revocation order within six months of the time that the FAA knew or should have known that his conviction was the basis for revocation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 821.33 of the NTSB\u2019s Rules of Practice in Air Safety Proceedings, known as the \u201cstale complaint rule,\u201d provides that \u201c[w]here the [FAA\u2019s] complaint states allegations of offenses which occurred more than 6 months prior to the Administrator\u2019s advising [the pilot certificate holder] as to reasons for proposed action ... [the pilot certificate holder] may move to dismiss such allegations----\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 821.33. By its specific terms, however, the stale complaint rule is preempted when there are allegations of the phot certificate holder\u2019s lack of qualifications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number><em>See id. </em>\u00a7 821.33(a), (b). Since, under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44710 and 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.15(a), the FAA Administrator may revoke a pilot certificate if the holder is convicted of a crime related to the transporting of controlled substances, Zukas\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to possess and to distribute cocaine implicated his qualifications to retain his pilot certificate. We defer to an administrative agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its own regulations. <em>See Georgia Pacific Corp. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>25 F.3d 999, 1004 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam). Because the FAA Administrator\u2019s complaint concerned Zukas\u2019s qualifications to hold a pilot certificate, the six months limitations period established in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 821.33 is inapplicable, and the ALJ correctly denied Zukas\u2019s motion to dismiss the FAA Administrator\u2019s complaint as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-4\">C. Ex Post Facto <em>Concern</em></p>\n<p id=\"A38\">Zukas contends that the FAA\u2019s retroactive application of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 44709 and 44710, which were enacted in 1994, over seven years after his 1987 conviction, was an unconstitutional <em>ex post facto </em>violation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Miller v. Florida, </em>482 U.S. 423, 430,107 S.Ct. 2446, 2451, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987) (explaining that the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause applies only to retrospective laws). Section 44710(b) requires the FAA Administrator to revoke the pilot certificate of an individual who is convicted of a federal or state statute related to a controlled substance, other than simple possession, if an aircraft was used to commit or to facilitate the crime and the certificate holder served as an airman or was on the aircraft involved in the drug crime. The policy of revoking a pilot certificate because of a holder\u2019s conviction for drug trafficking by aircraft predates the reeodification that became section 44710(b). In 1984, Congress amended the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 by enacting the Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control Act, which is the basis for 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44710, \u201cto provide for the revocation of the airman certificates and for additional penalties for the transportation by aircraft of controlled substances.\u201d Pub.L. No. 98-499, 98 Stat. 2312, 2312 (1984). The original 1984 legislation expressly provided that it was applicable to actions and violations occurring after the date of enactment, October 19, 1984. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 98-499, \u00a7 7, 98 Stat. at 2316. Contrary to Zukas\u2019s argument, Congress mandated the revocation of pilot certificates for holders\u2019 convictions for drug crimes prior to Zukas\u2019s November 5, 1986, drug trafficking that was the basis of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-6\">Significantly, neither section 44709 nor section 44710 was enacted as new law in 1994. Instead, these statutes were recodified as part of the legislative revisions of Title 49 of the United States Code on July 5, 1994. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No.103-272, 108 Stat. 745 (1994). The purpose of this recodification was <em>\u201cto restate </em>in comprehensive form, <em>without substantive change, </em>certain general and permanent laws related to transportation and to enact those laws as subtitles II, III, and V-X of title 49, United States Code, and to make other technical improvements in the Code.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 103-180, at 1 (1993) (emphasis added), <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.AN. 818, 818. Because Zukas\u2019s conviction occurred <em>after </em>the enactment of both the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and the Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control Act of 1984, there was no <em>ex post facto </em>application of either section 44709 or section 44710. <em>See Hernandez v. National Transp. Safety Bd., </em>15 F.3d 157, 158-59 (10th Cir.1994) (determining that, where statutes or regulations do not involve policy changes, the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause is not implicated).</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-7\">D. <em>Double Jeopardy Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1499-8\">Zukas finally contends that the revocation of his pilot certificate violated the Double Jeopardy Clause<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the Fifth Amendment because he already had been punished by imprisonment and a civil fine for his participation in the cocaine distribution conspiracy. Initially, we note that nothing in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>shows that Zukas was subjected to civil forfeiture or was ordered to pay a civil penalty. As part of his sentence, the trial court ordered him to pay a criminal fine of $10,-000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-4\">\u201c[T]he Double Jeopardy Clause protects against three distinct abuses: a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 440, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1897, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989). With respect to the third, relevant application, the Court held \u201cthat under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448-49, 109 S.Ct. at 1902. The test of \u201cwhether a given civil sanction constitutes punishment in the relevant sense requires a particularized assessment of the penalty imposed and the purposes that the penalty may fairly be said to serve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 109 S.Ct. at 1901; <em>see Department of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch, </em>511 U.S. 767, 777 n. 14,114 S.Ct. 1937,1945 n. 14, 128 L.Ed.2d 767 (1994) (\u201c[Whether a sanc. tion constitutes punishment is not determined from the defendant\u2019s perspective, as even remedial sanctions carry the \u2018sting of punishment.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. at 447 n. 7, 109 S.Ct. at 1901 n. 7)). Because double jeopardy applies to punitive and not to remedial sanctions, <em>see Manocchio v. Kus-serow, </em>961 F.2d 1539, 1541 (11th Cir.1992), a civil sanction that does not consist of money damages requires a court to consider the penalty imposed and the purposes of the penalty to determine if a legitimate, remedial purpose is served, <em>see United States v. Reed, </em>937 F.2d 575, 577-78 (11th Cir.1991). Only when the civil sanction serves a retributive or deterrent purpose does the sanction constitute punishment and violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>See id.; United States v. Walker, </em>940 F.2d 442, 443 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cA civil penalty is punishment if it cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose.\u201d). Revoking a pilot certificate by the FAA to ensure air safety by removing an unqualified pilot from the ranks of those who hold pilot certificates granted by the FAA serves a remedial purpose. The FAA regulations in effect at the time that Zukas\u2019s pilot certificate was revoked provided that \u201c[Revocation of a [pilot] certificate is used as a remedial measure when the certificate holder lacks the necessary qualifications to hold the certificate,\u201d and that \u201c[Revocation is appropriate whenever the certificate holder\u2019s conduct demonstrates a lack of the degree of care, judgment, or responsibility required of the holder of such a certificate.\u201d Federal Aviation Admin., U.S. Department of Transp., <em>Compliance and Enforcement Program, </em>Order 2150.3A, at \u00b6\u00b6 206(c), 206(c)(1) (as amended Apr. 20, 1994); <em>see Hite v. National Transp. Safety Bd., </em>991 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir.1993) (using an earlier version of the same FAA regulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-6\">The relevant legislative history also reveals a remedial purpose. The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1500-7\">The [Civil Aeronautics] Authority may ... alter, amend, modify, or suspend, in whole or in part, any ... airman certificate ... if the interest of the public so requires, or may revoke, in whole or in part, any such certificate for any cause which, at the time of revocation, would justify the Authority in refusing to issue to the holder of such certificate a like certificate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1500-8\">Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, ch. 601, 52 Stat. 973, 1011 (codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 559 (1940)) (repealed 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1500-9\">The \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 was to give the new federal agency, the FAA, which replaced the Civil Aeronautics Administration, \u201cpowers adequate to enable it to provide for the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace by both civil and military operations,\u201d including authority over airman certificates. H.R.Rep. No. 2360, at 1 (1958), <em>reprinted in </em>1958 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3741, 3741; <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44701(a) (providing that the FAA Administrator is charged with \u201cpromoting] safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce\u201d). The Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control Act of 1984 expanded the FAA\u2019s authority as part of the war against drugs and enabled it to combat aerial trafficking in controlled substances by authorizing the revocation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>certificates of pilots involved in drug trafficking to prevent the recurrence of criminal drug trafficking. See S.Rep. No. 98-228, at 1 (1984), <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3916, 3916 (\u201cThe bill is intended to expand the powers of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to combat aerial trafficking in drugs. The bill accomplishes this purpose by authorizing FAA revocation of the airman certificate and aircraft registration certificate of those involved in drug trafficking.\u201d). There is no evidence that Congress had a retributive or deterrent purpose in providing for the revocation of pilots\u2019 certificates in any of the legislation that preceded the current law, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44709; instead, congressional impetus was remedial to ensure air safety and competence in aviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-4\">Because \u201cthe FAA\u2019s authority and goals are anchored in a concern for air safety,\u201d <em>United States v. Emerson, </em>107 F.3d 77, 82 (1st Cir.1997), there is a reasonable relation between conviction for violating a drug law and flying safety. \u201c[I]t is reasonable to conclude that a pilot who has violated a drug trafficking statute is also likely to violate regulations concerning air safety.\u201d <em>Pinney v. National Transp. Safety Bd., </em>993 F.2d 201, 203 (10th Cir.1993); <em>see Walters v. McLucas, </em>597 F.2d 1230, 1232 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam) (upholding revocation of a pilot\u2019s certificate because he had been convicted of possessing marijuana for sale and finding a \u201crational relation between a conviction for the possession of drugs for sale and the unsafe use of aircraft for drug smuggling\u201d). Conviction for violating drug laws \u201cclearly demonstrates a tendency to act without inhibition in an unstable manner without regard to the rights of others.\u201d 38 Fed.Reg. 17, 491, 17, 492 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-5\">The FAA revoked Zukas\u2019s pilot certificate pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 44709(b), which provides for air safety in the public interest, and section 44710(b) and 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.15(a), which provide that a pilot\u2019s certificate is revocable if the holder has been convicted of a federal or state crime involving a controlled substance. Zukas does not dispute his conviction for conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846. Because \u201c[r]evocation of a pilot certificate is not a criminal sanction----[,but] it is a remedy imposed to enhance air safety and to promote the public interest,\u201d <em>Kolek v. Engen, </em>869 F.2d 1281, 1288 (9th Cir.1989), it cannot constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes, <em>see Walker, </em>940 F.2d at 443-44. Therefore, Zukas\u2019s double jeopardy argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-10\">Zukas has petitioned for review of the NTSB final order affirming the ALJ\u2019s granting summary judgment to the FAA Administrator to revoke his pilot certificate because of his conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. For the reasons stated herein, Zu-kas\u2019s procedural, <em>ex post facto, </em>and double jeopardy challenges are unavailing. We AFFIRM the decision of the NTSB.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1496-12\">.

In his petition to this court, Zukas has abandoned his argument made before the NTSB that the FAA Administrator failed to prove that he acted knowingly or willfully in violating the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. <em>See Rogero v.

The facts concerning Zukas\u2019s participation in the cocaine trafficking conspiracy are recounted in the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion affirming his conviction. <em>See United States v. Zukas, </em>843 F.2d 179, 180-81 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1496-19\">. Section 44709(b)(1)(A) authorizes the FAA Administrator to revoke a pilot certificate if he \"decides after conducting a[n]. ... investigation that safety in air commerce or air transportation and the public interest require that action.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44709(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1496-20\">. Section 61.15(a) provides that the FAA Administrator may revoke a certificate if a pilot is convicted of an offense relating to transporting or importing controlled substances. In relevant part, \u00a7 61.15 provides that \"[a] conviction for the violation of any Federal or state statute relating to the growing, processing, manufacture, sale, disposition, possession, transportation, or importation\u201d of controlled substances \"is grounds for ... [sjuspension or revocation of any certificate or rating issued under this part.\u201d 14 C.F.R. 61.15(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1497-6\">. Section 44710(b) mandates that the FAA Administrator revoke the certificate of a pilot</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC8\">convicted, under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance ... of an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year if the Administrator finds that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1497-9\">(A) an aircraft was used to commit, or facilitate the commission of, the offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1497-10\">(B) the individual served as an airman, or was on the aircraft, in connection with committing, or facilitating the commission of, the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1497-11\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44710(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1498-6\">. Zukas raises for the first time on appeal that the pilot certificate revocation order was untimely under the two-year statute of limitations in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46301(d)(7)(C) and that the FAA Administrator\u2019s claim of lack of qualifications is an attempt to circumvent the \"stale complaint rule\u201d of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 821.33. Because Zukas failed to raise these objections before the ALJ or the NTSB, we need not address them. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(d). Significantly, \u00a7 46301 applies generally to civil monetary penalties imposed by the FAA and not to revocations of certificates. Section 46301(d)(7)(A) specifically states that the FAA Administrator may impose a civil penalty, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, on individuals who are not acting as FAA certificate holders. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46301(d)(7)(A) (\"The [FAA] Administrator may impose a penalty on an individual <em>(except an individual acting as a pilot, </em>flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman) only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record.\u201d (emphasis added)). By its explicit terms, \u00a7 46301(d)(7)(C) is unrelated and inapplicable to FAA revocations of pilot certificates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1498-13\">. When the complaint alleges the pilot certificate holder's lack of qualifications, on the certificate holder\u2019s motion, the ALJ is required to determine initially whether the complaint presents an issue of lack of qualifications \"if any or all of the allegations, stale and timely, are assumed to be true.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 821.33(b)(1). If an issue of lack of qualifications is presented by the complaint, then the matter proceeds to a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>the issue of the certificate holder\u2019s qualifications. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 821.33(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1499-10\">.
