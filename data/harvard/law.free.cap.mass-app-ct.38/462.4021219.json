The judge had instructed the jury to assume that the corporation was a \u201cclose corporation,\u201d see <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc., 361 </em>Mass. 578 (1975); <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Springside Nursing Home, Inc., </em>370 Mass 842, 851 (1976), but she had reserved to herself the final determination of that question. The jury concluded, as to count II, that there had been no deceit by Pompei.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">After the trial, the judge issued her findings and rulings regarding count III. She concluded that Pompei, as majority stockholder, by discharging the plaintiff, had failed to perform his fiduciary obligations to the plaintiff, as a result of which the plaintiff was damaged to the extent of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Regarding the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the defendant corporation was a \u201cclose corporation,\u201d the judge found that (i) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>shares of the corporation were not generally traded or offered for sale on any securities market, and there was no ready market for the corporation\u2019s stock; (ii) the corporation has had, and continues to have, a \u201csmall number of stockholders\u201d; (iii) substantial majority shareholder participation in the management, direction and operations of the corporation has existed since its formation in 1980. On these subsidiary findings, the judge concluded that the defendant corporation was a \u201cclose corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The judge\u2019s findings continued: Pompei, a majority stockholder of the corporation, owed a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff, a minority stockholder, which required Pompei to honor the plaintiff\u2019s reasonable expectations that he would receive a return on his investments with continued employment, and Pompei, by terminating the plaintiff\u2019s employment without any legitimate purpose in doing so, had failed to perform his fiduciary obligations to the plaintiff. The judge also ruled that the jury\u2019s finding of an accord and satisfaction did not bar the plaintiff\u2019s claim for compensation. The judge entered judgment against the defendants, jointly and severally, on count III in the amount of $50,000 (as recommended by the jury), plus interest and costs. The defendants filed a notice of appeal, and the plaintiff filed a notice of cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The defendants argue that the corporation was not a \u201cclose corporation\u201d because it appeared from the evidence at trial that the corporation itself provided a ready market for its stock by repurchasing stock at any stockholder\u2019s request. (The judge found that two and possibly three stockholders \u2014 not including the plaintiff \u2014 had sold their shares to the corporation more than one year after the plaintiff was terminated).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">There is no merit to the argument. It is undisputed that the shares held by the plaintiff (and, inferentially, the shares held by the other twenty stockholders) were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the sale of such securities, therefore, was restricted. See <em>Leader </em>v. <em>Hycor, Inc., </em>395 Mass. 215, 217 (1985). The outstanding stock of the corporation was also burdened by restrictions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>transfer which gave the corporation the right to purchase shares from any stockholder desiring to sell at a price offered by the stockholder, or determined by arbitration. See <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co., </em>367 Mass. at 587 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The effect of these legal restraints was to foreclose the existence of a ready market for the corporation\u2019s stock. The \u201cready market\u201d of which <em>Donahue </em>speaks at 586 does not refer, as the defendants argue, to the alleged readiness of a single buyer \u2014 here, the corporation acting through the controlling stockholder \u2014 to buy the stock of a stockholder desiring to sell his shares, see <em>Goode </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>397 Mass. 85, 90 (1986); it refers to an active trading market for the stock of the corporation where the price is determined by the behavior of numerous buyers and sellers, each acting independently of the other. See Principles of Corporate Governance \u00a7 1.06 (1994) (\u201c \u2018closely held corporation\u2019 means a corporation the equity securities ... of which are owned by a small number of persons, and for which securities no active trading market exists\u201d). In the absence of such a market, as in this case, the plaintiff is likely to be obliged to deal with the controlling stockholder. See <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co., </em>367 Mass. at 591. Compare <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Bessette, </em>385 Mass. 806, 808 n.4 (1982) (where the corporation is family owned, an inference can be drawn that there is no ready market for its stock).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The defendants also argue that even if the corporation was a close corporation, there was no breach of any fiduciary duty owed to an at-will employee such as the plaintiff, because corporate law allows corporate officers \u201ca large measure of discretion\u201d in firing corporate officers and employees. <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Springside Nursing Home, Inc., </em>370 Mass. at 851. The argument fails to recognize that, where a minority stockholder in a close corporation brings suit alleging breach of the strict good faith duty, it \u201cmust be asked whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>controlling group </em>can demonstrate a legitimate business purpose for its action\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the judge concluded that there was no legitimate business purpose for not providing the plaintiff with continuing employment with the corporation \u2014 on its face, a breach of the fiduciary obligation owed to the plaintiff. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 849-850; <em>Leader </em>v. <em>Hycor, Inc., </em>395 Mass. at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In reaching this conclusion, the judge adopted the advisory finding of the jury that the plaintiff had been denied continuing employment with the corporation without any legitimate business purpose, but she did not make any subsidiary findings in support of that ultimate conclusion. Nevertheless, \u201cthe judge\u2019s decision imports every finding essential to sustain it if there is evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Mailer </em>v. <em>Mailer, </em>390 Mass. 371, 373 (1983). <em>Chase Precast Corp. </em>v. <em>John J. Paonessa Co., </em>409 Mass. 371, 377 n.7 (1991).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">There was such evidence here. Pompei claimed that the firing was due to Merola\u2019s being responsible for a level of inventory so high that it was threatening the company\u2019s financial stability. Merola testified that the high inventory was in fact Pompei\u2019s doing, and, in any event, did not impair the company\u2019s financial stability, and that the discharge was in fact due to Merola\u2019s having clashed with a female employee with whom Pompei was romantically involved.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This evidence was enough to support the inference that Pompei\u2019s motiva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>tion for the discharge was to harm the plaintiff and not to benefit the corporation \u2014 an inference sufficient to justify the judge\u2019s conclusion. See <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Springside Nursing Home, Inc., </em>370 Mass. at 852; <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Communications for Hosps., Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 751, 758-759 (1991); Southgate &amp; Glazer, Massachusetts Corporation Law and Practice \u00a7 16.3(a), at 516 (1991) (\u201cThe question is whether the majority has acted to achieve a <em>bona fide </em>[business] objective or to harm a member of the minority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Responding still further, the defendants argue (relying on <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Springside Nursing Home, Inc., </em>370 Mass. at 852-853), that a fiduciary obligation does not arise absent evidence of a nexus between the plaintiff\u2019s investment of capital and his employment in the corporation. No doubt a nexus must be made out in cases such as the one before us,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but the judge specifically found the facts which establish such a nexus, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In late 1980, Pompei recruited the plaintiff, as a part-time employee, to help with the development of the corporation\u2019s first product, an electronic heat detection device. In late 1981, the plaintiff was invited to attend a stockholders\u2019 meeting at which a private stock offering was announced.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>February 1, 1982, Pompei wrote the plaintiff soliciting the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the offering, and emphasizing that the purchase of the corporation\u2019s stock \u201cshould be considered a long term investment. If the company is successful it may still be a number of years before your stock can produce cash by either dividends or sale of the stock.\u201d As a result of a conversation with Pompei on February 5, 1982, as well as an earlier conversation in late 1981, the plaintiff understood that if he came to work for the corporation full time and invested in its stock, he would have the opportunity to become a major stockholder in the corporation and to have continuing employment with the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Further, the judge found that as a result of his conversations with Pompei, the plaintiff decided to work full time for the corporation and to invest in the stock of the corporation. He made these decisions because of the opportunities offered for a major stockholder position as well as the opportunity for employment with security.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Thus, on March 1, 1982, the plaintiff accepted full-time employment, and from March, 1982, through June, 1982, he purchased 4,100 shares of the corporation for $9,225. He purchased an additional 1,200 shares in October, 1983, for $6,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">On these subsidiary findings, the judge concluded that the plaintiff accepted full-time employment and invested his money in the corporation \u201cwith the reasonable expectations that he would receive a return in his investments with continued employment and with opportunities to become a major shareholder of Exergen.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>There was no failure of proof on the nexus issue. The required nexus may fall short of an enforceable contract, but that does not matter. All that is required is the express, or reasonably understood, coupling of continuing employment with the employee\u2019s investment in the equity securities of the corporation where there is no active trading market for those securities. The purpose of such a coupling (from the point of view of the corporation) is to acquire a valuable employee who might not otherwise be available and to compensate the employee at a level lower than what otherwise might be negotiated. From the point of view of the employee, by being allowed in on the \u201cground floor,\u201d he may realize the opportunity for long-term gain that otherwise would not be available. These are reasonable expectations that are deserving of respect and, if not honored, there is a breach of the duty owed the injured party. See <em>Bodio </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>401 Mass. 1, 10 (1987) (defendant\u2019s \u201ccontravention of . . . [plaintiff\u2019s] rightful expectation that he would have equal control with . . . [the defendant] and constituted a violation of the loyalty and fiduciary duty owed between the shareholders [of a closely held corporation]\u201d); <em>Hallahan </em>v. <em>Haltom Corp. </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 68, 71 (1979) (trial judge restored the balance of control among stockholders in a closely held corporation which the trial judge found \u201cthe parties had envisioned and which they had a fiduciary duty to each other to maintain\u201d). See also Southgate &amp; Glazer, Massachusetts Corporation Law and Practice \u00a7 16.4(b), at 623 (1991) (\u201cUnder <em>Hallahan </em>and <em>Bodio, </em>a stockholder\u2019s expectations may arise from an express or implied understanding that falls short of an enforceable contract. The rightful expectations of the parties, not contract law, are controlling. Massachusetts courts, thus, have broad discretion when deciding when to protect stockholders whose expectations have been frustrated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">As <em>Wilkes </em>points out, this rule of faithful performance of reasonable expectations based on the conduct of the parties works no unfairness to the managements of closely held cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>porations, for so long as they act in furtherance of a legitimate business standard or goal, they \u201chave a large measure of discretion . . . [in] hiring and firing corporate employees.\u201d <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Springside Nursing Home, Inc., </em>370 Mass. at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">There is no merit, either, to the defendant\u2019s argument that unless we reverse the judgment in this case, \u201c[a]ny current at-will employee of a small corporation who owns one share of stock could state a claim for breach under the <em>Donahue </em>doctrine by merely alleging \u2018expectations\u2019 that they had prior to the stock purchase.\u201d Here, the judge found, the plaintiff held the title of manufacturing manager and vice president of operations; he was second in command to Pompei and was responsible for all operations except sales and engineering. He was, in short, a key member of the management team. He owned 4.1 % of the outstanding shares of the corporation, which made him the fourth largest stockholder. That share of the company was slightly <em>more </em>than the share owned by the successful plaintiff in <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>418 Mass. 576 (1994).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We leave to another day the question whether controlling stockholders have special duties to at-will employees who have acquired nominal stock ownership in a corporation with a substantial number of outstanding shares of equity securities.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Finally, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs claim is barred by the jury\u2019s finding that the \u201cparties enter [ed] into an accord and satisfaction in compromise of the plaintiffs claim for compensation for a period of time after he had ceased to be an employee of Exergen.\u201d The judge instructed the jury that \u201c[the] <em>claim for deceit </em>may be resolved in this case if you find that there was an accord and satisfaction\u201d (emphasis added). There was no instruction that an accord and satisfaction could resolve the claim for breach of fiduciary duty, there was no objection to those instructions, and there is no reason to believe that the jury did not follow the judge\u2019s. instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Additionally, the judge found that the only evidence of an accord and satisfaction was negotiations about the amount due the plaintiff under the corporation\u2019s severance policy; those negotiations, the judge found, \u201cdid not include a claim for lost pay\u201d \u2014 as distinct from (as the judge found) payment due upon termination for past services.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We conclude that the jury found that the accord and satisfaction resolved the claim for deceit, but that their answer did not, and was not intended to, resolve the plaintiffs claim for breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In his cross appeal, the plaintiff argues that there was error in the admission of certain evidence regarding the plaintiffs mitigation of damages. The challenged evidence had to do with testimony of Pompei regarding comparable jobs available to the plaintiff and the salary ranges for those jobs. There is an adequate foundation for this testimony in Pompei\u2019s personal experiences, and there is no basis for concluding that the jury\u2019s determination of damages was unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">We do, however, correct one error in these proceedings, although not argued by any party. Final judgment was rendered against both defendants, \u201cjointly and severally.\u201d There is no basis for the liability of the defendant corporation to the plaintiff. The plaintiff established to the judge\u2019s satisfaction Pompei\u2019s breach of <em>his </em>fiduciary duty to the plaintiff. That provides a direct cause of action by the plaintiff against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Pompei, but not against the corporation. Contrast <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Bessette, </em>385 Mass. at 809-810 (where plaintiff establishes breach of fiduciary duty owed by the majority stockholder <em>to the corporation, </em>the plaintiff must proceed by way of a stockholders\u2019 derivative suit). There are outside stockholders in the corporation whose interests are not represented in these proceedings, and they should be unaffected by the outcome of this controversy. For this reason, we modify the judgment to run only against the defendant Pompei. As so modified, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\">As of June 10, 1987, two months after the plaintiffs termination, there were twenty-one stockholders (counting each record owner of stock as one stockholder and without consolidating the Pompei family group), and 127,992 shares were issued and outstanding. Of that number, Pompei was the record owner of 80,000 shares. The next largest shareholder was one Robert Jenner who was the record owner of 20,000 shares. The third largest shareholder owned 5,554 shares. The plaintiff was the fourth largest stockholder; he and his wife, jointly, were the record owners of 5,300 shares.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In 1991, approximately four years after the plaintiffs termination, the corporation purchased the plaintiffs shares at the same price per share ($17.00) the corporation paid to the stockholders who had sold their stock in 1988 and 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Because the judge found that the termination had no legitimate business purpose, there was no need to reach the issue whether there was a less harmful alternative.

It is a credit to both that we can proceed with a clear conscience, and without guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">A former employee of the corporation testified that Ryan had told her that the plaintiff was terminated because he had told Pompei that his relationship with Ryan was not good for the company, and that the plaintiff\u2019s termination \u201cwas one indication of the power she now had, and that if anybody disagreed with her relationship with Frank, she could get the same thing to happen to them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b505-13\">In cases such as <em>Donahue </em>(preferential redemption of stock), which involve the use, or abuse, of corporate assets to gain a financial advantage for those in the controlling group of stockholders while refusing the same financial benefit to the minority, no nexus need be made out. But where the issue is one involving discretionary management decisions, such as firing stockholder-employees, the nexus between employment and stock ownership, as well as the reasonable expectations of the stockholder, become live issues.
