He waived a jury and was found guilty by a District Court judge, who sentenced him to 120 days in a house of correction. On appeal, the defendant raises one issue \u2014 whether the judge committed reversible error by refusing to hear defense counsel\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">At trial the Commonwealth introduced evidence that the defendant backed his automobile into the rear end of a parked car, causing an estimated $3,000 in damage. The defendant then drove away from the scene without making himself known.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-16\">The defendant testified that he and a friend had left a bar near closing time. The defendant\u2019s friend stopped to talk to a young woman, who became quite upset. The defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>his friend got into the defendant\u2019s automobile but were quickly surrounded by several young men who uttered threats. The men started to \u201crock\u201d the automobile, and the defendant decided to leave the scene. He backed up his automobile and drove away. The defendant denied hitting any vehicle. The defendant\u2019s friend testified and stated, among other things, that he did not know whether the defendant had hit a car because, as a result of the crowd that had gathered and the \u201cyelling and screaming\u201d going on, \u201c[w]e just wanted to get the hell out of there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">After the defendant\u2019s friend testified, defense counsel informed the court that he had nothing further to offer in the way of testimony. The following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">Defense Counsel: \u201cI would rest, Judge. Judge, as you\u2019ve heard \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">The Court: \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear anything. Don\u2019t bury \u2014 don\u2019t do this to yourself, please, Mr. Mahoney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">Defense Counsel: \u201cJudge, I think under the circumstances \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">The Court: \u201cMr. Mahoney, if you want to do it, fine with me. I\u2019m giving you friendly advice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">Defense Counsel: \u201cI\u2019d rest on the evidence presented, Judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">The Prosecutor: \u201cI\u2019ll waive argument, Your Honor. I think the evidence speaks for itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">The Court: \u201cI\u2019m glad this case didn\u2019t go to the jury because they would have all wondered what was going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-13\">\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard in my seven-year judicial career \u2014 I wrote down words which were more judicious, like disingenuous, prevarication. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen before a more blatant, more blatant at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>tempt to mislead and to make up a story than I heard today in this court by the defendant and his witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\u201cI find the defendant guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Here, the defendant contends that the judge, by his words to defense counsel after the defendant rested, refused to hear closing argument by counsel. The Commonwealth, however, argues that, although the judge may have discouraged defense counsel from making a closing argument, he did not prohibit such an argument. We have held that a judge at a jury-waived criminal trial created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice necessitating a new trial when, after declaring that his mind was made up, he precluded counsel from making closing argument. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 10, 11, 22-23 (1986). We based our decision on the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Herring </em>v. <em>New York, </em>422 U.S. 853, 859 (1975), which held that the denial of the opportunity for a closing argument in a nonjury criminal trial is \u201ca denial of the basic right of the accused to make his defense.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Here, the record shows that when defense counsel started to make his closing argument, the judge interrupted him and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear anything.\u201d When defense counsel responded, \u201cJudge, I think under the circumstances \u2014,\u201d the judge again interrupted him and said, \u201c[I]f you want to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>do it, fine with me.\u201d However, the judge then told defense counsel, \u201cI\u2019m giving you friendly advice.\u201d Obviously, the \u201cfriendly advice\u201d referred to the judge\u2019s previous statement to defense counsel, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear anything.\u201d As a result of the judge\u2019s comments, defense counsel waived argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We rule that the judge\u2019s comments amounted to a declaration that he believed the defendant to be guilty and, therefore, a closing argument would not change his mind. In effect, the judge refused to hear defense counsel\u2019s closing argument. The judge\u2019s action constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">We are aware that defense counsel in this matter, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 22, did not object to the judge\u2019s action. However, in <em>Miranda, </em>we pointed out that \u201c[i]t is generally accepted . .. that prejudice as a result of the denial of closing arguments is assumed; and that such denial never can be harmless error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22-23. We then ruled that \u201c[f]or us to conclude that this denial did not create a substantial [risk] of a miscarriage of justice would be, in effect, to reject the importance assigned to the right [of the accused to make his defense] by the <em>Herring </em>decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. Therefore, on this record, there must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQp\">\n<em>Finding set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\">In ruling in <em>Herring </em>that a defendant has a right to a closing argument at a bench trial, the Supreme Court took note of the claim that a judge, because of his or her legal training and experience, will be likely at a bench trial to see the case clearly, thus rendering closing argument superfluous. <em>Id. </em>at 863 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">The court found the claim to be unpersuasive. \u201cJudicial training and expertise, however it may enhance judgment, does not render memory or reasoning infallible. Moreover, in one important respect, closing argument may be even more important in a bench trial than in a trial by jury. As Mr. Justice Powell has observed, the \u2018collective judgment\u2019 of the jury \u2018tends to compensate for individual shortcomings and furnishes some assurance of a reliable decision.\u2019 Powell, Jury Trial of Crimes, 23 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 1, 4 (1966). In contrast, the judge who tries a case presumably will reach his verdict with deliberation and contemplation, but must reach it without the stimulation of opposing viewpoints inherent in the collegial decision-making process of a jury.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
