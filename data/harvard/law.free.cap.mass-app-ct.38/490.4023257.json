He brought this action pro se, seeking injunctive relief and dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>ages for violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1988), the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H &amp; 111 (the MCRA), and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. At issue is the application of an institutional policy regarding noncontact visitation at Cedar Junction. The policy is recited in an institutional regulation, 103 WAL 483.19, which in pertinent part provides: \u201cOnly the Superintendent will be authorized to assign an inmate to [the] non-contact visiting room, based on instances of substantiated security risk. . . . Assignment of an inmate to the non-contact visiting room is <em>not </em>to be used as a form of punishment, nor is it to be used as a sanction of the Disciplinary Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The plaintiff alleged, alternatively, that the defendant assigned him to noncontact visitation in retaliation for a lawsuit he had previously filed against the defendant and that the regulation was selectively applied by the defendant in violation of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights. A judge of the Superior Court concluded that there was nothing in the undisputed facts which supported the claim that the assignment was retaliatory and allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on that claim. The selective enforcement claim survived, as the judge ruled that a genuine issue of material fact remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">After a newly appointed superintendent reinstated the plaintiff\u2019s contact visiting privileges, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint as moot. Another judge of the Superior Court then dismissed all of the remaining claims except the claim for damages against the defendant individually.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, the defendant filed a motion asserting that he was entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant appeals from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>denial of that motion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> asserting that as a government official he was entitled to qualified immunity from a suit for damages because (1) his actions regarding noncontact visitation are discretionary functions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) the violation of the institutional regulation may not serve as the basis of a damage claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, because it created no clearly established right. We agree with the defendant that the judge wrongly denied his motion for qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>In brief outline, the following are the undisputed facts. On September 3, 1989, the plaintiff received visitors in the contact visiting room. During the visit he made two obscene and threatening comments to a correctional officer. Afterwards he refused to submit to a routine postvisit search. He received three disciplinary reports as a result of this behavior, and after a review of these reports and on the recommendation of the deputy superintendent, the defendant assigned the plaintiff to the noncontact visiting room. Subsequently, the disciplinary board found the plaintiff guilty of all charges in the reports and suspended all visiting privileges for forty-five days. This sanction was upheld by the superintendent on October 13, 1989, and the plaintiff\u2019s assignment to noncontact visiting was continued for six months. Each time the plaintiff\u2019s visiting status came up for review, intervening disciplinary incidents (including assaulting an inmate in another cell) caused the defendant to continue the assignment to the noncontact visiting room. The prohibition contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ued until July 23, 1991, when the new superintendent reinstated the plaintiffs contact visiting room status.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">2. <em>Qualified immunity. </em>The defendant argues that his motion for qualified immunity was erroneously denied and that this interlocutory appeal is properly before us. We note at the outset that the judge\u2019s order denying the motion for qualified immunity \u201cdid not conclude the plaintiffs action at the trial level, and in that sense it [is] not the sort of final judgment entitled to appellate review.\u201d <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Commrs. of Springfield, </em>401 Mass. 26, 30 (1987), cert, denied, 485 U.S. 906 (1988). However, the immunity created by the United States Supreme Court for application to suits brought under \u00a7 1983 is an immunity from suit, not merely from liability. The judge\u2019s order denying qualified immunity, therefore, is a final order under the rule of present execution, and it is the proper subject of an appeal. See <em>Breault, </em>401 Mass. at 31; <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>405 Mass. 43, 44 n.2 (1989); <em>Hopper </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>408 Mass. 621, 623-624 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Where public officials are performing a discretionary function, they may be shielded from civil liability in a \u00a7 1983 action by the doctrine of qualified immunity. <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818 &amp; n.30 (1982). <em>Breault, </em>401 Mass. at 31-32. See also <em>Gildea </em>v. <em>Ellershaw, </em>363 Mass. 800, 820 (1973). An official is entitled to immunity if, at the time of the performance of the discretionary act, the right infringed upon was not \u201cclearly established.\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. at 818. <em>Breault, </em>401 Mass. at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">(a) <em>Discretionary function. </em>That the defendant superintendent\u2019s actions were discretionary is plain from the full text of the regulation set out in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It vests in the superintendent broad discretion to determine when someone is a se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>curity risk for purposes of assigning them to noncontact visitation. There are no criteria listed for the superintendent to use in making the decision to assign an inmate to noncontact visitation. The decision on assignment is left to the superintendent\u2019s unfettered discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">(b) <em>Clearly established right. </em>We must next inquire whether the defendant\u2019s conduct nonetheless violated a clearly established right of the plaintiff. The Superior Court judge wrongly used a subjective standard to evaluate the defendant\u2019s behavior. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Harlow </em>rejected the inquiry into the actor\u2019s state of mind in favor of a wholly objective standard<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; officials \u201care shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. at 817-818. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Scherer, </em>468 U.S. 183, 191 (1984); <em>Breault, </em>401 Mass. at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The Federal due process clause does not in itself guarantee an inmate a right to unfettered visitation, let alone contact visitation. <em>Kentucky Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989). Moreover, officials sued for constitutional violations do not necessarily lose their qualified immunity merely because their conduct violates some statutory or administrative provision. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Scherer, </em>468 U.S. at 194 &amp; n.12. A State regulation may, however, create an enforceable liberty interest in a prison setting. <em>Kentucky Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>490 U.S. at 461. <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Worcester County, </em>415 Mass. 132, 142 (1993). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Thus, the plaintiff urges us to hold that he had a clearly established right to contact visitation because the regulation in question created a constitutionally protected liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">A regulation creates a constitutionally protected liberty interest when it uses \u201clanguage of an unmistakably mandatory character, requiring that certain procedures \u2018shall,\u2019 \u2018will,\u2019 or \u2018must\u2019 be employed.\u201d <em>Hewitt </em>v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 471 (1983). However, the mere fact that a regulation spells out a careful procedural structure does not indicate the existence of a liberty interest. <em>Id. </em>at 471. In <em>Hewitt </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201cwe are persuaded that the repeated use of explicitly mandatory language in connection with requiring specific substantive predicates demands a conclusion that the State has created a protected liberty interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">As discussed above, the regulation vests in the superintendent broad discretion to determine when someone is a security risk for purposes of assigning them to noncontact visitation. Nothing in the regulation states that the superintendent \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall\u201d do anything. The sole limit on the superintendent\u2019s discretion is that such assignment is not to be used for punishment. The granting language must use a more definite expression than appears here in order to create a constitutionally protected interest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly asserted the paramount need for prison officials to maintain security in their institutions. \u201c[A] prison\u2019s internal security is peculiarly a matter normally left to the discretion of prison administrators.\u201d <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 349 n.14 (1981). \u201cIn assessing the seriousness of a threat to institutional security, prison administrators necessarily draw on more than the specific facts surrounding a particular incident .... The judgment of prison officials in this context, like that of those making parole decisions, turns largely on \u2018purely subjective evaluations and on predictions of future behavior.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>459 U.S. at 474, quoting from <em>Connecticut Bd. of Pardons </em>v. <em>Dumschat, </em>452 U.S. 458, 464 (1981). The <em>Hewitt </em>Court also warned that caution should be exercised in transposing the reasoning from other cases in which regulations have been interpreted to create a liberty interest<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to a situation where the regulations in question govern the day-to-day administration of the prison system. <em>Id. </em>at 470. This \u201chands off\u2019 doctrine is a product of judicial deference to administrative expertise where the court\u2019s lack of expertise in penology could exacerbate disciplinary problems. See <em>McCloskey </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>337 F.2d 72, 74 (4th Cir. 1964); <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Kerner, </em>427 F.2d 71, 72-73 (7th Cir. 1970). See Hirschkop, The Rights of Prisoners, in The Rights of Americans 455 (Dorsen ed. 1971). In short, neither the language of the regulation nor the considerations dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>cussed above support the conclusion that a liberty interest was created by the noncontact visitation regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Since the defendant\u2019s actions were discretionary and they did not violate any clearly established rights of the plaintiff, qualified immunity was warranted. The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for qualified immunity is reversed, and judgment shall be entered dismissing the complaint.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">State officials are liable for damages under \u00a7 1983 only if they are sued in their individual or personal capacities. See <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Worcester County, </em>415 Mass. 132, 141 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Although it is unclear from the record (the defendant failed to include in the record appendix a copy of the motion the disposition of which he is appealing), we surmise from the motion judge\u2019s order and the inclusion of affidavits and exhibits with the \u201cmotion for qualified immunity\u201d that it was, essentially, a motion for summary judgment founded upon that the<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>ory. We have reviewed it accordingly. See <em>Cousineau </em>v. <em>Laramee, </em>388 Mass. 859, 860 n.2 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The defendant has not pursued his appeal from the denial of his motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim for money damages, and we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The plaintiff argues that the motion judge never specifically stated that his claim under the MCRA was dismissed at summary judgment. We think that the judge intended to dismiss this claim when she ruled for the defendant on the summary judgment motion. In any event, the plaintiff failed to allege facts that would state a claim under the MCRA, which requires interference with the plaintiffs civil rights by threats, intimidation, or coercion. See <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., </em>403 Mass. 713, 719-720 (1989); <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Wareham, </em>27 Mass.

For a discussion of this problem, see <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>813 F.2d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1987). At the heart of the dispute is the question whether mandatory language as described in <em>Hewitt </em>is absolutely necessary to create a liberty interest. For our purposes this distinction is not critical, as the language fails to create a liberty interest under either formulation of the test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b533-15\">Compare other language which was held to create a liberty interest: <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>795 F.2d 235, 237 (1st Cir. 1986) (\u201cthe superintendent <em>shall designate </em>such person or persons as he deems appropriate to review the status of inmates housed in detention in awaiting action on a weekly basis.
