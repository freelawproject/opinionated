(Blue Cross), based upon Blue Cross\u2019s refusal to enter into a contractual relationship with RANE. RANE relied on various statutes, which we shall discuss, and on G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>c. 93A. After a jury-waived trial, limited to the issue of liability, judgment was entered in favor of Blue Cross on all claims. On the unique and undisputed facts of this case, we conclude that Blue Cross had an obligation to enter into a contractual relationship with RANE. We therefore reverse the judgment and remand the case for an adjudication of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We summarize the pertinent facts found by the Superior Court judge as well as some uncontested facts set forth in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">RANE operates a freestanding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> facility, Merrimack Valley MRI, in Methuen which serves the Merrimack valley and southern New Hampshire. The facility has existed since 1987, but RANE assumed ownership in 1988. Under RANE\u2019s ownership, the facility was licensed by the Department of Public Health (department) on February 28, 1989, and began to serve patients on March 1, 1989. As a part of the licensure process, the department issued a \u201cdetermination of need\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for new technology, as mandated by G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 25C, in August 1988. The \u201cdetermination of need\u201d was subject to the condition that \u201c[f]or Massachusetts residents, RANE shall not consider ability to pay or insurance status in the patient selection process.\u201d Between its first day of operation and June 30, 1991, the facility conducted over 2,200 scans for the twenty percent of its patients who were Blue Cross subscribers. During this period, Blue Shield, and, after its merger with Blue Cross,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Blue Cross provided reimbursement for the professional component of the MRI, that is, the interpretation of the scans by radiologists. The technical component, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>i.e., the actual performance of the MRI scans, was not covered by the agreement and was not reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Blue Cross is a nonprofit hospital service corporation regulated by the Rate Setting Commission and governed under G. L. c. 176A. It provides coverage for the technical aspect of hospital (and other institutional) services and procedures. Blue Cross offers participating diagnostic imaging facility (DIF-1) agreements for MRI facilities seeking reimbursement for the technical component of their scans. The rates of payment specified in the contracts must be approved by the Rate Setting Commission. G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In the summer of 1989, RANE applied for a DIF-1 contract with Blue Cross. RANE completed Blue Cross\u2019s written application, and a Blue Cross reviewer, Evelyn Callahan, conducted an on-site assessment of the facility. Blue Cross informed RANE that, to qualify for a DIF-1 contract, it would have to improve its medical necessity guidelines, its review procedures, and its clinical oversight committee. RANE complied, and, on August 16, 1989, Callahan acknowledged that it was in compliance with the requirements in the DIF-1 application. In October of 1989, however, Blue Cross suspended the processing of RANE\u2019s application \u201cpending review and/or resolution of issues Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. has with Northeast Rehab Hospital.\u201d In a letter dated February 7, 1990, Blue Cross explained that it was not in its \u201cbest business interests\u201d to accept RANE\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The majority of the limited partners of RANE, including Dr. Howard Gardner, were also limited partners in a limited partnership that has a forty-nine percent interest in the Northeast Rehabilitation Hospital (hospital). Since 1988, Blue Cross had an ongoing dispute with the hospital administrators, including Dr. Gardner, about the hospital\u2019s alleged failure to comply with Blue Cross\u2019s utilization review program and medical necessity requirements. The amount in dispute was $1.7 million, and Blue Cross was required to spend $104,000 to review the matter. Blue Cross and the hospital settled the dispute in 1993. Blue Cross\u2019s reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>refusing to enter into a DIF-1 contract with RANE was to avoid further dealings with the principals of RANE, who are associated with the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The judge recognized that two statutes, G. L. c. 176A and G. L. c. 176B, bore on the issue before her. According to G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 5, as appearing in St. 1969, c. 874, \u00a7 1: \u201cIn providing reimbursement for health services other than hospital services, any hospital service corporation may enter into contracts for the furnishing of such health services with providers thereof.\u201d General Laws c. 176B, \u00a7 4, as appearing in St. 1988, c. 23, \u00a7 59, governing medical service corporations, has comparable language: \u201c[a]ny medical service corporation may enter into contracts with . . . participating physicians, . . . and other providers of health services licensed under the laws of the commonwealth.\u201d General Laws c. 176B, \u00a7 4, however, also contains a clause that requires: \u201cno participating provider shall be denied the right to enter into any agreement with any medical service corporation by reason of any unfair or arbitrary discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The judge concluded, first, that RANE had no statutory right to enter into a DIF-1 contract with Blue Cross. She determined that G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4, had no application to RANE\u2019s claim as it applied only to professional providers and not to institutional providers. Relying on <em>Goddard Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>403 Mass. 736, 743-744 (1989), she interpreted G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 5, as allowing a hospital service corporation such as Blue Cross to exercise discretion whether to enter into a contract with a particular provider. With respect to RANE\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim (and its corresponding claim under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2), the judge concluded that Blue Cross\u2019s refusal of a contract was not an unfair or deceptive act or practice. The refusal, for the purpose of avoiding further dealings with individuals with whom Blue Cross had problems in the past, was not, in her view, arbitrary or unreasonable. The judge found no merit in the contention that other statutes afforded RANE the right to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>1. <em>RANE\u2019s rights under G. L. c. 176A. </em>RANE relies on this court\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4, which governs contracts between corporations such as Blue Cross and physicians and other professional providers, to argue that Blue Cross cannot deny RANE a contract by reason of any unfair or arbitrary discrimination. See <em>Blue Shield of Mass. </em>v. <em>Board of Review in the Div. of Ins., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 167 (1986). RANE acknowledges, in its brief, that G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 5, which governs contracts between nonprofit hospital service corporations and institutional providers, rather than G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4, is applicable to this dispute but argues that our interpretation of G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4, compels a similar reading of G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The absence of an express prohibition against \u201cunfair or arbitrary discrimination\u201d in the award of contracts in G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 5, distinguishes it from G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4. Indeed, the language authorizing Blue Cross to enter into contracts with institutional providers is permissive, and, in different contexts, it has been recognized that such relationships are \u201cvoluntary on both sides.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercy Hosp., </em>364 Mass. 515, 518 (1974). Cf. <em>Goddard Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>403 Mass. at 743-744. We, thus, acknowledge that Blue Cross generally may exercise its reasonable discretion in determining whether to enter into a contract with a particular institutional health care provider under G. L. c. 176A.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We do not think, however, the instant case falls within the general rule. RANE\u2019s application for a \u201cdetermination of need\u201d from the Department of Public Health was approved on August 11, 1988, on the express condition that RANE \u201cshall not consider ability to pay or insurance status in the patient selection process.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 100 (1986). RANE, therefore, was obliged to serve patients who were Blue Cross subscribers. Blue Cross was aware of the condition imposed on RANE and of the fact that its sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>scribers were receiving MRI scans (a total of 2,200 of them over a two-year period) from RANE. Blue Shield properly paid the physicians who evaluated the MRI scans. During the same period, Blue Cross paid nothing for the technical component of the same scans. There is no dispute that RANE satisfied all of Blue Cross\u2019s generally applicable criteria for MRI providers. To the extent that Blue Cross subscribers were entitled to the technical services and received them from RANE, and RANE was not compensated for them, RANE suffered a loss, and Blue Cross received a windfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">But for the statutory scheme, in such a situation we might be inclined to rule in RANE\u2019s favor and award the fair value of its services on the basis of the traditional common law theory of unjust enrichment. Restatement of Restitution \u00a7 1 (1936). Cf. <em>Salamon </em>v. <em>Terra, </em>394 Mass. 857, 859 (1985). The statute, however, contemplates reimbursement of certain providers without a contract only in very limited circumstances not present here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Considering the over-all regulatory scheme and the interests of fairness, we think this case presents an exception to the general rule in G. L. c. 176A, \u00a7 5, that Blue Cross may refuse to enter into a contract with an institutional provider. We conclude that, for a period at least as long as RANE was required to, and did, serve Blue Cross subscribers, and so long as RANE satisfied Blue Cross\u2019s criteria for MRI services, Blue Cross had an obligation to offer RANE a DIF-1 contract so that it could be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">2. <em>RANE\u2019s claims under G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2. </em>There is ample support in the record for the crucial underlying facts found by the judge with respect to the G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>c. 93A claim: that Blue Cross refused to enter into a DIF-1 contract with RANE based upon its experience with another hospital, some of whose principals were also principals of RANE, and its interest in avoiding costly disputes in the future. The judge heard the witnesses and considered a substantial amount of documentary evidence, and we cannot say her conclusions that Blue Cross did not act arbitrarily and did not engage in any unfair or deceptive act or practice were clearly erroneous. See, e.g., <em>Levings </em>v. <em>Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 498, 504 (1979). We agree with the judge that none of the other statutes relied upon by RANE provides a basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Accordingly, we remand the case to the Superior Court for a determination of damages due RANE for Blue Cross\u2019s failure to enter into a DIF-1 contract with RANE. As to the other counts of the complaint, we affirm the judgment for Blue Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">An MRI provides an image of the body through the use of magnetic fields, radiowaves, and computer reconstruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The department\u2019s determination of need is based on the proposed facility\u2019s financial and operational feasibility, the need in the community, and an assessment of alternative ways of meeting the health care needs of the population involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\">A merger between Blue Cross and Blue Shield was approved by the Legislature in 1988.
