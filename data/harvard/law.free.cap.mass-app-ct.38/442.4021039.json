L. c. 231, \u00a7 103, to remove his case from the District Court, where the action was commenced, to the Superior Court for a jury trial there.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">The plaintiff filed a complaint for damages in a District Court in Essex County naming the two defendants in separate counts. A jury trial of a civil matter so filed is available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>by statute. G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 19B. The plaintiffs claim arose from a motor vehicle accident. The matter was tried before a District Court judge who ordered judgment for the plaintiff and awarded damages of $1,136. On motion by the plaintiff, the matter was on December 15, 1993, removed to the Superior Court for a jury trial pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 103, whereupon the defendants moved for dismissal of the complaint for failure of the plaintiff properly to preserve his \u00a7 103 rights. A Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the claim and also denied the plaintiffs motion filed January 25, 1994, for leave to amend his complaint to add a claim for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The plaintiff appeals from those rulings and from the dismissal of his appeal. He maintains, first, that the language in the complaint was sufficiently strong and unambiguous so as to put the defendants on notice that he intended to preserve his right to a jury trial in the Superior Court and, second, that the policy favoring liberal rights to amend pleadings, Mass.R.Civ.P. 15(a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), entitled him to allowance of his motion to amend the original complaint to add a claim for jury trial in the Superior Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">1. <em>The alleged claim of a jury trial. </em>General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 103, as amended through St. 1987, c. 251, \u00a7 1, reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\u201cIf a party elects to bring in any district court any action or other civil proceeding which he might have begun in the superior court, he shall be deemed to have waived a trial by jury and his right of appeal to the superior court, unless within thirty days of commencement of the action or service of a responsive pleading, or within such further time as the court may allow, a plaintiff files a claim to a jury trial in the superior court with the district court and within thirty days after notice of the decision or finding files an entry fee of fifty dollars and bond in accordance with the second paragraph of section one hundred and four. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6m\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>When filed in the District Court, the complaint was unaccompanied by any separate document or notice demanding a trial by jury either in the District or Superior Court, or otherwise preserving the right to remove the case to the Superior Court for jury trial there. Nor was separate notice filed with the District Court within thirty days following commencement of the action or service of the defendant\u2019s responsive pleading. Thus, we are left with examining the complaint document itself to see what, if any, notice is contained therein. The complaint comprises two pages and ten numbered paragraphs. The first six paragraphs name the parties, briefly describe the motor vehicle accident, and claim injury, loss of wages, earning capacity, and so forth on the part of the plaintiff as against Janet Needham, the operator of one of the motor vehicles involved in the accident. Inserted between paragraphs six and seven is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">\u201cWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, James Islami, demands judgment against the Defendant, Janet E. Need-ham, in an amount to be determined by a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Paragraph ten, on the other hand, is followed by this notation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">\u201cWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Janet Islami |&gt;zc], demands judgment against the Defendant, James [\u00edzc] S. Cullen, in an amount to be determined by the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The complaint is signed by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The document appears to have been hastily prepared, evidenced by the misprinted names of two of the parties in the second prayer for relief and by the omission of a separate \u201cCount I\u201d caption despite the appearance of a portion of the complaint that is captioned \u201cCount II.\u201d More important, however, the actual prayers for relief that are so crucial in divining the plaintiff\u2019s intentions are ambiguous and lend themselves to different readings. If we consider the exact wording in the first prayer, for example, does the plaintiff demand a jury trial for assessment of damages only, leaving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>questions of negligence, causation, and so forth to be determined through a bench trial, or perhaps by stipulation? Reading the two prayers together, is a jury trial (of whatever scope) to involve Janet Needham, but not John Cullen, against whom damages are \u201cto be determined <em>by the CourtV </em>Or does the plaintiff intend a jury trial against both defendants? Finally, is a jury trial requested in the Superior Court, or in the District Court division in Essex County where the action was commenced?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Article 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights guarantees the right to trial by jury of civil controversies such as this. <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>214 Mass. 335, 336 (1913). See Mass.R.Civ.P. 38(a), 365 Mass. 800 (1974) (\u201cThe right of trial by jury as declared by Part 1, Article 15 of the Constitution . . . shall be preserved to the parties inviolate\u201d). The Legislature, by statute, or the court, by rule, may regulate the mode or manner by which the right is exercised. <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., supra. </em>Notice of a demand for jury trial, when timely filed in the manner prescribed by statute or rule, \u201cneed not be cast in any particular form so long as it is sufficient to convey to the clerk and to the opposing party the intention of the party that he desires a jury trial.\u201d Nolan, Civil Practice \u00a7 514 (2d ed. 1992). The notice, however, \u201cshould be conspicuous in form and certain in terms.\u201d <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., supra. </em>See also <em>Shields </em>v. <em>LeBrecht, </em>345 Mass. 354, 355 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Even were we to assume that the statement following paragraph six was sufficient to constitute a claim for trial by jury, we are unable to conclude that the jury referred to was the jury available in the Superior Court. There are sound reasons to interpret a demand for jury trial, unspecific as to forum, as a demand for a District Court jury-of-six trial where that is available. The six-person jury statutes (see G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 19A [Worcester County], and \u00a7 19B [Essex County]) were intended to reduce the inefficiencies, both to the parties and the judicial system, inherent in a system of multiple trials of the same action. In a pleading where no court is mentioned other than the District Court, we interpret a jury demand to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>be a claim to a District Court trial by a jury of six (provided that one is available).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">It follows that, in the instant case, the plaintiff did not make a claim of jury trial in the Superior Court, and that any claim he may have made for trial by a jury of six in the District Court was waived by his proceeding to a bench trial of the claim, without objection. See <em>Walcott </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>163 Mass. 21, 22 (1895); Nolan, Civil Practice, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Because the case was not transferable to the Superior Court, we are not required to consider the plaintiff\u2019s argument that that court erred in denying his motion to amend. The order entered in the Superior Court dismissing the appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
