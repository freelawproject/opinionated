L. c. 152, \u00a7 18, to John Roumeliotis (employee).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute provides, among other things, that \u201c[i]f an insured employer contracts to have part of his work done by an uninsured independent contractor and an employee of such an uninsured independent contractor suffers an industrial injury, . . . the [insured employer] must pay the compensation provided by the act .... To come within the statute, the particular activity in which the employees of an independent contractor are engaged must be a \u2018part of or process in\u2019 the trade or business conducted by the insured principal and not \u2018merely ancillary and incidental\u2019 thereto.\u201d Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 152, at 162 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The facts underlying the controversy are not in dispute. The employee was employed by George Popa, doing business as Huntington Auto Service (Popa), a sole proprietorship located at 670 Huntington Avenue, Boston. Popa was in the business of selling gasoline, and providing automobile repair and towing services. On April 22, 1983, Popa entered into a contract with Mobil in which Popa agreed to purchase between 300,000 and 600,000 gallons of gasoline per year from Mobil for a period of three years beginning May 1, 1983, and ending April 30, 1986. Popa also entered into a contract with Mobil, entitled \u201cSign and equipment rent rider,\u201d in which Popa agreed to lease one twelve foot sign and one im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>printer from Mobil for a lease period beginning May 1, 1983, to continue for a period of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">On November 2, 1984, the employee was working at the service station. A robbery occurred during which the employee was assaulted and severely beaten resulting in serious injuries. Popa, at the time of the employee\u2019s injuries, was without workers\u2019 compensation coverage in violation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The employee filed a claim against Mobil, contending th\u00e1t G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18, controlled the matter. After a conference (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A), the employee\u2019s claim was denied. The employee appealed and, after a hearing, an administrative judge ruled against him. The employee then filed an appeal with the board. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The board, in a two-to-one decision, reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision. The majority ruled that Popa was an independent contractor engaged by Mobil to do its work. The majority further ruled that the work performed by Popa was part of Mobil\u2019s business and was not merely ancillary and incidental to Mobil\u2019s business. In contrast, the administrative law judge who wrote the minority opinion stated that Popa was not an independent contractor and that the relationship between Popa and Mobil was that of buyer and seller. The minority judge also ruled that there was a lack of proof as to whether Popa was doing Mobil\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">As a result of the board\u2019s decision, the matter was remanded to the administrative judge to determine the employee\u2019s average weekly wages and to enter an appropriate order consistent with the board\u2019s opinion. Mobil, however, filed an appeal of the board\u2019s decision and also filed a motion requesting a stay of judgment pending an appeal. A single justice of this court allowed the motion for a stay of judgment and the employee filed an appeal regarding the allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>anee of the stay. The single justice consolidated both appeals and reported the matters to the full bench. No judgment has been entered as to the board\u2019s decision ruling against Mobil and, therefore, Mobil\u2019s appeal is interlocutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We deem the report of the single justice to be a grant of leave to take an interlocutory appeal of the board\u2019s decision to the full bench, and, therefore, we consider the merits of the board\u2019s decision concluding that Mobil was liable to the employee under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18. Because of our decision, the employee\u2019s appeal from the single justice\u2019s order granting a stay of the judgment is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The first issue to be resolved is whether Popa is \u201ca dealer buying and selling petroleum products in his own right... or an independent contractor doing part of [Mobil\u2019s] work.\u201d Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 152, at 163. In determining whether the service station owner is an independent contractor doing part of the oil company\u2019s business, a key factor is the amount of control that the oil company exerts over the operator of the service station.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The relationship between Popa and Mobil closely resembles the one described in <em>Whitehouse </em>v. <em>Cities Serv. Oil Co., </em>315 Mass. 108 (1943). In <em>Whitehouse, </em>the injured worker was employed by Albert Culver Co. (Culver), a distributor of, among other things, petroleum products. Culver had entered into a contract with Cities Service Oil Company (Cities Service) to buy certain petroleum products from Cities Service. The employee was injured on Cities Service\u2019s premises and brought a tort action against that company. Cities Service, as a defense, claimed that Culver had entered into a contract to perform Cities Service\u2019s work and, therefore, argued that the \u201ccommon employment doctrine\u201d of the worker\u2019s compensation act barred the employee\u2019s action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court addressed the issue of the relationship between Culver and Cities Service to determine \u201cwhether the stipulated facts, which included the written contract, were sufficient to support the contention of [Cities Service], or at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>sufficient to present a question of fact, that Culver was an independent contractor performing the oil company\u2019s work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The court observed that Cities Service controlled certain aspects of Culver\u2019s operation of its business through various conditions stated in the contract. The court noted that \u201c[t]he goods that Culver bought from [Cities Service] were to be resold only in the territory described in the contract at prices posted by [Cities Service], and a provision was required in all [of the contracts that Cities Service made] with its customers that they could resell only at the said posted prices.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, Culver \u201cagreed to paint its bulk and service stations, station equipment, pumps and tank trucks in the customary colors employed by [Cities Service].\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The court, in reaching its decision, recited other stipulated facts concerning the relationship between Cities Service and Culver. It noted that Culver bought and paid for goods that it purchased from Cities Service. The goods belonged to Culver, and it could resell them to any customer it chose within the territory described in the contract. The proceeds of its sales belonged to Culver. It was under no obligation to furnish Cities Service with a list of customers or in any way to account to Cities Service for any transaction Culver had with its customers. <em>Ibid. </em>The court concluded, based on the contract and the stipulated facts, that \u201cCulver conducted its own business, selling to its own customers and receiving as its only compensation whatever profits accrued from the business. Culver was paid nothing by [Cities Service]. No part of the regular business of [Cities Service] was entrusted to Culver .... [T]he only relationship that [the contract] created was that of buyer and seller.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Here, the contract contained some conditions imposed by Mobil on Popa\u2019s operation of his gasoline station. It required Popa, among other things, (1) to render \u201cprompt, fair, courteous and efficient service\u201d and not to engage in unethical or deceptive practices in the conduct of its business; (2) to comply strictly with all terms, conditions, requirements, and provisions regarding the use of Mobil credit cards; and (3) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>use Mobil\u2019s trademarks and brand names to identify Mobil\u2019s products. The contract, as the majority opinion states, also \u201cidentifies as the \u2018very essence of this contract\u2019 that [Popa] is obligated to conduct its own business according to Mobil requirements in order \u2018to promote the sale of [Mobil] products and to refrain from conduct that would lower public acceptance of Mobil\u2019s branded dealers.\u2019 [Popa] is obligated \u2018to conduct its business so as to meet or exceed [Mobil\u2019s] high standards.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The contract, however, did not require Mobil to pay Popa for any work that Popa might perform; rather, Popa was required to pay Mobil for the purchase of gasoline. Further, as the administrative law judge who dissented from the board\u2019s decision notes, \u201cMobil neither owns nor leases the property, has no right to inspect or supervise, and has no control over the retail price of its gasoline, the hours of operation, the hiring or training of employees, the vehicle service operation, or other products [Popa] might sell or lease.\u201d The fact that Popa rented a Mobil sign and was required by the contract to use Mobil\u2019s trademarks and brand names to identify Mobil\u2019s products is not controlling. Such trademarks and signs represent nothing more than a \u201cstatement that [Mobil] gasoline was sold at the station.\u201d <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Texas Co., </em>340 Mass. 606, 608-609 (1960). We conclude that Mobil did not hire Popa as an independent contractor to do part of Mobil\u2019s work. The sole relationship created by the contract was that of buyer and seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Moreover, the employee failed to demonstrate that Popa was engaged in doing Mobil\u2019s work. The purpose of \u00a7 18 is instructive on this point: \u201cto prevent... [an insured person] from escaping the obligation of the compensation act by <em>letting out a part of his work </em>to irresponsible subcontractors or independent contractors\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>318 Mass. 373, 375 (1945). Therefore, a significant consideration is whether the work contracted out to the independent contractor is the kind of work \u201ccustomarily . . . carried on as part of the business in which the insured is engaged.\u201d <em>Tindall </em>v. <em>Denholm &amp; McKay Co., </em>347 Mass. 100, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>105 (1964). See <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 218 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The opinion of the majority of the board states, among other things, that Popa is performing Mobil\u2019s work because \u201cMobil is engaged in marketing its own products [and Popa] engages in selling those products to consumers, an essential component of the marketing function.\u201d But as the minority opinion points out \u201cevery major oil company engages in a <em>wholesale </em>merchandising function\u201d (emphasis supplied). In this matter, the question is whether Mobil, as part of its regular business, sold gasoline at <em>retail. </em>There was nothing in the record before the board that demonstrated that Mobil owned, leased, or operated gas stations or that it and its employees engaged in either the retail sale of gasoline or vehicle repairs in Massachusetts or anywhere else.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The decision of the Industrial Accident Reviewing Board is reversed. The matter is remanded to the board for the entry of an order dismissing the employee\u2019s action. The appeal from the single jutice\u2019s order denying a stay is dismissed, not on the merits, but because it is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 18, as amended through St. 1939, c. 93, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">\u201cIf an insured person enters into a contract, written or oral, with an independent contractor to do such person\u2019s work, or if such a contractor enters into a contract with a sub-contractor to do all or any part of the work comprised in such contract with the insured, and the insurer would, if such work were executed by employees immediately employed by the insured, be liable to pay compensation under this chapter to those employees, the insurer shall pay to such employees any compensation which would be payable to them under this chapter if the independent or sub-contractors were insured persons ....
