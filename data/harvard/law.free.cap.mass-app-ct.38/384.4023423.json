A Suffolk County jury found the defendant guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>on the first of three indictments,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> each charging the defendant with rape of a child under sixteen years of age with force (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A). The defendant appeals, claiming, among other things, reversible error in the admission of certain expert testimony of a police officer, Sergeant Marie Donahue.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">From the evidence admitted at the trial, the jury could have found the following facts. The three separate acts of rape by the defendant occurred in the home of Mary\u2019s Aunt Marilyn during August (twice) and September (once), 1990, when Mary was eleven years old. Mary was staying with her aunt while her mother was in the hospital and, afterwards while her mother was recuperating at home. In each instance, Mary was awakened by the defendant, who was on top of her; her pants were pulled down to her ankles, and the defendant was penetrating her. Mary\u2019s younger brother witnessed one of the incidents, but he was unable to identify the date of the incident. There were no witnesses to the other two events.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Mary did not tell anyone about the incidents until January, 1991. Her disclosure was precipitated by a friend\u2019s unsolicited statement that she had been raped by the defendant. Mary then told her mother that she had been raped by the defendant, but she did not provide any details.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">On cross-examination Mary admitted that each time she was raped, she told the defendant to stop, and cried; yet her cousin, who was her close friend and who was asleep a few feet away, never woke up. Nor did Mary wake her cousin up after the event to tell her what had happened. Mary also acknowledged that each time she awoke from sleep only when the defendant was raping her, and not when the defendant was pulling down bottom clothes. The defendant also brought out minor inconsistencies between the events she described at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the first trial of this case<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and her description of events at the trial of this case. Further, after the first incident, Mary continued to return to her aunt\u2019s house, even though she knew the defendant would be there, and even though she could have stayed with other relatives who lived close by.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The defendant called Sergeant Marie Donahue of the Boston police department, sexual assault unit, to whom Mary had spoken in March, 1991. Donahue testified that Mary had identified each of the three rooms in her aunt\u2019s house where she was raped in August and September. Donahue\u2019s description of what Mary had told her differed from what Mary had testified to on direct examination. Mary told Donahue that the place of the first rape was her cousin\u2019s bedroom on the third floor, that the second rape occurred on the sofa in the living room on the ground floor, and that the third rape occurred in her aunt\u2019s bedroom on the second floor. On direct examination, however, Mary had testified that the first rape occurred on the couch in the downstairs living room; the second rape occurred on the floor in the hallway outside of her aunt\u2019s second-floor bedroom, and the third rape occurred in her cousin\u2019s third-floor room. Thus, Mary had told Donahue one sequence of places where the rapes had occurred, while on direct examination Mary testified to a different sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">It was in this context that the prosecutor began his cross-examination of Donahue. He started with two questions about the sergeant\u2019s \u201ctraining as a sexual assault officer\u201d and then asked whether she had investigated other allegations of sexual abuse. The defendant objected because \u201c[t]his is not relevant to anything.\u201d At sidebar, the prosecutor explained that he wished to elicit testimony that \u201cit\u2019s not unusual for children not to be consistent in terms of times, places.\u201d The defendant objected that the sergeant was not an expert, to which the judge responded, \u201cIf you want counsel to develop her experience in dealing with sexual abuse, I bet you he\u2019ll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>be able to do it, because I heard it in the last case she testified in here before. This woman is unbelievably experienced in this area, unbelievably.\u201d The colloquy at sidebar then continued as set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The thrust of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ant\u2019s objection was that Donahue would be commenting on the credibility of Mary.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the Commonwealth proceeded to establish that the sergeant supervised six detectives who investigate sexual assault, that she had conducted \u201chundreds\u201d of investigations herself, and that she always spoke with the child complainants. The Commonwealth\u2019s cross-examination then proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">Q. \u201cAnd, when you speak with children, is it unusual for them to remember the exact date when an incident takes place that they\u2019re referring to?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">Defense Counsel: \u201cObjection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">The Court: \u201cOverruled. You may have it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">A. \u201cBased on my experience, unless the incident happened that particular day that they are telling me, <em>it\u2019s highly unusual that they remember dates and times and </em>sequences\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">Q. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">A. \u201cBased on their tender years, the trauma that they\u2019ve gone through, the emotional state that they\u2019re in, and based on their tender years, it\u2019s very unusual that a child would remember dates and times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-12\">Q. \u201cAs well as sequences, you\u2019ve testified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-13\">A. \u201cSequence. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-14\">Q. \u201cWhen you say \u2018sequence,\u2019 could you describe what you mean by it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-15\">A. \u201cWhen an incident took place. For example, if incidents took place over a number of time[s], which time would be the first, sequence meaning which would take place in a specific pattern. <em>It would be difficult for a child to remember the specific incidents and the specific times, specific places where it happened and things like that\" </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Although the judge ruled (based on his experience in another case involving the testimony of Donahue) that Donahue\u2019s proffered testimony regarding sex abuse victims was admissible because Donahue was an expert in such matters, Donahue \u201cwas not presented to the jury as an expert, and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury were barren of any reference to experts or expert testimony . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 207 (1990).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Donahue appeared to the jury as a lay witness, and, as in <em>Wolcott </em>at 207, we must assess her testimony against \u201cthe basic requirement that lay witnesses confine their testimony to what they have themselves gleaned by the use of their senses . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Putting to one side the difficulty that the judge\u2019s ruling placed an assessment of Donahue\u2019s qualifications beyond the reach of the jury and of an appellate court, see <em>id., </em>there is the fundamental difficulty that the purpose and thrust of Donahue\u2019s testimony \u2014 like the testimony of the investigating sergeant in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 502-504 (1991) \u2014 was to make Mary\u2019s testimony \u201ccredible on the theory that the irregularities in [Mary\u2019s] statements were consistent with the manner in which truthful victims of sexual assault relate their experiences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We recognize that often \u201cthe line between proper testimony as to patterns of disclosure of child sexual abuse victims and improper testimony constituting endorsement of the credibility of a victim-witness,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 140, 148 (1994), presents a close ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>tion. But the facts in this case bear a remarkable resemblance to the facts in <em>Montanino, </em>where the verdict was set aside. In <em>Montanino, </em>the investigating sergeant\u2019s testimony described the behavior of \u201cmost\u201d sexual assault victims. Here, the testimony of the investigating sergeant described the behavior of sexual assault victims in terms of whether the behavior under discussion would be \u201chighly unusual.\u201d Indeed, Donahue testified that for a child to remember the \u201cspecific places where [the specific incidents] happened\u201d \u2014 the precise point of vulnerability of Mary\u2019s testimony \u2014 would be \u201cdifficult.\u201d As in <em>Montanino, supra </em>at 504, \u201cthe impact on the jury of [Donahue\u2019s] observations regarding sexual assault victims had the same effect as if [Donahue] had directed [her] comments specifically to [Mary\u2019s] credibility.\u201d Whether Donahue is considered a lay witness or an expert witness, her testimony violated the rule that witnesses may not offer their opinions regarding the credibility of another witness. Since Mary was the key prosecution witness, her credibility was a crucial issue. \u201cThe improper use of Sgt. [Donahue\u2019s] opinion testimony to bolster [Mary\u2019s] testimony was error requiring reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504-505. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colin C., </em>419 Mass. 54, 61 (1994) (reversible error to allow psychiatrist\u2019s opinion that the complainant was sexually abused; the testimony was essentially a statement vouching for the credibility of the complainant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. 750, 759-760 (1995) (physician\u2019s testimony that symptoms and physical condition of child were consistent with type of sexual abuse child alleged held erroneously admitted); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lorette, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 736, 738-740 (1994) (reversible error to allow mother\u2019s testimony that her child\u2019s statements made \u201ceverything just fit\u201d). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>417 Mass. 536, 539, 543 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The Commonwealth argues that if there was error it was harmless because the jury returned a verdict on the \u201conly charge\u201d corroborated by the evidence (the complainant\u2019s brother testified that on one occasion he saw the defendant on top of his sister \u201chumping\u201d her, and he heard her say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201cstop\u201d). As we said at the outset, there were two identically worded indictments charging a rape in August, 1990; the third indictment charged a rape in September, 1990. The jury found the defendant guilty of the first of the two indictments charging an August rape. The complainant\u2019s brother was unable to identify the day or month of the event he allegedly witnessed. As we noted earlier, Mary told Donahue that the rape in the living room was the <em>second </em>offense, while she testified on direct examination that the rape in the living room was the <em>first </em>offense. The same difficulty adheres to the mother\u2019s fresh complaint testimony; Mary told her mother that she had been raped by the defendant but no more. The result is that the brother enhanced Mary\u2019s credibility only with regard to one unidentified episode. The jury\u2019s verdict remains inscrutable. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 65, 70 (1994) (police officers with extensive experience in sex abuse cases likely to be viewed by jury as especially qualified to judge the credibility of children). We conclude that the judgment may have been \u201csubstantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 149, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In the event this case is retried,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we comment briefly on an issue likely to arise. As we noted earlier, Mary\u2019s first disclosure of the alleged abuse was prompted by the unsolicited statement of a friend that she had been raped by the defendant. After Mary\u2019s credibility had been challenged by cross-examination pointing out certain inconsistencies in her testimony and her failure to disclose the alleged abuse for approximately six months, the Commonwealth was entitled to have Mary explain \u201cwhy, after a long period of silence, she complained of the defendant\u2019s conduct to her mother.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875, 881 (1984). The statement of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d was admissible for that limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>purpose, and the judge immediately gave limiting instructions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The defendant also claims error in the prosecutor\u2019s summation. We have reviewed the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. We do not agree that it appealed excessively to the sympathy of the jury. In any event the point does not warrant extended discussion. At the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s summation, the defendant objected on the ground that the prosecutor\u2019s comments excessively appealed to the sympathy of the jury. The judge suggested that the defendant wait until the conclusion of his charge to the jury, and \u201c[i]f you have a problem that I didn\u2019t cover one of these issues, because my charge is given slow and accurate to this jury, why don\u2019t we just chat about it and I\u2019ll entertain whatever suggestions you wish to amend. Is that satisfactory?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d At the end of the judge\u2019s instructions, the defendant did not make any objections or recommendations for a further charge on that point. The objection was not preserved. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toro, </em>395 Mass. 354, 359-360 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Upon retrial, any expert witnesses \u201cshould not be permitted to opine as to whether [the complainant\u2019s] behavior or condition in any way conformed to or was consistent with the general characteristics of a sexually abused child.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 433, 445 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the verdict is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The third indictment charged two counts of rape, the first by natural sexual intercourse, and the second by unnatural sexual intercourse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The defendant was first tried from April 30, 1992, to May 6, 1992.

While I agree that Sergeant Donahue\u2019s testimony should have been excluded, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 502-504 (1991), in my view the improper admission did not constitute prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. 347, 352 n.5 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The victim\u2019s testimony and her account as related to Sergeant Donahue did not vary as to the number of rapes or in which rooms they had taken place \u2014 the living room (first floor), the hall near the aunt\u2019s bedroom (second floor) and the cousin\u2019s room (third floor). Although the inconsistency relied on by the defendant was the order or sequence in which the rapes occurred, what Sergeant Donahue told the jury was not, in my view, very significant. That children have difficulty with the concept of time is recognized by appellate courts, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gamache, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 805, 808-809 (1994), and is, I believe, undoubtedly within the ken of most jurors. This cannot be as readily said of the testimony in <em>Montanino, </em>where the police officer testified \u201cthat over the course of his interviews with sexual assault victims, \u2018most\u2019 victims eventually provided more details regarding the assault than they initially revealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">More important than the difference between the testimony of the police officer in <em>Montanino </em>and the police officer\u2019s testimony in this case is the strong corroboration here of the victim\u2019s testimony as to the rape in the living room. That incident was corroborated by the victim\u2019s brother, who at the time of the event was eight years old. He testified that, one night when he was in the kitchen, he saw the defendant \u201chumping\u201d his sister. The only incident he could have seen from the kitchen was the one on the first floor, the one identified by the victim as the first to occur. His testimony that he was sad and went home late that night after being hit by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>defendant was corroborated by his mother, who testified that during the period she was in bed after her hospitalization, her son, who had been staying with her sister, came home one night at one in the morning, the only time he had ever come home so late.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In light of this strong supporting testimony, which to me explains the jury\u2019s finding the defendant guilty on the first of the three indictments, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s holding that Donahue\u2019s testimony to the effect that children have difficulty in remembering dates and times and sequences could have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, 417 </em>Mass. 348, 353 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, </em>37 Mass.
