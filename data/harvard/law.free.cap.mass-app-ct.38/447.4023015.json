Harris \u2014 wanted to demolish several older buildings on his acre lot and build a new residence. The existing buildings, none of which, by common consent of the parties, has any historical significance, consist of a residential house, a detached garage and another out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>building. The one-acre lot is situated on Harris Meadow Lane, a part of the Old King\u2019s Highway Regional Historic District located in Barnstable, created twenty-one years ago by St. 1973, c. 470, as amended by St. 1975, c. 298 and 845; St. 1976, c. 273; St. 1977, c. 38 and c. 503; St. 1979, c. 631; and St. 1982, c. 338 (hereinafter the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Harris applied to the local committee for a certificate of demolition to remove the old buildings and for permission to build a new Cape Cod style home with an attached three-car garage. The committee approved both applications. During the reconstruction, Harris determined that the old garage was structurally sound and decided to convert it into a shed or studio. After a public hearing, the local committee denied Harris a certificate of appropriateness that would have enabled him to keep the shed on his lot. It also disallowed two design features of the house: a sky light and the garage doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Harris then exercised his rights under \u00a7 11 of the Act by appealing from the local committee\u2019s decision to the regional historic commission (commission). After a hearing, the commission reversed the local committee\u2019s decision regarding the skylight and the garage doors. As to the shed, Harris did not fare as well: the commission found that the local committee \u201cdid not act in an arbitrary, capricious or erroneous manner\u201d by denying Harris\u2019 application for a certificate of appropriateness.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Thereafter, Harris exercised his rights under the second paragraph of \u00a7 11 of the Act by appealing to the District Court of Barnstable. A judge of that court found facts and concluded that the local committee wrongly denied Harris the certificate of appropriateness for the shed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The same judge who had heard the case reported it to the Appellate Division, which, finding no error of law, dismissed the report. The commission appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Division.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>We begin with a brief overview of the mission of the agency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A principal role of the commission is to \u201cpromote the general welfare of the inhabitants [of the district] through preservation and protection of buildings, settings and places within [its] boundaries . . . through the development and maintenance of appropriate settings and exterior appearance of such buildings.\u201d St. 1982, c. 338, \u00a7 1. Under \u00a7 5 of the Act, each member town of the historical district is authorized to appoint a district committee consisting of five persons. Their role is to receive and evaluate applications for certificates of appropriateness. To assist the district committees, the commission \u2014 in 1983 \u2014 promulgated guidelines which are contained in a bulletin included in the record. According to the commission\u2019s guidelines, each application \u201cshall be judged on the criteria set forth in the Act under Section 10[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] including therein, but not limited to, historic value and significance, general design, arrangement . . . , relative size and settings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">At the heart of the dispute between Harris and the local committee is whether the size of Harris\u2019 new home combined with the shed, as an accessory building, was too large com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>pared to other homes in the district.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The local committee failed to follow the commission\u2019s rule published in the Old King\u2019s Highway Regional Historic District Bulletin, by neglecting to \u201cstate in writing the specific reasons for its [refusal to issue a certificate of appropriateness].\u201d However, as noted in the judge\u2019s decision, the committee determined that the \u201csizing, massing, bulk, and scale\u201d of the new home combined with the shed worked against the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. The judge reversed the commission\u2019s decision, ruling in part that the decision of the local committee was in excess of its authority. In careful findings, he rejected the commission\u2019s position that the entire project was too big. Based largely on a view taken of Harris\u2019 property and other homes around the locus, he found that the project was no larger than the other homes in the immediate area. He also found that it was characteristic of the older homes in the district to have outbuildings. That finding runs contrary to the testimony of the commission\u2019s consultant, who opined at trial that such structures detracted from the historical character of the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">As might be expected, Harris\u2019 evidence on the point differed from that of the commission. An architectural designer testified that the word \u201cmassing\u201d cannot be defined architecturally, but that he understood the term to mean a building\u2019s three dimensional qualities such as height, width and length as well as a building\u2019s articulation, configuration and fenestration. He rendered an opinion that the mass of this property would not be inconsistent with other older buildings in the area. He also testified that numerous other properties in the immediate area have accessory buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">After observing the property from the vantage point of Old King\u2019s Highway (Route 6A), the judge found the house barely noticeable and the shed completely hidden from view. From Harris Meadow Lane, he found that the lower grade of the lot minimized the visual impact of the house. The old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>garage had been moved to the rear side of the lot, and was not visible from the front of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The authority of a District Court judge when reviewing the commission\u2019s decision is \u201canalogous to that governing exercise of the power to grant or deny special permits\u201d under local zoning regulations. See and compare <em>Gumley </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Nantucket, </em>371 Mass. 718, 719 (1977).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court judge must affirm the commission\u2019s decision unless on the facts found by the judge, the commission \u201cshould have concluded that the local committee exceeded its authority, exercised poor judgment, or was arbitrary, capricious, or erroneous in its action.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Old King\u2019s Hy. Regional Historic Dist. Commn., </em>397 Mass. 609, 611 (1986).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As noted, the judge found that it was a feature of the homes in the area to have outbuildings. None of the experts\u2019 conclusions, of course, is binding on the trier of fact, and they may be rejected in whole or in part. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>288 Mass. 402, 408 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Further, he found that there was \u201clittle indication at the appeal hearing (and nothing in writing from the [local] Committee) as to how the shed/studio did not conform to the Historic District Commission mandate.\u201d \u201c[Findings which rest on a view are sometimes unassailable, unless the record is made to reflect the particular observances which underlie the findings.\u201d <em>Consiglio </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 135, 138 (1981). We conclude that the judge\u2019s findings have adequate support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Substantial deference ought to be afforded to the determination of appropriateness or lack thereof by the commission. However, the discretion of the commission and of the town committee is not without bounds. Section 11 of the Act permits the court to \u201cissue such superceding approval or denial of the application with such condition as said district court in its discretion deems appropriate, and [the court] shall have all of the powers to act in the matter that are available to a court of general equity jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">A principal purpose of the Act is to harmonize buildings located in the historic area and to suppress the obviously incongruous. <em>Sleeper </em>v. <em>Old King\u2019s Hy. Regional Historic Dist. Commn., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 571, 574 (1981). We do not construe the Act as requiring that the architectural and cultural motif be frozen at a particular moment in the history of Cape Cod. The mandate of the Act is not that one sort of design or configuration be preserved to the exclusion of another, but that the cultural heritage in its entirety be preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We conclude, therefore, that there is no rational basis for the district committee\u2019s decision. See <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Health Facilities Appeals Bd., 20 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 531, 534 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\u201cThis court\u2019s review is on the District Court report,\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Old King\u2019s Hy.

After the fact, that is, after the house and garage were built, the plaintiff wanted to retain the shed, but the committee refused permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">As a person aggrieved by a local committee\u2019s determination, the plaintiff appealed to the regional commission. Recognizing that its \u201cinitial function is not to exercise its independent judgment on the facts, but rather to determine whether the local committee erred in some respect,\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Old King\u2019s Hy. Regional Historic Dist. Commn., </em>397 Mass. 609, 611 (1986), the commission, after hearing, up-, held the committee with regard to the shed. In its decision, the commission noted that the committee had explained its denial by pointing out that the original plan \u201cde-emphasized the massing and size of the home,\u201d that, in any event, new construction of three car garages are discouraged, and that the three car garage and additional outbuilding were \u201cjust too much.\u201d The representative of the committee also testified before the commission that the \u201cultimate issue was not design, per se, but historic compatibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Aggrieved again, the plaintiff appealed to the local District Court. That court is to hear evidence and determine the facts using a standard of review \u201canalogous to that governing exercise of the power to grant or deny special permits.\u201d <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 611. \u201cThus the judge must affirm the regional commission\u2019s decision unless, on the facts found by the judge, the commission should have concluded that the local committee exceeded its authority, exercised poor judgment, or was arbitrary, capricious, or erroneous in its action.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is the committee\u2019s evaluation, and not the judges\u2019s, of the historic compatibility of the buildings with the tradition of the county as it existed in the early days of Cape Cod which is controlling. See <em>Subaru of New England </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 488 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">As stated in the report to the Appellate Division, there was evidence before the judge from a consultant in historic preservation that outbuildings were built in the post-World War II period and that such buildings did not exist at the turn of the century. The consultant noted that the original application was for the demolition of a single-family house with detached outbuildings and their replacement with a single-family house with an attached garage. Now sought, was a single-family house with an attached garage and with a detached outbuilding. In her opinion, this design was not appropriate to the historic character of the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The District Court judge did not dispute the consultant\u2019s testimony. Indeed in his report setting forth the relevant evidence, he indicated that the evidence \u201ctended to show\u201d what he summarized as the consultant\u2019s testimony. In his findings, which under \u00a7 11 of the act are conclusive, the judge primarily discussed the limited visual impact of the shed-studio and noted that \u201cit appears to be more of a characteristic of the older homes to have an outbuilding.\u201d The judge did not explain what his reference to \u201colder homes\u201d meant, and, except for noting the consultant\u2019s testimony, he did not in any way discuss the historic compatibility of the lot\u2019s buildings with the tradition of the county in the early days.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Since on the evidence found by the judge there was a basis for the committee\u2019s determination of historic incompatibility, and since such a decision is for the committee and not the District Court judge, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that there was no rational basis for the committee\u2019s denial of the certificate of appropriateness. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the District Court judge that the decision of the local committee, as ratified by the commission, was \u201cin excess of its authority in that it is arbitrary, and in accordance with the purposes of the Old King\u2019s Highway Regional Historic District Act.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In its entirety, \u00a7 1 of the Act entitled \u201cpurpose\u201d reads as follows: \u201cThe purpose of this [A]ct is to promote the general welfare of the inhabitants of the applicable regional member towns so included, through the promotion of the educational, cultural, economic, aesthetic and literary significance through the preservation and protection of buildings, settings and places within the boundaries of the regional district and through the development and maintenance of appropriate settings and the exterior appearance of such buildings and places, so as to preserve and maintain such regional district as a contemporary landmark compatible with the historic, cultural, literary and aesthetic tradition of Barnstable county, as it existed in the early days of Cape Cod, and through the promotion of its heritage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u201cThis court\u2019s review is on the District Court report just as was the review by the Appellate Division.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Old King\u2019s Hy.
