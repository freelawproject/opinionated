After a hearing, the same judge who presided over the trial denied the motion. All three also appeal that adverse decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">To put the issues in context, we outline the Commonwealth\u2019s case. From the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, given principally by the victim\u2019s husband, Vixaysouk Thongchamleune (\u201cSuki\u201d), a jury could find as follows: On February 10, 1990, Suki, along with the defendants (two brothers and their friend, Khambor), the victim and her two children attended a birthday party in Plymouth. The victim had been married previously to Souvanheung. Her two children were the product of that marriage. When Suki and the victim arrived, the other guests were already there and they were playing games, drinking, and gambling. The victim was sitting next to her husband Suki. Souvanheung sat down on the other side of the victim, next to his mother, Souvanny Phachansiri (\u201cSouvanny\u201d). Suki overheard defendant Souvanheung tell his mother that he had $20,000 to $30,000 in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>bank.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The victim then said to Souvanheung, \u201c[W]hy don\u2019t you pay child support?\u201d Souvanheung responded by punching the victim in the face. Suki told Souvanheung to stop, that \u201cshe\u2019s not your wife anymore.\u201d Suki and defendant Souvanheung began to fight. Then Souvanna \u201cstart [ed] jumping up . . . and pulled out the gun.\u201d Defendant Khambor was standing at the front door of the apartment at this time, about three feet from Suki. Suki then ran out of the house and down the street to a gas station to call the police. As Suki was running toward the gas station he saw Khambor and Souvanheung running after him; Khambor had a shovel in his hand.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Souvanheung was yelling at Suki to stop, that he was going to kill him. The police arrived quickly and drove back to the party with Suki. The police spoke to the three defendants and then broke up the party. The three defendants, with the brothers\u2019 mother Souvanny, and four children, left in a blue van. Shortly thereafter, Suki, the victim, and the victim\u2019s two children began their drive home to Lynn. The victim was driving. When they reached Revere, they stopped for gas. At the gas station, Suki noticed a blue van behind them. Suki got out of the car to pay for the gas. Souvanheung walked up to Suki and punched him in the face, and they fought. Souvanna joined in the fight. He pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot Suki. Then he stabbed Suki in the hand with a broken beer bottle. Khambor joined the fight and hit Suki in the head. After a few moments, Suki saw his wife, the victim, come out of the car. He saw Khambor pull the victim\u2019s hair. Khambor pulled the victim toward the blue van. Suki ran to the office to call the police. Then he saw the brothers and the victim near the blue van. Suki \u201cfreaked out.\u201d The blue van began to pull away. A witness saw the victim thrown into the van through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the side door. Suki screamed for the van to stop; he ran up to it and struck the driver\u2019s side window with a \u201ccrook lock.\u2019-\u2019 The van sped away, and Suki ran out into the street. Once in the street, he saw a woman holding his wife, who was on the ground lying on her back. A witness testified that he was driving behind the van and saw a body thrown out of the van. When found, the victim\u2019s eyes were open, but she could not talk. Blood was on her nose and chest. Her clothes were in shambles and her brassiere had been cut off.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Dr. Stanton Kessler, an expert in forensic pathology, testified that the victim died as a result of manual strangulation and blunt trauma, either of which \u201care fatal injuries.\u201d The defense was that the victim entered the van voluntarily and either fell from or jumped from the van, fatally injuring herself thereby. We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">1. <em>The judge correctly allowed the Commonwealth to amend the indictments charging kidnapping. </em>Prior to trial, pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 4(d), 378 Mass. 849 (1979), the Commonwealth moved to amend the indictments charging each defendant with kidnapping in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26. The Commonwealth sought to strike the language of specific intent in the third clause of the statute, and proceed with indictments tracking the first clause of the kidnapping statute, which does not require proof of specific intent. Over objection by defendants, the judge allowed the motion. In their amended form, the indictments tracked the language of the first clause of the statute: \u201c[The defendant], on February 10, 1990, without lawful authority did forcibly and secretly confine and imprison [the victim] within the Commonwealth, against her will.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>Saylor, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 117, 120-121 (1989), where the same issue is discussed and decided adversely to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">2. <em>There was no error in excluding evidence tending to show that the deceased was a violent person approximately nine years before trial. </em>During voir dire, the defendants elicited testimony from Betty Anderson (\u201cAnderson\u201d), the Director of Immigration and Resettlement for the Catholic Diocese in Davenport, Iowa, that in the early 1980\u2019s she was called to assist in family problems at the home shared by the victim and Souvanheung. The defendants were attempting to show that the victim was a violent, unpredictable person and, thus, not easily kidnapped. Anderson testified that \u201cgenerally [family problems occurred] because [the victim] had lost her cool . . . [s]he was a person who wished to control things. She was . . . easily agitated. She would have temper tantrums. She would scream, she would occasionally throw things. Even when I was there she would act out considerably and very angrily. She was always very angry.\u201d When pressed on cross-examination, however, she stated she was at the house only one time \u201cwhen [the victim] blew up quite profusely [sic] at her home,\u201d nine years prior to the date the victim died. Anderson could not pin down any specific times when she saw the victim \u201close her temper,\u201d she just stated that she \u201clost her temper any number of times.\u201d Anderson was usually called \u201cafter the fact\u201d to intervene in family disputes. She did say that \u201cat least three other times,\u201d in 1982 or 1983, she saw the victim acting in an agitated, violent, tumultuous fashion in the presence of defendant Souvanheung.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The trial judge excluded the testimony. First, he concluded that the evidence was too remote in time to have any probative value. Here the alleged specific acts of violence about which Anderson testified occurred nine years earlier, and, thus, the issue of admissibility fell well within the judge\u2019s discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733, 736 (1986) (whether the alleged incident is too remote is a discretionary matter for the trial judge). See also <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>418 Mass. 1, 6 (1994) (\u201cThere can be no bright line: in one circumstance, an act two weeks earlier might be too remote, while in another, an act two years before may not. That is why the matter is left to the sound discretion of the judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Second, the judge reasoned that there was \u201cno evidence which might tend to raise a reasonable doubt [as to whether] the defendants were acting in self-defense.\u201d Indeed, the defendants do not argue that they were acting in self-defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, they argue that the victim entered the van \u201cand appeared to exit or did exit of her own volition.\u201d Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733, 735-736 (1986), in which the court held that \u201ca defendant in a homicide case may introduce evidence of recent, specific instances of the victim\u2019s violent conduct, known to the defendant at the time of the homicide, to support his assertion that he acted <em>justifiably in reasonable apprehension of bodily </em>harm\u201d (emphasis added). We conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in excluding Anderson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">With regard to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Papadinis, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 570 (1987), <em>S.C., </em>402 Mass. 73 (1988), upon which the defendants rely, the judge ruled that \u201cI really don\u2019t think that this evidence tends to explain the conduct of any of the defendants based upon what I have heard so far, at least as it did in [Papadinis].\u201d In <em>Papadinis, </em>the defendant proffered his testimony concerning his state of mind which, if believed, would explain conduct otherwise incriminating. Here, all the defendants testified, and were not precluded from testifying about their own states of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Further, the defendants in this case <em>denied </em>that they were engaged in any incriminating conduct, and Anderson\u2019s testimony about the victim\u2019s volatile behavior nine years earlier would hardly lend support to the defendants\u2019 claim of their alleged benign state of mind in the van as it sped away from the gasoline station following the brawl with Suki. As Anderson\u2019s testimony would, at best, be only marginally relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>show the likelihood of her voluntarily jumping into and then out of the speeding van, its exclusion was certainly within the judge\u2019s discretion. See Liacos, <em>Massachusetts Evidence </em>\u00a7 4.1.2, at 113 (6th ed. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">3. <em>The judge correctly excluded the statement of an unavailable witness and correctly denied the defendants\u2019 subsequent motion for a new trial based upon the recent availability of that same witness. </em>During the trial, the defendants, being unable to secure the presence of Souvanny, the mother of two of the defendants, Souvanheung and Souvanna,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> sought to have a statement Souvanny made to police in February, 1990, admitted in her absence. Defendants argued that the statement \u201ccoincides with the defendants\u2019 versions of the events of that evening and every detail.\u201d The judge denied the motion; he pointed out that the statement simply was given in the course of a police interview. There was no error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 570, 574-575 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Souvanny became available nearly five months after the defendants were convicted, and the defendants moved for a new trial. Because the witness was unavailable for the trial, the defendants argued that the motion should be considered as one asserting newly discovered evidence. A hearing was held on the motion on November 18, 1991; Souvanny testified. The judge denied the motion. On appeal, the defendants argue that Souvanny\u2019s testimony was critical because \u201cthe witness corroborated the defendants\u2019 assertions that the deceased voluntarily entered and either jumped from the moving van or was ejected by the erratic movement of the van after she placed herself in close proximity to the side door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In reviewing the denial of a motion for a new trial, we \u201cexamine the motion judge\u2019s conclusion only to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986). Further, we give \u201cspecial deference\u201d to the motion judge as he was also the trial judge. <em>Id. </em>In his memorandum of decision and order, the judge noted that Souvanny\u2019s testimony was merely cumulative \u2014 \u201csimply a repetition of the testimony offered by the four defendants at trial.\u201d Citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, supra </em>at 305-306, the judge concluded that there was \u201cno substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion if they had heard Souvanny\u2019s testimony.\u201d He found that her testimony was both unreasonable and improbable,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and would not have been a real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations. There was no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 127 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 651, 654 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">4. <em>The judge correctly declined to instruct the jury on intervening cause with respect to the underlying felony of kidnapping. </em>The defendants requested a jury instruction on intervening cause. The argument was that the death of the victim was not the probable consequence of the kidnapping. Rather, Suki\u2019s act of hitting the driver\u2019s side window with the crook lock \u201cset in force a series of circumstances that resulted in the death of the victim.\u201d The \u201cgeneral rule is that the intervening conduct of a third party will relieve a defendant of culpability only if such an intervening response was not reasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>404 Mass. 532, 534 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The judge refused to instruct on the intervening cause. He made the sensible observation that if you kidnap somebody\u2019s wife it is foreseeable that \u201cthe husband is going to try to rescue the wife, or at least do something to attempt to stop the kidnapping.\u201d Thus, the judge correctly instructed that the \u201cCommonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the homicide committed in the course of the felony or attempted felony was the natural and probable consequence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>of the felonious act.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>408 Mass. 463, 467 (1990) (for the felony-murder rule to apply \u201cthe deaths must have been the natural and probable consequences of the felony\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catalina, </em>407 Mass. 779, 791 (1990). More than that was not required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Askew, supra </em>at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">5. <em>The judge correctly excluded testimony of defendant Souvanna\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity. </em>Defendant Souvanna sought to introduce evidence, through Anderson, of his reputation for truthfulness and veracity five years earlier. After the voir dire of Anderson, the judge ruled the proffered evidence inadmissible, finding it too remote and based upon too small and too limited a group to be sufficiently probative. Souvanna argues that this ruling denied him a fair trial. There was no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>379 Mass. 106, 115 (1979) (seven-year hiatus between knowledge of witness\u2019s reputation for veracity and the date of the trial \u201ctoo attenuated\u201d). The trial judge in this case, exercising his considerable discretion, permissibly characterized the evidence as too remote. See Hughes, Evidence \u00a7 239, at 283 (1961)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Further, the judge properly determined that the testimony was based upon the opinion of too limited a group. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPierre, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 871 (1980) (three coworkers insufficient); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 933 (1981) (\u201cat least five\u201d other people insufficient). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 178 (1991), cited by the defendant does not help him. In <em>Arthur, </em>the reputation of the witness was based upon \u201cat least fifty to sixty (and possibly as many as one hundred fifty) individuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 181. Here, the relevant community consisted of about ten to twelve adults, and Anderson based her testimony upon her assumptions of what other people must have thought about the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>6. <em>Denial of defendant Khambor\u2019s motions for required findings of not guilty as to kidnapping and second degree felony-murder were proper. </em>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the close of all the evidence and after the jury verdict, Khambor moved for required findings of not guilty. The judge denied each motion. On appeal, Khambor argues that he was merely present at the scene of the crime. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u201cThe familiar test is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Titus, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 216, 219-220 (1992), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). The Commonwealth proceeded under a theory of joint venture. To prove joint venture, the Commonwealth must prove \u201cthat the defendant was (1) present at the scene of the crime, (2) with knowledge that another intended to commit a crime, and (3) by agreement was willing and available to help the others if necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>405 Mass. 326, 327 (1989). The jury \u201cmay infer the requisite mental state from the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the circumstances and subsequent participation in the offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>402 Mass. 482, 486 (1988) (citation omitted). The defendant\u2019s knowledge or intent \u201cis a matter of fact,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 487, properly left to the jury\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">As to the kidnapping, the Commonwealth produced evidence that Khambor was at the scene of the crime, that he helped the brothers fight with Suki, and that he grabbed the victim\u2019s hair, struggled with her, and pulled her toward the van. Then, the two brothers and Khambor, acting in unison, grabbed her and threw her into the van \u201clike she was nothing,\u201d according to a witness at the scene. With all three men in the van, the van door was shut and the vehicle sped away. This was sufficient to establish Khambor\u2019s knowing, wilful and active participation in the kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>There was sufficient evidence to establish that the victim\u2019s death occurred during the course of the kidnapping, and that the kidnapping was executed with a conscious disregard of the risk to human life. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>408 Mass. 463, 466 (1990). There was evidence of a violent struggle within the van after it left the gasoline station. The victim\u2019s unconscious body was found in the street just a short distance from the gas station. A witness described her as limp and bleeding around her neck and shoulder\u2019s. There were stab wounds and numerous other bruises. Her slacks had been pulled down; her shirt was open; her hair \u201cwas a mess.\u201d There was an abundance of evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude that during the course of the kidnapping, and as part of one continuous transaction, a deliberate and brutal homicide had occurred. In addition, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the kidnapping had been committed with a conscious disregard for the risk to human life, and that the victim\u2019s death was the natural and probable consequence of the kidnapping. We are satisfied that the denial of Khambor\u2019s motion for a required finding regarding the kidnapping and second degree and felony-murder verdicts reveals no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, supra </em>at 466-467.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Khambor argues that his voluntary intoxication necessarily precludes the jury from finding him guilty of kidnapping and second degree felony-murder. It is enough to say, after reviewing the evidence and the judge\u2019s charge, that there is no merit to the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">7. <em>The judge gave the correct jury instructions on the intent required for second degree felony-murder on a joint venture theory. </em>Finally, Khambor argues that the judge\u2019s refusal to give an instruction that the jury must find the defendant specifically intended to commit the crime of kidnapping in order to sustain the second degree felony-murder conviction was in error. There was no error. The judge care<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>fully instructed the jury with regard to each element of the charges against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\n<em>Orders denying motions for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-14\">A fourth defendant, Seng Phachansiri, the wife of Souvanna, was also indicted for the same offenses.
