After a hearing, the judge ordered the child committed to the custody of the Department of Social Services (department).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The department, Leo\u2019s mother, and Leo, through counsel, rested on the documentary evidence. His father, while objecting to certain portions of the exhibits, did not call any witnesses or offer any additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The focus of this appeal by Leo\u2019s father<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the determination that he was unfit to care for the child has somewhat changed by reason of the recent case of <em>Care &amp; Protection of Rebecca, </em>419 Mass. 67 (1994), which was published after the filing of the father\u2019s brief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relying on that case, the father claims that the out-of-court statements made by Leo do not meet the criteria for admissibility under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 83, and that they are likewise not admissible under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. In addition, the father argues that the judge admitted and impermissibly relied on stale prior convictions of the father, including a thirty year old conviction for indecent assault and battery on a minor; he also makes a claim not raised before the trial judge, or even in his original brief, namely, that the appendices to the court investigator\u2019s report, and the reports, other than those of the court investigator, should not have been admitted. As a discretionary matter,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we have considered this issue, presented for the first time in the father\u2019s supplemental brief filed after oral argument. We conclude that no injustice has resulted despite the inadmissibility for substantive purposes of these documents, or certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>portions of them, as we are convinced, based on the admissible evidence, that the judge would have reached the same result without the items. Since other points raised by the father do not merit reversal, we affirm the judgment of the Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">1. <em>The investigator\u2019s reports. </em>The trial judge appointed a licensed social worker to conduct an investigation for the court. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 24.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The investigator interviewed numerous individuals including the child, the father, the child\u2019s foster mother, the father\u2019s thirty-seven year old daughter, and several social workers. He also referred in the report to a sexual abuse evaluation undertaken by Family Counseling Center, a program of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Apart from hearsay considerations which we shall discuss below, the two reports, dated September 15, 1992, and February 12, 1993, respectively, present a sorry picture of physical abuse of the mother and the child by the father. In addition to the recitations of the mother and Leo of such abuse, the investigator recounted reports of hospital personnel indicating that the mother had bruises, a fractured nose, and cigarette burns. Some episodes of abuse, such as choking the mother, took place in front of Leo.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">There was also ample evidence of the father\u2019s physical abuse of Leo. He, when questioned by the court investigator, stated that his father had hit him in the face, on the arm, and in the rear. His foster mother reported that he told her that his father had hit him. His biological mother stated that his father had slapped him in the face and, on one occasion, had hit him eight times with a stick. His stepsister, too, mentioned that her father had hit Leo with a stick.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The court investigator\u2019s report also revealed substantial evidence of sexual abuse of Leo by his father. When asked if his father touched him somewhere that he did not like, Leo told the court investigator that his father touched him between his legs and on his penis. Leo was overheard by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>foster mother telling a friend that he was in a foster home because his father and mother beat him and because his father \u201ctouches me in my private places.\u201d He told his foster mother that his father touched him in his private parts, that he and his father slept in the same bed together, that his father was naked in bed, and that he, Leo, would sometimes lie on top of his father and \u201csometimes it was soft and sometimes it was hard.\u201d The touching occurred not only in bed but also in the bathroom and sometimes on the couch. He also told the sexual abuse evaluator of his father\u2019s sexual touches.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Leo\u2019s stepsister told a social worker who was seeing Leo in play therapy that she was concerned about possible sexual abuse of Leo, that the father had sexually abused her as a child and had held a gun against her head when she was fifteen years old, and that her father slept with Leo with an open robe or naked until Leo fell asleep. Thereafter he would ask her to babysit while he went out. He then paid her with drugs. The court investigator discussed with Leo\u2019s stepsister her own claim of sexual abuse by the father, and she \u201cconveyed a very strong impression that the information she gave to the social workers was true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The court investigator also reported that Leo masturbated and that at a day care center he once rubbed his penis against a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The father\u2019s counsel\u2019s primary objections at the hearing before the judge were based on G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 83, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which provides that one of the requirements for the admission of any hearsay statements of a child under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the age of ten describing any act of sexual contact is that the person to whom the child made the statements must testify. On appeal, relying on <em>Care &amp; Protection of Rebecca, </em>419 Mass. at 83, the father argues that inclusion in the investigator\u2019s report does not dispense with the c. 233 requirements so as to make the child\u2019s statements admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In <em>Rebecca, </em>a case where the mother was not permitted to call the children as witnesses, see <em>id. </em>at 76 n. 10 (another important witness was also unavailable, see <em>id. </em>at 84 n.14), the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that \u201ca judge who has before him out-of-court statements admitted under \u00a7 83 must consider the reliability of those statements,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 78, and must explain his reasons for relying on such evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 80. In discussing the relationship between \u00a7 83 and G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 24, the court cautioned that the fact that statements also appear in an investigator\u2019s report does not ipso facto render them admissible for their truth. For such admissibility, what is required is that there be \u201can opportunity to \u2018refute the investigator <em>and the investigator\u2019s sources </em>through cross-examination and other means.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 83 (emphasis in original), quoting from <em>Adoption of Carla, </em>416 Mass. 510, 514 (1993), in turn quoting from <em>Custody of Michel, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 260, 266 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u201cCross-examination of the investigator provides an effective means to impeach the credibility of statements contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>in the report,\u201d <em>Custody of Tracy, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 481, 486 (1991), and thus determine their reliability. <em>Care &amp; Protection of Rebecca, </em>419 Mass. at 79-80. We do not read the language quoted in note 6, <em>supra, </em>to import into \u00a7 24 any requirement of reliability other than the opportunity \u201cto rebut the report, including the right to cross-examine the investigator\u201d and his sources. See <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>369 Mass. 598, 605 (1976). See also paragraph <em>(b) </em>of \u00a7 83, note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The difficulty with the father\u2019s position is that he was repeatedly informed by the judge that he had a right to call the sources referred to in the investigator\u2019s reports. When asked, \u201cWhen do you want to call them?\u201d counsel specifically replied, \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As counsel, who was not appellate counsel, continued to object to hearsay statements, the judge again and again told him his remedy was to call the witness, indicating that he would continue the matter to a date the witness would be available, and, if the witness was unavailable for any reason, the court would allow a motion to strike the hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Throughout the hearing, counsel maintained that calling the witnesses would put the burden on the father, and the burden of production should be on the department. Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>counsel also takes that position, arguing that the burden is on the department to produce clear and convincing evidence that the father is unfit and that the father\u2019s failure to subpoena the authors of the submitted documents \u201cdoes not somehow render unreliable hearsay now reliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The opportunity to refute the report and to cross-examine the investigator and his sources is sufficient to protect the father\u2019s rights. This was stated in <em>Michel, </em>was reiterated in <em>Carla, </em>and was repeated in <em>Rebecca. </em>See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Rebecca, </em>419 Mass. at 83. Fairness to the father does not require placing the time-consuming burden on the department and the court of calling for testimony from the mouth of each contributor to the report no matter how uncontested his or her evidence. See <em>Adoption of George, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 265, 273 (1989). Having seen the report, the father was in a position adequate to challenge any material therein with evidence of his own or to call any contributor to the report. By rejecting the opportunity given him by the court, the father lost, or effectively waived, his right to complain of the hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">2. <em>Other documents. </em>As stated earlier, in addition to the two reports of the investigator, the department introduced in evidence four reports of a social worker and two letters. Since the letters were from personnel at the hospital and related only to the mother\u2019s ability to care for Leo, a question not relevant to this appeal, they need not be discussed. While the four reports of the social worker prepared in connection with these care and protection proceedings were not admissible substantively,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> see <em>Care &amp; Protection of Rebecca, </em>419 Mass. at 84; <em>Adoption of George, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 270-271, we have no doubt that the judge would have reached the same result without the few additional facts that appeared in the social worker\u2019s reports but not in the investigator\u2019s reports. The same is true of the appendices to the investigator\u2019s report, although the opinions of the sexual abuse evaluator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>that some of Leo\u2019s statements were \u201chighly credible\u201d and that \u201cthe evaluation shows strong indications that [Leo] has been subjected to . . . sexual abuse\u201d were both clearly inadmissible, <em>Care &amp; Protection of Rebecca, </em>419 Mass. at 83, and, in other circumstances, might be deemed sufficiently prejudicial to require reversal. In this case, however, the extremely strong evidence of both physical and sexual abuse of Leo contained in the investigator\u2019s report and reflected in the judge\u2019s findings, coupled with the father\u2019s long criminal record, see <em>infra, </em>part 3, and his failure to testify, <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 616-618 (1986), were, we are convinced, determinative for the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">3. <em>Criminal history. </em>The judge did not err in weighing the father\u2019s entire, lengthy criminal record as a factor bearing on parental fitness. <em>Care &amp; Protection of Frank, </em>409 Mass. 492, 494 (1991). See also <em>Care &amp; Protection of Martha, </em>407 Mass. 319, 325 n.6 (1990); <em>Adoption of Irwin, </em>28 Mass.
