L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(a), and possession of a class A controlled substance (heroin) with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32. On appeal, he alleges that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence as to the heroin charge was legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">The essence of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence on the possession element of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 \u2014 an essential prerequisite for conviction under a theory of principal liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Both the defendant and Commonwealth spend substantial time disputing whether the case with respect to the disputed charge was presented on a theory of joint venture or principal liability. Insofar as there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction under the latter approach, which subsumes criminal liability on the basis of the former, it is ultimately unnecessary for us to resolve this question. As an aside, it appears from the record that the Commonwealth, in fact, argued both theories.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The facts, simply stated, are these. An undercover police officer approached a group of men suspected of engaging in the sale of illegal drugs. Upon approach by a \u201cgrey-haired\u201d man, the officer stated he \u201cwanted two.\u201d The grey-haired man pulled from his pocket two packets of what appeared to be \u201cred eagle brand\u201d heroin. The officer returned the two packets and said that he wanted \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine, not heroin. The grey-haired man then beckoned the defendant, who joined them. After the grey-haired man spoke to the defendant in Spanish, the defendant led the officer into a nearby apartment building. Asking the officer to wait in a hallway, the defendant entered one of the apartment units. A few minutes later, the defendant reappeared carrying a small plastic bag containing a substance later determined to be crack cocaine. The officer gave the defendant twenty dollars, received the drugs, and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Several minutes later, the undercover officer, now reinforced by several colleagues and the authority of a search warrant (presumably an anticipatory warrant dependent upon the success of his controlled buy, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>399 Mass. 141, 145 [1987]), returned, arrested the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>defendant and searched the apartment from which the defendant had obtained the illegal drugs. Baking soda, a substance used to make crack cocaine, and drug packaging paraphernalia were found in the bedroom and kitchen. In the same bedroom, hidden in a secret cache cut from the baseboard molding inside a closet, officers found a quantity of heroin, rock cocaine, powdered cocaine (packaged in the same way as the rock cocaine purchased by the officer), a digital scale, and drug sales records. Significantly, no other illegal drugs were found anywhere else in the apartment. Finally, a beeper was taken from the defendant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"AR7\">Upon these facts, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the defendant obtained the crack cocaine sold to the undercover officer from the hidden stash. Such access to and control over the secret stockpile was more than adequate to support an inference of constructive \u2014 if not actual \u2014 possession of its entire contents, including the heroin. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 498 (1984) (awareness of contraband coupled with ability and intention to control it sufficient to establish constructive possession). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 554, 556 (1991) (possession may be proved exclusively by circumstantial evidence). Despite the defendant\u2019s contentions to the contrary, it is irrelevant that others might have had similar access to the cache. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 409 (1989) (constructive possession may be exclusive or joint). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichols, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 606, 613 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In all material respects, this case resembles <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 252, 258-259 (1994). There, the defendant was able to produce illegal drugs, on demand, from a hidden stash within an apartment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Watson, </em>this court reasoned that the defendant\u2019s \u201cfamiliarity with the procedure for obtaining drugs\u201d from the concealed place supplied a sound basis for an inference of constructive possession. We think the same principle applies here. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>259. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 652 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 988, 989 (1981) (defendant\u2019s undisputed possession of drugs taken from larger stockpile provides sufficient basis for inference of constructive possession of that larger amount).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In arguing for a contrary result, the defendant has relied chiefly on cases in which the Commonwealth sought to establish possession on the basis of a defendant\u2019s presence in an apartment (or other place) where contraband was found. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 437 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 558; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 619, 623 (1993). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 776, 779 (1991). Those cases are not apposite to the circumstances in which the defendant was an active participant in illegal drug sales and where other evidence supported the inference that the supply under his control included a quantity of heroin. His motion for a required finding on the contested count, therefore, properly was denied. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gizicki, </em>358 Mass. 291, 297 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-16\">We note in passing, that the defendant has made a fundamental error of law in his argument relating to joint venture. To establish liability under this theory (as opposed to proving culpability as a principal), it would not be necessary to prove that the defendant had possession \u2014 actual or constructive \u2014 of the illegal drugs. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>30 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>App. Ct. 490, 499 (1991). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sabetti, </em>411 Mass. 770, 779-780 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Were it not possible to conclude that the Commonwealth had met its burden with respect to principal liability (and so necessarily satisfied the elements of joint venture), this would have posed potential difficulties. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 936, 938 (1990) (where one of two potential theories of liability is unsupported by the evidence, and it is unknown which the factfinder relied upon, reversal is required); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kickery, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 720, 724 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Like here, the drugs were hidden in a concealed compartment in the back of a bedroom closet. <em>Id. </em>at 258.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
