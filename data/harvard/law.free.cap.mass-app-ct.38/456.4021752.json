The defendant also appeals from the denial of its cross motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">Brett Nichols, the minor son of Bruce and Ann Nichols, was injured in a motor vehicle accident on September 14, 1989, by a tortfeasor who had $10,000 of bodily injury liabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ity insurance. The tortfeasor\u2019s insurer paid the plaintiffs $10,000. Alleging that Brett\u2019s damages were in excess of $35,000, the plaintiffs brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the entire $25,000 UIM coverage of an excess policy which they purchased from the defendant is available to cover the damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The plaintiffs were not entitled to collect under their primary automobile insurance policy with Aetna (primary policy) which provided UIM coverage of $10,000 on each of the three vehicles in the plaintiffs\u2019 household. The language of the primary policy, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contains the</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>formula for assessing the defendant\u2019s liability for UIM coverage. The policy also specifically details to and for whom the insurer will pay damages and the circumstances under which payment will be made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The definition of UIM provided by the primary policy comports with the statutory definition of an underinsured motor vehicle as set forth in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">1. <em>UIM coverage under the primary policy. </em>In this case, the tortfeasor had $10,000 bodily injury liability insurance, and the plaintiffs had $10,000 UIM coverage under their primary policy. The UIM provisions of the plaintiffs\u2019 policy were, therefore, inapplicable since the tortfeasor\u2019s $10,000 bodily injury coverage was not less than the plaintiff\u2019s $10,000 UIM coverage. <em>Alguila </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>416 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Mass. 494, 496-497 (1993).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The tortfeasor was not underinsured within the meaning of the primary policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">2. <em>UIM coverage under the excess policy. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 excess policy conditions the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay on the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover from the \u201cowner or operator of an uninsured auto or an underinsured auto.\u201d Applying the statutory definition, the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle is deemed to be underinsured if the tortfeasor\u2019s bodily injury liability coverage is less than the plaintiffs\u2019 underinsurance coverage. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, <em>supra </em>note 5. As the excess policy is a personal liability policy,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and not an automobile insurance policy, the tortfeasor\u2019s status as an underinsured driver must be determined by comparing the plaintiffs\u2019 total underinsurance coverage with the tortfeasor\u2019s bodily injury liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>coverage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>See <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co., </em>455 A.2d 932, 935 (Me. 1983) (stacking injured party\u2019s UIM coverage provided by two policies and comparing combined UIM coverage with tortfeasor\u2019s coverage to determine tortfeasor\u2019s status as underinsured). Accordingly, the tortfeasor in this case is underinsured since the tortfeasor\u2019s $10,000 bodily injury liability insurance is less than the plaintiffs\u2019 $35,000 underinsurance coverage ($25,000 under the excess policy and $10,000 under the primary policy). The plaintiffs, therefore, have a right to recover under the underinsurance provisions of the excess policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The defendant claims that the offset provision of the primary policy, which limits the defendant\u2019s liability for any \u201cunpaid damages up to the difference between the total amount collected from the automobile bodily injury liability insurance covering the owner and operator of the auto and the [UIM] limits\u201d under the primary policy, is incorporated by reference into the excess policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the defendant would have us read the excess policy, the defendant\u2019s potential liability would be limited to $15,000 ($25,000 UIM limit of the excess policy less the $10,000 bodily injury liability insurance received from the tortfeasor). The plain language of the excess policy, however, provides that the defendant will pay the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>loss </em>(allegedly in excess of $35,000) less the total amount of insurance recovered under any other UIM or automobile liability insurance ($10,000 from the tortfeasor) to the extent of the $25,000 policy limit. See <em>Ja</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>cobs </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>417 Mass. 75, 77 (1994), quoting from <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>405 Mass. 1101, 1101 (1989) (\u201c[Wjhere the words of an insurance contract are \u2018plain and free from ambiguity they must be construed in their usual and ordinary sense\u2019 \u201d). In any event, the primary policy contains a similar provision which requires reducing the plaintiffs\u2019 damages by \u201cthe amount recovered from any legally responsible person.\u201d Both provisions result in the defendant\u2019s potential liability of $25,000 under the excess policy. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s liability under the excess policy is determined by the express terms of the excess policy\u2019s coverage provision and that the offset provision of the primary policy is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the Superior Court for the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $25,000 is vacated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A new judgment should be entered declaring that the defendant is potentially liable for the entire $25,000 UIM coverage limit under the excess policy, but that a determination of the defendant\u2019s liability will depend upon the plaintiffs\u2019 proof of actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Bruce and Ann Nichols\u2019s excess policy with Aetna provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">\u201c1. <em>Coverage</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">We will pay compensatory damages for <em>personal injury </em>sustained by an <em>insured </em>in an <em>auto </em>accident for which that <em>insured </em>has a legal right to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured <em>auto </em>or an underinsured <em>auto. </em>Our responsibility to pay is subject to the terms and conditions of the uninsured or underinsured motorists coverage in your <em>primary insurance policy.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">We will pay for the amount of loss in excess of the greater of either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">a. the total amount of insurance any <em>insured </em>is entitled to receive under any other uninsured, underinsured motorists or <em>auto </em>liability insurance, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">b. the minimum limit for bodily injury liability required by law in the state in which the accident occurs.\u201d (Emphasis original.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">\u201cThe limit of liability shown on the Declarations for this <em>coverage </em>is the most we will pay for any one occurrence\u201d (emphasis original).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A7t\">The Aetna primary policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">\u201cAn auto is underinsured when the limits for automobile bodily injury liability insurance covering the owner and operator of the auto are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">1.

Co., supra, </em>the claimant had $15,000 UIM coverage, and the tortfeasor had bodily injury limits of $15,000 per person and $30,000 per accident. The tortfeasor\u2019s insurer settled six claims for $5,000 each, thereby exhausting the policy. The claimant sought to recover $10,000 of his UIM coverage ($15,000 UIM limit offset by the $5,000 recovered from the tortfeasor). The court denied recovery for the claimant holding that the tortfeasor was not underinsured within the meaning of the policy. The claimant\u2019s policy provided UIM coverage only when the tortfeasor\u2019s liability limits were less than the claimant\u2019s UIM limits and the tortfeasor\u2019s liability limits were insufficient to pay the claimant\u2019s damages. UIM coverage was not dependent upon the claimant\u2019s actual recovery. The UIM provisions of the claimant\u2019s policy were in accord with G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L(2), which \u201cdefines an underinsured vehicle as a vehicle covered by liability insurance with a limit that is less than the underinsurance limit of the policy on which the claimant relies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Although recovery under the plaintiffs\u2019 primary policy is not at issue in this case, we note that payment under the plaintiffs\u2019 UIM coverage could have been denied due to the inapplicability of the UIM provisions and not as a result of offsetting the UIM coverage by the amount received from the tortfeasor ($10,000 UIM less $10,000 from tortfeasor), see <em>Alguila </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra, </em>as both the plaintiffs and the defendant assert. The same result is reached, however, whether the UIM coverage is offset or the UIM provision is inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The terms of the excess policy require that the plaintiffs maintain primary insurance policies providing coverage for personal liability and for all automobiles, residences, watercraft and recreational vehicles. The excess policy provides coverage only for the amount of loss after the primary policies are exhausted. Therefore, the excess policy was designed to supplement the plaintiffs\u2019 primary policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113L, specifically prohibits the stacking of underinsurance limits on automobile policies. The plaintiffs acknowledge that stacking the three $10,000 underinsurance policies on the three vehicles in their household for a total of $30,000 in underinsurance is impermissible under the statute. The anti-stacking provisions of the statute, however, are inapplicable in this case since the excess policy is a personal liability policy, and not an automobile insurance policy. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>412 Mass. 492 (1992) (umbrella policy not a motor vehicle liability policy for purposes of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The excess policy provides that the defendant\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to pay is <em>subject to the terms and conditions of </em>the uninsured or underinsured motorists coverage in [the plaintiffs\u2019] primary insurance policy\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Under G. L. c. 231 A, a judge is required to make a declaration of the rights of the parties. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>373 Mass. 819, 829 (1977). <em>Galluccio </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 864 (1976). <em>Silverlieb </em>v. <em>Hebshie, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 911, 913 (1992). The declaratory relief sought in this case was a determination of the defendant\u2019s potential liability under the excess policy. The Superior Court judge should not have entered judgment for the plaintiffs assessing actual liability under the policy where actual damages were not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
