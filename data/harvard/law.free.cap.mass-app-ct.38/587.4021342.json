A medical malpractice tribunal, convened pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, reviewed the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof as to these defendants, and concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, if properly substantiated, was insufficient to warrant further judicial in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>quiry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The. plaintiff failed to post the bond required by c. 231, \u00a7 60B, and, accordingly, the two defendants were dismissed from the action, with final judgment entered September 29, 1993. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The action concerns the medical treatment given the plaintiff\u2019s late wife, Katherine Keppler, who died of lung cancer on August 29, 1989. Dr. Michaud, a general practitioner, saw Mrs. Keppler two times, on January 23, 1988, and on April 9, 1988, at Hunt Hospital, where she had presented at the outpatient department with complaints of a persistent cough and chest congestion. Dr. Michaud was made aware that the patient was a long-time chronic smoker. On the first visit, Michaud ordered a chest X-ray which, according to the radiologist\u2019s report, revealed a \u201cnormal chest.\u201d Michaud diagnosed the patient\u2019s condition at that time as acute bronchitis. At the April 9 visit, Michaud did not order a second X-ray. A diagnosis of viral syndrome was noted in the record on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Dr. Tufts, a pulmonary specialist, treated Mrs. Keppler between November 28, 1988, and late January, 1989, for continuing cough and chest congestion, diagnosed as acute bronchitis by another referring doctor from Beverly Hospital. Like Dr. Michaud, Dr. Tufts knew the patient had a history of chronic smoking. Tufts reviewed several X-rays of the patient taken during the course of her treatment by him, which revealed a two centimeter nodularity<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of uncertain diagnosis on her right lung. Tufts also ordered other tests, including two CT scans<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of Mrs. Keppler\u2019s lung and a bronchoscopy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Throughout the period Tufts treated Mrs. Keppler, he also maintained her on a regimen of antibiotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">1. <em>Claims against Dr. Michaud. </em>The thrust of the complaint against Dr. Michaud is that he departed from acceptable medical practice in failing to order a follow-up X-ray on April 9, 1988, when Mrs. Keppler\u2019s symptoms persisted; and in not prescribing further treatment for her complaints. As an offer of proof before the tribunal, the plaintiff submitted Mrs. Keppler\u2019s medical records and a report from Dr. Martin E. Katz, an oncologist,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which states in pertinent part that, had Michaud ordered a subsequent X-ray, it. \u201cwould have evidenced the lung cancer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The role of the medical malpractice tribunal in evaluating the sufficiency of the plaintiffs offer of proof is likened to a trial judge\u2019s evaluation of a motion for a directed verdict. <em>Little </em>v. Rosenthal, 376 Mass. 573, 578 (1978). <em>Kulas </em>v. <em>Weeber, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 983, 983 (1985). Under the <em>Little </em>directed verdict standard, the plaintiffs offer of proof was entitled to prevail if: (1) a doctor-patient relationship was shown; (2) there was evidence of the doctor\u2019s departure from good medical practice; and (3) damage resulted therefrom. <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass. 186, 193 (1980). The evidence presented is to be viewed \u201cin a light most favorable to the plaintiff,\u201d <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Avedikian, </em>412 Mass. 481, 484 (1992), and the tribunal may not examine its weight or credibility. <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Bay State Ambulance &amp; Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., </em>413 Mass. 670, 676 (1992). An offer of proof, however, \u201cmust comprise more than mere conclusory allegations. . . .\u201d <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 16, 20 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Applying these standards, we find Dr. Katz\u2019s opinion that Dr. Michaud departed from acceptable medical practice in not ordering an X-ray in April, 1988, and in not prescribing follow-up treatment to be based on more than speculation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201cconclusory allegations,\u201d <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>at 20. As such, the offer of proof as to negligence, element (2) above, see <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass. at 193, is minimally sufficient to survive a motion for directed verdict. With regard to causation, element (3) above, it was the plaintiff\u2019s duty, given Mrs. Keppler\u2019s ultimate diagnosis of incurable cancer to show that the \u201calleged negligence of [Dr. Michaud] was more probably than not a cause of the loss of a substantial chance to survive.\u201d <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Baystate Med. Ctr., </em>415 Mass. 202, 209 (1993). See also <em>Cusher </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 498 (1986) (citing <em>Glicklich </em>v. <em>Spievack, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 495 [1993], in applying a similar standard of causation when ruling on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in a medical malpractice case, where the plaintiff was diagnosed with ovarian cancer which had spread throughout her body). We find Dr. Katz\u2019s opinion that, had an X-ray been ordered on April 9, 1988, cancer would have been detected was speculative and amounted to little more than \u201cconclusory allegations.\u201d Mrs. Keppler\u2019s cancer was not detected until January, 1989, nine months after Dr. Michaud last saw her. During that period, she underwent several additional chest X-rays and two CT scans, none of which was positively interpreted at the time as showing cancer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The offer of proof that Dr. Michaud\u2019s omissions in failing to order a follow-up X-ray or follow-up treatment more likely than not caused further injury to Mrs. Keppler was insufficient, and the medical tribunal correctly so ruled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>2. <em>Claims against Dr. Tufts. </em>Mrs. Keppler was under Dr. Tufts\u2019 care for an approximate eight-week period between late November, 1988, and January, 1989, during which time Dr. Tufts did not positively identify the lung cancer. The cancer was finally identified through a needle aspiration biopsy conducted January 18, 1989. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>In his offer of proof, the plaintiff submitted Dr. Katz\u2019s expert opinion, in the form of a letter, which asserted that Dr. Tufts\u2019 failure \u201cto expeditiously diagnose and treat Mrs. Keppler\u2019s cancer increased the risk of metastases, militated against her chances of survival, lessened her life expectancy, and contributed to her pain, suffering, and morbidity.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">It was the plaintiff\u2019s duty before the tribunal to present evidence sufficient under the <em>Little </em>standard to show that any delay on Dr. Tufts\u2019 part in diagnosing Mrs. Keppler\u2019s cancer was causally related to the metastasis of her cancer, and to her ultimate death from that disease. Stated a different way, Dr. Katz\u2019s expert opinion would have had to show that Dr. Tufts\u2019 negligence was \u201cmore probably than not a cause of the loss of a substantial chance to survive,\u201d <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Baystate Med. Ctr., </em>415 Mass. at 209, or that, had he properly diagnosed Mrs. Keppler\u2019s disease, then, \u201cto a reasonable medical certainty, [she] would not have had [metastasis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>her cancer] and would have had a much improved chance of survival or longer life ...\u201d (brackets in original). <em>Cusher </em>v. <em>Turner, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 498. The record that was before the tribunal, however, is barren of any evidence to suggest beyond pure conjecture or speculation that Mrs. Keppler\u2019s cancer extended to other parts of her body, or progressed to a more advanced stage between November 28, 1988, when she first came under Dr. Tufts\u2019 care, and January 18, 1989, when the biopsy revealed a cancerous growth on her lung. Compare <em>Cusher </em>v. <em>Turner, supra </em>at 497-498 (three-year delay on defendant doctor\u2019s part in diagnosing and treating patient\u2019s cancer proximately caused metastasis of cancer leading to patient\u2019s death).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The plaintiffs offer of proof was insufficient, as no evidence was presented to indicate \u201cmore probably than not,\u201d <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Baystate Med. Ctr., supra </em>at 209, that Mrs. Keppler \u201cwould have lived longer or suffered less,\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>360 Mass. 746, 750 (1972), had Dr. Tufts diagnosed and treated her cancer between mid-November, 1988, and mid to late January, 1989. The tribunal\u2019s determination was not in error, and the resulting judgment dismissing the plaintiffs claim against Dr. Tufts was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The tribunal found sufficient evidence to raise questions of liability against two other defendants, Dr. Anthony Patton and Dr. Richard Mc-Manus, who were also named in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Derived from \u201cnodulus,\u201d defined in anatomical nomenclature \u201cas a general term to designate a comparatively minute collection of tissue.\u201d Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary 501 (West 1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b626-10\">\u201cA diagnostic procedure used to produce a series of cross-section images of internal body parts.\u201d CT stands for \u201ccomputerized tomography.\u201d Sloane-Dorland 536 (West Supp. 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Examination of the bronchi through a bronchoscope.

Hosp., 36 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 714 (1994), where the offer of proof established evidence of a causal nexus between the defendant pediatrician\u2019s failure to order an immediate CT scan on an unconscious and unresponsive infant, and the infant\u2019s death five days later from intracranial hemorrhage and anoxic brain damage. Here, by contrast, Dr. Michaud did not face an obvious life-threatening emergency, and he had before him the radiologist\u2019s reading of the January 23, 1988, X-ray which showed \u201ca normal chest.\u201d Nowhere does the offer of proof suggest that Michaud\u2019s reliance on that reading, or failure to independently examine the X-ray himself, fell below acceptable medical stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>dards. Furthermore, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, an X-ray taken in April, 1988, would likely have shown the same lesion or nodularity on the patient\u2019s lung which showed up in subsequent X-rays and CT scans, but which was not positively identified at the time as cancerous. By contrast, in <em>Rahilly, </em>the intracranial bleeding, from which intracranial pressure can be anticipated, was immediately detected in a CT scan belatedly taken some seven or eight hours later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b629-13\">Dr. Katz opined that Dr. Tufts\u2019 failure to obtain the original January 23, 1988, X-ray fell below acceptable standards of medical care. Under careful scrutiny, that X-ray, according to Dr. Katz, showed \u201ca suspicious area in the right upper lobe\u201d of Mrs. Keppler\u2019s lung. According to Dr. Katz, a comparison of that X-ray with one taken November 27, 1988, which revealed a 2 centimeter lesion or nodularity in the same area, \u201cshould have strongly suggested . . . evidence [of] cancer given the fact that the lesion was present in January, 1988, and progressive on the November 27, 1988, chest X-ray.\u201d From that, Dr. Katz concluded that Dr. Tufts should have ordered the biopsy procedure sooner and, thus, the cancer would have been positively identified earlier in his treatment of Mrs. Keppler.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
