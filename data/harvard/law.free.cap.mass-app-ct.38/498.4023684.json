L. c. 231, \u00a7 60F, into past and future damages. These were $70,000 and $1,235,000, respectively. Judgment was entered on August 16, 1993, in the amount of $1,305,000, \u201cwith [prejudgment] interest thereon from October 1, 1990,\u201d the date the complaint was filed. The defendants filed a timely motion to alter and amend the judgment by excluding from the interest computation that portion of the judgment specified as compensation for damages in the future. The trial judge denied the motion, point<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ing out that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, did not differentiate between past and future damages, and instead directed the clerk to add \u201cto the amount of damages interest thereon at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date of the commencement of the action.\u201d From this ruling the defendants have appealed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The judge treated the case as controlled by <em>Carey </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>377 Mass. 736, 746 (1979), where the court, despite the jury\u2019s having broken the verdict down into past and future losses, held that \u00a7 6B \u201cunequivocally required\u201d the statutory interest to be calculated on the entire amount of the verdict. The defendants argue that the <em>Carey </em>decision has, in effect, been overruled by <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Electro Switch Corp., </em>402 Mass. 385, 390-391 (1988), where the court said (at 391) that \u00a7 6B \u201ccannot reasonably be said to apply to an award of damages based upon lost earnings and benefits occurring after the date of judgment. We are aware of only one jurisdiction [Michigan] in which courts have held that interest may be added to front pay damages.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We do not concur in the defendants\u2019 view that <em>Conway </em>overruled <em>Carey </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>sub silentio. To the contrary, the <em>Conway </em>decision refers to <em>Carey </em>and, as we read the passage (402 Mass. at 391 n.9), distinguishes it on the basis that the <em>Conway </em>case, which was an employment discrimination case, dealt with a loss of future wages, whereas <em>Carey </em>dealt with a loss of earning capacity. \u201c[W]e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>view the loss of earning capacity as a present loss, although the determination of the extent of the loss necessarily takes into account future losses.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The distinction is a fine one, but it is serviceable: that in tort cases for personal injuries or property damage, compensation for future lost wages will be treated conceptually as an already incurred loss of earning capacity; while, in discrimination cases under G. L. c. 15IB, expected future income reductions will be treated conceptually as losses not yet incurred (i.e., \u201cfront pay damages\u201d). The former are subject to <em>Carey, </em>and prejudgment interest under \u00a7 6B will be applied to the entire amount of the verdict. In c. 15IB cases, compensation for losses of future income will not be subject to assessment of prejudgment interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We recognize that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60F, by requiring a breakdown of damage awards in medical malpractice cases into components,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> has eliminated the technical obstacle that a unitary verdict presents in applying interest only to medical expenses already incurred and wages already lost. That feature of the verdict in this case, however, does not differentiate it from <em>Carey, </em>where the recovery was similarly broken down into past and future components, nor from the terms of \u00a7 6B, which, in <em>Carey\u2019s </em>phrase (377 Mass. at 746), \u201cunequivocally required\u201d the computation of prejudgment interest on the entire award.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We recognize also that the jury were instructed to reduce future damages to present value, i.e., value at time of trial, rather than the appropriate instruction, suggested in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>380 Mass. 362, 367 (1980), to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>duce them to the \u201cvalue at \u2018the date of commencement of the action.\u2019 \u201d The defendants did not object, however, with the result that this case stands on the same footing as <em>Griffin </em>itself, where the court affirmed despite the disharmony between a discount to value at the time of trial and the addition of \u00a7 6B interest from the date of the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The judge did not err in ruling that \u00a7 6B interest was to be computed on the entire award.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\n<em>Order denying motions for new trial and to alter judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The notice of appeal indicates that the defendants also appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a motion for new trial, but they have made no corresponding argument before us. We also note that the defendants have paid already the amount of the verdict, together with prejudgment interest on that portion of the verdict identified as compensation for damages already incurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The defendants point also to <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 716-719 (1990), and <em>Makino, U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Metlife Capital Credit Corp., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 302, 320-321 (1988), as illustrative of their view that, after <em>Conway, </em>\u00a7 6B no longer requires prejudgment interest to be added to the entire amount of plaintiffs recovery in every case. <em>Conway </em>was not, however, the basis of decision in either <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau </em>or <em>Makino, U.S.A.; </em>rather, those decisions ruled that \u00a7 6B interest should be applied only to compensatory damages, not to punitive damages. The damages in the present action are all compensatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6B (1992 ed.), by its terms, applies only to recoveries \u201cfor pecuniary damages for personal injuries to the plaintiff or for consequential damages, or for damage to property.\u201d The damages in the <em>Conway </em>case did not fall into those categories, but, under \u00a7 6H, where no other provision for prejudgment interest is made, interest is to be computed at the rate provided by \u00a7 6B. It is possible to read the <em>Conway </em>decision as stating a rule for \u00a7 6H cases different from the rule for \u00a7 6B cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering are all to be separately broken down into damages incurred prior to verdict and those expected to be incurred after the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">In <em>Charles D. Bonanno Linen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>550 F. Supp. 231, 246-248 (D. Mass. 1982), affd., 708 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.), cert, denied, 464 U.S. 936 (1983), \u00a7 6B\u2019s application of interest uniformly to the entire award, from a fixed date, without differentiating dates of accrual for different components of the award, is viewed as a compromise justified by simplicity, shortchanging plaintiffs by not awarding interest for the period prior to the action\u2019s commencement, while favoring plaintiffs by allowing interest on losses expected to be incurred after that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
