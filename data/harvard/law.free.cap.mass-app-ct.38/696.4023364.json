A Land Court judge answered that question in the affirmative and the plaintiff has appealed the resulting judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-16\">The restriction, key portions of which are reprinted as an appendix to this opinion, was granted in 1976 by the property\u2019s former owner, Katharine Irving Morgan, to the town of Chilmark. Pursuant to G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 32, the restriction was accepted by the selectmen and was approved by the Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>retary of Environmental Affairs. It is recorded with the Dukes County registry of deeds. The restriction is administered by the Chilmark conservation commission (the commission). By its terms, the restriction is binding on Morgan and her successors in title, including the plaintiff who (along with other members of his family as successive interest holders) acquired the property in 1987.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">In 1993, the plaintiff applied to the commission for permits to construct an in-ground swimming pool in an area near the existing dwelling on the property. Upon notification from the commission that construction of the pool would violate the restriction, the plaintiff filed an action in the Land Court for a declaratory judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 231 A, naming the town as defendant. In ruling in the town\u2019s favor on cross motions for summary judgment, the judge relied in large part on \u00a7 B, par. 1, of the restriction which prohibits \u201c [construction or placing of buildings <em>... or other structures on </em>or above <em>the </em>ground.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The judge ruled the proposed swimming pool was a \u201cstructure\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 B, par. 1, and further ruled that the pool does not fall within the ambit of any of the restriction\u2019s limited exceptions allowing, for example, \u201cimprovement of the existing dwelling,\u201d \u00a7 B, par. 6, subpar. d, and \u201caccessory structures appropriate to [certain passive recreational] uses,\u201d \u00a7 B, par. 6, subpar. e.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The grantor\u2019s stated purpose in creating the conservation restriction for the town\u2019s benefit was \u201cto restrict the use of [the property] and retain it predominantly in its natural, scenic and open condition, in accordance with [G. L. c. 184, \u00a7\u00a7 31-33].\u201d The quoted language echoes that in \u00a7 31, par. 1. See also <em>Parkinson </em>v. <em>Assessors of Medfield, </em>398 Mass. 112, 115 (1986). Indeed, the list of activities prohibited by \u00a7 B, pars. 1-6, of the restriction is culled almost verbatim from \u00a7 31 of the statute. From this, and from the narrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>scope of the activities that are permitted on the property by \u00a7 B, par. 6, subpars. a-f, the judge correctly concluded that the grantor \u201cwanted a tight rein kept on changes to the [pjroperty.\u201d The judge also correctly characterized the proposed pool as a structure within the over-all meaning of the instrument, cf. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Wellesley, </em>356 Mass. 159 (1969) (in-ground swimming pool is a structure for purposes of town zoning by-law\u2019s set-back requirements), which would create a permanent physical presence \u201con . . . the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The plaintiffs arguments, that were the pool to be connected or appended to the existing structure by a patio or wooden deck, it would be permitted under \u00a7 B, par. 6, sub-par. d, and that the proposed pool is an \u201caccessory structure\u201d under par. 6, subpar. e, which is incidental to the primary recreational use of swimming, have little merit. As support for the first argument, the plaintiff points out that, on two prior occasions, the commission allowed him to construct wooden decks that are appended to and are a part of the existing dwelling, upon the opinion of town counsel that the decks were \u201cimprovements\u201d allowed under par. 6, subpar. d. The propriety of the commission\u2019s previous actions was not before the Land Court and is not before us. Suffice it to say that a swimming pool, unlike an attached deck, is an entirely separate structure which, even were it located next to, or even flush with, the existing dwelling, could not properly be regarded as an \u201cimprovement of the existing dwelling\u201d envisioned in par. 6, subpar. d.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Paragraph 6, subpar. e, enumerates activities that may be carried out upon the \u201cland ... in its natural, scenic and open condition\u201d (to quote once again from the document\u2019s statement of purpose), and it allows \u201cthe repair . . . and building of accessory structures appropriate to [such passive, recreational] uses\u201d as \u201c[f]ishing, shellfishing, boating, walking, horseback riding, bicycling, bird watching, nature observation\u201d and so forth. Arguably, swimming in Squibnocket Pond on which the property abuts is such a passive use. By this interpretation, par. 6, subpar. e, might be construed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>allow for construction of a bathhouse as accessory to such passive use of the property. Such use would remain consistent with the clear thrust of \u00a7 B, par. 5, of the restriction which forbids \u201csurface use of the land, except for [those] purposes consistent with allowing the land and related areas to remain <em>predominantly </em>in their natural condition [.]\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Here, however, the plaintiff tortures the language and plain meaning of par. 6, subpar. e, by arguing that a swimming pool is somehow incidental and accessory to swimming in much the same way one might try to argue that a tennis court is incidental and accessory to tennis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The structure cannot be \u201caccessory\u201d as the activity is not possible without the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In addition to its social benefits, a conservation restriction yields an economic benefit to the grantor of the restriction and successor owners of the property. See, for example, <em>Parkinson </em>v. <em>Assessors of Medfield, </em>398 Mass. at 115-116. In return for that benefit to the owner, it is reasonable that the conservation restriction be protected against expedient exemptions which defeat the purpose of preserving land in its natural state.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Appendix (with emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">\n<em>\u201cCONSERVATION RESTRICTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">\u201cI, Katharine Irving Morgan of the Town of Amherst, County of Hampshire, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, grant, without covenants, to the Town of Chilmark, County of Dukes, Commonwealth of Massachusetts a conservation restriction in perpetuity on a parcel of land located in Chilmark, Massachusetts, in order <em>to restrict the use of such land and retain it predominantly in its natural, scenic and open condition, in accordance with the authority contained in the Conservation Restriction Act, </em>Massachusetts General Laws, ch. 184, sections 31 to 33.
