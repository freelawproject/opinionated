At issue is whether those funds were subject to an attorney\u2019s lien under G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that they were and that Mr. Fischer has perfected a valid lien under the statute. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment which later entered in the case, and remand the matter to the Superior Court for an assessment of reasonable counsel fees to be paid from the money remaining in the escrow fund.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">As background to the controversy, we describe the underlying litigation and the events which preceded it. In 1982, Eli Cohen, the operator of a small pita bread bakery, purchased a building in Malden to expand his operation. As a vehicle to hold title, Cohen set up L&amp;E. Realty Trust, of which he was trustee and principal beneficiary. Cohen borrowed the purchase money and signed a mortgage note in the amount of $1,500,000 to Bank Five for Savings (Bank Five), and executed a conditional assignment of rents in the bank\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">The bakery conducted business as New England Food Co., Inc., until 1990, the corporation leasing the premises from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the trust. As part of a financial restructuring, that corporation was merged into a new entity called N.E. Food Co., Inc. To infuse capital into the flagging enterprise, Cohen enlisted LRF Investments and LRF Capital Limited Partnership (LRF) to become shareholders as well as secured creditors of the new corporation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Less than a year later \u2014 in July of 1991 \u2014 LRF declared N.E. Food Co., Inc., in default of its loan obligations. This prompted LRF to repossess all of N.E. Food Co.\u2019s equipment and fixtures; all were sold to Milldam Bakeries, a competitor. Cohen then enjoyed a brief stint as an employee of Milldam, allowing operations to continue under the lease. After several disagreements, Milldam fired Cohen. His termination triggered the eviction action together with a claim for back rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In November, 1991, a judge of the Superior Court entered an interlocutory order permitting Milldam to remain on the premises on condition that $10,000 per month as rent be paid into court until the case was concluded. Milldam paid a total of $60,000 into court under this order. As further security for Cohen, Milldam was required to place $100,000 in escrow for the removal of certain equipment from the building; Milldam later paid another $250,000 as a bond to dissolve Cohen\u2019s attachment on remaining bakery equipment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In total, $410,000 was paid into the escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">On March 4, 1992, Mr. Fischer filed a notice of lien for attorney\u2019s fees for $30,000. On April 28, 1992, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as receiver of the now defunct Bank Five, moved to intervene as a party to the action, seeking to establish its priority claim to the escrow fund.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *Several weeks later, Mr. Fischer filed a notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>increasing the amount of his lien to forty-five thousand dollars.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">On December 23, 1992, a Superior Court judge ordered that $228,087.95 be paid to the FDIC, on account of the fair rental value of the building and the value of the equipment removed by Milldam. The remainder was released to Mill-dam. On a petition of Mr. Fischer to this court seeking relief under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par., a single justice stayed the release of $45,000 of the $228,087.95 allotted to the FDIC, pending a full appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">1. <em>Validity of the Attorney\u2019s Lien.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The FDIC, citing several older cases, contends that the statutory attorney\u2019s lien only exists after the entry of a final judgment in the client\u2019s favor. Such, indeed, was the case under G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50, as in effect prior to St. 1945, c. 397, \u00a7 1, which provided that a statutory attorney\u2019s lien existed only after the entry of final judgment in the client\u2019s favor. See <em>Check </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>280 Mass. 170 (1932); <em>Tauro </em>v. <em>General Acc. Fire and Life Assur. Corp., </em>297 Mass. 234 (1937). By the time Mr. Fischer filed his lien, the modern version of \u00a7 50 as appearing in the 1945 statute <em>supra, </em>permitted a lien on \u201cthe judgment, decree or <em>other order in his client\u2019s </em>favor\u201d (emphasis added). Note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The sweep of the statute now includes any type of court order obtained in a client\u2019s favor. \u201cThe text [of a statute] must be afforded its plain meaning when it is clear and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 872 (1985). In the instant case, the judge ordered Milldam to pay $10,000 per month into the fund for the use and occupancy of the bakery facility, subject to a final determination of each party\u2019s rights and liabilities. The order established the fund as potential security for Cohen, pending an entry of final judgment in the case. The effect of the order was the same as an equitable attachment to reach and apply credits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>of Milldam to satisfy Cohen\u2019s claim. See G. L. c. 246, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 13; Gilleran, Massachusetts Prejudgment Security Devices: Attachment, Trustee Process, and Reach and Apply, 69 Mass. L. Rev. 156, 169 (1984). That the order actually required a transfer of funds in favor of Mr. Fischer\u2019s client differentiates the order from a simple attachment, which might not be the occasion of giving ground for an attorney\u2019s lien. The fact that the judge eventually awarded the fund to Cohen\u2019s creditor to reduce the amount of his liability to the bank, does not alter the character of the initial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">At common law, the underlying theory was that a lawyer\u2019s labor in the client\u2019s cause ought to be protected by the imposition of a lien. See McCann, Attorney\u2019s Liens in Massachusetts, 69 Mass. L. Rev. 68, 73-74 (1984). When, as occurred in this case, Mr. Fischer\u2019s efforts resulted in a fund available to satisfy Cohen\u2019s liability to the bank, we may conclude from the language of the first sentence of G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50, that the use of the fund for the payment of legal fees was appropriate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">For its part, the FDIC claims to rank first in the contest for the fund. However, the lien statute gives an attorney a right to assert a \u201ccharging lien\u201d to secure compensation for legal services rendered. See <em>Boswell </em>v. <em>Zephyr Lines, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 241, 244 (1993). The lien takes effect from the authorized commencement of an action or any proceedingjn any court. G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50. See Black, Attorneys\u2019 Liens in Massachusetts, 43 Mass. L. Q. (No. 3) 33, 36 (1958). Mr. Fischer preempted the FDIC by filing first iiL-the Superior Court the appropriate notice of lien._See McCann, Attorney\u2019s Liens in Massachusetts, 69 Mass. L. Rev. at 83. The filing serves as notice of the lien to othef~paftiesr~Black, <em>supra </em>at 38. See Martin and Hennessey, Automobile Law and Practice \u00a7 1883 (2d ed. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>2. <em>The Amount of the Lien.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">We are handicapped \u2014 and so far as we know, so was the motion judge \u2014 by not having been furnished with a particularized account or statement establishing Mr. Fischer\u2019s claim for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. When Mr. Fischer filed his first lien, he perfected a lien for reasonable fees. The assertion of a specific amount for the lien is not necessary, and in many cases is impossible.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That Mr. Fischer claimed a lien for $30,000 is immaterial. Filing an attorney\u2019s lien for a specific amount does not entitle an attorney to fees in that amount, nor does it limit the court in its determination of reasonable fees for the services rendered.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, there remains the question of the appropriate legal fee to be deducted from funds paid into court by Milldam. The judge in this case, on remand, should determine on^ the supporting materials, the reasonable counsel fees of Mr. Fischer, considering all the appropriate criteria. See <em>Mulhern </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>398 Mass. 18, 24 (1986), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We leave to the discretion of the judge whether to hold further hearings and take evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b40-12\">General Laws c. 221, \u00a7 50, as appearing in St. 1945, c. 397, \u00a7 1, states in pertinent part, that an \u201cattorney who appears for a client ... [in a] proceeding in any court . . . shall have a lien for his reasonable fees and expenses upon his client\u2019s cause of action, counterclaim or claim, upon the judgment, decree or other order in his client\u2019s favor entered or made in such proceeding, and upon the proceeds derived therefrom.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b40-13\">A single justice of this court stayed the release of $45,000 of the fund pending appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\">LRF held a security interest in the personal property and fixtures of N.E. Food Co., Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The payments are listed in the docket but not included in the record for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b41-11\">The FDIC had obtained a default judgment against Cohen on the mortgage on October 30, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Although Fischer asserted in his brief that he filed his notice of increase of lien on April 30, 1992, the notice is in fact stamped as filed on May 12, 1992, well after the FDIC had intervened. Our holding in this case, however, renders the date of his second filing irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The FDIC also argues that the fund did not constitute \u201cproceeds\u201d subject to a lien under G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50. The FDIC relies on <em>In Re Leading Edge Products, Inc., </em>121 B.R. 128 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1990), and <em>Torphy </em>v. <em>Reder, </em>357 Mass. 153 (1970). Both are inapposite because they involved vastly different factual circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\">For example, in contingent fee cases, or cases where the lien is filed while litigation is still ongoing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b44-10\">The FDIC asserts that Fischer is not entitled to collect attorney\u2019s fees because he submitted no evidence to the trial court to substantiate his claim. Such evidentiary support is not strictly necessary; the determination as to what are reasonable attorney\u2019s fees may be made on the judge\u2019s own observations of the relevant factors during trial. <em>McLoughlin v. </em>Disarro, 7 Mass. App. Ct. 853, 854 (1979). See <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. 621, 631 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
