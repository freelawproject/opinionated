Thereafter plaintiff brought another action against defendant in the same district court for rent of the same premises for the month of November, 1888. Defendant moved to have this action removed to this court and consolidated with the action previously removed on giving bond.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>J.

Belden, 12 Abb. N. Cas. 58 ; <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>Id. note ). The same result would seem to follow from section 3343, subdivision 1, which declares this court one of the superior courts of cities, and from section 267, which declares the jurisdiction of such courts to be co-extensive with that of the supreme court. The actions and defenses in both cases being the same, they should be consolidated, and the motion is therefore granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
