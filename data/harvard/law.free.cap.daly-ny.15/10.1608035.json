F. Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5\">The plaintiff deposited his note for $3,000, dated January 16th, 1888, payable three months after date, to his own order, and indorsed by him, with the defendant as collateral security for a letter of credit of \u00bf\u00a3600 received from defendant, upon the written stipulation of defendant that he would not allow the said note to go out of his possession. The plaintiff subsequently tendered the letter of credit to defendant, and demanded the return of the note, which was refused, defendant having parted with the note; having given it as collateral security for any balance of account which might be due from him to the firm of Alfred Carr &amp; Co. Defendant knew when he did so that there was nothing owing upon the said letter of credit. The note has been presented to plaintiff for payment by the Tradesmen\u2019s National Bank. Under the authorities,- these facts make out a case of disposing of a chattel so that it cannot be found or taken by the sheriff, and with the intent that it should not be so taken <em>(Barnett </em>v. Selling, 70 N. Y. 492). The defendant, when he pledged the note with his creditors, knew that he was diverting it from the purpose for which it had been deposited with him, and that he was putting it beyond the reach of the owner ; and he will be presumed in so doing' to have intended that it should not be taken by the sheriff in the event of plaintiff\u2019s bringing an action to recover it. The order of arrest was, therefore, properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">The defendant suggests that the Tradesmen\u2019s Bank may have presented the note on behalf of defendant; that there is no proof that it is now held by an innocent holder, and that it was transferred before maturity, etc. But this is not\u2019an answer to the action. The affidavit of J. W. Mason shows an admission of defendant that he had pledged the note. If this were done after its maturity, if it were not held by a <em>Iona fide </em>holder, the defendant could easily show the fact; but that would not, I think, defeat the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The transfer of the note and inability to deliver it upon demand establish the liability of the defendant in this form of action. An action for the recovery of plaintiff\u2019s own negotiable promissory note, before it is paid, may be maintained the same as for any chattel <em>(Barnett </em>v. Selling, above; <em>Murray </em>v. Burling, 10 Johns. 172).</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">Motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
