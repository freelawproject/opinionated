We concur in the court\u2019s decision not to go en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The State of Arizona finances private \u201cschool tuition organizations\u201d (STOs) by giving dollar-for-dollar tax credits to individuals who contribute to them. On its face, the statute creating this subsidy requires STOs to provide scholarships for students \u201cto attend <em>any </em>qualified school of their parents\u2019 choice.\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 43-1089(G)(3) (2005) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the Arizona Department of Revenue applies the statute, however, the state reimburses contributions to STOs that restrict their scholarships to use at religious schools. Consequently, 85 percent or more of the state-financed scholarship money is available only to students whose parents are willing to send them to sectarian institutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">If these facts are proved true, the Arizona Department of Revenue\u2019s execution of the scholarship program (Section 1089) violates the Establishment Clause. In <em>Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, </em>536 U.S. 639, 122 S.Ct. 2460, 153 L.Ed.2d 604 (2002), the Court upheld a school voucher program that \u201cprovide[d] assistance directly\u201d to parents without regard for religion, and public funds reached religious institutions only as the result of parents\u2019 choices about their children\u2019s education. <em>Id. </em>at 652, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Parents received aid whether or not they were willing to enroll their children in sectarian schools, so the program did not exert pressure on parents to choose religious schools. Under the Arizona program, by contrast, taxpayers, rather than parents, direct funds to religious organizations. Access to assistance is restricted on the basis of religion, creating financial incentives that may skew parents\u2019 choices toward religious schools. <em>See id. </em>at 650, 122 S.Ct. 2460. The differences between the Ohio and Arizona programs are constitutionally meaningful.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">The dissent from rehearing en banc demonstrates that others may prefer a more expansive reading of <em>Zelman. </em>Careful review of the two cases, however, shows why the dissent\u2019s argument that <em>\u201cWinn </em>cannot be squared with the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Zelman </em>\u201d is not persuasive. Dissent 14719-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">On its face, Section 1089 appears to provide for parental choice. The statute says that for an organization to qualify as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>an STO eligible to receive state-reimbursed contributions the organization must provide scholarships \u201cto children to allow them to attend <em>any </em>qualified school <em>of their parents\u2019 choice.\u201d </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann \u00a7 43-1089(G)(3) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If this were how Arizona applied the statute, the Arizona program would be similar to the majority of the tax credit programs currently in operation. Like Section 1089, four of these programs contain provisions directing scholarship organizations to provide scholarships for students to attend <em>any </em>qualified school of their parents\u2019 choice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These \u201cparental choice\u201d clauses may explain the apparent absence of any Establishment Clause challenges to those programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">This is not, however, how the Arizona Department of Revenue applies the statute. According to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, Arizona gives tax credits reimbursing individuals who contribute to STOs that expressly restrict their scholarships to use at religious schools. The largest STO, the Catholic Tuition Organization of the Diocese of Phoenix, restricts its scholarships to use at Catholic schools in the Phoenix Diocese; the second largest, the Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization provides scholarships only to students attending evangelical Christian schools; and the third largest, Brophy Community Foundation, restricts its scholarships to use at two specific Catholic schools. <em>See Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1006. As a result of how the Arizona Department of Revenue applies Section 1089, plaintiffs allege, these three religious STOs controlled 85 percent of the total STO donations in 1998, the year before the complaint was filed. <em>See id. </em>at 1006. Plaintiffs argue that it is this application of Section 1089 that violates the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">II. Effect</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">We turn first to the issue of \u201cwhether Section 1089 \u2018has the forbidden \u201ceffect\u201d of advancing or inhibiting religion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1012 (quoting <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 649, 122 S.Ct. 2460).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">A. Parental Choice</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">The <em>Winn </em>panel held that the Arizona Department of Revenue\u2019s application of Section 1089 may not provide parents with \u201ctrue private choice\u201d within the meaning of <em>Zelman. See id. </em>at 1015-18. With respect to this conclusion, the dissent accuses the panel of rejecting the majority\u2019s holding in <em>Zelman </em>in favor of Judge Souter\u2019s dissent. Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">The dissent fails to address the crucial difference between the Ohio voucher program upheld in <em>Zelman </em>and the Arizona Department of Revenue\u2019s application of Section 1089: with respect to religion, the Ohio program gave parents <em>equal access </em>to tuition benefits. <em>See Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 645, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Under the Ohio program, the state provided tuition aid on the basis of financial need, without regard to religion, and eligible parents were free to apply the aid toward any private school, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>religious or secular, or toward a public school outside the district willing to participate in the program (though none was). If a parent decided to send her child to a private school, the state wrote a check made payable to the parent, which the parent could then endorse over to her chosen school. <em>See id. </em>at 646., 122 S.Ct. 2460 Crucially, a parent\u2019s choice to send her child to a religious school would <em>neither help nor harm </em>her chance of receiving tuition aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Whether such a program violates the Establishment Clause, the Court held, does not depend on whether the parent receiving tuition aid has a broader array of religious than secular schools to choose from. This is because \u201c[t]he constitutionality of a <em>neutral </em>educational aid program simply does not turn on whether and why, in a particular area, at a particular time, most private schools are run by religious organizations, or most recipients choose to use the aid at a religious school.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (emphasis added). The majority in <em>Zelman </em>made clear, however, that a \u201cneutral educational aid program\u201d\u2014 or, as the Court also put it, a \u201cprogram of true private choice\u201d \u2014 is one that grants <em>access </em>to benefits without regard to religion. <em>Id. </em>at 658, 662, 122 S.Ct. 2460.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The importance of providing equal access to benefits is emphasized throughout <em>Zelman. A </em>common thread running through indirect aid programs the Supreme Court has upheld against Establishment Clause challenges, the <em>Zelman </em>Court observed, is that they have been <em>\u201cneutral </em>with respect to religion[] and provide[d] assistance <em>directly </em>to a broad class of citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (emphases added); <em>see also Mueller, </em>463 U.S. at 397, 103 S.Ct. 3062; <em>Witters v. Wash. Dep\u2019t of Servs. for the Blind, </em>474 U.S. 481, 487, 106 S.Ct. 748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986); <em>Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., </em>509 U.S. 1, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Likewise, under the Ohio voucher program, the Court stressed, \u201c[pjrogram <em>benefits </em>are available to participating families <em>on neutral terms, </em>with no reference to religion.\u201d <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 653, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">By contrast, as plaintiffs allege the Arizona Department of Revenue applies the statute, access to Section 1089-funded scholarships is not \u201cavailable ... on neutral terms, with no reference to religion.\u201d Parents who are unwilling to send their child to a religious school may be denied access to program benefits because, as plaintiffs allege, there are not a sufficient number of scholarships available for use at secular schools. Accordingly, these parents are shut out of the program altogether, and at the very least them chances of receiving benefits are harmed by their choice to send their child to a secular school.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">This lack of access on a religiously neutral basis explains why Section 1089 as operated by the Arizona Department of Revenue would violate the Establishment Clause. This conclusion is entirely consistent with \u2014 and required by \u2014 the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Zelman. </em>It is true that the majority in <em>Zelman </em>rejected Justice Souter\u2019s view that the number of religious and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>secular schools participating in the Ohio voucher program was relevant to its constitutionality. But before the Court addressed Justice Souter\u2019s concerns, it first identified several features of the Ohio program that made it one of \u201ctrue private choice ..., and thus constitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Among these features, the tuition aid distributed under the Ohio program created \u201cno \u2018financial incentives\u2019 that \u2018skew[ed]\u2019 the program toward religious schools.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Witters, </em>474 U.S. at 487-88, 106 S.Ct. 748). The Court recognized that \u201c[s]uch incentives \u2018are not present where the aid is <em>allocated </em>on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is <em>made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.\u2019\u201d Id. </em>at 653-54, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (emphasis added, alteration and ellipses omitted) (quoting <em>Agostini v. Felton, </em>521 U.S. 203, 231, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The Arizona Department of Revenue permits scholarships funded under Section 1089 <em>not </em>to be \u201cmade available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.\u201d Therefore, <em>Zelman </em>requires a closer look at whether the program, as applied, creates \u201cfinancial incentives that skew the program toward religious schools.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). This is why it is relevant that, by allowing tax credits for contributions to discriminatory STOs, the Arizona Department of Revenue has created an overwhelming disparity in the number of scholarships exclusively available for use at religious schools compared to the number available for use at secular schools. <em>See Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1016-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Consistent with Section 1089\u2019s parental choice provision, <em>see </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 43-1089 (2005), the Arizona Department of Revenue <em>could </em>apply the program to require that STOs make state-funded scholarships \u201cavailable to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.\u201d <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 653-54, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (internal quotation marks omitted). If Section 1089 were applied in this neutral manner, data concerning the number of scholarships applied toward religious schools versus secular schools would indeed be irrelevant to the Establishment Clause inquiry as long as the State of Arizona otherwise provided students \u201ca range of [secular] educational choices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655, 122 S.Ct. 2460.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">As Section 1089 is currently applied, however, the program allows state-funded scholarships to be restricted to use at religious schools. It is therefore necessary to consider whether, in reality, the program creates incentives for parents to send their children to religious schools in order to gain access to benefits. This conclusion is required by \u2014 and, at the very least, consistent <em>with </em>\u2014 Zelman.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">The dissent contends that the Arizona program is valid because the State of Arizona has <em>other </em>programs in place that pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>vide secular educational options for those unable to obtain a program scholarship. <em>See Zelman, </em>586 U.S. at 655-56, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (\u201cThe Establishment Clause question is whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools, and that question must be answered by-evaluating <em>all </em>options Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to <em>obtain </em>a program scholarship and then choose a religious school.\u201d (emphases added)). The dissent fails to recognize <em>Zelman\u2019s </em>holding that a program of \u201ctrue private choice\u201d is one in which \u201c[p]rogram benefits are available to participating families on neutral terms, with no reference to religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653, 122 S.Ct. 2460. A short hypothetical will show why the dissent\u2019s reading of <em>Zelman </em>is untenable. Consider a program, instituted by a state that provides an array of secular educational options, that offers tax deductions exclusively to parents sending their children to private schools. Each eligible parent receives a tax deduction unrelated to the amount spent on tuition, thus ensuring a windfall to parents who send their children to religious schools, which typically charge lower rates than secular private schools. Assume this hypothetical program has a valid secular purpose. For most potential recipients, however, benefits under the program are, as a practical matter, available only if the recipient chooses to send her child to a relatively low-cost religious school. Thus, the unmistakable effect of the program is to create special incentives to send one\u2019s child to a sectarian school.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Under the dissent\u2019s reading of <em>Zelman, </em>this hypothetical program would easily withstand an Establishment Clause challenge. Anyone can participate in the program. Anyone who participates receives identical tax benefits. Anyone can apply the tax benefits toward a private school of his or her choice. <em>See </em>Dissent 660. Moreover, for those who choose not to participate in the program, the state provides an array of public schooling options. <em>See id. </em>at 666-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">This program is not a hypothetical; it is the New York tax deduction scheme invalidated in <em>Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, </em>413 U.S. 756, 93 S.Ct. 2993, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973)\u2014 a case that <em>Zelman </em>distinguished but declined to overturn.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Nyquist, </em>413 U.S. at 788, 93 S.Ct. 2955 (\u201cIn its attempt to enhance the opportunities of the poor to choose between public and nonpublic education, the State has taken a step which can only be regarded as one \u2018advancing\u2019 religion.\u201d); <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 661, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (observing that the \u201c \u2018function\u2019 \u201d of the New York program \u201cwas <em>\u2018unmistakably </em>to provide desired financial support for nonpublic, sectarian institutions\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Nyquist, </em>413 U.S. at 783, 93 S.Ct. 2955 (emphasis added))). <em>Zelman </em>explained that <em>Nyquist </em>had \u201cexpressly reserved judgment with respect to \u2018a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>involving some form of public assistance <em>(e.g., </em>scholarships) made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Nyquist, </em>413 U.S. at 782-83, 93 S.Ct. 2955). The Ohio voucher program fit this description. The Arizona Department of Revenue\u2019s application of Section 1089 does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In <em>Zelman, </em>the Court clarified that <em>\u201cNyquist </em>does not govern neutral educational assistance programs that ... offer aid directly to a broad class of individual recipients defined without regard to religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, 122 S.Ct. 2460. According to the dissent, Section 1089 is such a \u201cneutral educational assistance program.\u201d By the dissent\u2019s logic, however, the New York program invalidated in <em>Nyquist </em>would also be such a program. Even more troublesome, a program that provided tax deductions exclusively to parents sending their children to <em>religious </em>schools would also constitute a \u201cneutral educational assistance program\u201d as long as the state had other programs in place that provided secular educational options. It is this result, not the outcome in <em>Winn, </em>\u201cthat simply cannot be reconciled with <em>Zelman.\u201d </em>Dissent 661. The Supreme Court elected not to overturn <em>Nyquist, </em>and we may not do so on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">B. Taxpayer Choice</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Next, the dissent challenges the panel\u2019s conclusion that the choices provided to <em>taxpayers </em>under Section 1089 \u2014 choices that, plaintiffs allege, restrict <em>parents\u2019 </em>access to secular educational scholarships \u2014 fail to render the program constitutional. <em>See Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1018-23. Specifically, the dissent contends the panel misapplied <em>Larkin v. Grendel\u2019s Den, Inc., </em>459 U.S. 116, 103 S.Ct. 505, 74 L.Ed.2d 297 (1982). A careful reading of <em>Winn </em>shows that the dissent exaggerates the panel\u2019s reliance on <em>Larkin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\"><em>Larkin </em>does not control this case. <em>See Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1020 (emphasizing that \u201cthe delegation of scholarship funding to individual taxpayers, such as in Section 1089, does less to promote religion than the delegation of zoning authority to churches,\u201d such as provided under the statute at issue in <em>Larkin). </em>Rather, the panel observed that <em>Larkin\u2019s </em>holding</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APo\">illustrates that when a statute delegates \u201ca power ordinarily vested in agencies of government\u201d to a private party, <em>see [Larkin, </em>459 U.S.] at 122, 103 S.Ct. 505, without reasonable assurance that the party\u2019s choices will advance the secular purposes of the statute, any ensuing \u201cperceived endorsement of a religious message\u201d may be \u201creasonably attribut[ed]\u201d to the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-10\"><em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1020-21 (second quotation from <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 652, 122 S.Ct. 2460).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, <em>Larkin\u2019s </em>holding is not limited to cases where the state vests governmental powers in a \u201cpervasively sectarian organization.\u201d Dissent 668. In <em>Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet, </em>512 U.S. 687, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994), for example, the Court applied <em>Larkin </em>when considering an Establishment Clause challenge to a statute creating a school district coextensive with a religious community. This statute vested power in individual taxpayers, not in a religious organization, but the Court nonetheless invalidated it. <em>See id. </em>at 698, 114 S.Ct. 2481 (\u201cThe Establishment Clause problem [at issue] is more subtle [than that in <em>Larkin </em>], but it resembles the issue raised in <em>Larkin </em>to the extent that the earlier case teaches that a State may not delegate its civic authority to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>group chosen according to a religious criterion.\u201d). Again, <em>Winn </em>does not suggest that the choices delegated to taxpayers under the Arizona Department of Revenue\u2019s construction of Section 1089 are the constitutional equivalent of the legislative action at issue in <em>Kiryas Joel. </em>That case makes clear, however, that the delegation concerns identified in <em>Larkin </em>are relevant to whether a reasonable, informed observer would conclude that the choices delegated under Section 1089 have the effect of promoting, or hindering, the program\u2019s secular purpose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The dissent further argues that in terms of constraining parents\u2019 access to secular educational options, taxpayers\u2019 choices under Section 1089 are no more constitutionally problematic than the choice of public schools not to participate in the Ohio voucher program in <em>Zelman. </em>Dissent 668. This misses the point. Under the Ohio program, it was not the public schools\u2019 choices that ensured \u201cthe Establishment Clause was not implicated\u201d \u2014 it was the <em>parents\u2019 </em>choices. <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 652, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Each parent had an equal choice under the Ohio program as to whether to apply a tuition voucher toward a private school, and the choice of one parent did not directly alter the array of options available to another parent. Accordingly, under the Ohio program, a parent\u2019s choice as to how best to educate her child had no coercive effect on another parent\u2019s choice whether to send her child to a secular or religious school. The Ohio program thus provided each eligible parent with a \u201cgenuine and <em>independent </em>private choice\u201d whether to direct assistance to a religious school. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The choices given to parents under the program therefore ensured \u201cthe circuit between government and religion was broken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although a public school\u2019s decision not to accept a voucher could indeed frustrate the secular purpose of the Ohio program, the Supreme Court did not <em>rely </em>on those choices to conclude the program was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">By contrast, the appellees in <em>Winn rely </em>on taxpayers\u2019 choices in arguing that the current construction of Section 1089 is valid under the Establishment Clause. The effect of these taxpayer choices, however, may be to <em>ham </em>the ability of aspiring scholarship recipients to obtain a scholarship available for use at a secular school. Accordingly, Section 1089 \u201cdelegat[es] to taxpayers a choice that, from the perspective of the program\u2019s aid recipients, \u2018deliberately skew[s] incentives toward religious schools.\u2019 \u201d <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1013 (quoting <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 650, 122 S.Ct. 2460). Such choices are not, in themselves, sufficient to render an educational aid program valid under the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">In summary, it was crucial to Zelman\u2019s holding that the Ohio program afforded aid <em>recipients </em>a \u201cgenuine and independent private choice\u201d whether to direct the assistance they received toward a religious school. <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 652, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Although the Arizona Department of Revenue\u2019s application of Section 1089 does not afford such choice, <em>Winn </em>carefully determined that the choice provided to <em>taxpayers </em>is insufficient to ensure \u201cthe circuit between government and religion was broken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For reasons carefully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>laid out in the decision, our court was correct to decline en banc review.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">III. Secular Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The dissent also faults <em>Winn </em>for concluding that Section 1089 may lack a valid secular purpose. <em>See </em>562 F.3d at 1011-12. This criticism is premature. The question before the panel was \u201cnot whether Section 1089 in fact has a genuine, secular purpose, but whether plaintiffs could prove, on the facts alleged in the complaint, that it does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">As the dissent states, a \u201clegislature\u2019s stated reasons\u201d for enacting a statute \u201cwill generally get deference,\u201d and must be accepted as true except in \u201cunusual cases where the claim was an apparent sham, or the secular purpose secondary.\u201d <em>McCreary County v. ACLU of Ky., </em>545 U.S. 844, 865, 125 S.Ct. 2722, 162 L.Ed.2d 729 (2005). The inquiry into whether a statute\u2019s ostensible purpose is a sham or secondary to a religious objective, however, must be \u201cundertaken from the perspective of \u2018an objective observer, one who takes account of the traditional external signs that show up in the text, legislative history, and implementation of the statute, or comparable official act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1012 (quoting <em>McCreary, </em>545 U.S. at 862, 125 S.Ct. 2722). The dissent\u2019s position would foreclose such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The dissent surmises that in enacting Section 1089,\u201c[t]he legislature could hardly have had the \u2018purpose\u2019 of endorsing religion when it set up a plan that, <em>for all it knew, </em>could have resulted in absolutely no funding for religious entities.\u201d Dissent 670 (emphasis added). The dissent makes this claim without citing any evidence concerning what the legislature <em>actually </em>knew about how Section 1089 would likely operate. This is just as well, because no such evidence yet appears in the record. But the dissent suggests it should not <em>matter </em>to us whether the legislature knew that Section 1089 would result in disproportionate funding being made available only for use at religious institutions. The Supreme Court has cautioned us, however, against evaluating a program\u2019s purpose from the perspective of an \u201cabsentminded objective observer, not one presumed to be familiar with the history of the government\u2019s actions and competent to learn what history has to show.\u201d <em>McCreary, </em>545 U.S. at 866, 125 S.Ct. 2722. In short, the dissent appears to call for either a heightened pleading standard for Establishment Clause claims \u2014 under which the plaintiff must allege specific facts establishing that the legislature acted for an invalid purpose \u2014 or an approach to evaluating a program\u2019s purpose that \u201cwould cut context out of the enquiry, to the point of ignoring history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 864, 125 S.Ct. 2722.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">Regarding evidence of Section 1089\u2019s implementation, the dissent contends that because taxpayer contributions to STOs are private conduct, they are irrelevant to whether Section 1089 has a valid secular purpose. Notably, in an as-applied context, at least two circuits have considered private conduct under a government program to be probative of the program\u2019s purpose,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and <em>Winn </em>does not foreclose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>possibility that plaintiffs can point to private conduct probative of whether Section 1089 has a secular purpose. More probative, however, is the <em>government </em>conduct on the part of the State of Arizona in implementing Section 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The Arizona Department of Revenue implements Section 1089 by allowing individuals to claim tax credits for contributions to private STOs. <em>See Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1009 (\u201cThe Supreme Court has recognized ... that <em>state tax policies </em>such as tax deductions, tax exemptions and tax credits are <em>means of\u2018channeling ... [state] assistance\u2019 </em>to private organizations....\u201d (emphasis added, ellipses in original) (quoting <em>Mueller, </em>463 U.S. at 399, 103 S.Ct. 3062)). According to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the Arizona Department of Revenue allows tax credits for contributions to STOs that provide scholarships only to religious schools. Individuals\u2019 contributions to STOs that discriminate on the basis of religion are not, of themselves, probative of Section 1089\u2019s purpose. The fact that the Arizona Department of Revenue gives tax credits for these contributions, however, could be probative of legislative expectations as to how state assistance under Section 1089 would be directed in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Accordingly, by declining to rehear this case en banc, we appropriately rejected the suggestion that we should turn a blind eye to the history and implementation of Section 1089 simply because the statute is facially neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">This case required the panel to apply <em>Zelman </em>to an educational aid program that, according to the allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, lets taxpayers choose to make state-reimbursed contributions to private scholarship organizations, but allows the organizations to restrict access to state-funded scholarships on the basis of religion. <em>Winn </em>correctly held that such a program would not, under <em>Zelman, </em>provide parents with \u201cgenuine and independent private choice,\u201d and that the choice given to taxpayers under such a program could not be treated as the constitutional equivalent of the choice given to parents under the Ohio voucher program. Unlike the program in <em>Zelman, </em>the program alleged here neither makes scholarships available to parents on a religiously neutral basis nor gives them a true private choice as to where to utilize the scholarships. The panel correctly held that these allegations, if proven true, could establish an Establishment Clause violation. We therefore concur in the denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\">. All references to \u201cSection 1089\u201d refer to the program as set forth in Arizona Revised Statutes Annotated \u00a7 43-1089 (2005), the version of the statute in place when plaintiffs' complaint was filed. Any differences between this and the current version of Section 1089 are not significant for purposes of the analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\">. The dissent sees no constitutional distinction between a tax deduction and a tax credit. <em>See </em>Dissent 659 n.3. We disagree. A tax-credit eligible contribution to an STO costs the taxpayer nothing. <em>See Winn v. Killian, </em>307 F.3d 1011, 1015 n. 5 (9th Cir.2002), <em>aff'd sub. nom Hibbs v.

The funds that he may contribute will be unavailable to him in any event: they will be used either to make the contribution or to pay the taxes he owes.\u201d). Tax deductible contributions, by contrast, impose a cost on the taxpayer. <em>See id. </em>(\"[W]hen a taxpayer is entitled to a tax deduction, the taxpayer must in most if not all instances still pay a majority of the tax involved[.]\u201d).

This case is more notable, however, for what it does not involve: state action advancing religion. The government does not direct any aid to any reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>gious school. Nor does the government encourage, promote, or otherwise incentivize private actors to direct aid to religious schools. Rather, \u201cstate aid reaches religious schools solely as a result of the numerous independent decisions of private individuals.\u201d <em>Zelman v.

Sadly, our three-judge panel reversed. <em>See Winn v. Ariz. Christian Sch. Tuition Org., </em>562 F.3d 1002 (9th Cir.2009). Because a program of scrupulous \u201cgovernmental neutrality between religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion,\u201d <em>Epperson v.

Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 43-1089(A). Anyone can form an STO, and there are no constraints on a taxpayer\u2019s ability to donate to an STO of his choice. Should a taxpayer elect to direct funds to an STO, that contribution is refunded via tax credits of up to $500 for individual taxpayers and up to $1000 for married couples filing jointly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">STOs use these funds to provide scholarships and tuition grants to students attending schools within the state. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 43-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>1089(G).

After that, the government takes its hands off the wheel. Anyone can create an STO. Anyone can contribute to any STO and receive identical tax benefits. Anyone can apply for any scholarship offered by any STO.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Shortly after Section 1089\u2019s enactment, the Arizona Supreme Court held that the statute, on its face, did not violate the Establishment Clause. <em>See Kotterman v. Killian, </em>193 Ariz. 273, 972 P.2d 606 (1999). Taxpayer plaintiffs then brought this federal action, which was dismissed by the district court under the Tax Injunction Act. <em>See Winn v. Killian, </em>307 F.3d 1011, 1013 (9th Cir.2002). After the suit was reinstated, <em>see id. </em>at 1020; <em>see also Hibbs v. Winn, </em>542 U.S. 88, 124 S.Ct. 2276, 159 L.Ed.2d 172 (2004) (affirming our opinion reversing its dismissal), the district court again dismissed the action, this time on federal constitutional grounds, <em>see Winn v. Hibbs, </em>361 F.Supp.2d 1117 (D.Ariz.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Plaintiffs appealed. They allege (and no one disputes) that in practice, some STOs make their scholarships available only to students willing to attend religiously affiliated schools. <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1006. While the majority of STOs do not so limit their scholarships,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> plaintiffs maintain that those that do receive the overwhelming majority of taxpayer contributions. <em>See id. </em>Consequently, they assert that the pool of available scholarship money is diminished for parents wishing to send their children to secular schools. <em>See id. </em>Plaintiffs contend that this disparity means Section 1089, as applied, impermissibly favors religion over nonreligion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">The three-judge panel agreed and reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal, holding that \u201cif plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are accepted as true, Section 1089 violates the Establishment Clause.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1013. Concluding that the nature of the tax credit made taxpayer contributions tantamount to government funds, the panel found that Section 1089 potentially violated both the purpose and effects prongs of <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 603, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). <em>See id. </em>at 1011-23. The fact that taxpayers directed the majority of available funds to religious schools, the panel reasoned, deprived parents of a \u201cgenuinely independent and private choice[]\u201d to send their children to secular private schools. <em>Id. </em>at 1013 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, Section 1089 was not a \u201cneutral program of private choice and a reasonable observer could ... conclude that the aid reaching religious schools ... car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>ries with it the <em>imprimatur </em>of government endorsement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1013-14 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">I have no bone to pick with the manner in which the panel frames the basic constitutional inquiry. We all understand that the Establishment Clause \u201cprevents a State from enacting laws that have the \u2018purpose\u2019 or \u2018effect\u2019 of advancing or inhibiting religion.\u201d <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 648-49, 122 S.Ct. 2460. More often than not, the Court determines whether these commands have been violated by asking whether a \u201creasonable observer,\u201d who is \u201caware of the history and context underlying a challenged program,\u201d would conclude that the state has \u201cendorsed\u201d religion. <em>Id. </em>at 655, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The panel\u2019s heavy emphasis on <em>Zelman </em>is also warranted. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld an Ohio school voucher program that provided tuition aid to Cleveland families on the basis of need. <em>Id. </em>at 644-45, 122 S.Ct. 2460. The vouchers were distributed directly to parents, who could choose to use the scholarship money at any participating private, community, magnet, or public school. <em>Id. </em>at 645-46, 122 S.Ct. 2460. The Court ruled that a \u201cneutral program of private choice, where state aid reaches religious schools solely as a result of the numerous independent decisions of private individuals\u201d does not violate the Establishment Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 655, 122 S.Ct. 2460.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">It is in the application of these standards, however, that the three-judge panel lost the forest for the trees. In doing so, it reached a result that simply cannot be reconciled with <em>Zelmanf.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">The panel is correct that a law may not have the \u201cforbidden \u2018effect\u2019 of advancing ... religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649, 122 S.Ct. 2460. What the panel seems to neglect, however, is that \u201c[f]or a law to have forbidden \u2018effects\u2019 under <em>Lemon, </em>it must be fair to say that the <em>government itself </em>has advanced religion through its own activities and influence.\u201d <em>Corp. of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, </em>483 U.S. 327, 337, 107 S.Ct. 2862, 97 L.Ed.2d 273 (1987).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">I must confess that I am at a loss to understand how a reasonable observer\u2014 one fully informed about all matters related to the program \u2014 could conclude that the <em>\u201cgovernment itself\u201d </em>has endorsed reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>gion in this case. Multiple layers of private, individual choice separate the state from any religious entanglement: the <em>\u201cgovernment itself\u201d </em>is at least four times removed from any aid to religious organizations. First, an individual or group of individuals must choose to create an STO. Second, that STO must then decide to provide scholarships to religious schools. Third, taxpayers have to contribute to the STO in question. Finally, parents need to apply for a scholarship for their student. In every respect and at every level, these are purely private choices, not government policy. Under such circumstances, \u201cgovernment cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.\u201d <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 652-53, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Only after passing through choice piled upon choice do government funds reach religious organizations. That is not government endorsement: that is government nonchalance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">To illustrate my point, consider the following hypothetical. Assume the exact statutory scheme embodied in Section 1089: anyone can create an STO, anyone can donate to an STO, and STOs can limit their scholarships to particular types of schools. Now imagine that only agnostics decide to create STOs. Imagine further that every STO refuses to provide tuition assistance to religious schools. In short, assume there is absolutely no money available for parents who want to send their children to a religious school. Would the parents be justified in accusing the <em>government </em>of depriving their children of school funds? Of course not.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The foregoing example plainly shows that in this case, any \u201cendorsement\u201d of religion arising from the disbursement of state funds to religious entities turns wholly and completely on the independent, uncoerced choices of private individuals. The system Arizona created could just as easily have resulted in a total dearth of funding for religious organizations as opposed to the surfeit allegedly available. This feast or famine is utterly out of the state\u2019s hands. It simply cannot be, as the panel claims, that the \u201cscholarship <em>program ... </em>skews aid in favor of religious schools.\u201d <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1013 (emphasis added). The \u201cprogram\u201d does no such thing: any \u201cskewing]\u201d that occurs takes place because of private, not government action. It is axiomatic that such action cannot violate the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">The panel however, believes that under this multi-tiered system, choice is the culprit, not the savior. After all, plaintiffs allege that it is \u201cthe choice delegated to taxpayers\u201d which \u201cchannels a disproportionate amount of government aid to sectarian STOs [that] limit their scholarships to use at religious schools.\u201d <em>Id. Zelman, </em>the panel maintains, focused on parental choice. <em>Id. </em>at 1018. Here, however, that choice is purported impermissibly to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u201cconstrained\u201d by the decisions of taxpayers and STOs. <em>Id. </em>at 1016. In other words, the choices of others deprive parents of their own \u201cindependent and private choice[].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1013 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). They might want to send their children to secular private schools, but scholarships are not readily available for that purpose. Moreover, the panel claims the alleged abundance of funds from religious STOs creates an incentive for these parents to enroll their children in religious schools. <em>Id. </em>at 1017-18. The panel therefore holds that Section 1089 \u201cfails to provide genuine opportunities for ... parents to select secular educational options for their school-age children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1018 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">I admit that the panel\u2019s conclusion with respect to the purported lack of parental choice finds support in <em>Zelman. </em>The problem is, that support comes from Justice Souter\u2019s dissent, not the opinion of the Court. Several aspects of the majority\u2019s reasoning in that case make the <em>Winn </em>panel\u2019s conclusion infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">By focusing generally on the scope of parental choice, the <em>Winn </em>panel, like the <em>Zelman </em>dissent, is barking up the wrong tree. The question is not whether a parent\u2019s choice is somehow limited or constrained, the question is whether the <em>government </em>has somehow limited or constrained the choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">In <em>Zelman, </em>Justice Souter accused the majority of allowing external factors to \u201cinfluencie] choices in a way that aims the money in a religious direction.\u201d 536 U.S. at 703, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (Souter, J., dissenting). Of the fifty-six private schools that participated in the Cleveland voucher program, he noted, forty-six were religious. <em>Id. </em>In his mind, this lack of a \u201cwide array of private nonreligious options\u201d suggested that any \u201cchoice\u201d was not genuine. <em>See id. </em>at 703-06, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Rather, he believed parents\u2019 decisionmaking process was skewed by \u201cthe fact that too few nonreligious school desks are available and few but religious schools can afford to accept more than a handful of voucher students.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707, 122 S.Ct. 2460. \u201cFor the overwhelming number of children in the voucher scheme,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe only alternative to the public schools is religious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He was not swayed by the fact that these constraints were unrelated to state action: \u201ca Hobson\u2019s choice is not a choice, whatever the reason for being Hobsonian.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In sum, Justice Souter would have struck down the Ohio voucher program because parents\u2019 choice was influenced by factors beyond their control.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">Obviously, Justice Souter\u2019s position did not carry the day. \u201cThat 46 of the 56 private schools now participating in the program are religious schools,\u201d the majority explained, \u201cdoes not condemn it as a violation of the Establishment Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (majority opinion). For one thing, the Court noted that the imbalance was not a function of government action. <em>See id. </em>at 656-57, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Moreover, \u201c[t]o attribute constitutional significance\u201d to the availability of secular options, \u201cwould lead to the absurd result that a neutral school-choice program might be permissible in ... some states [with a high concentration of secular schools], but not in other States [where religious schools are plentiful].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657, 122 S.Ct. 2460.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To avoid this ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>surdity, the majority held that \u201c[t]he constitutionality of a neutral educational aid program simply does not turn on whether and why, in a particular area, at a particular time,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> most private schools are run by religious organizations, or most recipients choose to use the aid at a religious school.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 122 S.Ct. 2460.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">I see no meaningful distinction between the situation in <em>Zelman </em>and the facts of this case. Both cases involve alleged \u201cconstraints\u201d on access to a scarce secular resource \u2014 \u201cnonreligious [private] school desks.\u201d In <em>Zelman, </em>only ten of the participating schools were secular. <em>Id. </em>at 656, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Parents were thus \u201cconstrained\u201d by third-party decisions to fund religious, rather than secular schools. Here, while thirty out of fifty-five STOs offer scholarships to secular schools, the majority of program funds are allegedly concentrated in religious STOs. Parents are thus \u201cconstrained\u201d by the decisions of some STOs to limit their scholarships to religious institutions, and taxpayer choices to direct their funds to those STOs. The key point is that in neither <em>Zelman </em>nor the case at hand are the purported \u201cconstraints\u201d government-induced. There is simply no constitutionally significant distinction between a system where \u2014 for reasons unattributable to state action \u2014 money is available, but there are a limited number of schools to receive it, and a system where schools may be available, but there is a limited amount of money to spend. Under either scenario, as Justice Souter bemoaned, \u201c[f]or the overwhelming number of children in the [program], the only alternative to the public schools is religious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (Souter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">I can go on. In <em>Zelman, </em>voucher funds could be used at participating public schools in districts adjacent to Cleveland. <em>Id. </em>at 645, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (majority opinion). However, no such school \u201celected to participate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 647, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Parental choice was therefore \u201cconstrained\u201d by the decisions of out-of-district public school administrators. Similarly, Ohio did not require private secular schools to accept vouchers: they chose to do so. <em>See id. </em>at 656 n. 4, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Citing overcrowding or a desire for independence from government funds, these schools could just as easily have decided to opt out of the program. Alternatively, they could have, for whatever reason, decided to close up shop. In either scenario, parents again would be left with a reduced \u201cchoice\u201d to send their children to private, secular schools. Did the <em>Zelman </em>Court strike down the Ohio program for impermissibly \u201cdelegating\u201d such decisions to school administrators? Was parental choice held to be unduly \u201cconstrained\u201d? Of course not. Instead, the Court said that the availability of a private secular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>education, \u201cin a particular area, at a particular time,\u201d was irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry. <em>See Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 656-60, 122 S.Ct. 2460; <em>supra </em>pp. 663-64.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Ultimately, the panel seems to assume that parents must have the same access to \u201cnonreligious [private] school desks\u201d as they do to religious private school desks. But that was certainly not the case in <em>Zelman, </em>and the Ohio voucher program was upheld. Indeed, such result is unattainable in <em>any </em>program where the government is neutral with respect to religion and nonreligion. If the government takes the constitutionally required hands-off approach, external factors \"will define the playing field. Contrary to the panel\u2019s conclusion, the constitutional inquiry \u201csimply does not turn\u201d on whatever influence these factors might exert on parents. <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 658, 122 S.Ct. 2460.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Again, provided there is \u201cno evidence that the <em>State </em>deliberately skewed incentives toward religious schools,\u201d there is no Establishment Clause violation. <em>Id. </em>at 650, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (emphasis added); <em>see supra </em>pp. 661-62. As the Arizona tax credit program is just as much a program of \u201ctrue private choice\u201d as the program in <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 649, 122 S.Ct. 2460, the panel erred in reinstating the constitutional challenge.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">In rejecting Justice Souter\u2019s position, the <em>Zelman </em>majority also emphasized that he was asking the wrong question. Rather than focusing narrowly on the challenged voucher program, the majority explained that the \u201cEstablishment Clause question is whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools, and that question must be answered by evaluating <em>all </em>options Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a[voucher].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655-56, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Because the <em>Winn </em>panel adopts Justice Souter\u2019s overly restrictive approach, rather than assessing <em>\u201call </em>options\u201d available to Arizona students, its result is similarly flawed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Indeed, the panel overtly limited its parental-choice inquiry to \u201cthe range of educational choices the STO-administered scholarship programs offer.\u201d <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1018. It \u201crejected] the suggestion that the mere existence of the public school system guarantees that any scholarship program provides for genuine private choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the latter statement may be true, it is also something of a non sequitur. No one claims the existence of a public school system grants a state license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>to ignore the Establishment Clause. The question, as <em>Zelman </em>instructs, is whether Arizona is \u201ccoercing parents into sending their children to religious schools,\u201d a question which must be answered by evaluating <em>\u201call </em>options\u201d Arizona provides its schoolchildren. 536 U.S. at 655-56, 122 S.Ct. 2460.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The panel did not even engage in this inquiry. Had it done so, it would have discovered that Section 1089 is but one of a \u201crange of educational choices\u201d available to parents of school-aged children. <em>Id. </em>at 655, 122 S.Ct. 2460; <em>see also Kotterman, </em>972 P.2d at 611 (noting that the \u201cArizona Legislature has, in recent years, expanded the options available in public education\u201d and listing some of those options). Arizona\u2019s public schools must provide for open enrollment, allowing parents to send their children, tuition-free, to schools of their choice. Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15-816.01(A). Tax credits are available for donations to public schools for \u201cextracurricular activities or character education.\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 43-1089.01. An extensive system of charter schools \u201cprovide[s] additional academic choices for parents and pupils.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 15-181.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Homeschooling is permitted and protected. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15-745, 802-03. Indeed, Section 1089 itself offers parents yet another alternative: they can create their own STO and solicit donations for use at secular private schools. These alternative educational opportunities mirror those the Court took into consideration in <em>Zelman. See </em>536 U.S. at 655, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (\u201cCleveland schoolchildren enjoy a range of educational choices: They may remain in public school as before, remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose a religious school, obtain a scholarship and choose a nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school, or enroll in a magnet school.\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">This is no Hobson\u2019s choice. Far from \u201ccoercing\u201d parents into sending their children to religious schools, Arizona provides a wide variety of secular alternatives. \u201cAny objective observer familiar with the full history and context of [Section 1089] would reasonably view it as one aspect of a broader undertaking....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655, 122 S.Ct. 2460. By shutting its eyes to the host of options available to Arizona parents, the panel\u2019s opinion directly conflicts with <em>Zelman.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">As demonstrated by the foregoing arguments, the Arizona program provides parents with \u201ctrue private choice.\u201d That established, the panel\u2019s discussion of taxpayer choice becomes surplusage. Indeed, is its curious focus on \u201ctaxpayer choice\u201d an apt analogy at all? I suggest that <em>Winn\u2019s </em>reliance on <em>Larkin v. Grendel\u2019s Den, Inc., </em>459 U.S. 116, 103 S.Ct. 505, 74 L.Ed.2d 297 (1982), is utterly mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The thrust of the panel\u2019s reasoning is that taxpayer choice is not a valid substitute for the <em>parental </em>choice allegedly at the core of <em>Zelman. </em>I am not certain, however, that parental choice was as central to the reasoning of <em>Zelman </em>as the panel would have it. While that opinion does repeatedly refer to aid \u201crecipients,\u201d <em>see Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1018 (listing citations), at other times, it refers only to private, nongovernmental choice, <em>see, e.g., Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 649, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (describing programs where \u201cgovernment aid reaches religious schools only as a result of the genuine and independent choices of private individuals\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 655, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (stating that \u201cno reasonable observer\u201d would find government endorsement where \u201cstate aid reaches religious schools solely as a result of the numerous independent decisions of private individuals\u201d). Significantly, <em>Zelman </em>seems most concerned about preventing the state from reaching out to \u201cgrant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652-53, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). So long as \u201cfavors\u201d are doled out independent of state action, the Establishment Clause \u2014 which again, prohibits the <em>\u201cgovemment itself\u2019\u2019 </em>from endorsing religion\u2014 is not offended.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">I further submit that under the endorsement test, any level of attenuation between government action and aid to religion necessarily reduces the likelihood that a \u201creasonable observer\u201d will find impermissible government approbation. There can be no doubt that taxpayer choice contributes to that attenuation. Thus, the panel\u2019s analysis of whether the choice Section 1089 provides to taxpayers ensures that \u201c \u2018the circuit between government and religion was broken\u2019 \u201d is beside the point. <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1021 (quoting <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 652, 122 S.Ct. 2460). The self-evident fact is that by \u201cdelegating\u201d the choice to taxpayers, the government already broke the circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Nonetheless, the panel contends a reasonable observer would consider two factors when deciding whether a program of individual choice violates the Establishment Clause: the \u201crole the person making the choice occupies in the structure of the program,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1020, and \u201cwhether the choice delegated ... has the effect of promoting, or hindering, the program\u2019s secular purpose,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1021. Regarding the former, the panel determined there was \u201cno \u2018effective means of guaranteeing\u2019 \u201d that taxpayers would exercise their choice \u201c \u2018exclusively for secular, neutral, and nonideological purposes.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1020 (quoting <em>Larkin, </em>459 U.S. at 125, 103 S.Ct. 505). Parents, on the other hand, have \u201cincentives to apply the program\u2019s aid based on their children\u2019s educational interests instead of on sectarian considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1021. As for the latter, the panel concluded that taxpayers thwarted the secular purpose of the statute insofar as their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>contributions narrowed the range of available educational alternatives. <em>Id. </em>at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">One could see how a reasonable observer in <em>Larkin </em>could perceive government endorsement of religion from the \u201crole the [entity] making the choice\u201d played in the scheme. Maybe I am stating the obvious, but a large part of that perception might rest on the fact that in <em>Larkin, </em>the state delegated legislative authority \u2014 the ability to veto liquor licenses' \u2014 to <em>churches. See </em>459 U.S. at 125, 103 S.Ct. 505. I say again: churches. Under such circumstances it is completely unsurprising that a reasonable observer would conclude that this \u201cjoint exercise of legislative authority by Church and State provides a significant symbolic benefit to religion in the minds of some.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125-26, 103 S.Ct. 505. To what pervasively sectarian organization has Arizona \u201cdelegated\u201d the choice at issue in this case? The Arizona taxpayer.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> When perceived endorsement of religion is at issue, state cooperation with churches is a far cry from state cooperation with taxpayers.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Moreover, I disagree with the panel\u2019s conclusion that parents are somehow less motivated to promote religious objectives than taxpayers generally. As anyone who has grown up in a religious household will tell you, schooling decisions are as frequently made on the basis of <em>religious </em>considerations as they are on purely secular academic grounds. At the very least, sectarian considerations factor into the equation of what is in the child\u2019s best interests educationally. Thus, whether it resides with the taxpayer or the parent, once the choice is made available, the state has no \u201ceffective means of guaranteeing\u201d that it will be exercised \u201cexclusively for secular, neutral, and nonideological purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 103 S.Ct. 505 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). By contrast with engaging in pseudo-psychological inquires into motivation, under <em>Zelman, </em>we need only satisfy ourselves that the choice, whatever it is, is made by a private actor, not by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">With respect to taxpayers\u2019 ability to \u201cthwart\u201d the secular purpose of the statute, as discussed above, actors in <em>any </em>program of true private choice will have this ability. <em>See supra </em>pp. 663-65. In <em>Zelman, </em>for example, the purpose of providing a broad range of educational opportunities was \u201cthwarted\u201d by the decisions of neighboring public-school administrators to decline program vouchers. <em>See supra </em>pp. 664-65. The goal could be similarly \u201cthwarted\u201d if secular private school administrators decided to pull out of the program. <em>See supra </em>pp. 664-65. An inherent reality of true private choice programs cannot condemn Section 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Ultimately, the panel appears to argue that Arizona\u2019s scheme is flawed because it essentially delegates to a private entity something the state could not constitutionally achieve by the exercise of its own powers; here, the promotion of religious education. <em>See Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1020; <em>see also id. </em>at 1021 (citing <em>Norwood v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>Harrison, </em>413 U.S. 455, 465, 93 S.Ct. 2804, 37 L.Ed.2d 723 (1973)). That may well be true, but as the panel\u2019s own citation indicates, for that to be the case, the state must somehow <em>\u201cinduce, encourage </em>or <em>promote </em>private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.\u201d Nor<em>wood, </em>413 U.S. at 465, 93 S.Ct. 2804 (emphases added). At the risk of beating a dead horse, I repeat that the state here has done <em>nothing </em>to cajole parents, STOs, or taxpayers into supporting religious education. The state has simply said, if you donate to the STO of your choice, you get a tax credit. Such action in no way induces, encourages, or promotes private parties to aid religion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The panel also holds that plaintiffs have alleged facts suggesting Section 1089 was not \u201cenacted for ... [a] valid secular purpose.\u201d <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1011 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The panel reaches this conclusion despite conceding that the statute is facially neutral with respect to religion. <em>See id. </em>at 1011-12. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that the driving force behind the bill was anything other than the desire to provide \u201cequal access to a wide range of schooling options for students of every income level.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Mueller, </em>463 U.S. at 395, 103 S.Ct. 3062 (\u201cA state\u2019s decision to defray the cost of educational expenses incurred by parents \u2014 regardless of the type of schools their children attend \u2014 evidences a purpose that is both secular and understandable.\u201d). Nonetheless, the panel maintains that plaintiffs could prove, based on how Section 1089 operates in practice, that this \u201csecular and valid\u201d purpose is a sham. <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1011-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">From its citation to <em>McCreary County v. ACLU, </em>545 U.S. 844, 125 S.Ct. 2722, 162 L.Ed.2d 729 (2005), the panel seems to argue that the very enactment of Section 1089 \u201cbespoke\u201d a religious purpose. <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1012. But how can this be so? <em>McCreary </em>does say that government action can be so \u201cpatently religious\u201d that its nonsecular nature is evident. 545 U.S. at 862, 125 S.Ct. 2722. The examples provided, however, are situations where the state mandated Bible study, the teaching of creationism, and prayer in schools. <em>Id. </em>at 862-63. Setting up a tax credit program to provide scholarships to children generally is hardly of the same ilk.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">To the extent the panel claims that the manner in which Section 1089 has been <em>implemented </em>reveals the stated secular purpose to be a sham, their arguments are similarly unpersuasive. First, the Supreme Court has recognized that a \u201clegislature\u2019s stated reasons will generally get deference,\u201d deference only abandoned in \u201cthose unusual cases where the claim was an apparent sham.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 864-65, 125 S.Ct. 2722. Nothing in the plaintiffs allegations suggest this is one of those \u201cunusual cases,\u201d and as setting up a tax credit program is not a \u201cpatently religious\u201d act, there is nothing \u201capparent\u201d about any purported sham. Second, the implementation inquiry centers on actions taken by the <em>government. See id. </em>at 862, 125 S.Ct. 2722 (stating that the inquiry turns on the \u201ctraditional external signs that show up in the text, legislative history, and implementation of the statute, or comparable official act\u201d) (internal quotation marks and cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>tions omitted); <em>id. </em>at 870-74, 125 S.Ct. 2722 (questioning the government\u2019s newly proffered purposes after it altered a Ten Commandments display in an attempt to mitigate previously stated sectarian purposes). Here, the alleged impropriety arises from taxpayer, not government action. Third, the panel\u2019s holding turns on plaintiffs allegation that \u201cin practice STOs are permitted to restrict the use of their scholarships to use at certain religious schools.\u201d <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1012. But that result is apparent from the statute itself, which is satisfied so long as STOs provide scholarships to two or more schools, <em>see supra </em>note 5, a fact plaintiffs themselves recognize in them complaint. That an STO may independently decide to limit its scholarships does not make a religious purpose \u201capparent.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">Ultimately, the crux of the panel\u2019s purpose holding turns on matters previously discussed under the effects prong: a nonsecular purpose could be inferred from the fact that, at a given moment, the bulk of scholarship money is available only for use at religious schools. But as detailed above, money flows to religious institutions entirely at the whim of nongovernmental actors: taxpayers or STOs. The legislature could hardly have had the \u201cpurpose\u201d of endorsing religion when it set up a plan that, for all it knew, could have resulted in absolutely no funding for religious entities. <em>See supra </em>pp. 661-62. This moving target is irrelevant to the Establishment Clause inquiry. <em>See supra </em>pp. 663-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The layer upon layer of private choice built into this program ensures that \u201cthe circuit between government and religion [is] broken.\u201d <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 652, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Try as it may, the panel cannot complete such circuit. Ultimately, nothing in the panel opinion grapples with the fact that Arizona does nothing to encourage, to promote, or otherwise to incentivize private actors to direct aid to religious schools. Nothing explains how \u201cthe <em>government itself </em>has advanced religion through its own activities and influence.\u201d <em>Amos, </em>483 U.S. at 337, 107 S.Ct. 2862. Nothing points to any \u201cevidence that the <em>State </em>deliberately skewed incentives toward religious schools.\u201d <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 650, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (emphasis added). Nothing shows how Section 1089 enables Arizona to \u201cgrant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652-53, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">But the three-judge panel can hardly be faulted for these omissions: it cannot manufacture what does not exist.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> What does exist is a tax credit system that relies entirely on private choice. Individuals choose to create an STO. STOs choose to limit their funds to certain schools. Taxpayers choose to donate. Parents choose to apply for scholarships. In truth, <em>everyone </em>in Arizona has a choice \u2014 everyone ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>cept the government. No <em>reasonable </em>observer would think this lengthy chain of choice suggests the government has endorsed religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Because the three-judge panel\u2019s decision strays from established Supreme Court precedent, and because it jeopardizes the educational opportunities of thousands of children who enjoy the benefits of Section 1089 and related programs across the nation, I must respectfully dissent from our court\u2019s regrettable failure to rehear this case en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\">. <em>See </em>Fla.

The distinction the panel tries to draw between a tax credit and a deduction, <em>see </em>562 F.3d at 1014-15, can have no constitutional significance. Both result in a reduction of the money paid by the taxpayer to the government, with the amount of the reduction going to the designated STO. The only practical difference is that with a deduction the taxpayer must make a co-payment of his own, whereas with a credit there is no copayment. Of course, this favors richer taxpayers over poorer ones, as the former are more able to afford a personal contribution. Moreover, in a progressive tax system, deductions most favor the taxpayers with the greatest income. Not only does the value of the deduction increase with the taxpayer's marginal rate, but so does the amount of government revenue that is diverted at the taxpayer\u2019s behest. It is difficult to see why such a regressive regime (deductions) is constitutionally superi- or to the egalitarian tax credit. <em>Cf. Lochner v. New York, </em>198 U.S. 45, 75, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905) (Holmes, L, dissenting) (The Constitution \"does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's social statics.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\">.

Like virtually every other tax credit system, <em>see supra </em>note 1, the Arizona statute requires STOs to provide scholarships \"without limiting availability to only students of one school.\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 43-1089(G)(3). And again, like most other schemes, <em>see supra </em>note 1, the statute says STOs should allow children \"to attend any qualified school of their parents' choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While hardly the model of clarity, this language has been interpreted to mean STOs satisfy the statute by providing scholarships to at least two schools.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b706-13\">. Twenty-five of the fifty-five existing STOs limit scholarship awards to religious schools.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\">. Make no mistake about the procedural posture of this decision. True, the case will be remanded to the district court. But the panel holds that, \"if plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are accepted as true, Section 1089 violates the Establishment Clause.\u201d <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1013. So far as I can tell, no one disputes plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations about how the program operates in practice. Thus, the panel leaves the district court with no choice but to declare the program unconstitutional as applied, rendering the remand little more than an empty formality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\">. As the panel focused primarily on \"effects,\u201d rather than \"purpose,\u201d I address these two <em>Lemon </em>prongs out of order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b707-16\">. For example, the panel asserts that Arizona parents are presented with a choice that \"deliberately skew[s] incentives toward religious schools.\u201d <em>See Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1013 (quoting <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 650, 122 S.Ct. 2460). The actual quotation from <em>Zelman, </em>however, includes a key qualifier: it condemns only programs where \u201cthe <em>State </em>deliberately skewed incentives toward religious schools.\u201d 536 U.S. at 650, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (emphasis added). Since only state action can violate the Establishment Clause, the panel\u2019s omission is telling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\">. The panel makes much of the fact that <em>Zelman </em>discussed aid flowing \"directly\u201d to parents. I submit that the Supreme Court used such terminology for two reasons. First, that was the case before the Court: it had no reason to pontificate on systems involving additional levels of private choice. Second, the language emphasized that the voucher program did not involve constitutionally problematic \"direct\u201d aid to religious institutions. The panel turns this language into a rallying cry to suggest that by filtering aid through multiple levels of private choice \u2014 rather than a single level \u2014 the state endorses religion. But that makes no sense. How can <em>increasing </em>the separation between state and religion result in heightened government endorsement?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\">. Earlier, I listed several state programs jeopardized by the panel's holding. <em>See supra </em>note 1. Under the panel\u2019s reasoning, those schemes could be constitutional if taxpayers decided to provide more funds to secular, rather than religious STOs. An identical pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>gram might then be constitutional in one state and unconstitutional in another.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\">. The \"at a particular time\u201d reference is especially significant. As discussed above, nothing in Section 1089 precludes any Arizona taxpayer, tomorrow, from suddenly deciding to fund exclusively secular STOs. <em>See supra </em>pp. 652-53. The Supreme Court has twice declined to strike down laws on the basis of such moving targets. <em>See Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 657-58, 122 S.Ct. 2460; <em>Mueller v. Allen, </em>463 U.S. 388, 401, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\">. The Court went on to explain that it is \"irrelevant ... to the constitutionality\u201d of a government aid program that \"a vast majority of program benefits went to religious schools.\u201d <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 658, 122 S.Ct. 2460. The panel distinguishes this point, claiming that the <em>Zelman </em>did not involve a situation where parental choice was \"constrained.\u201d <em>Winn, </em>562 F.3d at 1017 n. 14. As demonstrated below, that is simply not the case. <em>See infra </em>pp. 663-65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\">. The <em>Zelman </em>Court's comment that the \"preponderance of religiously affiliated private schools certainly did not arise as a result of the [voucher] program\" is also instructive. 536 U.S. at 656-57, 122 S.Ct. 2460. The Court stated that the imbalance was \"a phenomenon common to many American cities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657, 122 S.Ct. 2460. In other words, the disparity was caused not by government action, but rather by private predilections. The same can be said about the existence of religiously affiliated STOs and the disproportionate share of taxpayer contributions they receive. The concentration of funds in religious entities \u2014 and the resulting \"constraint\u201d on parental choice \u2014 \"certainly did not arise as a result of\u201d any state action, but rather as a consequence of private decisions. <em>See supra </em>pp. 661-62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b711-13\">. For this reason, the <em>Winn </em>panel's reliance on <em>Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, </em>413 U.S. 756, 93 S.Ct. 2993, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973), is misplaced. <em>See Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 661-62, 122 S.Ct. 2460.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b711-14\">. Interestingly, the Supreme Court decided to italicize <em>\u201call </em>options\u201d in <em>Zelman, </em>and <em>\u201cgovernment itself\u201d </em>in <em>Amos. </em>Maybe the justices thought these requirements were important. <em>Zelman, </em>536 U.S. at 655-56, 122 S.Ct. 2460; <em>Amos, </em>483 U.S. at 337, 107 S.Ct. 2862.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b712-5\">.
