Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that it may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The named defendant, James J. Quinn III,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from the trial court\u2019s decision vacating an arbitration panel\u2019s award in his favor and denying his application to confirm it. The defendant claims that the court improperly found that he is not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits because he is not a covered person as defined in the policy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was not operating a vehicle covered by the policy at the time he was involved in a two car collision. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The following facts are undisputed. On February 12, 1984, while driving a car he owned, the defendant was injured in a collision in New Haven. The defendant recovered $20,000 from the tortfeasor, the full amount of liability insurance available. The defendant\u2019s car was insured for $100,000 bodily injury liability and $20,000 uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">At the time of the collision, the defendant lived with his father, whom the plaintiff insured under two automobile liability policies covering five vehicles. Each of these vehicles was insured for $20,000 in uninsured motorist coverage. The defendant sought to aggregate these amounts and to collect $100,000 from the plaintiff. When the plaintiff denied coverage and refused to arbitrate the dispute, the defendant sought an order compelling arbitration. The trial court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>issued such an order, which this court subsequently upheld. See <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>16 Conn. App. 209, 547 A.2d 95, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 817, 550 A.2d 1085 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">On February 1,1991, the arbitration panel, in a two to one decision, awarded the defendant $83,333, with the plaintiff receiving $16,666.67 credit for the amount the tortfeasor had paid. The majority found that the policy\u2019s definition with respect to resident relatives is invalid and that the defendant is therefore a covered person under the plan. The dissent determined that the defendant is not a covered person and that our law does not require that he be covered under the circumstances of this case. On February 19, 1991, the plaintiff moved to vacate the arbitration award. The defendant subsequently moved to confirm it. On June 7, 1991, the trial court vacated the award and denied the motion to confirm. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We begin first by setting forth our standard of review and the principles we must apply in our analysis of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>matter. When an arbitration panel\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is at issue, an appellate court must conduct a de novo review. <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>219 Conn. 371, 375, 593 A.2d 498 (1991); <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 655 n.11, 591 A.2d 101 (1991). If the terms of the insurance policy at issue are ambiguous, any \u201c \u2018limitation of liability on uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage must be construed most strongly against the insurer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, quoting <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 196, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). Because the policy language at issue here is plain on its face and not ambiguous, we next consider whether it nevertheless violates Connecticut law and public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The defendant argues, in essence, that the plaintiff\u2019s policy definition constitutes impermissible exclusionary language under our insurance statutes and regulations. He relies heavily on our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 449 A.2d 157 (1982), and contends that the language at issue violates the strong public policy favoring compensation for victims of uninsured motorists that has been the hallmark of our legislative and regulatory history for twenty-five years. See <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">As a backdrop to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims, we briefly review the public policy behind uninsured motorist coverage. In <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, our Supreme Court stated that this policy is embodied in General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> now reorganized and recod-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ified as General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (b) and (d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cwhich requires every automobile liability insurance policy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>include such coverage \u2018for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages . . . .\u2019 \u201d The accompanying regulation, \u00a7 38-175a-6 (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, accordingly provides that the \u201c \u2018insurer shall undertake to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall be legally entitled to recover ....\u2019\u201d <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>221 Conn. 206, 211, 603 A.2d 385 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The court in <em>Streitweiser </em>further stated that \u201c[t]his regulatory pattern establishes the public policy that \u2018every insured is entitled to recover for the damages he or she would have been able to recover if the uninsured motorist had maintained a policy of liability insurance. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 377, quoting <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 249. To implement this policy, our Supreme Court has repeatedly held that \u201c \u2018an insurer may not, by contract, reduce its liability for such uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage except as \u00a7 38-175a-6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies <em>expressly </em>authorizes.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, quoting <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ferrante, </em>201 Conn. 478, 483, 518 A.2d 373 (1986). In this case, we note that the regulation does not expressly permit an insurer to exclude from coverage residents of an insured\u2019s household who own cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Although this history would seem to support the defendant\u2019s claims, such is not the case. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>214 Conn. 734, 573 A.2d 740 (1990), our Supreme Court upheld the validity of policy language similar to that before us in this case. The plaintiff in <em>Smith, </em>a passenger, was injured in an automobile collision. She argued that she was entitled to underinsurance benefits under the policy of the driver\u2019s father because the driver was a covered person under that policy. The father\u2019s \u201cpolicy explicitly excluded from coverage \u2018any vehicle other than your covered auto which is owned by a family member.\u2019 Thus, it did not provide liability coverage to [the son] while he was driving his own vehicle, a vehicle not covered by the policy.\u201d Id., 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Relying on <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, the plaintiff in <em>Smith </em>further argued that the policy language should be eliminated in the context of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. <em>Harvey, </em>she claimed, holds that \u201cuninsured motorist coverage attaches to the insured person and therefore \u2018an insured party may receive the benefits of a policy even though not occupying a vehicle insured under the policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra. The court rejected these claims, finding that prohibition of such language would not advance the public policy embodied in General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c and \u00a7 38-175a-6 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. The court declared that <em>Harvey </em>holds \u201cthat the public policy embodied in \u00a7 38-175c directs that <em>uninsured motorist coverage </em>is \u2018person oriented\u2019 and therefore must be provided to insureds while they are occupants of insured vehicles or uninsured vehicles. . . . \u2018The coverage attaches to the insured person, not the insured vehicle.\u2019 ... In <em>Harvey </em>we ruled that the plaintiff, <em>an insured under his mother\u2019s policy, </em>was entitled to coverage under <em>that policy, </em>even though he was injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>while occupying a vehicle owned by his father which was not insured.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) Id., 738-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The distinguishing factor, therefore, between <em>Harvey, </em>where coverage was allowed, and <em>Smith, </em>where coverage was denied, is that in the former case the plaintiff was insured under the policy at issue, whereas in the latter case the plaintiff was not. Id., 739. Applying the teaching of these cases, we conclude that the defendant is not covered because he is not an <em>insured person </em>under the definitional language at issue, which violates neither law nor public policy. See also <em>Carley </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>10 Conn. App. 135, 142-43, 521 A.2d 1053 (1987) (language in father\u2019s policy defining \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile precludes coverage for relatives living in father\u2019s household).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The result we reach in this case is in accordance with the public policy embodied in General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c, which directs that uninsured motorist coverage applies \u201cto <em>insureds </em>while they are occupants of insured vehicles or uninsured vehicles. . . . \u2018The coverage attaches to the <em>insured person . . . </em>.\u2019\u2019\u2019(Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra. It also accords with the language of \u00a7 38-175a-6 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which requires the insurer \u201c \u2018to pay on behalf of <em>the insured </em>all sums which <em>the insured </em>shall be legally entitled to recover . . . .\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>supra. The plaintiffs policy provides coverage when the claimant is (1) a family member (2) who is a household resident and (3) who does not own a car. At the time of the collision, the defendant was a family member and a household resident, but, because he owned a car, coverage did not extend to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The defendant also claims that the policy\u2019s definitional language is, in reality, an exclusion because it both \u201cprovides coverage for Quinn and takes it away in the same sentence.\u201d In his brief, the defendant suggests that such language could have been placed in that portion of the policy called \u201cThose Not Protected,\u201d where it also would be subject to invalidation. We decline to read into the policy any such devious maneuverings on the part of the plaintiff and find that the language at issue is not exclusionary but definitional.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>214 Conn. 573, 573 A.2d 699 (1990), our Supreme Court discussed when an \u201cexclusion\u201d arises in an insurance policy. \u201c \u2018In an insurance policy, an exclusion is a provision which eliminates coverage where, were it not for the exclusion, coverage would have existed.\u2019 \u201d Id., 588. Thus, \u201c \u2018before the need for an exclusion arises, there must first be coverage within the defined scope of the policy.\u2019 \u201d Id., 589. It is clear, then, that before policy language can be said to be exclusionary, it must first provide coverage. In this case, because the defendant is not a covered person under the policy, the language at issue is not exclusionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that the plaintiff\u2019s policy language represents a subtle attempt to prevent him from stacking insurance coverage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Although the defendant correctly points out that our Supreme Court has rejected attempts to limit stacking in personal automobile liability policies; see, e.g., <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ferrante, </em>supra; <em>Nicolletta </em>v. <em>Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>211 Conn. 640, 645-46, 560 A.2d 964 (1989); this argument assumes its conclusion because it presupposes that the defendant is entitled to stack coverage. \u201cIt is self-evident that, in all cases of \u2018stacking,\u2019 the injured person can only have been the occupant of one of the multiply-insured vehicles.\u201d <em>All</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>state Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ferrante, </em>supra, 486. Because our insurance statutes are \u201c \u2018person oriented\u2019 rather than \u2018vehicle oriented,\u2019 [our Supreme Court has] emphasized that insurance coverage \u2018attaches to <em>the insured person, </em>not the insured vehicle.\u2019 . . . From that perspective, the crucial question is whether an injured person has coverage under the terms of the policy . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id. As stated above, that question, in this case, must be answered in the negative. Because the defendant is not a covered person, he is therefore not entitled to stack coverage under the plaintiff\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Finally, we note that our Supreme Court has recently barred attempts to aggregate coverage, particularly when, as here, the results would be unexpected and bizarre. See, e.g, <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 671 (premium of $262 would purchase $40,500,000 of coverage); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 536, 569 A.2d 40, cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 52, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990) (premium of $137 would purchase $38,440,000 of coverage); <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 525, 531, 569 A.2d 541 (1990) (premium of $73 would purchase $19,360,000 of coverage); see also <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Ins. Co of North America, </em>25 Conn. App. 673, 676, 596 A.2d 18 (1991) (premium of $58 would purchase $2,000,000 of coverage). Permitting the defendant to stack coverage on the plaintiffs policy would lead to the absurd result that any number of the insured\u2019s relatives residing in the household could stack coverage on one or all of each other\u2019s policies, regardless of whether they are insured persons under those policies. Such a practice would lead to results far beyond the reasonable expectations of both insurer and insured. <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 670; <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>supra, 530. We decline to venture down any such \u201cjudicial primrose path\u201d; <em>Carley </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>Casualty Co., </em>supra, 143; that could potentially wreak the financial havoc with our system of insurance that now faces our national banking system in the aftermath of the savings and loan debacle. Because our Supreme Court has repeatedly and unequivocally rejected such unwarranted expansions of stacking, we decline to diverge from its path.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In this opinion Heiman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-10\"> The plaintiff\u2019s application named both James J.

My reasons for dissenting are two-fold. First, I believe that \u00a7 38-175a-6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies precludes the plaintiff insurance carrier from excluding from coverage residents of a policyholder\u2019s household who own their own cars, and, second, I respectfully contend that the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>214 Conn. 734, 573 A.2d 740 (1990), is misplaced. I agree with the majority to the extent that it recognizes that an insurer may not, by contract, reduce its liability for such uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage except as \u00a7 38-175a-6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies <em>expressly </em>authorizes. See <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ferrante, </em>201 Conn. 478, 483, 518 A.2d 373 (1986). It is at this point, however, that I part company with my brethren.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Section 38-175a-6 expressly authorizes an insurer to limit its liability to the extent that damages have been paid (1) by or on behalf of any person responsible for the injury, (2) have been paid or are payable under any workers\u2019 compensation or disability benefits law, (3) have been paid under the policy in settlement of a liability claim, or (4) have been paid or are payable under any provisions of the policy for direct indemnity for medical expenses or basic reparations benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>lation nowhere authorizes an insurer to exclude from coverage individuals residing in the home of the policy holder who own their own automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The majority inappropriately relies on <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, in upholding the policy language and thereby reaching the conclusion that the defendant is not an insured under the policy. The policy in <em>Smith </em>provided that \u201c[w]e will pay damages for bodily injury or property damage for which any covered person becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident.\u201d Id., 736. \u201cCovered person\u201d was defined as \u201cyou or any family member for the ownership, maintenance, or use of any auto or trailer.\u201d Id. The policy, however, explicitly excluded from coverage \u201cany <em>vehicle </em>other than your covered auto which is owned by any family member.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 737. Because the exclusion in <em>Smith </em>addressed a class of automobiles rather than a class of individuals, the exclusion did not violate the public policy underlying the \u201cperson oriented\u201d nature of uninsured motorist insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In the policy at issue here, a covered person is defined as, inter alia, \u201ca member of the family who is a resident of the household and who doesn\u2019t own a car or whose spouse doesn\u2019t own a car.\u201d The definition excludes the defendant, who is a family member and resident of the policyholder\u2019s household, on the sole basis of his status as a vehicle owner. Unlike the exclusion in <em>Smith, </em>the limitation here addresses a class of individuals and therefore undermines the public policy considerations in General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c and \u00a7 38-175a-6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. Thus, because of the \u201cperson oriented\u201d nature of uninsured motorist insurance, which the majority acknowledges, an exclusion premised on whether an individual, who otherwise would be covered, owned a vehicle, cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>A similar issue was addressed by our Supreme Court in <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co, </em>219 Conn. 371, 593 A.2d 498 (1991). In <em>Streitweiser, </em>the issue was whether our state legislative policy mandating insurance protection for someone injured by an identified uninsured motorist extends to someone injured as a result of an unidentified motorist who has no physical contact with the injured claimant. The policy limited coverage to \u201c \u2018a hit and run vehicle whose operator or owner cannot be identified and which hits\u2019 a covered person or auto.\u201d Id., 376. The plaintiff argued that because public policy favors uninsured motorist coverage, and because \u00a7 38-175a-6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies did not expressly authorize an insurer to reduce its liability in such a manner, the defendant was precluded from contractually excluding from uninsured motorist coverage the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover for injuries sustained where there was no physical contact. The court acknowledged that because the regulations contained no express authorization to reduce the uninsured motorist coverage, the question should be resolved in favor of insurance coverage, but felt constrained by two earlier cases where coverage had been denied. See <em>Weingarten </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>169 Conn. 502, 507, 363 A.2d 1055 (1975), and <em>Rosnick </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>172 Conn. 416, 423, 374 A.2d 1076 (1977). In light of this dilemma, the court chose to reconsider <em>Weingarten </em>and <em>Rosnick, </em>and, in so doing, overruled both cases. Accordingly, I would hold that the defendant is an individual covered under the policy, despite the definitional language to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">I would therefore reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-9\"> Regs., Conn.
