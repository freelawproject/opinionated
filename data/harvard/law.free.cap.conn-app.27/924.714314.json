On appeal, the plaintiff also challenges the trial court\u2019s postjudgment denial of his motion to restore the case to the docket, which motion was filed within the appeal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">We note that at the time of the dismissal the pleadings were not yet closed in this case. It was not a case \u201cappearing on an assignment list for final adjudication,\u201d and, therefore, it should not have been dismissed without a hearing on the matter, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 251. Since a review of the record indicates that no hearing was held prior to dismissal of the case, the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to restore the case to the docket.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
