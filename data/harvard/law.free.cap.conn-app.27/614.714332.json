The defendant suspended the plaintiffs\u2019 liquor license for five days and offered to accept a fine to be determined in amount in lieu of the suspension. General Statutes \u00a7 30-58a.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court which affirmed the defendant\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal. The plaintiffs now appeal to this court from the Superior Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly dismissed their appeal because (1) the defendant acted arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion as a matter of law, (2) the defendant was overreaching in the use of its police power, and (3) the plaintiffs\u2019 right to due process was violated. We reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The facts necessary to decide this appeal are as follows. The plaintiffs own and operate the M. V. Anna C (ship) which they operate primarily as the Block Island ferry. Occasionally, the plaintiffs charter the ship for private parties. On August 12,1989, the plaintiffs chartered the ship to the Savage Brothers rock band for a private cruise. Although the plaintiffs had a boat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>liquor permit,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the charter agreement did not call for them to sell any liquor or provide any employees to serve, deliver, give or in any other manner encourage or assist in the consumption of alcohol during the cruise. The ship\u2019s liquor inventory was securely locked away from possible access.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">By the terms of the charter contract, the plaintiffs leased the vessel to the band for its exclusive use between 8 p.m. and 12:01 a.m. Under the charter agreement, the band had the obligation to maintain order on board the ship and to provide security. The activities of the passengers were under the direct control of the band and not of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs\u2019 responsibilities under the charter contract were restricted to navigation of the ship. The band did not sell, furnish or deliver any liquor during the cruise. It is, therefore, not disputed that any liquor consumed on the ship was brought aboard by the passengers. The event was what is colloquially referred to as a B.Y.O.B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> affair. Most of the passengers were brought to the ship in chartered buses that returned them to Windsor Locks at the conclusion of the cruise. The price of the ticket included round trip transportation from Windsor Locks to New London plus the cruise and dance. Windsor Locks was apparently the assembly point for transportation to this charter cruise and dance.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">About an hour after the ship sailed from New London, a disturbance broke out on board, involving a f\u00edstf\u00edght and rowdy, assaultive conduct by some of the passengers. Many of the passengers appeared to be intox<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>icated. Of the estimated 1000 to 1500 passengers,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> witnesses estimated that between fifteen and forty people were involved in a fracas that lasted less than five minutes. The disturbance ended when the band\u2019s security personnel locked the two most disruptive individuals in the men\u2019s room.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The captain returned the ship to the New London pier. Upon docking, the two troublemakers were turned over to the police and paramedics were called to assist an unconscious female passenger. The record does not support the finding that this woman was intoxicated. The remaining passengers were in varying stages of sobriety. After placing the two men in the custody of the police and the unconscious passenger in the care of the paramedics,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the ship set sail once again and completed the cruise uneventfully.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Following a hearing, the plaintiffs\u2019 boat permit was suspended for five days on the ground that the plaintiffs permitted a disturbance on permit premises <em>or </em>that an intoxicated person was permitted to loiter thereon, in violation of regulations promulgated by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second claim is dispositive of this appeal. The issue is whether the department of liquor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>control has jurisdiction over a premises when no liquor is available for sale thereon, despite the fact that the owner of the property holds a liquor permit and on other occasions and under other conditions sells liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">We address the question of whether the defendant is the proper authority to police a threat caused by the consumption of alcohol when it occurs aboard a ship. The plaintiffs argue that it was not within the defendant\u2019s jurisdiction to police a private party on permit premises when there was no sale or delivery of alcoholic beverage thereon by the permittee or by its agent. The defendant derives its power from General Statutes \u00a7 30-6,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which gives it general authority to oversee a permittee\u2019s conduct of its liquor business. In the present case, however, the plaintiffs had locked away their liquor and were not, by any reasonable stretch of the imagination, involved in the liquor business during this cruise. They were simply sailing or operating a ship. The disturbance that occurred here was in no way related to the plaintiffs\u2019 exercise of their privilege to dispense liquor. Even if the plaintiffs did not hold a boat permit, but instead merely operated a charter service, the identical disturbance would have occurred. Under those circumstances, the defendant clearly would not have had jurisdiction to intervene to protect the public safety. Accordingly, the mere fact that the plaintiffs had a permit, pursuant to which they sold liquor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>on other occasions, did not extend the defendant\u2019s jurisdiction to this nonliquor charter. The defendant does not have jurisdiction over every social occasion where liquor is consumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The fallacy in the defendant\u2019s \u201cguardian of the public safety\u201d argument is that the defendant does not claim to have jurisdiction over the many ships without liquor licenses plying Long Island Sound on which identical B.Y.O.B. parties may be taking place. The passengers on such nonlicensed ships are in no greater jeopardy due to the lack of the defendant\u2019s protection. Local and state police, together with the United States Coast Guard,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> provide sufficient protection for the public concerning B.Y.O.B. drinking on nonlicensed ships. As evidenced by the events that occurred in this case, the police, when summoned by the captain of the ship, were on the shore awaiting the ship\u2019s arrival. Any jurisdiction of the defendant would have been superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Underlying the defendant\u2019s argument is its apparent belief that once a permit has been issued, the premises are subject to its jurisdiction twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and that there is no way in which the premises can, even temporarily, be freed from this control. The defendant argues that, \u201ca premises can never be shorn of the jurisdiction of the [department of liquor control] as long as a permit has been issued.\u201d The defendant fails to furnish a legal authority for this sweeping statement, nor could we locate any. The defendant\u2019s contention is true only insofar as it means that in the operation of his liquor business, a permittee cannot excuse himself from liability on the ground that a violation was in fact committed by an agent or employee and not by the permittee personally. We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s unsupported theory that there cannot be circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>stances under which premises, otherwise used for the sale of liquor, may not be temporarily removed from the defendant\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">\u201cAdministrative agencies are tribunals of limited jurisdiction and their jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the validity of the statutes vesting them with power and they cannot confer jurisdiction upon themselves.\u201d <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 428, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988). \u201cAn administrative agency can act only within the bounds of authority granted to it by its enabling statute and within constitutional limitations. It is wholly without power to modify, dilute or change in any way the statutory provisions from which it derives its authority . . . .\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Insurance Department, </em>9 Conn. App. 622, 626, 520 A.2d 1038 (1987). When an administrative agency takes action that exceeds its statutory authority, that action is void. <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>2 Conn. App. 628, 634, 481 A.2d 755 (1984). The suspension of the plaintiffs\u2019 boat permit was unrelated to the defendant\u2019s responsibility to control the sale of liquor on the ship. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Connecticut Liquor Control Commission, </em>36 Conn. Sup. 305, 314-15, 418 A.2d 955 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The two cases cited by the defendant do not support its position. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>124 Conn. 689, 199 A. 925 (1938), holds that a permittee is responsible for sales to minors even though the sales were not made by the permittee personally but by an employee. Further, <em>Koval </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>149 Conn. 63, 67, 175 A.2d 358 (1961), requires proof of agency by the person who delivers liquor to minors. There is no contention in the present case that the passengers who brought the liquor to this ship were employees or agents of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The defendant argues that if the plaintiffs prevail they could effectively evade the liquor control laws by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>obtaining an annual boat permit but use their boat solely for charter cruises. The fallacy in this argument is that if the plaintiffs did not intend to sell liquor at any time, there would be no purpose in their acquiring a boat permit in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We conclude that the defendant was overreaching when it applied its regulations to the plaintiffs\u2019 ship under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">In view of our disposition of the plaintiffs\u2019 second claim, we do not reach the plaintiffs\u2019 other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment sustaining the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-11\"> The plaintiffs are the Nelseco Navigation Company, a Connecticut corporation, and its president, John R. Wronowski.
