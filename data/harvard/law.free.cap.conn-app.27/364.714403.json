At issue are certain awards ordered by the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>court improperly (1) structured the marriage dissolution property award in order to provide for the support of a nonminor child, (2) held the plaintiff solely financially responsible for debts incurred for the benefit of both parties, (3) failed to define payments it had ordered the plaintiff to pay to the defendant as periodic alimony, (4) ordered the plaintiff to hold the defendant harmless on a mortgage taken out in both parties\u2019 names, and (5) failed to consider the tax consequences of its orders. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff and the defendant were married on November 2, 1968, in Waterbury. At the time of trial, the parties had two minor children, ages eight and seventeen, and a third, nonminor child suffering from diabetes who resided with the defendant. The trial court awarded joint legal custody of the two minor children, with residence of the seventeen year old to be with the plaintiff and residence of the eight year old to be with the defendant. In addition, the court ordered the plaintiff (1) to pay $50 per week child support for the youngest child, (2) to pay the personal property taxes due to the town of Wolcott, (3) to hold the defendant harmless on two of three outstanding mortgages, and (4) to pay $50 per week alimony to the defendant. The court also rendered orders concerning health insurance for the minor children and division of the family\u2019s two automobiles. These orders are not contested. Other relevant facts are detailed in the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The plaintiff filed a motion for articulation requesting the trial court to clarify, inter alia, (1) whether the court intended to benefit the nonminor child of the parties, and (2) whether an order requiring the plaintiff to pay certain joint debts constituted a property award or periodic alimony. The trial court's articulation stated that it found the defendant to be a credible witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>but the plaintiff was not totally credible based on his understated income and implausible explanations of certain items. The court also found that the plaintiff was the cause of the marital breakdown, as well as the cause of the family\u2019s financial problems. Finally, the court concluded that because the plaintiff\u2019s earning capacity and health were superior to the defendant\u2019s, \u201c[t]he provisions made by the court for the defendant\u2019s future are necessary for her to continue in a lifestyle approximately similar to the way the parties had lived in the past.\u201d A motion for further articulation was denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The plaintiff first contends that the trial court improperly fashioned the property awards in order to provide for the nonminor, diabetic child who resided with the defendant. The plaintiff attempts to support this contention by citing the following statement made by the court at trial: \u201cI have to figure out a way to keep this household intact. Because obviously . . . although he is eighteen years old, he\u2019s apparently a seriously ill offspring. ... I don\u2019t know what happens to him if the mother says, \u2018Good-bye, I\u2019m going into an apartment.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Although the plaintiff is correct that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84 does not authorize consideration of a non-minor child\u2019s maintenance, in the present case, he cannot demonstrate that the court\u2019s order provided for the adult child\u2019s maintenance. Nowhere in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, articulation, or judgment is there any mention of the diabetic adult child. In <em>Misinonile </em>v. <em>Misinonile, </em>190 Conn. 132, 459 A.2d 518 (1983), the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly rendered a support order in the guise of alimony. The defendant contended that a reference in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision to the \u201ccare of her retarded child\u201d demonstrated that the award of alimony was, in actuality, an improper order for the sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>port of an adult child and was therefore void because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to render such an award. The <em>Misinonile </em>court held that it had jurisdiction, but did not reach the question of whether there was an erroneous exercise of that jurisdiction. The court noted that, \u201c[t]he difficulty with the defendant\u2019s position is that it seeks to use the memorandum for the purpose of contradicting the express terms of the judgment and this he cannot do.\u201d Id., 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The facts in this case are stronger than in <em>Misinonile. </em>In that case, the memorandum of decision at least made reference to the proscribed category of support order. Here, the only mention of it was a comment by the trial judge at trial expressing his concern about the future of the household. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the court improperly considered the maintenance of a non-minor child in structuring its property award is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s second, third and fourth claims also must fail. The plaintiff\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly ordered the plaintiff to be financially responsible for debts incurred for the benefit of both parties. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> vests the Superior Court with broad discretion in assigning all or any part of the estate of the other to either the husband or wife. Moreover, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> allows the court to consider the causes of the dissolution of the marriage in valuing the property, as was done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s third claim, that the trial court should have defined the payments it ordered the plaintiff to make as periodic alimony, also fails to recognize that the trial court has broad discretion in rendering its dissolution awards. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 provides in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>pertinent part: \u201cAt the time of entering the decree, the superior court may order either of the parties to pay alimony to the other, <em>in addition to </em>or in lieu of an award pursuant to section 46b-81.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, because determination of what type of payments the court ordered the plaintiff to pay to the defendant rested within the discretion of the trial court, the plaintiffs claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The plaintiffs fourth contention, that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering the plaintiff to hold the defendant harmless on a mortgage, is similarly without merit. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81, a trial court may order one party to assume the joint liabilities of the parties. <em>Beede </em>v. <em>Beede, </em>186 Conn. 191, 195, 440 A.2d 283 (1982). Here, the trial court properly considered the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in the value of each party\u2019s estates, the cause of the marital breakdown and the age, health, employability and needs of each party in making its award. See <em>Cabrera </em>v. <em>Cabrera, </em>23 Conn. App. 330, 348-49, 580 A.2d 1227, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 828, 582 A.2d 205 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In his remaining claim, the plaintiff asks this court to reconsider its position in <em>Seaver </em>v. <em>Seaver, </em>10 Conn. App. 134, 521 A.2d 1053 (1987), where we held that \u201c[tjhere is no requirement in the applicable statutes which makes it mandatory that a trial court consider the federal tax implications of its financial orders.\u201d Id. Because our position is clear; see id.; we decline to reverse our decision in <em>Seaver. </em>Furthermore, because the plaintiff failed to raise the issue of tax consequences at the trial level or to put on any evidence as to the tax consequences of the property awards, such a claim may not now be raised at the appellate level. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 4185; <em>Ralto Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Environmental Impact Commission, </em>220 Conn. 54, 58-59, 594 A.2d 981 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (a) provides: \u201cAt the time of entering a decree annulling or dissolving a marriage or for legal separation pursuant to a complaint under section 46b-45, the superior court may assign to either the husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other.
