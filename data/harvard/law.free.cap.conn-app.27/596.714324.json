J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acbp\">The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of one count of conspiracy to sell cocaine and to possess cocaine with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 21a-278 (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole issue we must resolve is whether General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41p (b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 54-41b<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allow the use of lawfully obtained wiretap evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>a prosecution for a violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b). The trial court denied the defendant's motion to suppress such evidence pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-41b provides that an application may be made to a panel of judges to obtain authorization for the interception of a wire communication when \u201csuch interception may provide evidence of the commission of offenses involving . . . violations of section 21a-277 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The resolution of the issue before us depends, therefore, on whether a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-278 (b) is an offense \u201cinvolving\u201d the violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>conclude that the lawfully obtained wiretap evidence<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in this case was properly admitted into evidence against the defendant in a prosecution under \u00a7 21a-278 (b), and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Cases have strictly construed our wiretap statutes because to do otherwise would countenance an intrusion into an individual\u2019s privacy and is \u201cinherently greater than a typical particularized search of one\u2019s home or person which consists of essentially one overt intrusion. A wiretap necessarily is a continuing covert intrusion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>194 Conn. 447, 458, 481 A.2d 730 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Formica, </em>3 Conn. App. 477, 481, 489 A.2d 1060, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 806, 494 A.2d 903 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Yet, \u201c[a] statute, even one which has been held to be subject to strict construction . . . must be read with common sense, so as to accomplish a reasonable result and not to thwart its purpose. ... It cannot be denied that one of the principal purposes of our statutory scheme is to permit wiretaps where there is probable cause to believe that an individual is illegally selling a drug such as cocaine.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralston, </em>7 Conn. App. 660, 682, 510 A.2d 1346 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">There is a close relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 21a-277 and 21a-278 (b). They differ, on the facts of this case, only in the status of the offender and in the punishment for the offense. Section 21a-278 (b) applies to persons who are not drug-dependent whereas \u00a7 21a-277 applies to persons who are. The absence of drug dependency, however, is not an element of an offense committed in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b). <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>221 Conn. 595, 608, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992). When the drug involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>is cocaine, the two statutes contain the same elements. The punishment for a violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b), however, depends on whether an offender can sustain a burden of proving her or his drug dependency by a fair preponderance of the evidence in order to obtain an exemption from liability as provided in \u00a7 2la-269. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Because both crimes, on the facts of this case, contain the same elements that must be proved by the state beyond a reasonable doubt, it is reasonable to conclude that the crimes should be treated similarly in the context of the wiretap act. It is not reasonable to require a suppression of evidence in the prosecution of persons who are not drug-dependent, the more serious crime in terms of punishment, and to allow the very same evidence to be used in the prosecution of drug dependent persons. Such a result would not provide any greater privacy protection to individuals since lawfully seized wiretap evidence of illegal drug activity can always be used to support a conviction under \u00a7 21a-277.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The gravamen of the defendant\u2019s claim that the wiretap evidence must be suppressed centers about the interpretation of the word \u201cinvolving\u201d as used in \u00a7 54-41b. To involve means to \u201cinclude\u201d or to \u201ccontain.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary (1981). Since a violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b) predicated on a sale of cocaine or possession of cocaine with intent to sell contains the same elements as does a violation of \u00a7 21a-277 when predicated on the sale of cocaine or possession of cocaine with intent to sell, a violation of one necessarily \u201cincludes\u201d or \u201ccontains\u201d a violation of the other.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 54-41p (b) and 54-41b, therefore, makes clear that the use of wiretap evidence is not limited to drug prosecutions under \u00a7 21a-277.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">It would undermine the plain language of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41b and 54-41p (b), as well as their purpose, namely, to afford the police a means to investigate narcotic offenses, to hold that evidence obtained through a lawful wiretap is inadmissible in a narcotics prosecution under \u00a7 21a-278 (b). We conclude that \u00a7 21a-278 (b) is a crime involving a violation of \u00a7 21a-277 for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 54-41b and 54-41p (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marihuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years.

To the extent that the holding remains intact, the latter must be a crime \u201cinvolving\u201d the lesser included crime of \u00a7 21a-277.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
