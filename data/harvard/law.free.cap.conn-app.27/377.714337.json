An administrative hearing was held to determine whether the plaintiff caused or contributed to a fatality, and, if so, whether his motor vehicle license should be suspended. A hearing officer found in the affirmative and suspended the plaintiff\u2019s license for three years. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the following evidentiary rulings of the hearing officer were proper and that the plaintiff was not substantially prejudiced by these rulings: (1) the admission of the police report that contained hearsay statements of witnesses without requiring the witnesses\u2019 presence at the hearing; (2) the admission of a copy of the police report rather than the original, where the author could not recall if any corrections had been made; and (3) the admission of only a portion of the officer\u2019s investigation file. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The following facts are undisputed. On August 9, 1988, at approximately 9:30 p.m., the plaintiff was driving southbound in the left lane on Interstate 95 near exit 14 in Norwalk. The left lane, however, was closed for road construction and the closure was indicated by both signs and cones placed in the lane. As the plaintiff was attempting to merge into the center lane, he noticed high beams being flashed from behind him. At the same time that the plaintiff was turning the wheel to merge into the center lane, he looked up to adjust his rearview mirror, taking his eyes off the road. When he returned his attention to the road, he saw the brake lights on in the car immediately in front of him in the center lane. The plaintiff immediately applied his brakes, but was unable to avoid a collision with that car, which was driven by Joseph Grumblatt. Also in the car were his wife Louise, and Stephen and Sylvia Luciano. The Grumblatt car was forced over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>guardrail, rolled down an embankment and came to rest on its roof. Louise Grumblatt was thrown from the car and died as a result of her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Trooper Joseph Kubish of the state police arrived at the scene shortly thereafter and examined the physical evidence, including the skid marks, the positions of the two cars and the damage the cars had sustained and interviewed Joseph Grumblatt, the plaintiff, and David Rubin, the driver of the car behind the plaintiff.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff was arrested six months later on February 7,1989, and charged with negligent homicide with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The plaintiff was present at the administrative hearing and was represented by counsel. Only two witnesses testified at the hearing, Kubish and Sal Rermo, a business associate of the plaintiff. The hearing officer made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201c1. On August 9,1988, at about 9:43 p.m. Robert C. O\u2019Sullivan was operating a 1984 Toyota C\u00e9lica on 1-95 westbound near the Richard Avenue overpass in Norwalk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u201c2. Mr. O\u2019Sullivan was operating in the far left lane of three travel lanes. Said lane was clearly marked as closed and traffic had been directed to merge right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u201c3. Mr. O\u2019Sullivan passed a vehicle being operated by David A. Rubin who was in the center lane. While operating at speed in excess of 55 miles per hour Mr. O\u2019Sullivan attempted to change lanes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\"><em>\u201c4. </em>By Mr. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s statement he admits that he took his eyes off the road to adjust a rearview mirror while in the process of the lane change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\u201c5. When Mr. O\u2019Sullivan looked down from his rear-view mirror he observed the red brake lights of a vehicle in front of him, but was unable to react.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">\u201c6. Mr. O\u2019Sullivan struck the rear of a 1981 Pontiac being operated by Joseph J. Grumblatt with sufficient force to spin the Grumblatt vehicle 180 degrees in a northerly direction, across the right lane, striking the guardrails off the right shoulder. The Grumblatt vehicle flipped over the guardrails and barrel rolled down the embankment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">\u201c7. At the time of the collision, Louise F. Grumblatt was a passenger in the vehicle being operated by Joseph L. Grumblatt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">\u201c8. As a result of injuries received in this collision Louise F. Grumblatt expired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">\u201c9. The closure of the extreme left lane was clearly posted and the slowing and merging traffic should have been evident to Mr. O\u2019Sullivan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">\u201c10. Mr. O\u2019Sullivan operated his vehicle with reckless disregard for others using the roadway, contrary to the provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">The hearing officer concluded that the plaintiff \u201ccaused or contributed [to] and is responsible for the death of Louise Grumblatt . . . .\u201d and suspended the plaintiff\u2019s license, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-111 (c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a period of three years to commence September 1,1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The plaintiff appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the Superior Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. On June 27,1991, the trial court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. The court found that the hearing officer properly admitted a copy of the police report although (1) it contained hearsay statements of witnesses to the accident without requiring their presence at the hearing, (2) it was not the original report, but rather a copy, and (3) it did not include the photographs the police had been requested to produce.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court concluded that the plaintiff received a fair and adequate hearing and that substantial evidence existed to support the hearing officer\u2019s findings, but remanded the case to the hearing officer for articulation of the plaintiff\u2019s request for suspension credit. \u201cIt is the trial court\u2019s decision that is appealed from, not that of the [hearing officer], and it is the trial court\u2019s decision that we review.\u201d <em>Gallacher </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>221 Conn. 166, 176, 602 A.2d 996 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The trial court found that the hearing officer properly admitted the police report and the hearsay statements of the two witnesses contained therein without requiring the witnesses\u2019 presence at the hearing. We agree with the trial court. Initially, it must be noted that \u201c \u2018[i]t is fundamental that administrative tribunals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>are not strictly bound by the rules of evidence and that they may consider exhibits which would normally be incompetent in a judicial proceeding, so long as the evidence is reliable and probative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>10 Conn. App. 90, 93, 521 A.2d 607, cert. denied, 203 Conn. 805, 525 A.2d 520 (1987), quoting <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, 710, 372 A.2d 110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977); see also <em>Casella </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>4 Conn. App. 359, 362, 494 A.2d 909 (1985), aff\u2019d, 202 Conn. 28, 519 A.2d 67 (1987). Evidence in written form is not, as a matter of law, inadmissible in an administrative hearing unless it substantially prejudices a party. <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>172 Conn. 263, 266, 374 A.2d 207 (1977). Moreover, hearsay evidence is not prohibited in administrative proceedings by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, which permits the introduction of oral or documentary evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Tomlin </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>177 Conn. 344, 348, 416 A.2d 1205 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that a hearing officer\u2019s evidentiary ruling is arbitrary, illegal or an abuse of discretion. <em>Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control Authority, </em>183 Conn. 128, 139, 439 A.2d 282 (1981). Where such a showing has been made the administrative order must be invalidated. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The plaintiff has wholly failed to make such a showing. He relies on our Supreme Court decision in <em>Carl</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>son </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, where the court addressed whether affidavits of witnesses to an accident were properly submitted at the administrative hearing despite the fact that the witnesses were not present. The only witness who testified at the hearing was the investigating police officer. The only evidence pointing to the plaintiffs culpability was contained in the affidavits of four witnesses to the accident who were not present at the hearing. The affidavits were admitted over the plaintiffs objection. In reviewing this claim, the Supreme Court relied on the fact that the evidence challenged by the plaintiff was the only evidence indicating the plaintiffs culpability. The court stated that \u201c[i]f hearsay evidence is sufficiently trustworthy to be considered \u2018 \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d \u2019 and it is the <em>only </em>evidence probative of the plaintiffs culpability, its use to support the agency decision would be prejudicial to the plaintiff, absent a showing, which has not been made here, that the appellant knew it would be used and failed to ask the commissioner to subpoena the witnesses.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">This case is more like <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, than <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra. In <em>Lawrence, </em>an administrative hearing was conducted to determine whether the plaintiff was responsible for an automobile accident. The plaintiff challenged the admission of various reports indicating he was responsible for the accident and that he had pled nolo contendere to a charge of negligent homicide. The court concluded that \u201c[e]ven if the challenged documents had been excluded the commissioner\u2019s conclusion was supported from other substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>714-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">As in <em>Lawrence </em>and unlike <em>Carlson, </em>the documents challenged here, were not the only evidence indicative of the plaintiff\u2019s culpability. Giving the plaintiff the benefit as to each of his evidentiary claims, there remained substantial evidence from which the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>officer could reasonably have concluded that the plaintiff \u201ccaused or contributed [to] and is responsible for the death of Louise Grumblatt.\u201d The plaintiffs admission of liability in his statement to Kubish, the physical evidence Kubish observed at the scene of the accident, including the skid marks, the position of the vehicles, the damage sustained by the vehicles and the remainder of the police report, including the diagram of the accident scene and the vehicle damage record, are individually and collectively sufficient to substantiate the hearing officer\u2019s finding. Additionally, because it is highly likely that the plaintiff knew the police report would be introduced at the hearing and failed to subpoena the witnesses, the plaintiff has not sustained his burden of proving that he was substantially prejudiced by the hearing officer\u2019s reliance on improper evidence. See <em>Reconstruction Finance Corporation </em>v. <em>Banker\u2019s Trust Co., </em>318 U.S. 163, 170, 63 S. Ct. 515, 87 L. Ed. 2d 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The trial court also found that the hearing officer properly admitted a copy of the police report rather than the original which had been destroyed. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly reached this conclusion and relies on an unreported Superior Court case.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">As defined by our Supreme Court, the best evidence rule requires a party to produce an original writing, <em>if it is available, </em>when the terms of that writing are material and must be proved. <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., </em>201 Conn. 1, 10, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986); see also B. Holden &amp; J. Daly, Connecticut Evidence (1988) \u00a7 82 (a). The \u201c \u2018basic premise justifying the rule is the central position which the written word occupies in the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., </em>supra, quoting C. McCormick, Evidence (1984) \u00a7 230; see also <em>Coelm </em>v. <em>Imperato, </em>23 Conn. App. 146, 150, 579 A.2d 573 (1990); <em>Morales </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>Saint Francis Hospital &amp; Medical Center, </em>9 Conn. App. 379, 382, 519 A.2d 86 (1986), cert. dismissed, 202 Conn. 807, 520 A.2d 1287 (1987). Although the plaintiff objected to the introduction of the copy and Kubish testified that he was unsure whether there had been changes made to the copy, the plaintiff offered no evidence that the copy was not accurate, nor, in fact, did he dispute the contents of the copy. See <em>Guaranty Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>4 Conn. App. 376, 382, 494 A.2d 1216, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 808, 499 A.2d 58 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also, the plaintiff offered no evidence in support of his claim that he was substantially prejudiced by the introduction of the copy. The trial court, therefore, properly concluded that the copy of the investigation report was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Finally, the trial court found the plaintiffs claim regarding the absent accident photographs to be without merit. The court reasoned that although Kubish failed to bring the photographs to the hearing as requested, the plaintiff could not show that he was substantially prejudiced by their absence. Furthermore, he failed to request a continuance for the purpose of securing the photographs. The plaintiff\u2019s failure to request a continuance indicates a willingness to continue with the proceeding. <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>181 Conn. 254, 266, 435 A.2d 38 (1980). Because the plaintiff failed to request a continuance to secure the photographs, he cannot now complain that he was prejudiced by their absence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 723, 725, 535 A.2d 808 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>204 Conn. 654, 670, 529 A.2d 1236 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>203 Conn. 159, 171, 523 A.2d 1284 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-9\"> The police report contained the following statement from the plaintiff which was given to Kubish at the scene: \u201cI was traveling south on 95 coming from Norwalk Exit 15 connector leaving work (New England Mobil Communications, Inc.) heading to my girlfriend\u2019s house in Stamford. I was between the left and center lane (in the middle of a lane change) someone behind me flashed their high beams. I saw the flash of light, so I reached up and adjusted my mirror at the same time I was turning the wheel. By the time I looked back down from the mirror I saw the red brake lights and then I hit him (the brown car) in the rear. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the car go over the rail. I stopped on the right shoulder and ran down to the other car to see if they were alright. At the time of the incident, around 9:30 p.m. I was driving my car a 1984 Toyota C\u00e9lica GT, color red bearing CT registration 587-PDA.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-111 (e) provides in pertinent part: \u201csuspension of license after fatal accident.
