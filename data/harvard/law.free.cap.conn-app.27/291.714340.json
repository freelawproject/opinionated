App. 423, 601 A.2d 542 (1991), and review the search and seizure warrant under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test of <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983), pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 594 A.2d 917 (1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our remand ordered a new trial because our decision did not review the warrant to determine whether the evidence seized pursuant to it should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">We have recently explained that our scope of review, in determining whether a substantial factual basis was demonstrated for the issuing authority to find probable cause to issue a warrant, is limited to the facts that appear within the four corners of the affidavit or facts that may properly be inferred from those facts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anziano, </em>26 Conn. App. 667, 669-72, 603 A.2d 415 (1992). We also have given retroactive effect to <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>25 Conn. App. 428, 431, 594 A.2d 1035, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 915, 597 A.2d 337 (1991). <em>Barton </em>applied the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test of <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, and explained that analysis as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u201cWhen a search warrant affidavit is based on information provided to the police by confidential informants, the magistrate should examine the affidavit to determine whether it adequately describes both the factual basis of the informant\u2019s knowledge and the basis on which the police have determined that the information is reliable. If the warrant affidavit fails to state in specific terms how the informant gained his knowledge or why the police believe the information to be trustworthy, however, the magistrate can also consider all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit to determine whether, despite these deficiencies, other objective indicia of reliability reasonably establish that probable cause to search exists. In making this determination, the magistrate is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the facts presented. When a magistrate has determined that the warrant affidavit presents sufficient objective indicia of reliability to justify a search and has issued a warrant, a court reviewing that warrant at a subsequent suppression hearing should defer to the reasonable inferences drawn by the magistrate.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 544-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The defendant originally raised two issues on appeal,</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">(1) whether the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence seized from his person, and</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">(2) whether the trial court improperly denied his motion for judgment of acquittal because of insufficient evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>15 Conn. App. 519, 545 A.2d 1151, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 816, 550 A.2d 1087 (1988). The state conceded that the underlying affidavit lacked the necessary indicia of reliability and basis for knowledge required by the two-pronged <em>Aquilar-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number><em>Spinelli </em>test,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and unsuccessfully put forth two theories that would support the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion: a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule and the investigative stop doctrine as set forth in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6The state now seeks an affirmation of the judgment of conviction because under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test of <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, our review of the underlying affidavit would lead to the conclusion that there existed a substantial basis for the issuing authority\u2019s determination that probable cause existed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>219 Conn. 557, 565, 594 A.2d 933 (1991). If probable cause existed, the evidence seized was properly admissible, and there would be evidence sufficient to support a conviction, thereby making a new trial unnecessary. We agree that we should examine the warrant; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Anziano, </em>supra; and amend our rescript in <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 26 Conn. App. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The affidavit supporting the application for the search warrant contained the following information. A named police officer from Trumbull notified the Monroe police that the defendant was a heavy seller of cocaine and other illegal drugs. The police had also received a telephone call from a resident of Swendsen Drive reporting that he had seen what he believed to be drug activity at 154 Swendsen Drive, that he had seen many vehicles drive up to the house, and that a bearded man came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>from the house, approached each vehicle and engaged in some sort of transaction. When the vehicles left, the man returned to the house. This \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d then stated that this activity could be characterized as \u201cheavy\u201d with vehicles coming and going at all times of the day and night. In light of these reports, Monroe police drove by the house several times every day and night for a period of time and observed numerous vehicles occupied by young males in front of the house and a man walking between the house and the vehicles. On September 15,1986, a confidential informant came to the police department in Monroe and told of what he believed to be heavy drug trafficking at 154 Swend-sen Drive, supplied a list of thirteen marker numbers of vehicles that had been seen frequently stopping at that address at all times of the day and night and that some type of transaction would take place between the occupants of the cars and Michael Marsala, who was known to the informant as the occupant of 154 Swend-sen Drive. The police then continued their surveillance. The informant again came to the police department on September 29, 1986, and gave similar information about the activity concerning Marsala and the address in question. The informant also stated that extremely heavy activity was seen during the weekend of September 27 and 28, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">On September 23, 1986, another police officer told one of the affiants that another informant had told him that he was aware of a man named Mike on Swendsen Drive who was selling cocaine to young people who drove up to the front of the house and that transactions took place right in the street. The following day a resident of the same neighborhood as 154 Swendsen Drive telephoned one of the affiants to express concern about what he felt was frightening activity going on in front of that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>The information received by the affiants came from two neighbors, who, although not referred to as such, maybe considered \u201cconcerned citizens,\u201d from one confidential informant directly, from a second informant through a police officer, and from another police officer, and from another police department. Neither of the \u201cconfidential informants\u201d was shown to be reliable but the information given was obviously current and in one instance detailed sufficiently to be based on personal observation. The credibility of the two neighbors \u201cis bolstered by the fact that citizen informers are considered more credible than confidential informants who are often criminals themselves with ulterior motives for providing information to the police.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anzi-ano, </em>supra, 673. Additionally, observations of the defendant\u2019s activities, made by one or both of the affi-ants, corroborated the details provided by the informants.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Although the confidential informant was not specifically shown to be reliable or trustworthy, the information derived from all sources and corroborated by the police surveillance reasonably allowed the issuing authority to conclude that the information supplied by the informants presented a substantial factual basis on which to find that probable cause existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Thus, after considering the totality of the circumstances as described in the affidavit, we conclude that it presented sufficient objective indicia of reliability to justify the issuance of the warrant. Therefore, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The evidence was properly admitted and with it, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\"> The state filed a \u201cMotion for Reargument\u201d pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4121, 4122 and 4123, which we accept as a motion for reconsideration, and hereby grant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-9\"> For a complete review of this matter see: <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>15 Conn.
