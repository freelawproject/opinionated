The defendants claim that the trial court improperly (1) rendered judgment without joining the general contractor as a party to this action, (2) found that the defendants prevented the general contractor from completing performance, and (3) refused to apportion the debt owed by the defendants among all claimants having an interest in the debt as required by General Statutes \u00a7 49-36 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The court found the following facts. The defendants entered into a written agreement with the general contractor for the construction of their house. The plaintiff subcontractor supplied materials to the general contractor that were used in the construction of the house. A dispute arose between the defendants and the general contractor that was ultimately submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator ruled that the general contractor was entitled to $101,000 for the work done at the defendants\u2019 residence. The award stated that the general contractor was to obtain all necessary approvals and permits from the town of Greenwich. The award further required that the $101,000 was to be placed in an escrow account to be distributed to those parties that were owed money for supplies or services used by the general contractor on the defendants\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">At the time of trial, the general contractor had failed to obtain a certificate of occupancy from the town of Greenwich. The town would not issue the certificate of occupancy until a hard-wired smoke detector was installed in one of the bedrooms as required by the state building code. The court found that the defendants prevented the general contractor from returning to install the smoke detector. The court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the debt owed to the general contractor by the defendants was now due, thus allowing the plaintiff to foreclose on the mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The court determined that the plaintiff was entitled to $55,185.81 for the supplies provided to the general contractor. The defendants then sought apportionment of this payment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-36 (b). The court denied the defendants\u2019 application for apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The resolution of the issues in this case is governed by the statutory provisions concerning mechanic\u2019s liens set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-33 through 49-36. The mechanic\u2019s lien statute is \u201cremedial in nature, designed to furnish security for a contractor\u2019s labor and materials.\u201d <em>Rene Dry Wall Co. </em>v. <em>Strawberry Hill Associates, </em>182 Conn. 568, 573, 438 A.2d 774 (1980). Under Connecticut law, a subcontractor\u2019s right to enforce a mechanic\u2019s hen against a property owner is based on the doctrine of subrogation. <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Climate Control Corporation, </em>181 Conn. 592, 601-602, 436 A.2d 271 (1980). The theory of subrogation allows the plaintiff to recover only to the extent the general contractor could recover from the defendants. The mechanic\u2019s lien held by the plaintiff did not exceed the amount owed by the defendants to the general contractor for performance of the job as required by \u00a7 49-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The defendants challenge for the first time on appeal the plaintiff\u2019s failure to join the general contractor. The defendants argue that the general contractor was an \u201cindispensable party\u201d the absence of which deprived the court of authority to render its judgment. The defendants never filed a motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for nonjoinder of a party as required by Practice Book \u00a7 198. The defendants are not challenging the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>There is some dispute as to whether the defendants waived reviewability of this claim. Practice Book \u00a7 198 provides that \u201cthe exclusive remedy for nonjoinder of parties is by motion to strike.\u201d Our Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]his exclusive remedy applies to nonjoinder of indispensable parties.\u201d <em>George </em>v. <em>St. Ann\u2019s Church, </em>182 Conn. 322, 325, 438 A.2d 97 (1980). Nonjoinder of a party is not a jurisdictional issue because \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 52-108 and Practice Book \u00a7 100 both explicitly provide that nonjoinder does not defeat an action.\u201d <em>DeRosa </em>v. <em>DeRosa, </em>22 Conn. App. 114, 117, 575 A.2d 713 (1990). In <em>DeRosa, </em>we refused to review the claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction in an action to partition property because of nonjoinder of the administrator of the owner\u2019s estate where the appellant did not file a motion to strike. Relying on <em>George </em>v. <em>St. Ann\u2019s Church, </em>supra, this court refused to review a party\u2019s claim that a corporation was an indispensable party where the party did not attempt to strike the complaint because of nonjoinder of parties. <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>5 Conn. App. 235, 238, 497 A.2d 1015 (1985), cert. dismissed, 201 Conn. 366, 516 A.2d 1351 (1986). Our Supreme Court, in its dismissal of the appeal in <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 367 n.1, noted that its decision did not constitute an endorsement of the finding that nonjoinder of an indispensable party was unreviewable when the party failed to strike the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">This court, however, recently reviewed a claim of nonjoinder of an indispensable party despite the appellant\u2019s failure to move to strike the complaint. <em>Gaudio </em>v. <em>Gaudio, </em>23 Conn. App. 287, 305-306, 580 A.2d 1212, cert. denied, 217 Conn. 803, 584 A.2d 471 (1990). The plaintiff in <em>Gaudio </em>alleged that her husband fraudulently transferred corporate stock to the defendant. The trial court found that it was a fraudulent conveyance and ordered the defendant to return the outstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>corporate stock. The defendant claimed that an alleged owner of the corporate stock had to be joined as a party to dispose of the fraudulent conveyance claim properly. Id., 304-305. The plaintiff argued that because there was no motion to strike the fraudulent conveyance claim, this court could not review it. Id., 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In <em>Gaudio, </em>this court agreed with the defendant and reviewed the claim because, if the party that was not joined truly was an indispensable party, the action could not \"be disposed of properly on its merits . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. Therefore, despite the absence of a motion to strike, the claim of nonjoinder of an indispensable party was not waived on appeal. Id. A party is defined as indispensable if its interest in the case is such that a final judgment cannot be entered without either affecting the party\u2019s interest or leaving the case in such condition that its final resolution may be inconsistent with equity and good conscience. <em>Sturman </em>v. <em>Socha, </em>191 Conn. 1, 6, 463 A.2d 527 (1983). After reviewing the evidence in <em>Gaudio </em>v. <em>Gaudio, </em>supra, we concluded that the case could be properly disposed of because the alleged stock owner did not in fact purchase any of the corporate stock. Because this person did not own any stock, the action could be disposed of without affecting his interest, thus, he was not an indispensable party. Id., 306-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We believe that because of the definition of indispensable party and its relation to the proper disposition of an action, it is necessary for us to review the defendants\u2019 claim even though they did not move to strike the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The defendants argue that the general contractor is an indispensable party because they could be subject to paying both the general contractor and the plaintiff for the same expenses. Therefore, the final resolution of this case would be inconsistent with equity if they have to pay both the general contractor and the subcontractor for the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>work. Their claim is based on <em>Jones Destruction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Upjohn, </em>161 Conn. 191, 198, 286 A.2d 308 (1971), where the court stated that \u201cthe general contractor should be made a party to an action for foreclosure of a subcontractor\u2019s lien where the amount due the general contractor is a material issue.\u201d We note however, that the court in <em>Jones Destruction, Inc., </em>characterized the general contractor as a \u201cnecessary party\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and not an indispensable party. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In the present case, the amount due the general contractor is not in dispute. The arbitration award established that the defendants owed the general contractor $101,000 for the work done on their house. The dispute between the defendants and the general contractor concerns the completion of the job. The court focused on the language of the arbitration award in determining that the amount due had already been established. According to this language, the payment of $101,000 constituted \u201cfull and final payment for work completed by\u201d the general contractor. Although the court reasoned that the above language established the existence of a debt owed by the defendants to the general contractor, it deferred payment until certain documents, including the certificate of occupancy, were obtained by the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The arbitration award also stated that the $101,000 was to be held in escrow \u201cwith the understanding that these funds will immediately be used to pay subcontractors and materialmen owed money on account of work done at the [defendants\u2019] residence\u201d for the general contractor. This fund was created for the benefit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>subcontractors who worked for the general contractor. Payment by the defendants to the plaintiff will reduce the amount owed to the general contractor. The defendants will not be subject to double payments because their payments will decrease the fund established for the benefit of the subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Additionally, the general contractor was not an indispensable party because General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 (f)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> protects the defendants from being liable to both the plaintiff and the general contractor for the same services. Section 49-33 (f) allows the court to diminish the amount secured by a mechanic\u2019s lien in favor of a subcontractor \u201cby (1) the reasonable cost of satisfactory completion of the contract, (2) any damages for which the general contractor might be liable to the owner, and (3) any bona fide payments that were made by the owner before it received notice of the lien.\u201d <em>Chris Construction Co. </em>v. <em>May Centers, Inc., </em>23 Conn. App. 453, 456, 581 A.2d 748 (1990). In <em>Chris Construction Co., </em>the general contractor was not a party to that action. This fact further supports our conclusion that the general contractor is not an indispensable party in an action to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien by a subcontractor against the owner of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The foreclosure and payment of the mechanic\u2019s lien will not affect the general contractor\u2019s interest because the general contractor was required to pay the plaintiff for those supplies once it received payment from the defendants. The amount owed to the plaintiff is severable from the total amount owed to the general contractor by the defendants. Therefore, we hold that the general contractor was not an indispensable party that must have been joined in order to render a valid final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The defendants challenge the court\u2019s finding that they prevented the general contractor from completing the job. The court found that the general contractor had to install only a smoke detector to complete performance and to obtain a certificate of occupancy. The court also found that the defendants prevented the general contractor from entering their premises to install the smoke detector. The defendants argue that there was no proof that they prevented the general contractor from finishing the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The trial court\u2019s finding that the defendants prevented the general contractor from completing performance was a disputed question of fact. \u201cThe resolution of conflicting factual claims falls within the province of the trial court. . . . \u2018The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. . . .\u2019We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witness[es].\u201d (Citations <em>omitted.) Nor\u2019easter Group Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 468, 473, 542 A.2d 692 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">At trial, the president of the general contractor\u2019s construction company testified that the defendants told him not to return to the premises to install the smoke detector. The attorney representing the general con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tractor\u2019s construction company also testified that the defendants told the general contractor not to return to the premises. One of the defendants testified that they did not prohibit the general contractor from returning to complete the job. The trial court resolved this conflict in favor of the plaintiff. Because there was evidence supporting this finding, we cannot hold that it was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The defendants\u2019 last claim involves the court\u2019s refusal to apportion the debt found due the plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-36 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants assert that when judgment was rendered for the plaintiff there were also claims against the defendants for approximately $50,700. They argue that these claims combined with the plaintiff\u2019s claim exceeded the $101,000 debt owed to the general contractor. Because the claims exceeded the contract price, the defendants sought apportionment of payment among the claimants having liens on the residence in proportion to the amount of debts due each claimant. The court denied the defendants\u2019 application for apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The court\u2019s determination that the claims against the defendants\u2019 property did not exceed the $101,000 debt for the work done on the defendants\u2019 residence was a factual finding. The court\u2019s determination must stand unless we find that it was clearly erroneous. Our review of the record on the apportionment hearing reveals an inconsistency in the defendants\u2019 brief as to the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>of claims against the defendants. In their brief, the defendants claim that at the time of the hearing they faced a claim of approximately $44,000 from L &amp; M Company related to work done on their residence. At the apportionment hearing, counsel for the defendants acknowledged that, in fact, the claim had been settled for $18,000. Thus, the claim reduced the debt owed by the defendants from $101,000 to $83,000. Therefore, at the time of the apportionment hearing, because of the defendants\u2019 negotiation, the original lien of $44,000 was reduced to $18,000 and was paid by the defendants. The remaining fund of $83,000 exceeded the sum of the plaintiff\u2019s lien for $55,185.81 and another lien for approximately $6700. The defendants\u2019 brief failed to address the effect of their settlement of the lien on the court\u2019s decision not to apportion the remaining claims. On the basis of the evidence presented to the trial court, we cannot find that its decision denying apportionment of the claims was clearly erroneous. The defendants did not establish that the claims against them exceeded the debt owed to the general contractor. Therefore, the trial court was not obligated by \u00a7 49-36 (b) to apportion the claims pro rata.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\"> A necessary party is a person who has an interest in the outcome of the case and ought to be a party but the interest is separable from the parties\u2019 interest such that the court can render judgment without affecting the rights of the person. <em>Sturman </em>v. <em>Socha, </em>191 Conn. 1, 6-7, 463 A.2d 527 (1983).
