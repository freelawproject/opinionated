The bill stated, that a replevy bond, purporting ,to be entered into by the plaintiff, as security for <em>John </em>Whiting, (and which had been assigned to <em>Maupin,) </em>was not the act of the plaintiff. That, about fifteen months after its date, <em>Maupin </em>informed the plaintiff that he had such a bond. That the plaintiff, with astonishment, informed <em>Maupin </em>that he had never executed it, or heard of the execution before. That, about two months afterwards, he met with the Deputy Sheriff, by whom the execution and bond were returned, and was persuaded by him not to mention the transaction, as he said that he would not have such an affair to come before the Court for an hundred pounds; that the plaintiff told him, he would not make any stir in it, unless an execution should come against him. The bill, therefore, prayed an injunction to the bond; and the Deputy Sheriff was made a defendant to the suit. The answer of <em>Maupin </em>stated, that, not fifteen .months after date, he shewed the bond to the plaintiff, who said it was not his hand-writing; but, from the manner of expressing himself, he did not suppose the plaintiff would contest it, or deny that the. subscription was with his consent and approbation. That he was the more induced to think so, as the plaintiff was the only son of the principal obligor, who was wealthy and of a fair character. The answer of the Deputy Sheriff stated, that the commissioners having approved of the plaintiff as security for his father, and the defendant reposing confidence in the father, entrusted him with the bond to get the signature of the plaintiff, who was absent. That the father afterwards returned the bond to the defendant, with the plaintiff\u2019s name subscribed. That, the plaintiff afterwards denying the signature, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>defendant said he would sue the father in order to secure himself. Whereupon, the plaintiff said it might hurt his father\u2019s feelings, and that he supposed he must be his security. On which, he acknowledged the signature to be his hand and seal. The cause was heard on the bill and answers in the Court of Chancery; where the injunction was made perpetual. From which decree <em>Maupin </em>appealed to this \"Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-8\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-9\">The plaintiff, indeed, states that he did not subscribe the bond; but, <em>Maupin </em>says, he did not appear to dispute his liability; and, the Deputy Sheriff says he acknowledged it, which is responsive to the allegations of the bill. The Deputy Sheriff\u2019s testimony is admissible, because he has no interest in <em>questions of this </em>kind. <em>It is his duty to </em>take the bonds, and in practice, he is generally the only witness to them. But, the conduct of the plaintiff charges him, because he did not give fair warning. He should have denied it at once; but, he did not, and from his own shewing, he intended to conceal it. This might have been no objection at law, but it certainly is in equity; for, it was a fraud upon the defendant. The plaintiff had no pretext for applying to a Court of Equity. He should have pleaded <em>non est'factum, </em>and submitted the legal question to the Court of Law. It is analogous to a case in this Court, in which a <em>supersedeas </em>from the District Court, to an execution in a County Court, was quashed; because, the County Court might have given redress.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\"><em>[* Post, </em>390, and <em>Buck </em>et. al. v Copland 2 Call, 229<em>; Beatty </em>v. <em>Smith </em>et al. 2 H. &amp; M. 395; <em>Heffner </em>v. <em>Miller </em>et al. 2 Munf. 43 ; <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Woodfin, </em>admr. 5 Munf. 183 ; <em>Lenox </em>et al. v.
