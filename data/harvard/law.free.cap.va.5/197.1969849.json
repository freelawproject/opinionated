Upon the trial of the cause, the defendant filed a bill of exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion; which stated, that the plaintiff offered in evidence to the jury, a record of a suit in <em>Brunswick </em>County Court, wherein <em>Minnis </em>was plaintiff, and <em>Thomas Carter </em>defendant, commenced upon the' 9th day of <em>April, </em>1792; and, the declaration in which, contained three counts. 1st. For military certificates sold and delivered. 2d. A <em>quantum valebat </em>for military certificates sold and delivered. 3d. For money had and received. . The plea was <em>non assumpsit, </em>and there was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for 173/. <em>3s. </em>and costs. Upon which, a writ <em>offierifacias </em>was issued and was returned <em>\u2018 no </em>effects.\u2019 There is, in the said record, a copy <em>of </em>the before-mentioned writing from <em>T. Carter </em>to <em>John Carter, </em>and of the endorsements mentioned in the declaration: To which is annexed, a certificate of the Clerk of the Court, that the same were read on the trial. To the introduction of which evidence the defendant objected; but the objection was overruled by the Court. o The defendant likewise demurred to the same evidence; with the addition, that there was verbal testimony to prove that <em>Thomas Carter </em>was generally reputed insolvent from <em>January, </em>1791. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 188/. <em>3s. 6d. </em>damages, if the evidence is sufficient to support the plaintiff\u2019s action; if otherwise, for the defendant. The County Court gave judgment for the plaintiff; the District Court affirmed that judgment; and, from the judgment of affirmance, <em>Minnis </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>Washington, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-3\">The evidence was inadmissible, as it did not support the allegations of the declaration; which aver, that suit was brought by <em>Pollard: </em>whereas, the evidence produced, was the record of a suit between <em>Minnis </em>and <em>Carter, </em>and not between <em>Pollard </em>and <em>Carter. </em>So, that there was a plain variance between the declaration, and the evidence offered to support it, which is sufficient-to reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-4\">But, upon the demurrer, the judgment is certainly erroneous. It was a special contract, the condition of which was, that <em>Pollard </em>should pursue the legal method for recovering the demand against <em>Carter; </em>and, the declaration avers performance. The plaintiff, therefore, should have proved it. But, he has not; for, he has not shewn that he brought any suit: Which was a condition precedent, and without performing it, he could not maintain the action. In <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Davis, 2 </em>Wash. <em>219, </em>in this Court, it was held,* that the assignee must sue the obligor, before he can resort to the assignor; upon the implied condition, that he undertook to do so. But, this case is stronger; for, here nothing was left to implication; but, the assignee expressly undertook to do it, and, therefore, was bound to perform his promise. Sensible of this, he has averred it; but, his evidence does not support the averment. For, the record produced was a suit between other parties. It may per haps be said, that <em>Pollard </em>could not have brought a suit. But, whether he could or not, will make no difference. Because, he undertook to do so; and, he was under a necessity of fulfilling that undertaking, before he could sue the assignor. None of the evidence applies to the money counts; and, therefore, upon those the judgment cannot be sustained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-5\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">The bill of exceptions does not state, that it was all the evidence in the cause, and there might have been evidence under the special counts, to shew that the suit, though brought in the name of <em>Minnis, </em>was <em>really </em>for the benefit of <em>Pollard, </em>and that it was commenced by his direction. Which was a thing that lay in averment, and might have been proved by matter <em>de hors </em>the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\"><em>Pollard </em>could not have brought suit in his own name; for, the paper being only a private letter between Doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>Carter </em>and his brother, was not a note in writing or obligation to pay to <em>Minnis, </em>although perhaps he might have used it collaterally, in support of his original demand. Neither was it negotiable On the ground of its being an order to pay; for, it has not any marks of privity and confidence between <em>Minnis </em>ana <em>Carter; </em>and, at all events, it is payable out of a particular fund, and that fund contingent and uncertain. The inference, therefore, is, that <em>Minnis </em>by assigning it, has agreed to lend his name to <em>Pollard </em>to bring suit against <em>Carter; </em>and, consequently, bringing suit in the name of <em>Minnis, </em>was not only allowable, but all that <em>Pollard </em>could do. ' Again, the object of a suit was only to ascertain whether the money could be made out of <em>Carter </em>or not; and, that object was as well attained by a suit in the name of <em>Minnis, </em>as of <em>Pollard. </em>Besides, the demurrer admits the insolvency of <em>Carter, </em>at the time of the assignment; and, therefore, it was wholly unimportant whether suit was brought or not, as the situation of <em>Minnis </em>could not be altered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-8\">But, this argument, that <em>Pollard </em>brought no suit, proves too much: because, it brings the appellant to this dilemma, that he brought the suit himself, and, therefore, has dispensed with the obligation, on the part of <em>Pollard, </em>to do it. And, having dispensed with it, he can never be received to say that it was not done. But, there is a circumstance which clearly.proves, that the suit was brought for the benefit of <em>Pollard. </em>For, the record of <em>Brunswick </em>Court shews., that the paper and endorsements were filed and used, as exhibits in the trial of that causey and, the defendant by demurring, has admitted that they were the foundation of that action. For, the demurrer admits every thing which the jury might have inferred from the circumstances. BulleP'\u00abN. P. 313. It, therefore, admits the promise to pay; that <em>Pollard </em>had used the necessary process; and, that <em>Carter </em>was insolvent. But, the assignment for value received, was proper evidence on the money counts; and, if <em>Carter </em>was insolvent, then on application to him for the money, and not receiving payment, <em>Pollard </em>had a right to consider the assignment as useless, and to resort to <em>Minnis </em>for his original demand. <em>[Steedman </em>v. <em>Gooch,] Esp. Rep. </em>5-6.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-9\"><em>Washington, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-10\">The doctrine of demurrers, is carried too far by the appellee\u2019s counsel. The demurrer only admits such things as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the jury might have inferred from the evidence produced. <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>White, 2 </em>Wash. [203,] in this Court. For, if all the evidence is stated, and yet that evidence does not prove the charge, the presumption is, that the party cannot prove it. Or, else you must suppose that the jury can presume legal evidence, which would be preposterous. It does not necessarily follow, from the record of <em>Brunswick </em>Court, that the suit there, was for the benefit of <em>Pollard. </em>At least, he should have shewn upon the trial, that he had it instituted, and paid the costs. But, having shewn none of these things, and the record being only between <em>Minnis </em>and <em>Carter, </em>the plaintiff has not proved performance of the condition; and, therefore, can\u2019t recover. It was said, the whole evidence is not stated; but, if that be true, the plaintiff should have refused to join in the demurrer. There was no- proof of a <em>loan </em>or of <em>money. laid out', </em>and, therefore, the plaintiff could not recover on the money counts.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b225-4\">PENDLETON, President,</author>\n<p id=\"A2K\">delivered the resolution of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On the 30th of <em>June, </em>1791, <em>Minnis, </em>for value received, assigns to <em>Pollard, </em>an order of <em>Thomas Carter </em>upon <em>John </em>Carter,\u25a0 for some military certificates, and binds himself to pay the certificates, with interest from the 1st <em>January, </em>1791, if <em>Pollard </em>does not recover them from <em>Thomas Carter, </em>after pursuing the legal method for obtaining the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In <em>Jlpril, </em>1793, a suit is brought in the name of <em>Minnis </em>against <em>Carter, </em>founded on these papers, and claiming the value of the certificates. Judgment is obtained, and execution issued in <em>Jlpril, </em>1793,' which is returned, no effects. And, in <em>October, </em>1793, <em>Pollard </em>brings this suit upon the assignment, and adds two general counts. Upon the trial, he gives the former record in evidence, to shew he had pursued the legal method for obtaining the money from <em>Carter, </em>with the auxiliary parol proof that <em>Carter </em>was deemed insolvent from <em>January, </em>1791, the commencement of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">It is objected, that the suit against <em>Carter </em>does not appear to have been for the same thing. But this objection is made in the very teeth of the record, which shews it to be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"AoJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Another objection was, that the suit being in the name <em>Minnis, </em>it does not appear to have been pursued by <em>Pollard, </em>as his engagement required. But the answer is, that it was probably the only legal method which could have been pursued by <em>Pollard: </em>And, by whomsoever the suit was prosecuted, the essential purpose was obtained by it, namely, that of discovering whether the money could have been recovered of <em>Carter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
