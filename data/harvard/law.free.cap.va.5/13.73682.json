Code, ch. 78. \u00a7 12. p. 278. and in this bond, <em>George Pegram, </em>jrj05er\u00a1f <em>Williams, Nathaniel Dabney </em>and <em>Isham Dabney, </em>were bound as sureties. The surety, <em>Pham Dabney, </em>was also a deputy of <em>Claiborne </em>the sheriff; and he in fact administered <em>Smith\u2019s </em>estate; but almost all his transactions in the administration, were posteriour to the termination of <em>Claiborne\u2019s </em>shrievalty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-3\">The legatees of <em>Smith </em>exhibited their bill in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Richmond, </em>against the administrator and heirs of <em>Claiborne, </em>the administrator of <em>Pegram </em>and <em>Williams, Isham </em>and <em>Nathaniel Dabney, </em>setting forth the facts above stated, and praying an account of the administration of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>estate, and a decree against the administrator or heirs of <em>Claiborne, </em>and his sureties in his official bond, for the balance that should be found due to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-4\">Pending the suit, most of the original parties defendants died, and the first representatives of them, respectively, also died, and the suit was, from time to time, regularly revived, except as to the representative of the defendant <em>Williams; </em>after the death of whom, it was regularly revived against his executor, but he also died before the final decree, and there was no revival, by the usual process, against <em>Williams\u2019s </em>administrator <em>de bonis non.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">An account was ordered of the administration of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>estate by <em>Isham Dabney, </em>the deputy of <em>Claiborne </em>the sheriff: and the commissioner\u2019s report shewed a balance due from <em>Dabney </em>to <em>Smith\u2019s </em>legatees of 1430 dollars, principal and interest computed to the 1st January 1830.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">It appeared, very clearly, that no assets had come to the hands of the personal representatives of either <em>Claiborne, </em>the sheriff, or <em>Isham Dabney, </em>the deputy, who actually administered <em>Smith\u2019s </em>estate and one of <em>Claiborne\u2019s </em>sureties, or <em>Pegram, </em>another of his sureties; and no accounts of the administration of those estates were required: the estates of the sureties <em>Williams </em>and <em>Nathaniel Dabney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>only were solvent. It appeared, however, that Claiborne, the sheriff, had a claim to a bounty in land for military services, for which his heirs obtained a land warrant after his death; but this land was in the state of <em>Ohio. </em>No inquiry was made as to real estate left by <em>Pegram </em>and <em>Isham \u00b0 </em>Dabney, nor were their heirs ever made parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-10\">The chancellor first made a decree against the administrators of <em>Claiborne </em>and of <em>Isham </em>Dabney, that they should pay, out of the estates of their intestates, respectively, the balance of 1430 dollars found due <em>Smith's </em>estate, to the plaintiffs his legatees; reserving liberty to them to resort to the court for a decree against the other defendants, if this decree should prove unproductive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-11\">At the time this decree was made, the executor of the surety Williams, against whom the suit had been regularly revived, was living and before the court; but, it seemed he died soon afterwards, though his death was not suggested on the record; and administration <em>de bonis nm </em>with the will annexed of <em>Williams </em>was committed to another person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-12\">A <em>fieri facias </em>having been sued out on the decree against the representatives of <em>Claiborne </em>and of <em>Isham </em>Dabney, and returned \u201c no effects of either decedent,\u201d the plaintiffs gave a notice to the administrator of Pegram, the administrator of <em>Nathaniel </em>Dabney, and the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed of <em>Williams </em>(though there had been no process to revive the suit against him), of a motion to be made in the circuit superiour court of law and chancery of <em>Henrico </em>(to which the cause had been transferred), for a decree against them for the amount due. And thereupon, the circuit court decreed, that the administrator of <em>Nathaniel Dabney </em>and the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Williams, should pay the balance of 1430 dollars &amp;c. <em>de bonis testatoris, </em>respectively, without making any decree against <em>Pegrards </em>administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-13\">From this decree, the representatives of <em>Nathaniel Dabney </em>and of <em>Williams </em>applied by petition to this court, for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Avi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The <em>attorney general </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhFM\">objected to the proceedings and decree, 1. That, as it appeared that the administration of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>estate had been conducted wholly ^ <em>jsjmm j)aine^ </em>the deputy sheriff, his estate, real and personal and his sureties in his bond to <em>Claiborne </em>the she-r <em>1 </em>riff for the faithful discharge of his office of deputy, ought in equity to have been charged with the debt in the first instance; yet no account was required of the administration of <em>Isham Dabney\u2019s </em>personal estate, and neither his sureties nor his heirs were made parties. <em>2. </em>That the estate of <em>Claiborne </em>the sheriff, real as well as personal, should have been charged with the whole debt in exoneration of his sureties; yet no account of his personal assets was required; and though his heirs were parties, and it appeared that he left real estate, no step was taken to ascertain its value, and to subject it to the debt. 3. That if a decree was proper against the sureties, under the circumstances of the case, the decree should have been against the representatives of all, not, as it was, against those of <em>Williams </em>and <em>Nathaniel Dabney </em>only, without any regular inquiry as to the assets, real or personal, of the other two, <em>Isham Dabney </em>and <em>Pegram, </em>whose representatives, real and personal, were bound to contribute. Accounts of the administrations of the estates of <em>Pegram </em>and <em>Isham Dabney, </em>were necessary; since they might have shewn waste committed by their representatives, which would have made them personally liable. 4. That the decree against the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Williams, </em>was irregular, because the suit had never been revived against him, nor had the death of <em>Williams\u2019s </em>executor been suggested on the record: the notice to the administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>on which the decree against him was made, was not process: he was, in fact, not a party to the proceedings. And 5. That the official bond of a sheriff, as the law stood at the time this bond was executed (it had since been amended), did not bind the sheriff as sheriff, or his sureties, for his transactions as committee of a decedent\u2019s estate, much less for the transactions of his deputy in the administration. <em>The Auditor </em>v. <em>Dryden, </em>3 Leigh 703. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>And, at any rate, the sheriff and his official sureties were not responsible for the transactions of his deputy in the administration, after the expiration of his term of office; and _ , _ . . . _ \u201e _ i .] . here, the administration of Dabneyf the deputy, was transacted, for the most part, after the termination of his principal\u2019s shrievalty.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-6\">Spooner, for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsZ\">answered, that as it clearly appeared, that the <em>personal </em>estates of <em>Claiborne </em>the sheriff, of <em>Isham </em>Dabney, his deputy as well as one of his sureties, and of the surety Pegram, were utterly insolvent, it would have been an idle waste of time, and a useless aggravation of costs for which the solvent sureties would have been responsible at last, to have required accounts of administration of their estates; and this consideration obviated the objection to the final decree, that it was against two of the sureties only; since they were the only parties chargeable, whose estates were solvent. He said, that it did not clearly appear, that the heirs of <em>Claiborne </em>inherited any land from him, which could be charged with his debts: they obtained a warrant for land bounty for his military services, after his death; but the land to which the warrant entitled them, lay in the state of <em>Ohio, </em>and the appellees were not bound to go there after it. Nor could <em>they </em>be required to pursue the sureties of the deputy sheriff. The appellees were entitled to recover their whole demand against each and every one of the sheriff\u2019s sureties, and out of the personal estate of each and every one: they were not bound to pursue the real estate of either of them in the hands of his heirs, in order to exonerate the estates of the solvent sureties, whose representatives might have recourse, if they thought proper, to the heirs of their co-sureties for contribution, or to the sureties, of <em>Dabney, </em>the deputy, for indemnification. He cited <em>Sheppard\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Starke and wife, </em>3 Munf. 29. to shew, that the proceeding against <em>Williams\u2019s </em>administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>by notice and motion, was regular and proper. And as to the last objection, he said, that the administration of the decedent\u2019s estate was committed to <em>Claiborne </em>as sheriff; the duty of administering the estate was imposed on him by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>law in his official character; and it was provided in the condition of his official bond, in the most general terms, that he should, in all things, faithfully execute his office of she-during his continuance therein. And he maintained, that the administration of <em>Smith's </em>estate having been com- \u00ae mitted to the sheriff, he could not, at the expiration of his office, have devolved the duty of the administration to his successor: it belonged to his official authority and duty to complete the administration, settle the accounts, and distribute the surplus.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-9\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AWL\">Yarious objections have been made to the decree in this case, none of which appear to me to be substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">It has been decided by this court, that a party injured may, under particular circumstances, pursue his remedy in equity against the executor and his sureties, without a previous suit to establish a <em>devastavit. </em>It is not pretended, that the remedy has not been properly resorted to in this case; but it is contended, that as the plaintiff comes into equity, instead of suing upon the bond at law, he is bound to submit to the rule of equity, which will first decree against the principal, and subject the sureties only in the event of that decree being unavailing. Such, I take it, is without question the practice of the court where such a measure can be adopted, \u201cwithout any material delay or injury to the creditor;\u201d <em>2 </em>Rand. 400. And if <em>Buller Claiborne </em>and <em>Isham Dabney </em>had been alive at the date of the decree, it ought to have been entered against them, in the first instance. However, they being dead, it was entered very properly against their estates in the hands of their personal representatives; and on this decree a <em>fieri facias </em>has been returned <em>nulla bona testator is. </em>But, it is contended, that the plaintiffs should then have proceeded to have the accounts of the administrators of <em>Claiborne </em>and <em>Dabney </em>settled, in order to a decree against them personally, if a <em>devastavit </em>should be established. I think not. This would indeed be to impose too onerous terms on the creditor. He ought not to be de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>layed in his recovery, until he has pursued the personal representatives of the principal to the utmost limit of litigation. Tiie surety must be content with his right of subrogation, and take upon himself that pursuit, as the consequence of his having become sponsor for the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">For a like reason, I do not think there was any obligation in the creditor to pursue the <em>heirs </em>of <em>Butter Claiborne. </em>Indeed, in this case, it might well admit of question, whether if the <em>Ohio </em>land be <em>not </em>sold, the courts in <em>Virginia </em>could charge <em>it; </em>or, if <em>it be </em>sold, whether by the law of <em>Ohio, the </em>heir is chargeable by reason of the descent of the land. These are interesting questions, but not necessary to be settled in this case, unless the sureties asserting their right of subrogation, should directly present it.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">As to the objection that <em>this </em>decree is rendered against two only of four sureties, the answers are plain: that as to <em>Ishami Dabney, this </em>decree was not rendered against him, because the <em>former </em>decree had been <em>already </em>so rendered, and found unavailing: and that as to <em>Pegram, </em>enough appears in the record, to shew that he was hopelessly insolvent, and no attempt was made by the appellants, at the last hearing, to prove the contrary. As to the proceeding by notice, this is expressly sustained by <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hobson, 2 </em>Rand. 487. on the authority of the case of <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Starke, </em>3 Munf. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\"><em>It </em>remains but <em>to </em>add, that I think the sheriff\u2019s sureties are responsible under his official bond, for his <em>devastavit </em>of the estate committed to him, and that <em>Dry denis </em>case is not to be considered as an authority to the contrary. The reasoning of the court in that case, it is believed, will not be found applicable to this. It was contended, indeed, that the sureties are not liable for any waste committed after the expiration of the term, for which <em>Claiborne </em>was commissioned. I cannot think so. The estate was committed to him within that term. The statute made no provision for transferring the administration to a succeeding sheriff, and the sheriff to whom the estate is once committed, must therefore proceed with the administration until it is complete. If the <em>trust </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>reposed within the period within which the sureties are bound, they are responsible, whenever there is a breach of that continuing trust, whether .before or after the expiration \u2018 of that term; in like manner as sureties are responsible for non~Payment \u00b0f money made by <em>sale </em>under execution, though made after the expiration of the sheriffs\u2019s term, the levy having been made <em>before </em>its expiration.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Cabell and Carr, <em>J. </em>concurred.
