This debt was afterwards, to wit: On the 11th day of <em>April, </em>1777, carried into a specialty, the penalty of which was 400/. and the condition was for payment of 200/. on the first day of <em>August, </em>1780, with legal interest thereon, from the first day of <em>Augus t, </em>1778. That <em>Hewett </em>died, and his property was put into the hands of the defendant <em>Vowles, </em>as Sheriff of the County of <em>Stafford, </em>for administration and division, by the Court of the said County of <em>Stafford-, </em>who directed the said bond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>be discharged according to the scale of depreciation, upon the 11th day of <em>April, </em>1777, and that the Court refused to receive proof of the said debt having originated in the year 1776: -That this opinion of the County Court had been affirmed by the District Court of <em>Fredericksburg. </em>To which judgment of affirmance, the petitioners prayed a writ of <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">The bond was for 400/. current money of <em>Virginia; </em>and, was payable to Messrs. <em>Bogle, Somerville Co. </em>of the City of <em>Glasgow. </em>The condition was for payment of 200/. like money, on the first day of <em>August, </em>1780, with interest from the first day of <em>August, </em>1778, according to the statement in the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">There was a bill of exceptions to the opinion of the County Court, which stated the matter mentioned in the petition, and that the plaintiffs offered to prove, that the contract for which the said bond was taken, originated on the 22d day of <em>June, </em>1776, but that the Court rejected the testimony.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-8\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahl\">Referred the Court to <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Bibb, </em>1 Wash. 8, and <em>Hill </em>et al. v. <em>Southerland\u2019s </em>ex\u2019r. 1 Wash. 128, in this Court; and, submitted the case upon the petition.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b239-9\">PENDLETON, President,</author>\n<p id=\"AWkH\">delivered the resolution of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">The circumstances to be enquired' into, under the last clause in the act of Assembly, in order to overrule the legal scale, must be such as arise in the contract sued on, shewing tbe parties, at that time, contracted on the idea of no <em>depreciation, </em>or one different from the legal scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">In the case of bonds, the circumstances, if admitted at all, must be very strong to induce a departure. <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Bibb, </em>1 Wash. 8, had a strong appearance on the bond itself of a prior contract not changed; and, this confirmed by other written testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">But, here the bond has a .different aspect. The interest is to commence at a future day, and the payment is to be made at another day, still more remote; and, whatever might have been the contract in 1776, the parties may have contemplated in 1777, an existing or probable depreciation, and increased the sum accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"AYZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The Courts were right in rejecting the evidence of the conti\u2019aet 1776, as wholly immaterial; and, therefore, upon the merits, we deny the motion for a supersedeas,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-4\">[* <em>Skipwith </em>v.
