Beverley, </em>as expressed upon his deed to the said <em>Lewis </em>recorded in the court &lt;fcc. and are excepted in the above deed of <em>Lewis </em>to Washington.\u201d 2. A deed of <em>Washington </em>to <em>Robert Dunbar, </em>dated the 18th March 1813, conveying the same lands to him ; to which deed there was likewise subjoined the following\u2014\u201c Note: two acres of <em>Belville </em>are reserved, according to the reservation in the deed from <em>C. Beverley </em>to <em>J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>Lewis, </em>and in the deed from said <em>Lewis </em>to the said <em>Washinglon.\u201d </em>3. A deed from <em>Dunbar </em>to <em>Peter Hansbrough </em>now deceased, dated the 19th March 1813, conveying the same lands to him, with the like note thereto subjoined, viz. \u201c Note: two acres of <em>Belville </em>are reserved, according to the reservation in the deed from <em>Washington </em>to the said <em>Dunbar.\u201d </em>And 4. the plaintiff proved, that the two acres of land in the declaration mentioned were parcel of the <em>Belville </em>tract; that Hansbrough, in his lifetime, took possession of the whole of Belville, including the two acres in controversy, and built a shop on those two acres, and put his grandson, one Cochran, in possession of the whole of <em>Belville; </em>that about the year 1816, the shop being then vacant, the defendant <em>\u00a1Stone </em>took possession of it and of the two acres in controversy, and had thenceforth continued to hold the same; that <em>Hansbrough </em>died in 1822, in possession of all Belville, except the two acres, and by his will devised the same to his son, the lessor of the plaintiff. And then the defendant <em>\u00a1Stone </em>offered in evidence, 1. a deed executed by <em>Carter Beverley </em>to him, dated the 5th January 1819, conveying <em>to him the two </em>acres of land in controversy, describing the same by metes and hounds, as two acres lying in the north east fork of the cross roads, which were reserved to <em>Beverley </em>in his conveyance of <em>Belville </em>to <em>Joseph Lewis: </em>and 2. the conveyance from <em>Beverley </em>to Lewis, dated the 24th September 1806, conveying to Mm <em>{inter alia) </em>the parcel of land called <em>Belville, </em>by the name of <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>tract; on which there was a writing indorsed and signed by <em>Lewis, </em>in the following words: \u201c It is understood, that two acres of land in <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>tract,, having been heretofore applied for the erection of a church, are excepted in this deed, and are to he located in the most convenient spot near the cross roads.\u201d And the court permitted the last mentioned deed of <em>Beverley </em>to <em>Lewis, </em>to be read in evidence to the jury, except the writing thereon indorsed, purporting to be a reservation of two acres for the use of a church, which the court rejected and excluded: to which opinion the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff; to which, upon the petition of the defendant, a <em>supersedeas </em>was allowed by a judge of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-10\"><em>Btanard, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkX\">said, 1. that the writing indorsed by <em>Lewis </em>on <em>Beverley\u2019s </em>deed to him, was a part of the deed; <em>Shermer </em>v. <em>Beale, </em>1 Wash. 11. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>2 Wash. 130. and, therefore, of necessity, it ought to have been read with the rest of the deed; and 2. that the writing indorsed was a plain exception, and reservation to <em>Beverley, </em>of the two acres of land out of the whole parcel conveyed to <em>Lewis, </em>so that he and those claiming under him acquired po title to those two acres.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-11\">\n<em>Leigh,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmY\"><em>contra, </em>insisted, that the writing indorsed on the deed, though it was written on the same paper, was not therefore a part of the deed. He said, it was, in effect, an executory agreement: the whole land was conveyed by the deed to <em>Lewis ; </em>and then it was agreed, that two acres, to be located, that is, afterwards located, at the <em>most </em>convenient spot near the cross roads, for the use of a church, were excepted. This was surely no reservation of two acres in the north east fork of the cross roads, which was the land in controversy, or of any particular two acres. The reservation could not operate till the two acres should be located; and a court of equity would not have decreed execution of the agreement, without laying <em>Beverley </em>under terms that the two acres should only be used for the purpose of a church. This agreement, therefore, was rightly excluded from the evidence, since it did not affect the legal title, and might have the effect of misleading the jury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b444-12\">Care., <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A_i\">In <em>Shermer </em>v. <em>Beale </em>and <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>and other cases, both <em>english </em>and <em>american, </em>it is laid down, that such an indorsement as that on the deed from <em>Beverley </em>to <em>Lewis, </em>is to be taken as a part of the deed; yet the circuit court admitted the deed and rejected the indorsement. This was clearly wrong. What may be the weight of that indorsement as evidence, would be matter for the jury, after it should be before them. On this point, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>court below lias given no opinion, nor need we. The judgment should be reversed, and the cause sent back for anew trial.</p>\n<author id=\"AGB\">Cabell, ./.</author>\n<p id=\"ATkH\">The indorsement on the deed, was a part of the deed. It ought, therefore, to have been suffered to go to the jury, as evidence. The circuit court erred in excluding it; and for this cause, the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b445-7\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AT8I\">I think, there can be no doubt that the court erred in excluding the indorsement on <em>Beverley\u2019s </em>deed to <em>Lewis </em>from the jury. That indorsement was a part of the deed, whatever might be its effect. <em>Burgh </em>v. Preston, 8 T. R. 483. 1 Bac. Abr. Condition. C. p. 634. <em>Gordon </em>v. Frazier, 2 Wash. 130. Tf the deed was introduced at all, it could not properly be garbled. The whole of it should have gone to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Indeed, the effect of the exception in the deed, was to create a tenancy in common, in the first instance, between <em>Beverley </em>and <em>Lends, </em>the former having an undivided interest of two acres in the tract. Now the ejectment was for the two acres out and out. It was a claim in severalty; and it was, therefore, important to the defendant to shew, that the plaintiff had no right to turn him entirely out of possession, but only a right to recover his own social possession in the property. Had this indorsement on the deed been introduced in evidence, it would have shewn <em>Stone\u2019s </em>title to an undivided interest to the extent of two acres, and the verdict instead of being for two acres in severalty, to which <em>Hansbrough </em>had no right, would have been for his undivided portion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">I am of opinion, therefore, to reverse the judgment, set aside the verdict, and send the cause back for further proceedings ; remarking, however, that the facts disclosed shew a case much more proper for a bill in equity for partition, than for an ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
