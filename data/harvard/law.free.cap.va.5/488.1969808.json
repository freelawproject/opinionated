I therefore, notify you to prepare to chuse you a Clerk in my room at the next Court, as I shall continue in office no longer after that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>day,\u201d Signed <em>\u201c Qawin Hamilton\u201d </em>and directed to <em>\u2018c </em>the Justices of <em>Pendleton </em>county.\u201d At <em>June </em>Court, 1797, the Court made this entry on their records, <em>\u201c </em>the Court \u201e are of opinion from a letter received from <em>Gawin Hamil</em>ton, in open Court at the last term, (and from his verbal declaration to them at that time,) that he would not continue in office, as Clerk of this County longer than this term, that he the said Hamilton, hath thereby resigned his said office as Clerk aforesaid: they, therefore, proceed to chuse another Clerk for the said County, and order, that the Clerk that may be so appointed, take upon himself and execute the duties of Clerk of the said County immediately after the expiration of this term: And that the said <em>Hamilton </em>be notified to appear at the next Court, to be held for this County, at the Court-house, to deliver up the records of said County to the person who may be chosen Clerk as aforesaid.\u201d The Court, at the time of making the said entry, consisted of ten members; four of whom the record states objected thereto, because the said letter and verbal declaration did not warrant the appointment of a Clerk at that time; as <em>Hamilton </em>was not present and had not written any further to the Court. The record then states, that <em>Dyer </em>was immediately appointed Clerk; he having six votes, and the four who objected as above having refused to vote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-3\">At <em>July </em>Court, 1797, the same ten members were in Court, a new commission of the peace was produced, and three new Justices qualified under it, against the opinion of the above-mentioned six; because the recommendation was made at the last Court, and the copy of the order was not attested and sent to the Governor by <em>Dyer; </em>and because too, esthe three new Magistrates aforesaid were qualified by the deputy Clerk of <em>Gawin Hamilton.\u201d </em>Then follows an entry in these words, <em>u Gawin </em>Hamilton, Clerk of this County, came into Court and resigned his office as Clerk of this County, whereupon <em>Abraham Smith </em>having seven votes was duly elected Clerk of this County.\u201d The above-named six members objected to this appointment, as they conceived <em>Dyer </em>to have been legally appointed, and he had qualified and given bond at the last Court. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\">The District Court first granted a rule upon the Clerk and Justices, to shew cause why <em>Dyer </em>should not be reinstated in the office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">Several depositions were taken in the District Court, which stated, that <em>Hamilton </em>came into the County Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>at the <em>May </em>term and held a paper in his hand which the Court considered as his resignation. That he gave the paper to the Court, and told them it was his resignation. That one of the Justices objected to the form of it, but <em>Hamilton </em>said no advantage was intended; but that he meant it as his resignation. That, if the Court supposed he had any design, he would give up the office then, but that he wished to. keep it until the next Court, that the young man might get the papers in order. That the Court might proceed to appoint another Clerk at the next Court, for he would be their Clerk no longer. And that <em>Hamilton </em>gave the Court no further information until the succeeding <em>July </em>term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-8\">The first writ of <em>mandamus </em>to restore or shew cause, not being returned by the Justices, a second issued, with a direction in the order, that it should be delivered to the <em>\u201c </em>Justices, or such of them as shall be sitting in open Court,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-9\">To this latter writ, six of- the Justices who stated themselves to be then, sitting, and composing part of the Court on the 6th of <em>June, </em>1798, returned that <em>\u201cDyer </em>was never duly elected and sworn, but that the office from <em>May </em>to <em>July, </em>was filled by <em>Hamilton-. </em>Who then resigned, and <em>Smith </em>was duly elected, sworn and admitted, &amp;c.\u201d But seven other Justices being the residue of the Court then sitting, returned, \u201c that <em>Hamilton </em>resigned at <em>May </em>Court, and <em>Dyervfzs </em>elected, qualified and admitted in <em>June, </em>1797, and acted as Clerk till <em>July, </em>1797; when, in consequence of an appointment of <em>Smith </em>as above-mentioned, (reciting the circumstances as already related,) he got the possession and acts as Clerk, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b514-10\">Upon this return, the District Court awar.ded a peremptory <em>mandamus </em>to restore <em>Dyer-, </em>and from that order <em>Smith </em>appealed to this Court.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-11\"><em>Call, Randolph </em>and <em>Nicholas, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-12\">Contended that <em>Dyer </em>was not duly elected; because, at the time of his election, <em>Hamilton, </em>the preceding Clerk, had not resigned. For, the letter was not an actual resignation, but a mere declaration of an intention to resign, which he might or might not carry into effect, as he thought proper. Therefore, as he had done no further act of resignation, when <em>Dyer\u2019s </em>election took place, the office was not then vacant, and, consequently, the election was void. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>That the County Court could not grant an office to take effect in occupation at a future day, as the King of <em>England </em>can; because the constitution' requires an actual vacancy, and as there was no vacancy here at the time, the election conferred no right. That it appeared by the record, that the Court did not consider <em>Hamilton\u2019s </em>resignation as perfected at the time of the election; for, <em>Dyer </em>is elected to occupy the office, after the expiration of that term of the Court; and at a subsequent term, it is stated, that <em>Hamilton </em>came in and resigned. That the return to the <em>mandamus </em>was not conclusive; for, it is so only against the party praying it; and, .therefore, the statute of <em>Anne </em>only gives a traverse to him who prays it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-4\">That where there was so nice a division of the sitting members of the Court, as there was in this case, when the return was made, and where too the members present at the elections were equally divided, and the Magistrate who made the majority was not present at either, whilst one of those who was present at both elections, and had divided in favor of <em>Smith, </em>was absent when the return was made, a peremptory <em>mandamus </em>ought not to have gone, until a feigned issue had been offered and rejected, as was done in <em>[Rex </em>v. <em>Barker </em>et al.] 3 <em>Burr. [1268.} </em>For,- it was but a decent respect due to the minority in a doubtful question of this kind, and where accident alone, perhaps, had produced the return: Because, if there had been a full Court, or if the absent Justice before spoken of had been present, instead of the other who was not at the elections, a very different return would possibly have been made. That it did not appear that the <em>mandamus </em>was served upon all the Justices of the Court, and yet all had an equal interest in the business. For which reason, the order of the District Court, directing that the <em>mandamus </em>should be served upon the members in Court only, was clearly wrong; because it was subjecting the decision to chance and accident. For, if there should have happened to have been a mere quorum' in Court, and that <em>quorum </em>had consisted of the members who voted for either of the candidates, the return would be according to their own opinions; which, it is not to be presumed, they would have changed after the decisions which they had made upon record relative to the elections. Of course, the only proper mode would have been, to have directed that all the Justices should be served; and, consequently, that the District Court had erred in the manner which they had prescribed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ap7l\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>Wickham </em>and <em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABp\">Contended, that there was an actual vacancy of the office at the time of <em>Dyer\u2019s </em>election; because, the resignation of <em>Hamilton </em>had been accepted by the Court, and was now complete by efflux of time. <em>[Rex </em>v. <em>The Mayor &amp;c. of Rippon,] </em>1 Salk. 433. That no set form of words was necessary to constitute a resignation, but that any thing tantamount was sufficient. Therefore, as <em>Hamilton </em>in this case had shewn a clear intention to divest himself of the office, it was enough. But, at all events, the return to the <em>mandamus </em>was conclusive. 3 <em>Blac. </em>Com. 111; <em>[Bagg\u2019s </em>Case, <em>11] Co. 99. </em>For, there was no ground for the supposed distinction between the person applying for the <em>mandamus </em>and <em>any </em>other person. That a feigned issue was not necessary,, in a case where the right was clear. That it did not appear that all the Justices were not served with the writ. But, it was not necessary that it should be. served upon all; for service on the sitting mernbers of the Court was sufficient, because they were to do the act.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
