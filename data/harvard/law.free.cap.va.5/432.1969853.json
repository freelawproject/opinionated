They also find a letter from <em>John Love, </em>one of the defendants, to the plaintiff, stating, that he is sorry he has. determined to sue him, instead of <em>Skinker. </em>That if the plaintiff would sue <em>Skinker, </em>the said <em>John Love </em>would give security, that if the money could not be made on the execution, that he the said <em>John Love </em>would pay it. That by suing <em>Skinker </em>in <em>Fauquier, </em>where he had large property, the plaintiff might immediately get judgment; and that he <em>John Love </em>would see to the business. That if this was refused, he should procrastinate the suit as long as he could. That a compliance on the part of the plaintiff would prevent trouble to the said <em>John Love </em>in recovering the money of <em>Skinker </em>afterwards. That, he did not consider himself bound to make extraordinary sacrifices for dischargingthis debt, under the circumstances of the case; and, therefore, if sued, should consult his own convenience in the payment, which he might be able to put off longer than <em>Skinker. </em>That if the plaintiff brought a suit against <em>Skinker, </em>that he <em>John Love, </em>gave him his honor he would endeavor to havejudgr ment got as soon as possible against <em>Skinker; </em>which he should consider as necessary for his own safety.
