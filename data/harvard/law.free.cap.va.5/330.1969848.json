Afterwards on the 6th day of <em>April, </em>1795, the parties by rule of Court, referred the cause to' the determination of <em>Bellfield </em>and <em>Brewer, </em>or their umpire, and agreed that the award shall be made the judgment of the Court. The order was, that the referees might proceed <em>ex parte, </em>if either side failed to attend after notice. In <em>April, </em>1796, the arbitrators returned their award, bearing date the 25th day of <em>March, </em>1796; wherein, after stating that due notice had been given, and that they had had the parties before them, and considered the exhibits and evidences produced, they awarded a balance due to <em>Kelly, </em>from <em>Mitchell, </em>of 203/. <em>7s. Id. </em>agreeably to an account thereto annexed. Which award was made the judgment of the Court on the 4th day of <em>April, </em>1796. From this judgment, <em>Mitchell </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-8\">The defendants filed a bill of exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion, stating, that he had moved to reject the award, for reasons stated in his affidavit, (which is annexed to the accounts furnished the defendant by the said <em>Brewer, </em>one of the arbitrators;) but, that the Court over-ruled the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-9\">The affidavit referred to, states that the defendant had received no notice from the plaintiff, to attend the arbitrators since the first of <em>September, </em>then last part; and, that the account thereto annexed, in the hand writing of the said <em>Breioer </em>was, by him, delivered to the defendant, some time in the said month of <em>September.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-10\">This affidavit bears date the 2d day of <em>April, </em>1796.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-11\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-12\">The award must lie a term for the party to except; for, otherwise, he would have no effectual opportunity of shew<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ing cause against it; because, the judgment would be final, and an execution might issue on it before the time, for making his exception, had expired. But, this would be plainly , contrary to the act of Assembly. <em>R. C. </em>54, [c. 114, \u00a7 2, p. 454, ed. 1819; c. 46, <em>Stat. Larg. </em>63.] The appellant offered a good exception to the award, and whether true or false, was not important, for he ought to have been allowed time to support it. Another notice should have been given to the appellant, after the copy of the account was furnished him. Therefore, although, there was no corruption in the arbitrators,-yet the word misbehaviour will embrace it. Because, not having given further time, when they were bound to do so, they did misbehave.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-4\">Warden, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-5\">The act of Assembly does not apply to the case; for, that was only intended for references before the commencement of a suit, and not for those which were made in the progress of a cause, without the forms and solemnities mentioned in the act. But, if it did, still there is no ground to impeach the judgment. For, the account was delivered to <em>Mitchell </em>by one of the arbitrators, in order that he might state his objections; which, he never did: and, therefore, the inference is, that he had none. The exception, made in Court, was not sustained by any evidence; and, if it had, the matter of it was not sufficient to delay the judgment: Especially, as no specific exception to the account was made either to the referees or the Court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-13\">[* See <em>Holcomb </em>v. Flournoy, 2 Call, the negative.] 433, in which, the point was settled in</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b355-7\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"AGx\">Delivered the resolution of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the District Court, entered upon an award made pursuant to a submission by order of Court, in a suit depending; and at issue. The judgment was moved for at the term the award was returned; and, opposed by the defendant, for want of due notice; which being over-ruled, he filed his exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The counsel here, has added another objection, that the judgment was entered too soon, in the term when the award -was returned; since the act of Assembly of 1789, [c. 46, 13 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>63,] relating to awards, allows the parties till the end of the next term, to make their objections.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Without deciding, whether the act extends to the present case a submission made in a suit depending? We are of opinion, that admitting it does, the privilege of time might and was waived by the defendant, in this case; he having brought forward his objections at an earlier period.</p>\n<p id=\"A5G\">As to the notice, the affidavit is equivocal: he says, that <em>Kelly </em>gave him no notice after the first of <em>September; </em>thereby implying, that he had given him notice before, and admitting that he might afterwards have had notice from the arbitrators. Which is the rather presumable, since he admits, that he received in that month <em>Kelly\u2019s </em>account from one of them; no doubt for some purpose; probably, for an opportunity to make objections to it; and, these the arbitrators waited for, until the month of <em>March </em>following. In which time, he may have made them; and, they may have been considered by the arbitrators: Who report, that upon due notice, they had heard the parties; had considered their exhibits and evidence; and, had made the award between them. He does not say, that he has any objection to the account or to the justice of the award; but, is quibbling in terms about the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">J udgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
