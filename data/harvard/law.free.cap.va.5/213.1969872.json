The declaration was in the common form of a declaration upon a bond for payment of money. Plea, <em>conditions performed, </em>and issue. The jury found a verdict in these words: \u201cWe of the jury find for the plaintiffs the debt in the declaration mentioned, to be discharged by the payment of <em>651. </em>11 y. <em>3d. </em>with interest from the 21st day of <em>February, </em>1775; if the Court shall be of opinion lhat an action of debt can be maintained by the plaintiffs in this Court in this cause, it being a three months\u2019replevy bond, taken under an execution on a judgment obtained in the County Court of <em>Halifax, </em>under an act of Assembly, entitled, an act, declaring the law concerning executions, and for relief of insolvent debtors, passed in the year 1748: but, if the Court shall be of a contrary opinion, we then find for the defendants. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-9\">The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiffs ; and the defendants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-10\">M\u2019Craw, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-11\">The executors had no remedy by motion under the act of Assembly; and, therefore, they were obliged to resort to an action upon the bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-12\"><em>Washington, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-13\">In several instances in this Court, it has been decided, I admit, that where a forthcoming or replevy bond was void as <em>a statutory </em>bond, that the obligee might, nevertheless, maintain an action at the common law, upon the bond. <em>Hewlett v. Chamberlayne, </em>[1 Wash. 367,] <em>Meriwether </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>[3 Call, 523,] and <em>Bibb </em>v. <em>Cawthorne, </em>[1 Wash. 91,] were of that kind. But where the bond is good as a statutory bond, the party must pursue the remedy by statute. <em>[Hollingworth </em>v. <em>Ascue, </em>] Cro. Eliz. 355. It is objected, however, that the executors could not sustain a motion on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the bond.
