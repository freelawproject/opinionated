In order to constitute usury, there must be a lending on one side, and a borrowing on the other. There must be a corrupt agreement on one side to take, and on the other to give, greater interest than the law allows. If the defendant had any relief, it was in a Court of Equity; where the unconscionable gain, if any, might have been corrected. That, however, is no question at present; but, the question is merely, whether the unreasonable profit, if it be so, was usury or not? In all these cases, the first enquiry is, if there be a loan ? I admit, that if a real loan is endeavoured to be covered under any disguise whatever, it is still usury. Here was no direct loan; and the question is, if there was any indirect lending ? If one goes to borrow, and the parties communicate about a loan, which at length terminates in a sale of property, at a price greatly beyond its value, it is usury; because, it is merely a scheme indirectly to avoid the statute. But, here was no borrowing, nor any communication about a loan; it was a fair sale of property, which the one party might make, and the other purchase. The case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>is no more than this; <em>Fristoe </em>says to the plaintiff, I have not money to pay you, but, if you will accept of property upon such terms as we can agree upon, I will discharge the debt immediately; <em>Gibson </em>consents, and got a bargain: -Now, although a Court <em>of </em>Chancery might relieve, if there were any undue advantage taken, yet the law cannot; because, there was neither a loan or a borrowing; without which there cannot be usury. <em>[Loyd </em>v. Williams,] 3 Wils. 261; <em>[Floyer </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>] Cowp. 112. Which last case, not only establishes the general principle, but goes further; for there more than five <em>per cent, </em>was taken, and justified merely upon the custom. <em>[Tanfield </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>] Cro. Eliz. 27; <em>[Murray </em>v. Harding,] 2 Wm. Black. Rep. 859, 3 Wils.. 390, S. C. All these cases prove the definition of usury to be, a corrupt agreement for greater interest than the law allows; and that there must be a borrowing and a lending. So that if one meant a loan, and the other notj there would be no usury: for, both minds must concur in the corrupt intention. Usury is odious, and not to be presumed; for, it occasions not only a loss, but a penalty. Therefore, it must be expressly proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-9\">The question then is, if the facts in this case amount to usury ? It is the case of a debtor not able to pay his debt in money, but offering to discharge it in property, and the creditor accepts the offer. I said offering property, for bonds are property; they do not in any manner differ from other property, but are every day bought and sold at market. So that if the plaintiff had not been a creditor, the purchase would have been clearly legal; and his being a creditor, does not make any difference at law. If <em>Fristoe </em>had given stock at a valuation,, though the value of - that is more easily ascertained, it would not have been usury. And where is the difference ? One is as much the subject of loan and purchase, as the other. Nothing like a loan is found in this case, whatever might have been the opinion of the jury; and I repeat it again, that, without a loan, there can be no usury. At the former argument, it was supposed that the liability of the assignor might affect the ease; but, I cannot see how. . For, suppose, instead of bonds, <em>Fristoe </em>had paid the debt with lands, and the title had afterwards been evicted, he would have been liable on his warranty, and yet that would not have turned the transaction into usury. But, the principle of that case is precisely like the other. The contrary argument goes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>length of establishing, that if a debtor, not having money* *s willing to discharge his debt in property, that the creditor dare not take it but at the full value; for, if he takes it at less, his conduct is corrupt, and he will be condemned for usury. So that, instead of the debtor\u2019s being able to facilitate his struggles, he will be obliged to submit to a suit and execution. For, his creditor cannot, without danger or loss, relieve his difficulties. Therefore, taking it as a question at law, there can be no doubt that it was not usury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2m\">But, even in Equity, the transaction could not be impeached. For there was no future responsibility on <em>Fristoe, </em>because the obligors were able at the time of the assignment, and it -is found that they have since actually paid the money. In addition to which, it appears that the transaction was in 1787; that the largest of the assigned bonds was not due until 1790; and that twelve or thirteen shillings in the pound was given for it: Which was a fair market price and more.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b84-8\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEt\">There was a surplus for which we were entitled to a credit; as the jury have said there was an excess. If <em>Fris.toe </em>had given the plaintiff the bonds to collect, and pay the debt, he would have been clearly liable for the excess; and if there be an assignment without more being said, the assignor would be entitled to the excess, as so much money received to his use. For, the Court will not intend that the assignor would relinquish such an interest, without compensation, or an express agreement to the contrary. But, if there be an excess coming to us, we had a right to insist upon it as\" a discount. So that, if the Court should ^e against us on the point of usury, a deduction to the amount of the excess should be made from the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-10\">But the transaction was clearly usurious. The act of Assembly annuls every contract where, more than lawful interest is reserved, whether the same be directly or indirectly, or by any shift, and this was plainly but a shift to elude the statute. Usury is a mixt question, both of law and fact'; and it is for the Court to .draw the conclusion from the facts found in the verdict; <em>i. </em>e. whether the facts stated, amount to usury or not. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Tremayne, </em>Cro. Jac. 508. Which case expressly proves, that it is not necessary for the verdict to find, in so many words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>that the agreement was corrupt; but that the Court may infer it from the facts. In our case, the facts found amount to usury; and, therefore, no communication of a loan or other technical language, was necessary to be stated. It is said, that usury is odious, and not to be presumed. But this is only where the words are equivocal; for, then a favorable interpretation will be made. . So, if there be a mistake, or if the contingency be doubtful. But if the facts stated amount to complete usury, and are not equivocal, then the transaction will be considered as usurious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-7\">The authorities cited by Mr. <em>Washington, </em>only prove that a loan is necessary: Which I admit. But those same books prove, that it is a loan whenever the money is to be certainly returned without any hazard. Here the plaintiff was certain of his money at all events; and, therefore, the case falls within the principle of those cases. In <em>Villars </em>v. <em>Cary, </em>6 Mod. '303, it is held that if there be a just debt due, and a bond be given for it with unlawful interest, it is usury; and the same principle may be collected from 12 <em>Mod. </em>385. This doctrine is our case expressly; for here the defendant was indebted, and gave a new bond: The case in <em>Cowp. </em>cited by Mr. <em>Washington, </em>shews that a shift will not do; and that every case of usury should stand upon its own ground. <em>Fristoe </em>got time for payment of the 106/. 17i. <em>2d. </em>sterling. Now suppose A. owes B. a sum of money, and pays it to him; who thereupon re-lends it to A. with more than lawful interest; this is usury. Suppose then instead of his own bond, the party gives one in which he was security by assignment, he is not indeed liable in the first instance, but he is ultimately liable, and so is within the same principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-11\">This practice is calculated to afford a cloak for usury; which may be secretly carried on to a great extent under pretense of discounts; and, therefore, the Court will view it with a jealous eye. It is said that it is like the case of a payment in lands with warranty, and that such a payment would not be usury. But this is the difference, that the warranty in that-case only obliges for the title, whereas the assignor of \u00e1 bond warrants not only that the bond is due, but that the obligor is able to pay; and, therefore, is ultimately liable for the money, if the obligor fails. Such a transaction as this, was expressly held to he usury in the case of <em>Massa </em>v. <em>Dauling, 2 </em>Stra. 1243; which was the case of an assignment of a note, and therefore is, in principle, precisely like the case before the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The decision that this is usury, will not affect the genera* question, whether one may not fairly purchase bonds at a discount; for, this rests on particular grounds: here was called for, threats used that the defendant should not remove till he had paid the debt, and an advantage attempted to be taken of <em>Fristoe; </em>which finally ends in bonds being given for more than tire debt. This was forcing the party to give more than lawful interest. As to <em>Fristoe\u2019s </em>acknowledgment, that the debt was just, it does not alter the case; for, it is only evidence of a fact, and other facts prove it was not for a just consideration.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-6\"><em>Washington, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATZ\">If the plea in bar is over-ruled, then the defendant has admitted, that he has no payments to offer, and is consequently estopped to insist upon them afterwards. Payments cannot be given in evidence on the=plea of usury; because they are not in issue. If the defendant meant to rely upon it, he should have pleaded doubly and inserted a plea of payment. But, if the plea of payment had been put in, the pretended discount could not have been insisted on. For, it is not the case, which Mr. Randolph supposes, of bonds put into the hands of the assignee to collect; but the whole contents are sold at a certain agreed value. The agreement is express, and does not admit of any presumption. The decision contended for, will affect all cases of the sale of bonds; and will make every purchaser liable for the surplus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-8\">It is admitted, that to constitute usury, there must be a loan; but here was none: there was no reservation of more than legal interest; but it was a fair purchase of property; in which, inadequacy of price will not constitute usury. The case in <em>Stra. </em>is so; and it was left to the jury in that case, whether it was a loan or a sale. According to the doctrine contended for, if a bill of exchange were paid at less than the current exchange, it would be usury. In short, the practice will destroy all accommodation between debtor and creditor; and put an end to payment in facilities altogether, however convenient to the parties. Suppose <em>Fristoe </em>had paid the whole debt in bonds at this value, then, according to- the doctrine, <em>Gibson </em>was guilty of usury, and an information would lie for it. There is a case in <em>Lutw. </em>101, which goes the whole length of deciding this; and proves very cleayly that the present transaction was not usurious.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pAW8\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\n<em>Randolph.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG4\">That case turned on the capacity to make \u25a0advantage; for the Judge says, there is a great difference between loss and gain. But, when the party who takes up, can\u2019t make gain, it is usury, or else the quotation from <em>Grotius </em>would be idle. The plaintiff, therefore, in order to have avoided the statute, should have shewn that <em>Fristoe </em>was to derive profit from the transaction; but the fact is, that he sustained positive loss. I was misunderstood upon the subject of the rate of bonds. If the seller does not make himself answerable for the money, it is not usury; but if he does, it is. In a transfer of stock, there is no future responsibility, and, therefore, no usury. So, if the owner of a bill of exchange delivers it over, without endorsement. But here, the assignor, according to the decision of this Court, is expressly liable; and, therefore, it is usury. Bonds in <em>England, </em>do not pass by assignment; and, therefore, no argument can be drawn from them. Promissory notes there, are more like bonds here; but no ease is produced, to shew that such transaction in the case of a note would not be usury there. Indeed, the cases are the other way.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pA5o\">\n<em>Washington.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-j\">The case in <em>Lutw. </em>proves, that you may even buy guineas at less than value; and why not bonds ? It is not material on which side the profit was; for, in usury, both are corrupt.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"pAbV\">ROANE, J\u00fcdge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag4\">At the first hearing of this cause, I was strongly inclined to think that the bond in question was usurious, even upon an <em>ex parte </em>argument, but now, upon a full discussion, and mature consideration, I am con-</p>\n<p id=\"A9_a\">firmed in that opinion. But, before I come particularly to the circumstances of the present case, as arising from the special verdict, I will lay down some principles, which appear to be clearly warranted by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">1st. If the corrupt agreement be not expressed in th\u00a9 verdict, but it is apparent to the Court that the matter is usury, there it is not necessary for the jury to shew that it was. corruptly made. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Tremayne; </em>Cro. Jac. 508; for, in the language of the case, <em>res ipsa </em>loquitur,</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">2d. That, where the intention of the contract is to get more than legal interest upon the- sum lent, it is usury ; unless the sum itself be put in risque. <em>[Jestons v. </em>Brooke,] Cowp. 797.</p>\n<p id=\"APR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>3d. But, that a slight contingency will not take a cofrtract out \u00b0f the statute, where the substance of the contract is a borrowing and a lending. <em>[Richards </em>v. <em>Brown,] </em>Cowp. 776.</p>\n<p id=\"AYk\">4th I hold it also to be a clear principle, that a corrupt forbearance of money <em>then due, </em>is as much within the statute as an original loan; and that, within the meaning of the statute, it is a loan. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">To test the present case, by the foregoing principles :</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">On the 17th day of <em>December, </em>1787, the defendant being indebted to the plaintiff by bond, on demand, in 443/. 11,?. 3 <em>d. </em>sterling, with interest from the first of <em>January, </em>1786 ; by agreement, assigned to the plaintiff certain bonds, amounting to 780/. currency, at the value of 382/. <em>8s. 2d. </em>sterling, and his own bond for <em>1491. </em>125 <em>Id. </em>currency, on account of the said debt. Which bonds, the jury find, exceeded the original debt and interest, by the sum of 244/. <em>12s. 7d. </em>currency; on the giving and assigning these bonds respectively, the plaintiff lent, or which is the same thing, forbore to demand the money originally due him; as to the sum for which the bond in <em>December </em>was given, until the first of <em>March, </em>1789, and as to much the greater part of the money due by the bonds assigned, until periods of time posterior to that of the transaction. The bonds so assigned, and the bond in <em>December, </em>are all of them bonds with sureties; whereas the bond, in lieu of which they were given, was a single bond; and as the jury find that the obligors in the bonds assigned were, at the time of the assignment, deemed of sufficient estate and property to discharge the same, I may safely affirm that the risque of losing the present money, as respects the ability of the obligors, was not increased, but rath\u00e9r lessened by the transaction now in question. It is also found; that the defendant, about the time of this transaction, intended to remove to <em>Kentucky. </em>Whence we may reasonably infer, that he was under a peculiar situation, which placed him much within the power of his creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Under the above principles, is this transaction usurious or not ?</p>\n<p id=\"ASx\">The money due, as' above stated, was, by this transaction, forborne to be demanded; and, in consideration there-one obligation was- given, and others assigned, the amount of which exceeded greatly the' principal and inte* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>rest really due. It is true,-the jury have not found the forbearance, in so many words ; but, they have found the agreement and the bond, in which the forbearance is contained, and that is the same thing. The money due by these obligors could, every shilling of it, have been recovered, supposing the question of usury out of the case, unless there had been an insolvency of tire obligors; and, in the case at bar, that is far less probable, than in the original bond. For, there are sureties to the bond on which the suit is brought, whereas that was a single bond, and the obligors, in the bonds assigned, are found to have been of sufficient ability. What then, upon the face of this transaction, could have induced the defendant to have acceded to the terms of this unrighteous accommodation, but the distress and duress under which he laboured ?</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">If it be said, that on the contingency of all the obligors in the original bond .being insolvent, then <em>Frist oe </em>could only be made responsible for the sum allowed as the value of the assigned bonds, upon the principle on which this Court went in the case of <em>Mackie\u2019s exr. </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>et al. <em>2 </em>Wash. 219, which sum, with the bond in discussion, is not more than was originally due: I answer, that the event</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">of their being insolvent, under all the circumstances, of this case, are too slight and remote a contingency to take the case out of the statute, according to the spirit of the decisions, upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">But we are to consider the ease, upon the bond only, for, if the agreement of the creditor is to get an illegal profit on money lent, every bond given in pursuance thereof, is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">In deciding this case, I go entirely upon the circumstances of the transaction in question, forming the terms, on which money was to be lent or forborne; and, therefore, it is entirely different, from a case of the sale of a bond, unconnected with a loan. For, in my mind, every cireumstance here, has considerable weight; especially the ability of the obligors, the additional sureties; and the defendants being about to remove to <em>Kentucky. </em>The decision of this case, therefore, will not affect other cases, where such circumstances are wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">I said, that the jury have found what is tantamount to finding a forbearance expressly; that is to say, they have found an agreement which shews a forbearance; and bonds given in pursuance thereof, payable in future, for a debt due by a bond on demand: And this being the case, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>may say, in the emphatieal terms of Lord Mansfield, [in <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Waller, 2 </em>Doug. 740,] that it is impossible to wink so hard, as not to see, that a borrowing and loan money was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\">But these bonds, it is said, were sold for their real value: I answer, that in ease of the solvency of the obligors, (of which there was no reason to doubt from the verdict,) the plaintiff, inasmuch as bonds form a certain measure of value, was sure of getting a sum exceeding that due, with interest by the sum of 244/. 12s. <em>Id. </em>currency, and the present sum not put in risque.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">But, indeed, putting bonds merely on the footing of chattels; I suppose that if, on an usurious .agreement for money, ahorse were set off at 25/., whereby to enhance the balance of the money borrowed, beyond what in justice it ought to be; and a bond given for the balance in pursuance of such agreement expressed, or which is the same thing, manifestly inferred from the circumstances of the transaction itself, that such bond would not be permitted to stand; but would be deemed usurious and void. For, where the intention is to- get an illegal profit upon money lent or forborne, the wit of man, as said by Lord Mansfield, [in <em>Floyer </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>1 Cowp. 114,] cannot devise a shift to evade the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">On every principle, therefore, this transaction is usurious, and the judgment of the District Court is right.</p>\n<author id=\"pALZ\">CARRINGTON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AOYC\">The case carries several marks of hardship along with it, all tending to shew, that the defendant was driven into an agreement to give more than the law has established, for a little longer indulgence from his creditor. For, none but a man pressed by the urgency of his affairs, would have consented to such an improvident bargain, and unusual sacrifice, as was made in the present case. Into whatever shape thrown, it was, strictly speaking, an engagement on the part of the plaintiff to receive, and of the defendant to allow greater gain, than that prescribed by the statute. In other words, it was a contract of forbearance, in consideration of more than the legal profit; both principal and profit being so well secured, that there was not the slightest danger of either being lost. There cannot be a doubt but this was usury; and, therefore, I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b90-7\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AF7\">The bond is good in form, but it is objected to,'as being given for an usurious consideration; be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>.cause, the assigned bonds and this together were for more than the original debt. In all findings by juries, nothing is to be presumed; for facts and not evidence of facts, must be found, which was well illustrated at the bar, by the case an action of trover and conversion; in which, if the verdict omits to find the conversion, it will not be presumed. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In the present case, the verdict does not find that the assigned bonds were transferred at more than the current value, and . if any presumption were to be admitted at all, it should rather be in favor of the plaintiff; who ought to be supposed to have acted rightly, until the contrary is shewn ; especially as the defendant acknowledged afterwards, that the debt was just, and it is a rule that fraud or corruption ought not to be presumed, neither does the verdict state any offer of further time for the balance on payment of the bonds ; and therefore, all argument upon that ground fails. So, that upon the verdict, it is really no more, than the ordinary case of a sale of bonds, which is not unlawful, according to the decision of this Court in the case of <em>Hunter\u2019s exrs. </em>v. <em>Hylton, </em>where the bonds were as well secured, as those in the present instance. If, then, it would not have been wrong in other persons, to have purchased them on those terms, why should it be in the plaintiff, when there was no communication for a loan or forbearance ? I confess I can see no reason for it; and therefore, cannot say that the agreement was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The intended removal to <em>Kentucky, </em>even if it had been imparted by- the defendant to the plaintiff, would not have altered the case; but if it would, still the jury have not found that the defendant told the plaintiff of his intention to go thither, or that there was any conversation between them concerning it; and therefore, no inference can be drawn from thence. The verdict does not state, that the defendant considered himself in the plaintiff\u2019s power, or that he was driven into any usurious engagement, by the terrors of his situation. Ought I then, as Judge sitting here to decide upon the facts presented to me in the verdict, to presume, what the jury with all the evidence before them have not thought proper to infer ? Especially, when the transaction bears another construction, namely, that the defendant being about to leave the State, meant to do justice before he went.</p>\n<p id=\"Ami\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>The plaintiffs conduct appears to have been fair throughouh n\u00b0t only during the transaction itself, but even after the suit was brought; for, the plea of payment was withdrawn by consent, which was fair and candid, and if presumptions were to be indulged, it would afford no slight evidence of his confidenc\u00e9 in the purity of the original negociation. But, I repeat it again, that presumptions ought not to be admitted at all.</p>\n<p id=\"AlK\">The jury might have found, if the evidence would have supported them in it, that the defendant was forced into the settlement, that there was an intention on the part of the plaintiff to make illegal gain, and that the bond was given in consideration of <em>forbearance </em>; but they having omitted to find these facts, I with less information of the transaction than they possessed, am not at liberty to infer them. The defendant surely, cannot expect me to be satisfied with less evidence, than would convince the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">It was said though, that the jury was not bound to find in words, that the agreement was corrupt or usurious. Be it so; but then they must find something equivalent to it. In the present case, they have not found any circumstance constituting a corrupt or illegal bargain; and yet I am called on to pronounce the transaction usurious, when not a single ingredient constituting usury, is contained in the verdict. For, the jury have not found, either that the defendant asked, or that the plaintiff offered a forbearance; they have not stated any corrupt motive, or design to make illegal profit from the distressed situation of the defendant; they have not said that the bonds were settled at less than the market value, or that the defendant was driven into the agreement by the exigency of his affairs, or the extortion of the plaintiff. But, without something of this kind, surely there can be no usury. Although goods sold for more than the Value, or property settled at less, may be usury according to the circumstances, yet those circumstances must be found. In the case of the goods, a prior communication for a loan, or something amounting to it must be stated; and in the ease of the property, the actual value should be found, with the forbearance and other circumstances tending to shew, that it was settled at less, with an usurious intention. Bonds actually due do not sell for the nominal amount; and much less those upon time. They fluctuate in value like corn, wheat, or any other article. So, that the purchase of them, for less than they express upon the face, may be perfectly innocent. I cannot, therefore, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>present case decide, that a transaction, unaccompanied with any unfair practice, is void; merely because the fendant has voluntarily made an improvident bargain, which has eventually proved beneficial to the plaintiff, whose conduct has not been impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">That the bonds were warranted to be due, don\u2019t alter the case; for, all sales are warranted; and perhaps the plaintiff could not have recovered of the defendant more than the value paid, in case there had been an insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Upon the whole, the least that could have been required, would be, that the verdict should have stated that the assigned bonds were rated below the market value; and that in consideration thereof, the bond on which the suit is brought, was given for forbearance of the balance; the most, therefore, that could be done for the defendant, would be to award a new trial in order to have the defects supplied. But I am for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">PENDLETON, President. I do not consider the verdict in the present case as uncertain, or objectionable as finding evidence instead of facts. The jury refer to the evidence indeed, but that is surplusage, since they find the facts, which are proved by that evidence. Usury is a question of law, and. the jury find in a clear and sensible manner, all the facts necessary to decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Mr. <em>Randolph\u2019s </em>first point maybe thrown out of the question, since if there was no usury, the bargain was to stand; and the bonds assigned at the value agreed on of 382f. 8s.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\"><em>2d. </em>sterling, leaves no excess to be set-off against the bond on which the suit] was brought. The supposed threat of the plaintiff not appearing to have been used at the agreement, if it was of any consequence, may also be laid aside, or balanced by the other, finding that the defendant acknowledged the debt to be just, when the writ Was served; which is equally unimportant, since he could no more sanctify the corrupt agreement, if it was one, by that acknowledgment, than he could by his original assent in making it.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">I proceed,- therefore, to the principal point.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">The legal principles on which questions of usury are to be decided, appear to me to be well settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">An agreement by which a man secures to himself, directly or indirectly, a higher premium than legal interest for the loan of money, or the\u00bb forbearance of a debt due (for, in reason and precedent, they stand on the same' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ground,) is usury. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But if the principal, or any consideraWe Part, be put in risque, it is not usury; because, the excess in the premium, is a consideration for that risque. So, if it be amere sale of property (andbonds<footnotemark>+</footnotemark> are as much property in this respect as any thing else,) although at an under value, it is not usury; because, price is a thing unfixed, and depends upon the convenience of the parties contracting.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">But, if the bargain proceeds from, and is connected with a treaty for the loan or forbearance of money, it is usury; because, the vendor is supposed to have submitted to a disadvantageous price, under the influence of that necessity, which the statute meant to protect him against.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">How do these principles apply to the present case on the special verdict ?</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The jury find that, on the bonds assigned, and the bond in suit, the plaintiff received 244/. <em>8s. Id. </em>more than the principal and interest, due on the bond, they were meant to discharge; and that no part of the principal was put in risque under the agreement, since they find that the obligors were deemed solvent at the time, and proved so' in event. The plaintiff\u2019s security was bettered too by the liability of the debtors in the bonds assigned, and the sureties to his new bond, instead of the defendant, being alone answerable on the old bond; and he still remained liable for the whole: So that there was no risque.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Then, was this a mere independent sale of the bonds, or connected with a proceeding, from a treaty for payment of part of a debt due, and forbearance of the residue ? It is apparently the latter; and, therefore, it differs from the case of <em>Hylton </em>v. <em>Hunter\u2019s ex\u2019rs. </em>which was a mere bargain for sale of bonds; and there was no prior treaty for borrowing or forbearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">For, what brought the parties together in the present case? It was not to treat of the sale and purchase of bonds, but of the debt existing between them. The bonds are offered as payment, and the plaintiff in his acceptance of them, imposes on the defendant terms, which secure to himself a profit beyond legal interest: and on these terms, as they make but a partial payment, he will give a further day for the balance; provided, the defendant will, to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>own obligation, add other security for it. These terms are accepted, and the bond in suit given in consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Under this view of the case, nothing can be more apparent to me, than that this agreement was entered into by the defendant, in order to procure forbearance of part of a debt due, and to avoid a suit for- the whole, and that it was not an independent sale. Which, if it had been, I should have adjudged it the proper business of a Court of Equity to enquire into its fairness or iniquity, and that it was not usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">I concur in affirming the judgment; and am authorised by the absent Judge to say, that he also concurred.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b88-9\">[* <em>Musgrove v.
