Nevertheless, the said defendant, though often requested, did not pay to the said <em>Cuthbert, </em>in his life-time, the aforesaid sum of money, or any part thereof, but the same to pay refused, and still refuses to pay the same to the plaintiffs, to the damage of the plaintiffs 300/., and therefore they bring suit, &amp;c.\u201d Plea, <em>conditions performed; </em>and the plaintiff took'issue. The suit was then referred; and after-wards, at a subsequent Court, the record proceeds thus: <em>el October, </em>1795, order reference set aside and continued.\u201d On the trial of the issue, the defendant filed a bill of exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion, which stated, that the plaintiffs offered in evidence to the jury an agreement in these words: \u201c Agreement between Mr. <em>John Hammitt </em>and <em>Cuthbert Bullett: Cuthbert Bullett </em>sells Mr. <em>Ham-mitt </em>lot number thirteen, in the town of <em>Newport, </em>with the improvements, for one hundred and twenty-five pounds, specie, payable with interest from the first day of <em>January, </em>on the first day of next <em>April, </em>and rents him both his ferries during the said <em>Bullett\u2019s </em>life, at fifteen pounds, specie, <em>per annum, </em>for the first four years, and after, during the remainder of the term, at the annual rent of twenty-five pounds <em>per annum; </em>the said <em>Bullett </em>is to have and retain the rent for the present year.

The breach laid is, that the defendant had not paid the aforesaid sum of money; without distinguishing, whether it was the 125/. only, or that sum with interest: and, therefore, the declaration in that respect is uncertain. The issue is taken on a plea of conditions performed, and the verdict is, that the plaintiff had not performed the conditions in the plaintiff\u2019s declation mentioned; which is senseless and immaterial, as there was nothing like a condition stated in the declaration; but, a charge founded on a positive stipulation; and therefore, the issue being immaterial, the judgment is erroneous. The order of reference appears to have been set aside, upon the motion of the plaintiff merely, and without any consent thereto obtained from the defendant; although no reason for this extraordinary interference appears on the record. This was an assumption of power which did not belong to the Court, who ought to have suffered the order of reference to stand until it was acted on; unless the parties had consented to rescind it, or some other proper cause had been shewn for their interposition. But, there is a further variance between the -writing produced and that declared on : For, the declaration is, that the defendant would pay, on <em>or before </em>the 1st day of <em>April, </em>whereas the agreement produced was, that the money was payable <em>with interest from the first day of January on the first day of next April. </em>Besides, the writing contains other stipulations, of which no notice is taken in the declaration; and, therefore it does not necessarily appear to be the same, on which the suit is brought. The judgment varies from the verdict; for, the latter finds damages only: whereas, the judgment is for the 125/. and the damages also.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b518-11\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"AIn\">Delivered the resolution of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s counsel seems to have thought, that as there was no penalty to cover the interest, it could not be recovered under the act of Assembly, although the interest was promised; but, could only be given in damages; and so declares for the debt, and lays his damages for nonpayment. Whether he was mistaken or not, is doubtful; though the practice is, to claim and recover the interest with the principal. Yet, since the defendant is not injured, but benefitted by the alteration, he has no right to complain of it as an error, if it be one.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Conditions performed, to a specialty for payment of money, amounts to the general issue of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\"><em>/Supersedeas </em>denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">[* <em>Smith </em>v.
