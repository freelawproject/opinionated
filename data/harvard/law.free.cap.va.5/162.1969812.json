And <em>E </em>Contra.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"0\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b186-3\">[Monday, <em>October </em>15, 1798.]</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b186-5\">If I. give a mortgage (in lands to B. &amp; Co. and then the agent of B. &amp; Co. and I. agree to convey to II. on his securing the mortgage money j after which, H. gives a deed of trust on sundry slaves, for that and other debts to a succeeding agent of B. &amp; Co., the 1st mortgage is discharged, though B. &amp; Co. never conveyed to II.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-6\">This was an appeal from a decree of the.High Court of Chancery, upon the following case: <em>Towler </em>filed a bill in Chancery against <em>Buchanans, Hastie Co. </em>merchants in <em>Glasgow; </em>which stated, that the lands in question were mortgaged to <em>Buchanans, Hastie fy Co. </em>by <em>Isbel. </em>That <em>Jameson, </em>the defendant\u2019s factor, and <em>Isbel, </em>afterwards agreed to convey them to <em>Hammond, </em>on his securing the mortgage money to he paid to the defendants, in four instalments. That afterwards <em>Jameson </em>left the factorship, and <em>Lindsey </em>succeeded him. That <em>Hammond </em>mortgaged six slaves to <em>Lindsey, </em>for this and another debt, and then sold the lands to <em>Lea, </em>who sold to <em>Towler; </em>and, the bill is brought to have <em>Isbel\u2019s </em>mortgage to the defendants delivered up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Avl\">The answer admits <em>Isbel\u2019s </em>mortgage, <em>Jameson </em>and <em>Isbel\u2019s </em>agreement with <em>Hammond, </em>and the mortgage to <em>Lindsey; </em>but, denies that the mortgage money has been paid, and, stating that <em>Hammond </em>is now insolvent, insists now upon the lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">The cross bill states the debt due to <em>Buchanans, Has-tie fy Co. </em>and another of <em>951. </em>due <em>Read, </em>for his undertaking to <em>Burwell; </em>for which, <em>Isbel </em>mortgaged the lands and four slaves. That <em>Jameson </em>and <em>Isbel, </em>entered into the aforesaid agreement with <em>Hammond, </em>to convey him the lands, when he should secure the payment of 225/. the amount of <em>Isbel\u2019s </em>mortgage; but, denies payment thereof, or that <em>Jameson </em>ever conveyed to <em>Hammond. </em>That <em>Hammond </em>being indebted on his account to <em>Buchanans, Hastie S\u00a1- Co. </em>to secure that debt, as well perhaps as an additional security for <em>Isbel\u2019s </em>debt, gave the mortgage for six negroes, which he has since carried off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-10\">A witness deposed that he heard <em>Towler </em>say, that he understood previous to his purchase, that the lands were mortgaged to <em>Buchanans, Hastie \u00a7\u25a0 Co. </em>That <em>Towler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>and he went to enquire of <em>Jameson; </em>to whom <em>Towler </em>shewed the deed for the six slaves, and asked, if they were not mortgaged to release the lands, who answered yes; and, that the land ought to be. cleared.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-4\">The purport of the \"agreement of <em>Jameson </em>and <em>Isbel </em>with <em>Hammond, </em>is only that they would convey on the money being paid or secured. There is in the record, the proceedings in an attachment by <em>Burt </em>for <em>Buchanans,</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-d\"><em>Hastie 8\u00a1' Co. </em>against <em>Hammond; </em>in which is an account stating <em>Hammond </em>to be debtor to <em>Buchanans, Has-tie fy Co. </em>in 156/. <em>19s 9d. </em>on his' own account, and 225/. <em>the agreed price for Isbel\u2019s land, </em>with a credit \u201cby further security taken on slaves by deed of trust.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">The Court of Chancery decreed, that <em>Towler\u2019s </em>bill against <em>Buchanans, Hastie fy Co. </em>should be dismissed; and, on the cross bill, that the lands should be sold to pay the mortgage money. From which decree, <em>Towler </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-7\"><em>Bonold, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-8\">Insisted, that the second deed for the six slaves was an execution of the agreement with <em>Jameson, </em>and, therefore, that the mortgage on the lands was discharged. That all the circumstances of the case proved this; and, consequently, that the decrees were erroneous.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-9\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2H\">The second deed does not appear to be made with intention to discharge the first. The answer does not admit it; and the circumstances plainly prove, that no such exoneration was intended by the parties. At any rate, the last does not destroy the first, unless the money was paid: for, it was but a mere contract of sale. <em>Buchanans, Hastie &amp; Co. </em>had a mortgage for market, which <em>Hammond </em>agreed to buy at a certain price, payable by instalments; but, he has neglected to do so, and, consequently, by the known rule of equity, the sellers have a lien until the purchase money is paid, <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Scot, </em>[2 Wash. 141,] in this Court. This is the stronger still, when the plaintiff, claiming with notice under <em>Hammond, </em>comes to call for a security, which, itself, is a lien on the estate, <em>[Hardwick </em>v. <em>Mynd,] </em>1 Anstr. Rep. 111. If the contest were with <em>Hammond </em>himself, there could be no doubt; and his derivative pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>chaser, both with implied and express notice, can be in no better situation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aku\"><em>Ronold, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-7\">The cases put are all of implied agreements, but here it was express.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b188-8\">\n<em>PER C UR.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AlH_\">The deed of trust from <em>Hammond </em>to <em>Lindsey, </em>of <em>March </em>the 28th, 1774, comprehending a security for the 225/. mentioned in the agreement of <em>October </em>27th, 1770, between <em>Isbel, Jameson </em>and <em>Hammond, </em>was a complete performance of the condition mentioned in the said agreement on the part of <em>Hammond; </em>and as such, appears to have been accepted by <em>Lindsey, </em>as agent for <em>Buchanans, Hastie fy Co. </em>Therefore, although <em>Hammond, </em>whilst the land remained in his possession, might hold it chargeable with any accidental deficiency in the new security, more especially if that deficiency was occasioned by his own fraudulent conduct: Nevertheless, as <em>Lea </em>was afterwards a fair purchaser of the land, without' other notice than what appeared from the several papers, which testified that the condition was performed, and the land exonerated; and this view of the papers confirmed by the proceedings of <em>Buchanans, Hastie fy Co. </em>upon the attachment in <em>Charlotte </em>County Court: He, and the appellants under him, have superior equity to the appellees; and a right to have the \u00e1greement of <em>Jameson </em>specifically performed by a release of the legal title claimed under <em>Isbel\u2019s </em>deed of trust. Consequently, the decree of the High Court of Chancery is to be reversed with costs; and a decree entered, for a release of all right to the land, under the deed from <em>Isbel </em>to Jameson.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
