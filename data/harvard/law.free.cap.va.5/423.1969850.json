Besides, the subject in controversy was not the same in both Courts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-9\"><em>Marshall, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-10\">The subject of controversy was precisely the same, in both suits; for, in both, the title to this land was in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-11\">As to the objection, that the parties were not the same in both Courts, there is no weight in it: Because, the rule is, that verdicts (and, therefore, I infer depositions,) may be given in evidence between privies, as assignees, descendants, or purchasers. So that I conceive, whenever the title is the same and comes from the same source, the deposition in one suit may be read in another. In this case, the plaintiff in the first suit was a purchaser under the plaintiff in this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-12\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-12\">[* See <em>Paynes </em>v. <em>Coles </em>et al, 1 Munf. 273; <em>Chapmans </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>1 Munf. 398, <em>Shelton </em>v, <em>Barbour, </em>2 Wash. 64; <em>Pegram </em>v. <em>Isabell, </em>2 H. &amp; M. 193.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"pAfX\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AOV\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that the depositions were not admissible, and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>that the judgment ought to be reversed. That if there be a recovery by verdict against tenant for life, this is no evidence against a reversioner. <em>Buller\u2019s N P. </em>232, <em>cites </em>Yelv. [23, <em>Brode </em>v. <em>Owen,] </em>and by parity of reasoning, the depositions in the present case ought not to have been read in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The judgment was as follows: \u201c The Court is of opinion that the said judgment is erroneous in this, that the said Court permitted the depositions of <em>Benjamin Scott </em>and <em>Anthony Perryman </em>taken in an action brought by the appellant <em>Rachel, </em>against one <em>Justice </em>Beadles, for a trespass supposed to have been committed by the said. <em>Beadies </em>on the premises now in dispute as stated in the bill of exceptions, filed in this suit, to be read in evidence on the trial against the appellant <em>John, </em>who was not a party in the action of trespass aforesaid, and does not claim or hold the said premises from or under the said <em>Rachel Rowe </em>or <em>Justice Beadles, </em>and who, not having had the liberty of cross-examining the said witnesses, should not be injured or bound by what he was not allowed to contest. Therefore, it is considered that the said judgment be reversed and annulled, and that the appellants recover against the appellee their costs by them expended in the prosecution of their appeal aforesaid here, and it is ordered, that the jurors\u2019 verdict be set aside, and a new trial be had in the cause, and that on such trial the said District Court do not permit the depositions aforesaid to be read in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
