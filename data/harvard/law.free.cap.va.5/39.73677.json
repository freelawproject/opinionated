The erroneous description of the boundaries in this deed, was owing to a mistake, common to both parties, into which they were led by the erroneous description of them in the deed from <em>John Trimble\u2019s </em>executors. <em>Keyton </em>lived near the lands, and was well acquainted with them: <em>Brawford </em>lived at some distance'from them, and had much less knowledge of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-4\">The 1000 dollars purchase money, which <em>Keyton </em>was to pay to <em>Brawford, </em>was payable in instalments; and some of the instalments were paid to <em>Brawford </em>in his lifetime.

That a considerable part of land held by <em>M\u2019Knight\u2019s </em>heirs, under the grants to him of April 1788, was included in the elder grants to <em>David </em>and <em>James Trimble </em>of October 1765 and March 1771; that <em>M\u2019Knight\u2019s </em>heirs had no title to so much of the land held under the junior grant to their ancestor, as was included in the elder grants to the <em>Trimbles, </em>and in the conveyances from <em>John Trimble\u2019s </em>executors to <em>David Steele </em>and <em>Brawford, </em>and from <em>Brawford </em>to <em>Keyton '; </em>and they claimed the same under the elder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>grants. 2. That it was the intention of <em>John Trimble </em>to devise, by his will made in 1783, all the lands which he inherited from his father James, which <em>James </em>bought from his brother <em>David, </em>and which <em>David </em>was entitled to under his grants of October 1765 and March 1771: that it was the intention of <em>Samuel Sleele </em>and <em>Susan </em>his wife, to sell and convey to <em>Brawford, </em>all their interest in the lands, devised by <em>John Trimble </em>to be sold, and the proceeds divided between <em>Susan </em>and <em>Agness Steele: </em>that it was the intention of <em>John Trimble\u2019s </em>executors, by their deed of October 1804, to convey to <em>David Steele </em>and <em>Brawford, </em>in undivided moieties, all the lands that had been owned by the <em>Trimbles, </em>and to which their testator was entitled, though that deed (through mistake, arising from the ignorance of the parties as to the true boundaries and title papers, the lands being then altogether in woods and unsettled, and the parties being misled by an erroneous survey) conveyed the lands by a very erroneous description of the boundaries: and that it was the intention of <em>Brawford </em>to sell and convey to <em>Keyton, </em>his undivided moiety in all the lands to which he and <em>David Steele\u2019s </em>heirs were justly entitled in common, though his deed to <em>Keyton </em>followed the mistaken and erroneous description of the boundaries contained in the deed from <em>Trimble\u2019s </em>executors of October 1804. And they prayed, that the mistakes in the description of the boundaries, in the deed from <em>Brawford </em>to Keyton, should be corrected, and that <em>Brawford\u2019s </em>heirs should be decreed to convey to <em>Keyton!s </em>heirs, <em>Brawford\u2019s </em>undivided moiety in the lands, according to the true boundaries thereof, as well those which had been actually held in possession by <em>David Steele </em>and <em>Brawford, </em>as what should be recovered from the heirs of <em>M\u2019Knight. </em>They did not expressly claim an abatement from the purchase money contracted to be paid by <em>Keyton </em>to Brawford, for any deficiency in quantity that might be discovered; but they asked an injunction, to restrain <em>Brawford\u2019s </em>executors from proceeding to recover the balance of the purchase money, until the just boundaries of the lands should be ascertained, and a perpetual in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>junction, in case the heirs of <em>M\u2019Knight </em>should succeed in holding any part of the lands intended to be sold by <em>Brawford, </em>to <em>Key ton. </em>3.

But <em>they </em>insisted, that their ancestor contracted to sell his undivided moiety in the lands to which he and <em>David Steele </em>were entitled in common, for 1000 in gross, whatever might be the true boundaries or quantities of these lands; that it was not the intention of <em>Brawford </em>to stell, or of <em>Keyton </em>to purchase, any of the land held by <em>M\u2019Knight; </em>and that they were entitled to the whole purchase money, without abatement on account of any conflicting claim of <em>M\u2019Knights </em>heirs; since <em>M\u2019Knight </em>was in possession of all the land he now claimed, at the time of <em>Brawford\u2019s </em>sale to <em>Keyton, </em>and this was well known to Keyton, who was also well acquainted with the lands, and the true and ancient boundaries by which they had in fact been held.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">It is unnecessary t\u00f3 the defence of <em>M\u2019Knight\u2019s </em>heirs; the chancellor, very early, dismissed the bill as to them, and the propriety of that decree hardly admitted of doubt. The only controversy was that between the heirs of <em>Keyton </em>and the heirs of <em>Brawford.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHD\">The deed from <em>Brawford </em>to <em>Keyton </em>described the lands as consisting of two parcels; one conveyed to <em>David Steele </em>and <em>Brawford </em>by <em>John Trimble\u2019s </em>executors, containing 325 acres, and the\" other conveyed to them by <em>M\u2019Knight </em>containing 18 acres; in all, 343 acres. By surveys, made under orders \u00f3f the chancellor, it appeared, that the land embraced within the boundaries .of the grant of 300 acres to <em>David Trimble </em>of October 1765, (according to the lines of that grant contended for by <em>Keyton\u2019s </em>heirs) exclusive of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the land held by <em>M'Knight </em>under his conflicting claim, , , ,,. _ . . 7 was only <em>271 </em>acres, and a hall; and that the parcel conveyed by <em>M'Knight </em>to <em>Steele </em>and <em>Brawford </em>was 19 acres and a quarter; in all, only 290 acres and three quarters; so that, as <em>Key ton:s </em>heirs alleged, there was a deficiency in quantity of 52 acres and a quarter. And as this 52 and a quarter acres was included within the boundaries described in the deed from <em>Brawford </em>to Keyton, and lost by reason of the conflicting claims of <em>'NBKnight, </em>therefore, at the hearing of the cause, they insisted on a rateable abatement from the purchase money for the deficiency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">But it also appeared from a survey filed with the bill, that there was another parcel of 78 acres lying contiguous to the tract of 290 acres and a half; which, whether it was parcel of <em>David Trimble's </em>lesser grant of 140 acres, or (more probably) of his inclusive survey of 430 acres, or by whatever right it was claimed, had been in fact held by <em>David Trimble, </em>by <em>James Trimble </em>under him, by <em>John Trimble </em>heir at law of James, by <em>David Steele </em>and <em>Brawford, </em>and by <em>Steele's </em>heirs and <em>Keyton </em>after his purchase from <em>Brawford. </em>Counting these 78 acres (and <em>Brawford\u2019s </em>heirs insisted they ought to be counted) as part of the lands sold by <em>Brawford </em>to <em>Keyton, </em>the whole quantity was above 368 acres. But <em>Keyton </em>obtained a grant from the commonwealth for the 78 acres; and his heirs claimed that parcel under that grant, though there was parol evidence which rendered it very probable, that <em>Keyton </em>himself had considered it as part of the land he bought of <em>Brawford, </em>and obtained the commonwealth\u2019s grant for it only to perfect the title.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">The chancellor, by his decree, first settled the boundaries of the lands to which <em>Keyton\u2019s </em>heirs were entitled, under his purchase from <em>Brawford, </em>by reference to the surveys: and then declaring, that, as the boundaries described in the deed from <em>John Trimble\u2019s </em>executors to <em>Steele </em>and <em>Braio</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>ford, </em>were, acknowledgedly, wholly erroneous, owing to the ignorance of the parties as to the actual boundaries; as the boundaries in <em>Brawford\u2019s </em>deed <em>to Keyton </em>were also erroneous, being founded on the previous mistakes in the deed from <em>Trimble\u2019s </em>executors; and as the bill itself alleged these mistakes, accounted for them, and prayed the correction of them; therefore, the heirs of <em>Brawford </em>were not liable for any land embraced within the mistaken boundaries described.by their ancestor\u2019s deed to <em>Keyton, </em>and not included within the true lines as ascertained <em>and </em>established by the court; and, therefore, he dismissed the bill as to <em>Brawford\u2019s </em>heirs, with costs.

I am well satisfied, that there is no such ground for relief in this case, because the vendor never contemplated gelling that portion of land, which lies within the boundaries claimed by the <em>M\u2019Knights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">It sufficiently appears, that the dispute between <em>David </em>and <em>James Trimble </em>and <em>George M\u2019Knight, </em>which was the subject of the suit brought by <em>M\u2019Knight </em>against them in the general court in 1773, was compromised by the agreement between <em>M\u2019Knight </em>and <em>John Trimble </em>of May 1781. {Here the president stated the circumstances on which he founded his opinion on this point). Thenceforth, ever since, the parties have held by the lines as settled by that compromise ; and from that time, the grant to <em>David Trimble </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>October 1765, must be taken to have been limited by those lines; for this court has decided, that the agreed boundaries between parties shall be sacredly respected, as the real and true boundaries of their lands, whatever evidence may be offered to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Such being the established boundary of <em>Trim,ble\u2019s </em>grant, we are told by the bill, that it was the object of <em>John Trimble\u2019s </em>executors, in 1804, to convey to <em>Steele </em>and <em>Brawford, </em>all the land which <em>David Trimble </em>had owned &amp;c.; that <em>Keyton </em>purchased <em>Brawford\u2019s </em>moiety of the land so conveyed, and that <em>Brawford </em>intended to convey such moiety; but that <em>the </em>land was altogether in woods, when the deed was made by <em>Trimble\u2019s </em>executors to <em>Steele </em>and Brawford, the boundaries and title papers were in a great measure unknown to the parties, and thus the description of the boundaries in that deed, was altogether erroneous. Now, it is true, that the bill does not expressly assign the embracing of <em>M\u2019Knight\u2019s </em>lands in the courses of the deed, as one of the errors committed; but they shew, that the parties were in a state of ignorance as to the boundaries, which led to the mistaken description; and it is now ascertained, that their grossest mistake was in comprehending lands which had, more than twenty years before, been given up as not within their boundary. I am, therefore, well satisfied, that the deed from <em>Trimble\u2019s </em>executors to <em>Steele </em>and Brawford, and that from <em>Brawford </em>to <em>Keyton, </em>are both erroneous, in this particular; and as <em>Key lords </em>representatives come here <em>to </em>ask equity, they must submit to the correction of that error; and the rather, if <em>Keyton </em>was well acquainted with the title, and had the deed prepared which was afterwards executed by <em>Brawford </em>and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The next ground on which relief is asked, is the alleged deficiency in the quantity of the land sold. This depends upon the question, whether the sale was in gross or by the acre; for if it was a contract of hazard, in which each party took upon himself the risk of excess or deficiency, there can be no relief afforded to either, whatever may be the actual quantity in the tract sold.</p>\n<p id=\"AH8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Questions of this character have frequently been before this court, and nothing is better established than the law of the subject, when the real intention of the parties in the contract, is once ascertained. But this intention it is sometimes difficult to discover, from the carelessness of the parties, from the use of equivocal expressions, and from the glosses which are given to the transaction by the testimony of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Before going into an examination of the probable intention of the parties, in this case, I shall premise a few remarks on the subject. Contracts of hazard, such as those we are now considering, never have been discountenanced by our law. Where they are clearly established, they are valid, and will be respected and enforced, if fair and reasonable. But, though such a contract of hazard is valid, it is not readily to be presumed, that the parties designed to enter into such a contract, unless it is clearly sustained by the facts. The courts will not favor such a construction; but they will rather take it, that a contract is by the acre, whenever it does not clearly appear, that the land was sold <em>by the tract, </em>and not by the acre; <em>Hundley </em>v. Lyons, 5 Munf. 342. Nor will they presume, that an executor, who ought not to sell in gross, has done so, unless the fact be clearly established; <em>Jolliffe </em>v. <em>Hite, </em>1 Call 301. Nor do I think it should be readily presumed, that a vendee, who is ignorant of the lines and of the quantity of land, would enter into such a contract of hazard with the vendor, who may fairly be supposed to know every thing about it: since, in such a contract, the hazard is only on one side.</p>\n<p id=\"AQE\">In the present case the deed itself and the circumstances, afford the only evidence of the character of this purchase. The deed is for a moiety of two tracts of land, the first con--tabling 325 acres, and the second containing 18 acres. Whether the specification of the number of acres here, should be regarded merely as matter of description, or in the stronger light of a warranty of quantity, may well, perhaps, admit of a difference of opinion. I have looked upon such mention of quantity, as, in general, matter of description only, and not of itself as giving the character of a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>by the acre to the transaction. I am satisfied, that such a thing is rarely dreamed of by those who execute deeds, usually filled up according to a formula, without the slightest reference to the real contract of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In the present case, the circumstances are very strong to shew a purchase in gross, instead of by the acre. The presumption against a vendee\u2019s being willing to make such purchase, is rebutted by the fact, that <em>Keyton </em>was himself interested in the estate, and probably knew as much or more of it than <em>Brawford. </em>The tract was in woods and unsettled : its lines were unascertained, and but little known to the contracting parties: the value by the acre was small: no previous attempt was made to ascertain the lines or quantity, and no provision for a survey, preparatory to a final adjustment of the purchase money, though the parties were very uninformed about the land: the conveyance was of 325 acres instead of 300, as set forth in the grant under which the land was claimed; whence I infer that an estimate of quantity was made between the parties, in the deed from <em>Trimble's </em>executors, and adopted by <em>Keyton </em>and <em>Brawford: </em>the price by the acre is not stated, but a round sum of 1000 dollars given for this body of unsettled land:\u2014 these facts all go to satisfy me, that <em>Keyton </em>took the risk of the purchase on himself. In 1 Call 325. president <em>Pendleton </em>speaking of <em>Quesnel </em>v. <em>Woodlief </em>says, <em>\u201c </em>the original contract, there, was not in proof, but it is evident to me, that it was for a specific quantity, since the purchase money amounts to 800 acres at \u00a3 4. <em>per acre? </em>The converse of the proposition may not be equally conclusive; but it is persuasive evidence, that a contract was not by the acre, when the purchase money is not an equimultiple of the number of acres. What for instance was the price <em>per acre </em>of this purchase, if the contract was by the acre <em>1 </em>It would be 5 dollars 83 cents, and <em>thirty-one three hundred and forty-third parts of a cent. </em>If an addition to the tracts described as 325 and 18 acres, he really did get also from <em>Brawford, </em>the 78 acres which have been re-entered, it seems very probable, that he bought the whole of these various claims and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>interests, such as they were, for the gross and lumping sum 1000 dollars, without any intention of being responsible for excess above the quantity represented in the deed, or any hope of remuneration for deficiency. When to this we add the frame of the bill, which does not go for an alleged deficiency, and the late date at which it was filed, namely, in June 1818, five years after the purchase, we may very well doubt, whether <em>Keyton </em>himself or his heirs ever conceived, that <em>Branford </em>was responsible for a deficiency, or that it was necessary to have a survey of the land, before it could be ascertained what sum would be due for the purchase money. Their objept was to get the land held by <em>M\u2019Knight, </em>or to be paid for the loss of it, as <em>Branford\u2019s </em>deed had comprehended it by mistake: and it is not until after those points are decided against them, that they set up the new (and, I think, incompatible) claim, that this was a contract for a specific quantity of land. I think the decree ought to be afiirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The other jndges .concnrred, Decr.ee afiirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
