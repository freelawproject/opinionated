It was proved that there was such a partnership between them, as the plaintiffs alleged; and that <em>Powell, </em>being the agent of the plaintiffs, had paid the rent due <em>Mrs. Crawford </em>and the overseer\u2019s wages, out of the plaintiffs\u2019 funds, by giving them cr edit, respectively, in their accounts with <em>Higginbotham Sp Co. </em>for the sums due them from <em>Brown Sp Powell; </em>but the entries of these payments were made on tKe plaintiffs\u2019 books by <em>Powell\u2019s </em>directions, after the dissolution of the partnership of <em>Brown Sp Powell. </em>It appeared also, that <em>Mrs. Crawford </em>was indebted to <em>Brown </em>individually, about 42 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-8\">The chancellor decreed, that <em>Robertson </em>executor of <em>Brown, </em>should pay the plaintiffs 316 dollars, with interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>&amp;,c. out of the assets of his testator; from which decree <em>Robertson </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ASq\">Garland, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ARbv\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b605-7\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AuQ\">The only question of any difficulty in this case, I think, is as to the existence of the partnership; and I am of opinion, that the evidence sufficiently establishes it. Partnership is \u201ca contract between two or more persons for joining together their money, goods, labour and skill, or either or all of them, upon an agreement to divide the gain or loss proportionably between them.\u201d Wats. on Partn. 1. It is not confined to mercantile speculations or adventures, but may exist between mechanics, attorneys, carriers or <em>farmers. Coope </em>v. Eyre, 1 H. Black. 37. Its existence is established by proof of an actual community of interest, accompanied by an agreement to participate in the profits, and contribute to the losses of the concern. Such proof places beyond question the liability of the partner; but even without it, a party may be charged as partner, where ho appears and exhibits himself to the world, as a person connected with the partnership, and as forming a component member of the firm. In this case, however, I do not think the evidence fixes upon <em>Brown </em>the character of a <em>nominal </em>partner; that is, of one who, without an interest in the concern, allows his name to be used, and holds himself out t.o the world as having an apparent interest. It must be admitted, I think, that <em>Brown </em>is not chargeable, unless such an <em>actual interest </em>can he shewn in him, as constitutes a partnership; for as to the loose declarations and opinions of witnesses, that he was always considered a partner, they are to be very cautiously received, because of the danger of establishing so important a contract upon so weak a foundation. However, <em>Brown\u2019s </em>interest is proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">To establish it, it must be shewn, that the parties have joined together their money, goods, labour or skill, or either or all of them, upon an agreement to participate in the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>fits, from which is also <em>implied </em>by law a liability for the losses; for no stipulation can protect a party who receives the profits, from a corresponding responsibility for losses. <em>Ex parte Hamper, 17 </em>Ves. 412. I think it cannot be doubted, that these parties did join together their property, labour and skill. The defendant acknowledges, that <em>Brown </em>told him, \u201che placed under the management of <em>Powell </em>a certain number of hands.\u201d Here, then, was an union of the property of <em>Brown </em>with the management of <em>Poto ell. </em>Moreover, they were placed on a farm, of which <em>Powell </em>was the lessee. He thus brought into the concern his skill and labour, and his lease also, and <em>Brown </em>brought in his slaves. It is proved, that <em>Brotan, </em>in speaking of these transactions, recognized the partnership,in the farm; and the overseer deposes, that <em>Brown </em>took an interest in the farm, which justified the belief that he was a partner; that he frequently visited it, and inquired about its progress, and as the witness thinks, said, in his presence, that he was in partnership with <em>Powell </em>in the farm. With this testimony, I do not perceive how we can question the fact that there was an union of the property on the one hand, and of property and attention on the other, between these two parties; and this too, with a distinct admission by each, of the power of the other over the affairs of the concern; for <em>Brown </em>admitted that he had placed his hands under the management of Powelland <em>Powell </em>has abundantly admitted <em>Brown's </em>interest, and, of course, his powers as a partner. It is, indeed, worthy of remark, that <em>Brown </em>did not tell the defendant <em>Robertson, </em>that he had <em>hired </em>his slaves to <em>Powell, </em>but that he had put them under his <em>management. </em>This implies, that <em>he </em>also still retained control over them. If he did so, it must either have been as partner, which is the matter to be proved, or as owner, in which case his liability would be unquestionable, as <em>Powell, </em>in this view, would be only his agent. Then, was there an agreement to participate in the profits <em>1 </em>This is, in effect, admitted ; for <em>Brown </em>told the defendant <em>Robertson, </em>that he was to receive <em>two thirds of the nett proceeds of the crop, deducting all expenses. </em>Now, the profits wore precisely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the nett proceeds of crop, after deducting all expenses; therefore, he was to receive two thirds of the profits. If he had bargained to receive two thirds of the crop, without regard to the expenses, some doubt, perhaps, might be thrown over the question ; but as the expenses were first to be deducted, it is obvious that he was not only to participate in profits, but to be affected by losses; for if the expenses exceeded the crops, he was to get nothing. Moreover, being thus entitled to profits, and a fleeted by losses, he could not limit or contract that liability, so as to affect third persons. For, even if it had been expressly agreed, that he should not be affected with losses, farther than the whole amount of the crop, that agreement would not have absolved him from a further liability, so far as third persons were concerned. Gow on Partn. 19. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">If there was a partnership in this case, I think the decree is manifestly right. It is objected, indeed, that <em>Mrs. Crawford\u2019s </em>rent was not properly chargeable against the partnership. I cannot think so. By the agreement, <em>Brawn </em>was to have two thirds, deducting all expenses. The rent under the lease was <em>one </em>of those expenses. By the agreement, then, the rent was to be paid out of the crops of the concern. The lease was brought into the concern by <em>Powell. </em>Though he was the original renter, yet when he formed the partnership, the lease was in effect assigned to the partnership. Admitting the partnership, this is obvious; and if so, then, as assignees, the partners were liable to the lessor. <em>Powell </em>was no longer the tenant, but <em>Powell </em>Brown, as partners, were tenants; and as terre-tenants they were responsible for the rent, and it has been properly charged against the firm, by <em>Higginbotham &lt;Sp Co. </em>who paid it. In this aspect, it is perfectly unimportant, <em>when </em>the entry was made, since the partnership was liable for the amount. The same remark applies to the wages of the overseer, which being a fair charge against the firm, it was entirely unimportant when the entry was made. Both debts were due either to <em>Mrs. Crawford, </em>and the overseer, or to <em>Higginbotham Co. </em>who had paid them; and as <em>Higginbotham, </em>cf- <em>Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>paid them by direction of one of the firm of <em>Brown f Poioell,</em>though after its dissolution, it cannot be regarded as an officious payment. For until the affairs of a partnership are settled, and outstanding engagements are made good, the partnership must in legal contemplation have a continuance, so-far at least as respects winding them up. Gow 312. [287]. 15 Ves. 226, 7. 16 Ves. 57. 1 Swanst. 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">As to the 42 dollars due from <em>Mrs. Crawford </em>to <em>Brown, </em>it is obvious that he could not have set off this debt <em>at law, </em>even against her. But whether he could do so or not <em>in \u25a0equity, </em>I am of opinion, that as <em>Higginbotham f Co. </em>at the instance of <em>Powell, </em>paid off the whole 170 dollars to <em>Mrs. Crawford, they </em>are not liable to the set-off at law or in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">I do not perceive, that <em>Powell\u2019s </em>being the agent of <em>Higginbotham cf Co. </em>makes any difference in the case.' As their agent he bound them, indeed, by his acts, and therefore they cannot now gainsay the credits to <em>Mrs. Crawford </em>and the overseer, though they should lose the amount. But he was also partner of <em>Brown, </em>and when he took up goods for the firm, or paid debts of the firm out of <em>Higginbotham f Co.\u2019s </em>funds, he was certainly acting for himself and partner, and the firm is chargeable accordingly. Upon the whole I am of opinion, that there is no error in the decree and that it must be in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The other judges concurred. Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
