The declaration was in the usual form, averring that the slave belonged of right to Moore, and that he had sustained damages by reason of the marshal\u2019s sale to the amount of 300 dollars; and assigning as the breach of the condition of the bond, that the defendants had ftiiled and refused to pay him the damages. The suit abated as to <em>Long. </em>The defendants <em>Morla.it </em>and <em>Kroesen </em>took <em>oyer </em>of the bond and condition, and pleaded <em>conditions performed; </em>on which an issue was made up. Upon the trial, the defendants filed a demurrer to evidence, setting out the evidence at large, which was, in substance, thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-4\">The plaintiff gave in evidence, 1. an absolute bill of sale executed by <em>Long </em>to Moore, dated the 30th March 1824, whereby <em>Long, </em>in consideration of 200 dollars paid him by <em>Moore, </em>conveyed to him the slave <em>Sarah, </em>described as being about fourteen years old at the time. 2. The testimony of a witness, that he was requested by <em>Moore, </em>about the end of the year 1824, to call on <em>Morlati (one </em>of <em>the </em>defendants) and request him to surrender possession of the slave; that the witness did so; and <em>Morlati </em>admitted, that he had hired the slave from <em>Long </em>from the commencement of 1824, and that the time for which he had hired her, was expired, and said, that <em>Moore </em>might have his slave whenever he pleased; but the witness departed without reclaiming possession of the slave, leaving her in <em>Morlatis </em>possession. The witness also testified, that <em>Moore </em>forbad the sale of the slave, on the day of the sale made by the marshal. 3. The testimony of another witness, that he as deputy sheriff of <em>Berkeley, </em>had a claim against <em>Long </em>for taxes, but he did not remember the amount or the year for which the taxes were due: that he thought he had a lien on the slave in question, for the taxes: that <em>Moore, </em>in conversation with him, claimed the slave, on certain terms, that is, on paying the taxes, which he promised to pay, but never did: that <em>Moore </em>said, \u201c that <em>Long had a right to redeem the </em>slave <em>at any time, on </em>pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ing him <em>(Moore) </em>the money\u201d\u2014or <em>\u201c </em>that he <em>could </em>redeem the slave at any time on paying the money\u201d\u2014the witness thought <em>Moore </em>used, both those expressions; but the witness could not say, whether or no, <em>Moore </em>meant, that such was the understanding at the time of the sale from <em>Long </em>to him: that, at the time of those conversations of <em>Moore, </em>the slave was in <em>Morlatt\u2019s </em>possession; but the witness did not remember, whether the conversations took place before or after the date of <em>Long\u2019s </em>bill of sale to <em>Moore: </em>that the witness distrained the slave, then in <em>Morlatt\u2019s </em>possession, for the taxes; yet he did not proceed to make sale of the property, but directed <em>Morlatt </em>to retain the possession till the taxes should be paid; and <em>Morlatt </em>did keep possession, till the slave was taken in execution by the marshal of the court of chancery, which was in August 1825 : and that the witness received the taxes due him from the marshal, out of the proceeds of the sale made by him. And 4. it was admitted, that the slave was sold at the marshal\u2019s sale, for 233 dollars. And this being all the evidence, the defendants demurred thereto, and the plaintiff joined in the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-4\">The jury found for the plaintiff, 233 dollars, with interest from the 5th August 1825, subject to the opinion of the court upon the demurrer to evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">The court at the next term, having declared its opinion that the law upon the demurrer was for the plaintiff, and being about to give him judgment for the penalty of the bond, to be discharged by the damages assessed by the jury, the defendant <em>Kroesen, </em>then, laid before the court, a bond executed by <em>Moore </em>to <em>Long, </em>of the same date with <em>Long\u2019s </em>bill of sale of the slave to <em>Moore, </em>namely, the 30th March 1824, in the penalty of 400 dollars, with the following collateral condition: <em>\u201c </em>The condition of the above obligation is such, that whereas the above bound <em>Moore </em>did buy a certain negro girl named <em>Sarah, </em>aged about <em>fourteen </em>years, of the said <em>Long, </em>for which the said <em>Moore </em>gave 200 dollars, the receipt of the said <em>Long </em>for which will appear in his bill of sale to the said <em>Moore </em>for the said girl, dated the 30th March 1824, which said girl the said. <em>Moore </em>binds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>himself to deliver to the said <em>Long </em>or his order, on the 1st April 1825, on the said <em>Long\u2019s </em>paying the said <em>Moore </em>the sum of 200 dollars, with legal interest from the 30th March 1824; now if the said <em>Moore </em>shall well and truly deliver to the said <em>Long </em>the aforesaid girl on receiving the aforesaid sum with its interest, then this obligation to be void.\u201d And <em>Kroesen </em>offered to prove, that this instrument was genuine ; and to prove by his own affidavit, that he first came to a knowledge of the existence of the instrument after the term at which the cause was tried, and the demurrer to evidence entered. And thereupon he moved the court to set aside the verdict, and order a <em>venire de novo. </em>But the court overruled the motion, and ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiff; and at the instance of <em>Kroesen\u2019s </em>counsel ordered the matter of the motion to be stated in the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\"><em>Kroesen </em>appealed from the judgment to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-6\">Leigh, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b457-8\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AxqJ\">Two questions were raised, and well argued, in this case, 1. Whether the circuit court decided correctly on the demurrer to evidence? 2. Whether the court ought to have ordered a <em>venire de novo, </em>upon the new evidence laid before it by <em>Kroesen ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The question on the demurrer is, whether the plaintiff, or rather <em>Moore </em>the relator, produced evidence from which a jury might reasonably draw the conclusion, that the slave in question was his property ? He produced a bill of sale of her to him, admitted to have been executed by <em>Long, </em>dated the 30th March 1824. He proved, that the girl was then in <em>Morlatfs </em>possession, having been hired to him for that year; that at the end of the year, he by his agent demanded the girl of <em>Morlatt, </em>who admitted his right to her, and said he might take her, but did not deliver her up. He proved also by a deputy sheriff, who had a claim on <em>Long </em>for taxes, that <em>Moore </em>claimed her as his property, but said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>Long </em>could redeem her at any time by paying him the \u00ab money. This was all the evidence which is material. It seems to me, that a jury might without impeachment either of their, understanding or their honesty, have drawn from it the conclusion, that the slave was <em>the property of Moore. </em>The bill of sale was strong proof. It stated the girl to be about fourteen years old, and the price 200 dollars cash. Unless this was considered fraudulent, or that the facts proved it a mortgage, it would seem to be conclusive. As to fraud, I see no badge of that, except that possession did not follow the sale; and this a jury might thiuk satisfactorily explained by the fact, that the girl was then in the possession of <em>Morlatt </em>who had hired her, and that so soon as his hiring ended, <em>Moore </em>demanded her. Then, did the evidence prove this a mortgage ? There is nothing that looks that way, except the declaration of <em>Moore, </em>that <em>Long </em>had \u201c a right to redeem, or <em>could </em>redeem, the slave at any time by paying him the money.\u201d The witness says he did not know, whether <em>Moore </em>meant that such was <em>the </em>understanding at the time of the sale, or not; and a jury, feeling the same doubt, might well have decided, that such a declaration ought not to destroy the effect of a bill of sale under seal, absolute upon its face, and purporting to be for a fair and adequate price paid in hand. Upon the demurrer, therefore, I cannot say that the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">But the more important question remains: Did the court err in refusing a <em>venire de </em>novo, upon the new evidence? This evidence consisted of a bond of <em>Moore </em>to <em>Long, </em>with a condition, that whereas <em>Moore </em>had on the same day bought the negro girl of <em>Long </em>about fourteen years old, for which he had paid him 200 dollars, <em>Moore </em>should deliver her to <em>Long </em>on the 1st April 1825, upon <em>Long\u2019s </em>paying him the sum of 200 dollars with interest from 30th March 1824, the date of the bond. I shall take it for granted, that the excuse tendered for not producing this bond at an earlier date, was sufficient. The bond bears equal date with the bill of sale, and manifestly forms a part of that transaction. What character does it give to it ? Does it prove it a mortgage, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>a conditional sale <em>1 </em>Upon this point, I think, rests the ques-1 1 ' ' <em>1 </em>tion whether the court erred or not, in refusing the new trial, That there is a difference between mortgages and conditional sales, both reason and authority tell us. In mortgages the estate is at all times redeemable, until a foreclosure passes, or a dereliction is presumed from length of time. In conditional sales, the time of performing the condition must be strictly observed. \u201c It must often happen in disquisitions of this sort\u201d (says president Pendleton, in <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Campbell &amp; Wheeler, 2 </em>Call 429.), <em>\u201c </em>that there will be difficulty in drawing the line between those two sorts of conveyance. The great desideratum, which this court has made the ground of their decision, is, whether the purpose of the parties was to treat of a purchase, the value of the commodity contemplated, and the price fixed ? Or whether the object was the loan of money, and a security or pledge for the repayment, intended <em>1 </em>The former was the case in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Turner; </em>the latter in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Norvell. </em>In the case before us, looking into the bill of sale, the defeasance and the demurrer to evidence, we find no evidence shewing any proposition for a loan of money, and the taking security for its return. The bill of sale is in the common form. The defeasance calls it a sale: its language is, <em>\u201c </em>whereas the said <em>Moore </em>did <em>buy </em>a negro girl &amp;c. for which he gave 200 dollars &amp;c.\u201d And <em>Moords </em>declaration about the power to redeem, stated in the demurrer, being made before the twelve months given for the repayment of the <em>200 </em>dollars had elapsed, may, without much straining, be referred to that privilege. Certainly, it proves nothing like a loan of money and security for its return. Again, where nothing but a loan and security are intended, the sum lent ordinarily bears no proportion to the subject pledged; because neither party contemplates the price and value of the subject, or its changing hands. The lender wants ample security, such as no change of times or circumstances can affect: the borrower has no reason to object to this, because he knows he can at any time redeem, by paying the actual sum borrowed with its interest. But where a sale is intended, though a conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>one, the value of the commodity is contemplated, and the price fixed. So in the case before us, the girl was considered to be worth 200 dollars, and that price was given; a price which seems to have been fairly adequate to the value of the commodity; for in March 1824, when <em>sold by Long to </em>Moore, she was about fourteen years old; and in August 1825, she was sold by the marshal for 233 dollars. But further, there is no proof in the cause that shews the slightest obligation on <em>Long </em>to repay the 200 dollars. The bill of sale certainly imports no such obligation, for that speaks simply of a sale out and out. The defeasance does not, for that is a bond executed by Moore, binding himself to return the slave, if <em>Long </em>on 1st April 1825, should pay the 200 dollars with interest: it gives <em>Long </em>the privilege, but imposes no obligation. So <em>Moore\u2019s </em>declaration was, that <em>Long </em>could redeem by repaying the money, not that he was bound to repay. Hence, it is evident that <em>Moore </em>risked the life of the slave: \u25a0 if she had died the next day, <em>Moore\u2019s </em>200 dollars were gone, for <em>Long </em>in that case would never choose to exercise his privilege. This is a most important consideration, in fixing and applying to particular cases, the distinction between mortgages, where the party may redeem in twenty years, and conditional sales, where the time fixed must be observed. President <em>Pendleton, </em>in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Call 293. says, with his usual force and clearness, <em>\u201c </em>the reason for holding vendors to this strictness in conditional sales, applies with every degree of weight to the case of slaves in this country. They are a perishable property, and may die the next day: if they should not, however, and are males, they may be very profitable, or if females, they may by their children increase .the stock. Now, can it be imagined, that any vendor could be so warped by interest, as to suppose, he might lie by until, in event, the men had earned profits greatly exceeding the principal and interest, or the women borne several children, and then expect to perform the condition, when the purchaser had all the meantime risked their lives? If there be such a vendor, I am sure he will receive no countenance from a court of equity.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>It was suggested that the stipulation for <em>interest </em>on the 200 dollars during the twelve months, evinces that this was a loan of money, and that the interest in addition to the profits was exorbitant. I think not: it was an open stipulation on the face of the bond, leaving it perfectly optional with <em>Long </em>to pay the money or not; and it will hardly be deemed exorbitant, when it is considered that the slave was hired out for nine of the twelve months; that, during this time, the vendee risked her life, while the vendor received her hire, which hire, for these nine months, would exceed the twelve months interest on the 200 dollars. There are several cases in our books on this subject. <em>Chapman </em>v. Turner, <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(before mentioned), <em>Robertas adm'r </em>v. Cocke, 1 Rand. 121. And comparing this case with those, and taking the distinctions laid down in them all, I feel well satisfied, that this must be pronounced a conditional sale. The case of <em>Conway\u2019s ex'ors </em>v. <em>Alexander, 7 </em>Cranch 218. is also a very strong one upon this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Taking this as a conditional sale, ought the court to have granted a new trial ? This is a motion always addressed to the sound discretion of the court; and, unless it is satisfied, that the justice of the case requires it, it will not send the parties to another trial. If this was a conditional sale, it became absolute, and discharged of all condition, after the 1st April 1825. The slave was then the absolute property of Moore, and the execution was not levied on her by the marshal, till the August afterwards. I think the court, under this view of the subject, was right in refusing the new trial. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b461-7\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Avo\">If there was any doubt, on the demurrer to evidence, whether this was a conditional sale or not, that doubt is entirely removed by the evidence produced on the motion for a new trial, which clearly proves, that the transaction was a conditional sale and not a mortgage. I concur, that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"ALv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"An7\">I concur in the opinion, that <em>Moore\u2019s </em>agreement of the 30th March, 1824, shews that the contract was a conditional sale by <em>Long </em>to him; and that <em>Long </em>not having complied with the condition, his right was forever concluded. Therefore, whether the judgment on the demurrer to evidence was right or not, as the document produced on the motion for a new trial, clearly proves the right of Moore, the new trial ought not to have been granted: the verdict and judgment are according to the right of the case. I am also of opinion, that there was a sufficient possession in <em>Moore. </em>Until the expiration of the year\u2019s hiring, no actual possession could have been taken by him; and immediately on the expiration of it, possession was demanded, and <em>Morlatt </em>no longer holding under <em>Long, </em>and assenting to deliver up the slave at any moment to <em>Moore, </em>his possession from that time was <em>Moore\u2019s </em>possession. At least, it was not <em>Long\u2019s ; </em>and so the- possession was not left with the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
