That, before <em>Wilson\u2019s elegit </em>was sued, the comptroller of the treasury of the <em>U. States </em>issued a warrant against <em>M\u2019Cally, </em>dated the 23rd February 1822; but, though the case agreed stated that the warrant -was set out <em>in lime verba, </em>the warrant was not, in fact, in the record: (it was, doubtless, a warrant of distress issued from the treasury against <em>M\u2019Cally, </em>for a debt due the <em>U. States, </em>under the second section of the act of congress of the 15th May 1820, providing for the better organization of the treasury department, 3 Story\u2019s dig. laws U. S. 1792). That, on the 12th July 1824, the marshal of the <em>U. States </em>for the western district of <em>Virginia, </em>under authority of the comptroller of the treasury, made sale of all the lands that had been extended under <em>Wilson\u2019s elegit </em>and the inquisition thereon taken, at which sale the agent of the treasury became the purchaser for the benefit of the <em>U. States, </em>and the marshal conveyed the same to the <em>U. States. </em>That the lands and lots remained in the occupation of <em>M\u2019Cally </em>and those claiming under him, until November 1825, when they were rented out, in pursuance of an order of the district court of the <em>U. Stales </em>held at <em>Clarksburg, </em>made in a suit there pending, between the <em>U. States </em>and <em>M\u2019Cally </em>and others, touching the title of the <em>U. States </em>to the lands claimed under the purchase from the marshal; in which suit, <em>Wilson </em>the plaintiff here was a party defendant, claiming the lands under his <em>elegit </em>and inquisition. And that, in that suit, in the district court of the <em>U. Stales, </em>no final decree had been made determining the rights of the parties, but an interlocutory decree had been made, directing the property to be sold, and the proceeds of sale to be brought into court to abide its further order. The question referred to the court, was, whether, upon this state of facts, the plaintiff was entitled to recover in this action <em>?</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-6\">The circuit court gave judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-3\">No counsel for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ADU\">Brockenbrotjgi-i, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ABJ\">Several questions have been raised in this case. Was the levy of <em>Wilson's elegit on M? Catty\u2019s </em>lands, and the delivery to him by the sheriff of one moiety of the lands at a reasonable extent, a satisfaction of the debt ? and if so, was <em>Jackson, </em>the warrantor of the debt, thereby discharged from all liability ?</p>\n<p id=\"AFF\">The case of <em>Crawley </em>v. <em>Lidgeat, </em>Cro. Jac. 338. is a strong authority on the point. There, <em>Bate </em>and <em>Crawley </em>had been jointly and severally <em>bound; </em>judgment had been recovered against <em>Bate, </em>for \u00a3 150. and an <em>elegit </em>sued out, and levied on his goods and lands; his goods to the value of \u00a3 10. were taken in part satisfaction, and a moiety of his lands, to the value of \u00a3 20. delivered to the creditor, in extent ; the plaintiff had also obtained judgment against <em>Crawley, </em>and sued out a <em>ca. sa. </em>against <em>him; </em>from which <em>Crawley </em>sought relief by <em>audita querela: </em>and <em>Coke, </em>O. J. said, the reasons yielded in the books, are, that after an <em>elegit </em>taken, the plaintiff shall not have a <em>capias; </em>that the taking of the land in extent for the debt, is, in judgment of law, <em>as if he had taken a lease for years in satisfaction of the debt; </em>and if he had taken satisfaction of the one, he never should take execution against the other: and the whole court thereupon decided that the execution against the body of <em>Crawley </em>was not well taken, and that he should be discharged. If such be the law as to joint and several obligors, who may each be sued at the same time, it is at least equally applicable to the case now before the court. <em>Jackson </em>was only collaterally bound: he guarantied that <em>the </em>debt should be paid by <em>M\u2019Cally. </em>I waive the inquiry, whether the creditor was bound to proceed, in the first place, against the principal debtor: here, he selected his own remedy, and did so proceed. He chose to have delivered to him a moiety of the lands of the principal debtor, on an extent, for the debt, and his taking it is, according to the decision just cited, as if he had taken a lease for years in satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>faction. I am of opinion, that <em>Jackson, </em>the warrantor in this case, has at least as much right, as <em>Crawley </em>the joint and several obligor, to claim his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"AJl\">If the plaintiff should be evicted of the lands held by him by virtue of the extent, then by express provision of our statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 134. \u00a7 4. p. 257. he may take out any other execution; or he may, I presume, hold the defendant <em>Jackson </em>liable on his warranty. In this case, there has not been, as yet, any eviction; it being expressly agreed, that there was no <em>final </em>decree in the suit depending in the federal court at <em>Clarksburg, </em>deciding the rights of the different claimants to the land. That court may yet decree in <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">It is stated, in the case agreed, that the actual possession of the land was not conferred on the plaintiff by the levy; and it is urged, that this <em>legal </em>possession is no satisfaction of the debt. On this point, however, the authorities are explicit and conclusive. In <em>Puller\u2019s Ni. Pri. </em>104. it is said, that an extent gives only a possession in law, and will not enable a sheriff to use force which may be necessary for the delivery of an actual possession: that a tenant by <em>elegit </em>has such an estate, that he may demise it to a plaintiff in ejectment: and the author shews what proof it will be necessary for him to produce, to maintain his ejectment; namely, a copy of the judgment, of the writ of <em>elegit, </em>and of the inquisition and return. And in 2 Wms. Saund. 69. c. note 3. <em>Williams </em>says, that it was formerly the practice for the sheriff to deliver <em>actual </em>possession of a moiety of the lands, but he now only delivers <em>legal </em>possession, and in order to obtain <em>actual </em>possession, the plaintiff must proceed by ejectment. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>3 T. R. 295. <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>Addison 203, <em>M\u2019Dougal </em>v. <em>Sitcher, 2 </em>Johns. Rep. 42. 2 Wils. Bac. Abr. Execution. C. 2. p. 711. The reason why the sheriff is not required to give more than <em>legal </em>possession, is, that he may be compelled to use <em>force, </em>and that would endanger the public peace. The plaintiff, therefore, who elects to have the moiety of the lands at reasonable extent, must be contented to resort to the peace<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ful remedy of ejectment, to obtain the actual possession. But, although he takes only the legal possession, he takes it in satisfaction of the debt; and that satisfaction begins to be effectual, I presume, as soon as by the obtention of the actual p0ssessi0n; he is let in to the pernancy of the profits. If, without any default of his own, he should fail to recover, in ejectment, the moiety of the lands of which the sheriff gave him the legal possession, I incline to think, that, upon the equity of the statute, he might then hold the warrantor liable, he being thereby deprived of actual satisfaction as much as if he had been evicted. But that point is not presented in this case, and I give no opinion upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The last ground on which the appellant\u2019s counsel proposes to reverse this judgment, is, that the case agreed is so imperfect that no judgment can be founded on it. The imperfection alleged consists in the omission to set out in the record, the warrant of distress issued by the comptroller of the <em>U. States, </em>and to state the date when it was served on <em>M'Catty, </em>or levied on the land. But of what avail, would that finding be, if inserted in the record? The greatest effect that could possibly be given to it, would be, that it operated as a <em>lien </em>on the land of <em>M\u2019Catty. </em>The act of congress authorizing this distress warrant declares, that the amount due by the debtor shall be a <em>lien </em>on his lands from the date of a levy in pursuance of the warrant, and a record thereof made in the clerk\u2019s office. Now, the effect of a levy of the warrant being only to create a <em>lien, </em>and not to divest the possession of the land, the plaintiff <em>Wilson </em>might well elect to have the land extended, subject to the incumbrance of the treasury hen: he might choose to take it with that hen, as well as to take it burdened with a mortgage, deed of trust, or any other incumbrance. I therefore think, that the imperfection of the case agreed is no ground for reversal; and, on the whole, I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b126-6\">Carr, <em>J</em></author>\n<p id=\"AWn\">It was admitted, in the argument, that before the statute 32 Hen. 8. ch. 5. from which the provision in our statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 134. \u00a7 4. was taken, the levy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>return of an <em>elegit </em>was a satisfaction, and precluded the plaintiff from any further remedy: but it was said, that that statute has changed the nature and effect of the writ. I cannot assent to this proposition. The <em>elegit </em>was given by the statute of West. 2. under which the construction was, that an eviction of the land did not give the tenant any right to resort again to his debtor; and the statute of Hen. 8. merely corrected this injustice, thus far, that if tenant by <em>elegit </em>was evicted, he might, by a <em>scire </em>facias, have another <em>elegit; </em>but it went no further. Except in the single case of eviction, the levy of the <em>elegit </em>was as absolute a satisfaction as before. Even where there was an eviction of all but a single acre, the tenant had no other remedy, than holding that, till he was paid. That this is the law under the statute, there are numerous cases to shew: they are collected in the note 2 Wms. Saund. 68. c. The case of <em>Crawley </em>v. Lidgeat, Cro. Jac. 338. is directly in point. Our statute is a copy of that of 32 Hen. 8. with this amendment, that it does not confine the party to another elegit, but permits him to take out any execution: yet there must be an eviction, by judgment, of the land delivered to him, before he can in any way resort again to his debtor. Has there been an eviction here <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The case is defectively stated in the case agreed; but enough is stated, to enable us to decide the point. The warrant of the comptroller of the treasury is stated to have been issued on the 23rd February 1822, but it is not in the record, nor does it appear when it was served. But I do not consider this material; because no such service could amount to an eviction, or change the property in the land, even if made prior to the levy of the <em>elegit. </em>The land still continued the property of the debtor, subject to the <em>elegit; </em>which being levied, the plaintiff must hold until there shall be a final judgment of a competent tribunal, condemning the land under the <em>lien, </em>which, by the act of congress, the service of the warrant of distress is said to create. Until such an eviction wrought, the tenant by <em>elegit </em>could never resort again to his original debtor, and still less to Jackson, who was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>surety. It is stated, in the case agreed, that the suit in the federal court was still pending, and that <em>Wilson </em>was a party to it, claiming the land under his <em>elegit; </em>and that court may finally decide, that his claim is the best, or it may turn ou^ tpe proceeds of the land may suffice to discharge both debts; in either of which cases, <em>Wilson </em>will get satisfaction of his claim out of <em>M'Califs </em>property. If he were now allowed to go against Jackson, the warrantor of the debt, he might get a double satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">It was said, that <em>Wilson </em>having no other possession than that which the inquest and return of the sheriff gave him, cannot be said to have been in, under the <em>elegit. </em>But all the cases contradict this idea. The sheriff never delivers actual possession. The party must bring ejectment, in all cases, if possession be held by another; yet, in all the cases, the return of the sheriff is considered as a satisfaction of the debt, unless the party be evicted. If he does not choose to enforce his rights, it is his own <em>laches, </em>and he can gain no advantage from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Brooke, <em>J </em>concurred. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
