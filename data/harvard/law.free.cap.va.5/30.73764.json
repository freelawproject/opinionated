Dillard, </em>however, continued to hold the bond till it was past due; and on the 27th August 1821, <em>Feazle </em>became <em>Dillard\u2019s </em>surety in a bond to <em>Burd </em>for 363 dollars, payable the 27th February 1822. About the same time that <em>Feazle </em>thus became <em>Dillard\u2019s </em>surety in the bond to <em>Burd, Feazle\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Dillard </em>was assigned by <em>Dillard </em>to <em>Campbell, </em>as an indemnity to him for suretyships to a much larger amount which he had incurred for <em>Dillard; </em>but <em>Feazle </em>had no notice of this assignment of his bond to <em>Campbell, </em>when he joined <em>Dillard </em>as his surety in the bond to <em>Burd; </em>the first notice that <em>Feazle </em>had of the assignment was in November 1821. At the time of the assignment of <em>Feazle\u2019s </em>bond by <em>Dillard </em>to <em>Campbell, Feazle </em>was aclmowledgedly entitled to credits for payments to <em>Dillard, </em>to the amount of 704 dollars. <em>Dillard </em>had then become embarrassed, and shortly afterwards, he took the oath of insolvency, and left the state. <em>Campbell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the assignee, brought a suit on <em>Feazle\u2019s </em>bond assigned to <em>\\\u00fam\\&gt;y Dillard, </em>and recovered judgment at law. And <em>Burd </em>had brought a suit against <em>Dillard </em>and <em>Feazle </em>on their bond to him for 363 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ANb\">But before <em>Burd </em>recovered judgment, <em>Feazle </em>exhibited his bill, in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Lynchburg, </em>against <em>Dillard </em>and <em>Campbell, </em>wherein he set forth the facts above stated, and insisted that ho was entitled, in equity, to set-off the amount for which he was bound as surety for <em>Dillard </em>in the bond to <em>Burd; </em>first, on the general ground, that he had incurred that responsibility for <em>Dillard </em>before notice of <em>Dillard!s </em>assignment of his own bond to <em>Campbell, </em>and tha,t <em>Dillard </em>was now insolvent; and secondly, on the special ground, that before he consented to become <em>Dillard!s </em>surety in the bond to <em>Burd, </em>being aware of <em>Dillard\u2019s </em>embarrassments, he stipulated, and <em>Dillard </em>agreed, that if he should bo compelled to pay the debt to <em>Burd, </em>the amount thereof should be credited to him against his own bond to <em>Dillard; </em>an agreement verbal, at first, ho alleged, but afterwards reduced to writing, which was exhibited with the bill. And he prayed an injunction to restrain <em>Campbell </em>from executing his judgment for so much as he was bound to pay as <em>Dillard\u2019s </em>surety to <em>Burd. </em>The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-5\"><em>Campbell, </em>in his answer, controverted the allegations of the bill, as to the special agreement between <em>Dillard </em>and <em>Feazle, </em>for the allowance of a credit to the latter for the amount of the debt due to Burd, in case <em>Feazle </em>should be compelled to pa.y the same; and he alleged, that in April 1822, he and <em>Dillard </em>went together to <em>Feazle\u2019s </em>house, in order to have a settlement of the credits to which <em>Feazle </em>was entitled on his bond to <em>Dillard, </em>then held by <em>Campbell; </em>that <em>Feazle </em>and <em>Dillard </em>referred the settlement between them as to those credits, to <em>William Otey, </em>who made the settlement accordingly, in the presence of all the parties, and ascertained the amount of credits to be 731 dollars, and indorsed the same on the bond; in which, however, there was an over credit of 27 dollars allowed by mistake, as was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>afterwards discovered, but as <em>Otey\u2019s </em>award was final, the mistake had never been corrected: that,, at that settlement, <em>Feazle </em>mentioned his suretyship for <em>Dillard </em>to <em>Burd, </em>and proposed to take on himself the payment of that debt, and to take credit on his own bond for the amount, but <em>Dillard </em>refused to allow such credit, and denied that he had ever agreed to allow it; and that it was expressly agreed between the parties, that that settlement, so made by <em>Otey, </em>should be final.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-3\"><em>Dillard, </em>having left the state, was proceeded against as an absent defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZP\"><em>Otey </em>was twice examined as a witness. In his first deposition (taken when <em>Feazle </em>was not present) he said, he was requested by <em>Feazle, Dillard </em>and <em>Campbell, </em>to meet them at <em>Dillard\u2019s </em>house, in April 1822, for the purpose of settling the accounts between the parties, touching the credits claimed by <em>Feazle </em>against his bond to <em>Dillard </em>assigned to <em>Campbell; </em>that he and the parties met there accordingly, and the settlement was made; that it was his impression, that all the credits were then allowed, and <em>Dillard </em>and <em>Feazle </em>tboth expressed their satisfaction with the settlement, with the exception of one claim for a credit, which <em>Feazle </em>required should be entered on the bond, namely, a credit on account of his suretyship for <em>Dillard\u2019s </em>debt to <em>Burd, </em>and which <em>Dillard </em>positively refused to allow, <em>saying he had never agreed to allow such credit against Feazle\u2019s bond to him, and in this Feazle at that time acquiesced; </em>that it was the witness\u2019s understanding, that the balance due on <em>Feazle\u2019s </em>bond, after allowing the credits, as then adjusted, and indorsed on the bond by the witness, was to be paid to <em>Campbell </em>the assignee; and that there was a credit for above 20 dollars allowed, to which <em>Feazle </em>was not justly entitled, but having been inadvertently admitted, both parties agreed it should remain, as the settlement was a final one respecting the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-5\">In <em>Otey\u2019s </em>second deposition, in answer to interrogatories put by <em>Feazle, </em>he said, that he was requested by <em>Dillard, Feazle </em>and <em>Campbell, </em>to settle the accounts between <em>Dil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>lard </em>and <em>Feazle, </em>and <em>to enter the credits, </em>to which <em>Feazle </em>was entitled on the bond, <em>at the time of the settlement, </em>namely, in April 1822\u2014that <em>Feazle </em>claimed a credit for the amount of the bond due to <em>Burd </em>[that in which <em>Feazle </em>was surety for <em>Dillard\\ </em>which <em>Dillard </em>refused to allow, <em>alleging that it was time enough to claim a credit for the same, when Feazle should have paid the money as surety.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-4\">In pursuance of the settlement made by <em>Oley, Dillard </em>indorsed a credit on <em>Feazl\u00e9s </em>bond, for 731 dollars, under date of the 1st April 1822, when the settlement was made. And there was a paper exhibited by <em>Feazle </em>with his bill, bearing the same date of the 1st April 1822, purporting to be an agreement signed by <em>Dillard, </em>in which <em>Dillard </em>agreed, that if <em>Feazle </em>should have to discharge the bond in which he was jointly bound with <em>Dillard </em>to <em>Burd, </em>and on which suit had been brought, then <em>Feazle </em>should have a credit on his bond to <em>Dillard </em>due the 10th January 1820. But there was no proof of the execution of this paper; and <em>Otey, </em>in his deposition, said he had no recollection of any such agreement being executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\">Pending the suit, <em>Burd </em>recovered a judgment against <em>Dillard </em>and <em>Feazle, </em>and sued out execution for principal, interest and costs, amounting to 429 dollars, which <em>Feazle </em>was compelled to pay: and this was the sum which he claimed, in this suit, to have set-off against the judgment which <em>Campbell </em>as assignee of <em>Dillard </em>had recovered against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-8\">The chancellor, on the hearing, dissolved the injunction which he had previously awarded to <em>Feazle, </em>and dismissed the bill with costs; from which decree <em>Feazle </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-9\">In the argument of the cause here, by <em>Leigh </em>for the appellant, and <em>Johnson </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMT\">the latter endeavoured to maintain, as a general proposition, that, having respect to the date of the assignment of <em>Feazl\u00e9s </em>bond by <em>Dillard </em>to <em>Campbell, </em>(namely, November 1821, when notice of the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>signment was given to <em>Feazle), Feazle </em>had no just claim, in equity any more than at law, to have the amount of the bond for which he was surety for <em>Dillard </em>to <em>Burd, </em>and which was not due till February 1822, discounted against his bond to <em>Dillard, </em>assigned to <em>Campbell, </em>upon which the debt had become due in January 1820, or to any relief in equity on account of that responsibility for Dillard, even as against <em>Dillard, </em>if he had still held the bond, much more against <em>Campbell </em>his assignee. But the argument at the bar turned chiefly upon the effect of <em>Oteifs </em>evidence upon the case; as to which there was (as will be seen) a diversity of opinion on the bench.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b54-9\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AHI\">If this case depended solely upon the general principles of the law as to assignees, I should have no difficulty in reversing the decree. Nothing is better established, than that an assignee takes the obligation assigned to him subject to the same equity that affected it in the hands of the obligee. This was the doctrine of courts of equity anteriour to our statute (Chan. Ca. 232. 2 Vern. 428. 692. 765.), and the statute has, in this respect, made no alteration; for it was not intended to abridge the rights of the obligor, nor to enlarge those of the assignee. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>2 Wash. 248. <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Richeson, </em>4 Rand. 266. The statute merely had the effect of enabling the assignee to sue in his own name, instead of leaving him as at common law, under the embarrassments arising out of a suit for his benefit in the name of the obligee. The same construction has been given to the <em>Pennsylvania </em>statute in <em>pari materia; Wheeler </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>1 Dall. 23. If, therefore, the appellant could, in equity, have arrested the recovery of the amount of his bond by <em>Dillard, </em>the obligee, he has equal equity against <em>Campbell, </em>unless he has waived or forfeited it by his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">The counsel, apparently aware of this, contended that <em>Feazle </em>would not have been entitled to injoin the recovery of the bond by <em>Dillard </em>himself. I cannot think so. That a bond not due cannot be used as a set-off at law, is very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>true; and it seems to have been supposed, that if the bond attempted to be set-off, was not due when the assigned bond became due, it could not be set up against tire assignee, at law. <em>Stewart </em>v. Anderson, 6 Cranch 203. See also <em>Hankey </em>v. Smith, 3 T. R. 507. in note. Be this as it may, it affords no ground for the opinion, that a bond not yet due, cannot be the subject of set-off <em>in </em>equity, whatever may be the circumstances. In a naked case, where there is no reason to apprehend insolvency, it would by no means follow, that instead of paying what I owe to my creditor to-day, I should set-off against it what he may on a different transaction owe me twelve months hence. For as money is sometimes worth more than its interest, and the payment of it when due is often of vital importance to the creditor, the rebate or discount of interest may bo a poor compensation for the loss of prompt payment. On the other hand, if I owe an insolvent man 100 dollars, and I hold his bond for the same sum payable a week hence, neither equity nor good sense would demand, that 1 should pay my money to him, with the certainty of losing that which is due from him to me. The insolvency constitutes a new ingredient in the case, and upon the principle of the bill <em>quia </em>timet, a court of equity will retain in my hands what I owe, for my indemnity, unless my adversary will secure me by some other satisfactory indemnity. Nothing is more common, I think, than the application of this principle to cases in equity. It is extended so far as to justify the suspension of the payment of purchase money, where there is an incumbrance upon the land purchased, Sugd. Law Vend. ch. 9. \u00a7 6. p. 345<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and with us, even upon proof of better title in a third person to part of the land, although there has not been, and possibly never may be, an eviction, and of course the demand is both unliquidated and uncertain; <em>Ralston </em>v. <em>Mil</em>ler, 3 Rand. 4,4. Nor have I ever before heard a doubt suggested of the propriety of injoining the recovery of a judgment, when the plaintiff at law was insolvent, and was debtor to the defendant, to an equal amount by bond, though not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>yet due. The case is not materially different, where the plaintiff in the injunction, is surety in a bond to a third perSOn for the plaintiff at law; for upon the supposition of the insolvency of the latter, the former is in equal danger of loss. In both eases, the court proceeds upon the same principle, of protecting the party from a payment of money to one, to whom, in justice and equity, he owes nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">This case, however, does not seem to me to depend on these principles. <em>Otey\u2019s </em>testimony changes its aspect entirely. Whether the parties designed to constitute him arbitrator or not, I think we must consider that settlement as final. If he was arbitrator, this is clear; for the credit was claimed, was resisted, and was not allowed. If he was not arbitrator, still it is obvious that the assignee <em>Campbell, </em>and <em>Feazle </em>and <em>Dillard </em>met together, and called on <em>Otey </em>to adjust the credits to which <em>Feazle </em>was entitled. For what purpose? obviously, that it might be ascertained on the one hand, what <em>Feazle </em>owed upon the bond, and on the other, how far <em>Campbell </em>the assignee would be paid by him, and how far he should have to look to his failing debtor, <em>Dillard, </em>for further security, or indemnity for his liabilities. If <em>Feazle </em>had insisted on his equity, <em>Campbell </em>would have been warned of the necessity of pressing <em>Dillard </em>for some equivalent to what he would lose by that credit on <em>Feazle\u2019s </em>bond. But <em>Feazle </em>did not urge it, nor intimate that it would be further insisted on. On the contrary, he acquiesced in the indorsement of credits, to the exclusion of this credit; and moreover, <em>Otey </em>says, that it was his impression from the transaction, that <em>Feazle </em>was to pay the balance without further deduction, to <em>Campbell. </em>Now, if the conduct of <em>Feazle </em>gave this impression to <em>Otey, </em>it may fairly be considered as having given it to <em>Campbell. </em>And if <em>Feazle </em>left <em>Campbell </em>under the impression that he would pay the amount, and not insist on his equity, it would be a fraud in him afterwards to attempt to set it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">There is a paper in the cause, purporting to be signed by <em>Dillard </em>on the very day of the settlement. I do not consider it as proved. <em>Otey, </em>the only witness examined, never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>heard of it; the handwriting is not proved, and it is cer- ' , . , \u201e . . . . <em>7 </em>, tamly not admitted. But u it be gemnnej it looks very much like a fraud on the part of <em>Dillard </em>and <em>Feazle. </em>For it was executed on the very day of the settlement, when <em>Feazle </em>was perfectly aware of <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>rights; and as neither <em>Campbell </em>nor <em>Oley </em>knew any thing of it, and there is no subscribing witness, it would seem to have been a secret transaction between <em>Dillard </em>and <em>Feazle. </em>What could have been its object, but to give <em>Feazle </em>the benefit of the credit, while <em>Campbell </em>was left to suppose he was to have the bond absolved from it, and was therefore diverted from pressing <em>Dillard </em>for farther security?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-16\">Upon the whole, I think the decree is right and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-17\">Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b55-6\"> Ingraham\u2019s edi. Philadelphia .1820.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b57-18\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A3D\">dissented. He said\u2014This is a contest between two sufferers by an insolvent debtor, each endeavouring to throw a portion of the loss upon the other. If the bond executed by <em>Feazle </em>to <em>Dillard, </em>had not been assigned, but had remained in <em>Dillard\u2019s </em>hands, and he had obtained judgment and execution thereon in November 1821, I think it is very clear, that, under the circumstances disclosed in this record, <em>Feazle </em>would have been entitled, at that time, to the interference of a court of equity, lor indemnity against the payment of the smaller debt for which he was <em>Dillard's </em>surety, although that debt was not then due; and that the chancellor ought to have granted him an injunction for the amount of it, unless such indemnity were given. There is good reason to believe, that <em>Dillard </em>was then insolvent, and that <em>Campbell </em>knew it; and it appears that <em>Dillard, </em>shortly afterwards, took the benefit of the insolvent laws, and removed out of the country. If the contest then had been between <em>Dillard </em>and <em>Feazle, </em>in November 1821 (at which time <em>Feazle </em>had notice of the assignment), I cannot doubt but that a court of equity ought to have granted an injunction to the amount of the debt for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>which <em>Feazle </em>was security for <em>Dill'ard, </em>unless the latter had indemnified him against the suretyship. This equity, which <em>Feazle </em>had against his own bond <em>in Dillard\u2019s </em>hands, attached to it in the hands of <em>Campbell, </em>the assignee, accordjng to tkg we]q settled doctrine of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">I do not think there is any thing in the testimony of <em>Otey, </em>to take this case- out of the general rule, even if we regard him as an arbitrator in the settlement which he made for the parties in April 1822. <em>Feazle\u2019s </em>right to indemnity against the bond in which he was surety for <em>Dillard, </em>was not submitted to <em>Otey; </em>for he says expressly, that he was called upon to settle the accounts between the parties, and to enter the credits to which <em>Feazle </em>was entitled on the bond, <em>at the time of the settlement. </em>It is true, that <em>Feazle </em>de-' manded a credit for the amount of the bond in which he was surety to <em>Burd, </em>but <em>Dillard </em>refused to allow it, alleging that <em>Feazle </em>had not yet paid it, and that it was time enough to claim a credit for it, when he should have paid it. This reasoning was irresistible in a contest about <em>credits then due, </em>but had no force as to a right of indemnity not then submitted to the arbitrator. <em>Feazle </em>has, since, been compelled to pay the debt to <em>Burd; </em>and I think that the same equity which entitled him to an indemnity before it was paid, entitles him to a credit for it, now that it has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
