The bill then alleged, that <em>Pulliam </em>was a distributee of <em>Richardson, </em>and entitled to the twenty-eighth part of the surplus of his personal assets, and that he was entitled to set-off this claim also against the bond assigned to <em>Winston, </em>but that <em>Scott </em>had not yet settled his accounts of administration. The prayer of the bill was, that the discounts above specified should be ascertained and set-off against the judgment recovered by <em>Winston </em>as assignee of Scott; that <em>Scott </em>should be compelled to settle his accounts of administration of <em>Richardson\u2019s </em>estate; that <em>Winston </em>should be injoined from proceeding to execute his judgment at law; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\"><em>Scott, </em>in his answer, admitted, that <em>Pulliam </em>held his note for 21 dollars; but he said, that, at the time <em>Pulliam </em>gave him the bond for <em>47, </em>dollars which he liad assigned to <em>Winston, </em>he agreed, that he would not insist on setting off the debt <em>Scott </em>owed him against that bond, because he owed another debt by bond to <em>Scott </em>as administrator of <em>Richardson, </em>equal to the debt due from <em>Scott </em>individually to <em>Pulliam. </em>He did not admit, that <em>Pulliam </em>had any just claim as a creditor of <em>Richardson\u2019s </em>estate. As to his administration of <em>Richardson\u2019s </em>estate, he admitted, that his accounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>were not yet settled; but be said, the estate was, for the pre- <em>. . :' </em>, \u2019, , , . \u2019 \u201e , . . . f , sent, in his debt; and that his letters of administration had been revoked, and administration <em>de bonis non </em>committed to the sheriff of <em>Hanover. </em>He was ready to settle his accounts of administration, and to pay the surplus in his hands, to the distributees of <em>Richardson; </em>but, he said, he did not admit that <em>Pidlia/m </em>was one of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-9\">The defendant <em>Winston </em>answered, that he had acquired the bond fairly, for a valuable consideration, and that he knew nothing of the transactions mentioned in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-10\">The county court, on motion of the defendants, dissolved the injunction; and, at the second term afterwards, no cause being shewn to the contrary, dismissed the bill with costs.

The injunction ought never to have been granted, for the reasons assigned by the president of this court, in <em>White, Whittle &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Banister's ex'ors, </em>1 Wash. 166. which reasons apply as well to the case of a distributee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>as to that of a creditor. See also <em>Brown's adm'x </em>v. <em>Garland, </em>1 Wash. 221. and <em>Dale &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 11. 13. The bond, in this case, though taken to the administrator himself, and therefore, at law, considered as his own bond, is to be looked upon, in equity, as the bond of the estate, until the accounts, at least, are liquidated, and he is found to be in advance; which, here, the plaintiff himself denies. The set-offs, therefore, against the defendant <em>Scott, </em>of his individual debts, were clearly inadmissible. And, as to the set-oils of demands against <em>Richardson's </em>estate, they were inadmissible as has been already said, for the reasons given in <em>White, Whittle &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Banister\u2019s ex'or s. </em>If a purchaser at the sale of a decedent\u2019s estate, desire to set-off a claim, which he has as a distributee, he ought to institute his suit for a settlement and distribution in due season, so as to ascertain that there will be a balance in his favor, in time to meet the expected judgment for the amount of his purchase. If, on the contrary, he may wait until there is a judgment against him, and may then tie up the recovery until complicated accounts of administration may be settled, in order to discover whether there will be a distributable surplus, the executor may be made liable for a <em>devastavit, </em>and creditors may be unduly delayed in the recovery of their demands. Every purchaser at a sale of the decedent\u2019s estate, ought to understand, that he is to pay up the amount of his purchase, unless the executor expressly agrees, that any claim he may have against the estate, shall be discounted. Therefore, the injunction was properly dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">But there can be no question, that this decree must be reversed, upon the authority of the cases of <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Shreeve, </em>4 Munf. 490. and <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>6 Munf. 397. In those cases, it is decided, that the provision of the statute, under which the county court proceeded in dismissing the bill, does not apply to a bill which is not merely a bill of injunction, but has other objects besides those of injoining a judgment at law. Now, here the bill alleges, that the plaintiff is one of <em>Richardson's distributees; </em>and prays, that the administrator may be compelled to settle his accounts, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>for all proper relief. Here, then, is a bill which has in view other objects besides the injunction. It should not, therefore, have been dismissed as a matter consequent of course on the dissolution of the injunction. It should have been regularly proceeded in to a hearing. It is true, that <em>the </em>bill is obviously defective for want of, parties. Only one out of twenty-eight distributees, according to the plaintiff\u2019s own shewing, is before the court. But though if a bill shew no cause of action, this court ought not to reverse a decree of dismission, however irregular, yet if it shew a cause of action, an irregular dismission, without a hearing, should be set aside, notwithstanding the bill be defective in form or for want of parties. For had it not been improperly and prematurely dismissed, the plaintiff, before the hearing, would have been entitled to amend, by giving form to the bill, or by adding proper parties. I am, therefore, reluctantly compelled to say, that, in my opinion,.both decrees must be reversed for this error, and the cause sent back to the county court, with directions to redocket it, and send it to the rules for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Cabell and Carr, <em>J </em>concurred.
