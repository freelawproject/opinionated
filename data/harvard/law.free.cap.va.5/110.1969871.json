I give all my other lands to my son <em>Christopher </em>above named, containing one hundred and fifty acres including the plantation on which he now lives.\u201d Then follow several bequests of personal property and a slave; and.then the last clause in these words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-12\"><em>\u201c I </em>leave all the corn and tobacco now upon the plantation to <em>John Berry </em>to pay my personal debts; this is my will and the way I desire my <em>estate </em>to be disposed of, revoking any other will or testament made by me formerly. \u201d The bill of exceptions further stated, that the said <em>John Miller, </em>the testator, left <em>Christopher Miller </em>his son in the will mentioned. And, also, as the demandant alledged and offered to prove, another <em>Christopher Miller </em>his grandson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>and heir at law. That this last named <em>Christopher </em>was the eldest son of the testator\u2019s eldest son, who died in the life-time of the testator. That after the testator\u2019s death, the said <em>Christopher, </em>his son, entered on the lands in question, claiming them by virtue of the following clause of the will: <em>\u201c </em>I give all my other lands to my son <em>Christopher </em>named above, containing one hundred and fifty acres, including the plantation on which he now lives;\u201d the said <em>Christopher, </em>the alledged grandson, being then living. That after the death of <em>Christopher </em>the son, the tenants entered as his sons and devisees. That on the 16th of <em>March, </em>1792, <em>Christopher </em>the grandson, claiming as heir at law of the testator <em>John Miller, </em>brought his writ of right for the same, which afterwards abated by the death of the said <em>Christopher, </em>who died without having recovered possession of the land; but, made his will on the 2d of <em>June, </em>1792, attested <em>by </em>three witnesses, but proved only by one, on the 23d of <em>September, </em>1793, and thereby devised the lands to the demandant. Whereupon, the tenants, without going into evidence on their part, moved the Court, that it appeared from the demandant\u2019s own shewing, that the said <em>Christopher, </em>the testator, was not either at the time of making and publishing his said will, or at the time of his death, seised or possessed of the said lands, and, therefore, that the said devise was Void. That the Court was of this opinion, and instructed the jury accordingly. The jury found for the tenants. The Court gave judgment agreeable to the verdict. And the demandant appealed therefrom to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-8\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-9\">The question is, if a man out of possession of lands, can devise them ? Great doubts have arisen with respect to such a devise, under the statute of wills in <em>England. </em>But, I believe, if it were necessary, that I could maintain the devise under that statute, in which the words are \u201c any person having lands may devise them. \u201d But, be that as it may, the act of 1792, [a re-enactment of 1785, 12 <em>St at. Larg. </em>140; c. 104, \u00a7 1, <em>R. C. </em>ed. 1819,] expressly includes the case, and removes all doubt upon the subject; and, so I have been informed it has been decided in this Court. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A6g\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>Warden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3R\">There is another question in the cause ; whether the. devise by <em>John Miller, </em>did not carry a fee in these lands to his son <em>Christopher, </em>the devisee ? In this devise, there are no words expressly describing a smaller <em>estate, </em>and, therefore, the words in the latter part of the will, in which the testator says, <em>\u201c </em>this is my will, and this is the way I wish to have my estate disposed of,\u201d will carry the fee. For, the word <em>estate </em>carries the whole interest and means all the right of the testator. This construction is supported by the introductory words, where the testator says, <em>I dispose of my estate as follows; </em>thereby plainly shewing that he meant to dispose of his whole estate, and to die intestate as to no part thereof. Words of inheritance, are not necessary to create an estate in fee simple in a will. <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>Guthrie, </em>in this Court at the last term. <em>Ante. </em>p. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahp\">Then, upon the point made by Mr. <em>Wickham, </em>the law of 1792 was made to govern rights accruing after, and not those which were acquired before the passage thereof. r^'^le wor&lt;^s are? that every person shall have power to devise all the estate, right, title and interest in possession, reversion or remainder, which he hath or at the time of his death shall have of, in or to lands, &amp;c. But, the testator in this case, had no estate, title or interest either in possession, reversion or remainder; for, he was not in possession, and the claim he set up was neither in reversion nor remainder; and, consequently, he came w.ithin neither of the provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-8\">Again, the will of <em>Christopher </em>was only proved by one witness, which was not sufficient; and the tenants had been in possession fifty years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-9\">If, enough appears upon the record to shew that the te-nants have the better right, the Court will decide for them,' without sending the cause back to the District Court to go through the mere form of another trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-10\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-11\">It is said, that <em>Christopher, </em>the son, took a fee by the devise to him in <em>John Miller\u2019s </em>will; which I do not admit. By the first clause, he had clearly only an estate for life by the settled law of the land. There must be a sufficient expression to alter this rule; and the words in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>latter clause do not-contain such an expression. The words there, are according to the common style in wills. To have had the effect contended for, the word <em>a ll </em>should have been inserted. Besides, there is a clause which expresses another idea; for, it is to the devisee and his heirs, and yet, in the next clause, to the same devisee, he does not use words of perpetuity or inheritance ; which shews, that when he intended a fee, he knew how to create it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-4\">It was said, that the act of 1792, relates to estates acquired after vards, and not to those which the testator had before ; but there is no reason for the distinction : The words are sufficient to enable him to devise his interest of every kina ; and, the decision of this Court was so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\">Although, the will was proved only by one witness in the Court where probat was obtained, yet it does not appear, but that there might have been other evidence, at the trial. But, the Court will consider only what point was made and decided by the inferior <em>Court; </em>and, if the decision on that was wrong, they will reverse the judgment and award a new trial. Mr. <em>Warden </em>says, that the Court will decide upon the whole record ; and, if our conduct was improper prior to the decision, he would be right; but no such thing appears, and therefore, I think the Court is confined to the point in decision. For, what was stated prior thereto, was only explanation and inducements leading to the point which was decided.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>Warden.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_F\">There is no evidence that the <em>will of Chris-</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZo\"><em>topher </em>was proved as the law requires, and it cannot be presumed. The word <em>estate </em>means the whole interest, and so the testator intended it.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b135-12\">[* <em>Turpin v.Turpin, </em>1 Wash, 75.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b137-7\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"ANt\">This is an appeal from the District Court of <em>King </em>and <em>Queen, </em>where, in a writ of right, the <em>mise </em>was joined on the mere right; and a jury were sworn and charged to decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The demandant filed a bill of exceptions, stating the title of both parties to be derived from <em>John Miller, </em>who died seised, in 1742: the demandant claiming under <em>Christopher. </em>his grandson, and heir at law, the tenants under <em>Christopher </em>his son, to whom the testator devised it by his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">By the strict wording of the opinion, it would seem as if it was founded on the statute, requiring, as the Court appear to have supposed, seisin and possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>lands to enable a testator to dispose of them, which Chris<em>t\u00b0P^er&gt; </em>the grandson, had not, and, therefore, according to the opinion, could not devise them, though he should have had title. But, if it appears, by the demandant\u2019s own shewing, that <em>Christopher, </em>the grandson, had neither seisin, possession or title, so that he could derive none from him, the opinion and verdict were substantially right, and the Court will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AIJ\">Whether the heir had a title, depends on the will of his ancestor devising the lands to his son <em>Christopher </em>without limitation, but declaring in the preamble he intended to dispose of his estate, and towards the conclusion, that he had disposed of his <em>estate </em>according to his will.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">If this passed a fee to the son, his title was in the tenants, and the heir had no title. If, on the contrary, it <em>only </em>passed an estate for life, the reversion descended to the heir, who had a right to the possession on the death of <em>Christopher </em>his son.</p>\n<p id=\"AJm\">That the word <em>estate, </em>coupled with the devise, will comprehend the interest, as well as describe the thing, and pass a fee, has long been settled. That it may be transposed <em>from the </em>preamble <em>or </em>other parts of the will, and annexed to the devise, to fulfil the intention of the testator, is warranted by precedents in <em>England </em>and in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The testator, here, has doubly fortified his devise, by the word <em>estate </em>in the preamble and conclusion of his will: which the Court do not hesitate to say passed a fee to <em>Christopher </em>the son; and that the heir had <em>not, </em>and consequently the demandant has no title.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Affirm the judgment. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b138-11\">[* See <em>Kennon </em>v. <em>McRoberts </em>et ux., 1 wash. 96; <em>Watson </em>v.
