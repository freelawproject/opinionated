Therefore, the bill prayed a decree against <em>Baxter </em>for the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\"><em>Baxter, </em>in his answer, admitted that he was indebted to <em>Dunlap, </em>and <em>Irvin </em>indebted to him, and that the design of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the arrangement was, that <em>Irvin </em>should stand paymaster to <em>Dunlap, </em>so that <em>Irvin </em>should be discharged from <em>Baxter's </em>claim, and <em>Baxter </em>from <em>Dunlap's; </em>but he said, that as it was <em>Irvin </em>who owed the debt, so it was <em>Irvin </em>who undertook to find sureties to <em>Dunlap </em>for the same; and that the plaintiff <em>Moore </em>and himself, with <em>Duffield </em>and <em>Given, </em>joined in the bonds as <em>Irvin's </em>sureties. Therefore, he insisted, that <em>Irvin, </em>the principal debtor, was bound, in the first place, to make remuneration to <em>Moore; </em>and if <em>Irvin's </em>estate was insufficient, then <em>Moore </em>was only entitled to contribution from <em>Duffield, Given </em>and the defendant, as his co-sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-4\">The plaintiff proved his case as stated in the bill; but part of his proof consisted in the depositions of <em>Duffield </em>and <em>Given </em>his co-sureties, which were read at the hearing of the cause, without any objection made on the part of <em>Baxter.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">The chancellor gave <em>Moore </em>a decree against <em>Baxter, </em>for 721 dollars (which appeared to be the amount of the judgments recovered by <em>Dunlap, </em>principal, interest and costs)with interest &amp;c. though there was no proof that <em>Moore </em>had paid more than the sum claimed in his bill, namely 672 dollars. And, upon the petition of <em>Baxter, </em>this court allowed him an appeal from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOG\">objected, 1. That supposing <em>Moore's </em>case well proved, and that he had a just claim against <em>Baxter </em>alone, then he had a plain and complete remedy at law, and therefore the court of chancery had no jurisdiction to relieve him. 2. That, at any rate, <em>Irvin </em>was certainly the principal debtor, and therefore his representatives ought to have been made parties. 3. That <em>Moore's </em>case was not well proved; for that the depositions of <em>Duffield </em>and <em>Given </em>were not competent evidence for <em>Moore, </em>since the effect thereof was to discharge themselves from the duty of contributing, as co-sureties, their portions of the debt, by throwing the whole burden on <em>Baxter. </em>And 4. That the decree was for more than <em>Moore </em>had paid, and more than he claimed in his bill.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE1\">answered, 1. That a surety, having been coerced by legal process to pay the debt, had a clear right to the aid of a court of equity to compel remuneration from his principal, or contribution from his co-sureties; <em>Cabell\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Wigginson\u2019s </em>adm\u2019rs, 6 Munf. 202. <em>Kemp </em>v. <em>Prior, 7 </em>Ves. 237. 249. 2. That, supposing the case stated in the bill made good by the proofs, <em>Irvin\u2019s </em>representatives were not necessary parties; because, as between <em>Baxter </em>on the one part, and <em>Moore, Duff,eld </em>and <em>Given, </em>on the other, <em>Baxter </em>was the principal debtor, and the other three were his sureties. 3. That <em>Duffield </em>and <em>Given </em>were competent witnesses; for if <em>Baxter </em>should bring a suit against them to compel them <em>to </em>make contribution as his co-sureties, the record and decree in this suit would not be competent evidence for or against them. Besides, he said, the objection came too late here: no objection was made to the reading of the depositions at the hearing in the court of chancery: if the objection had been made there, it might have been obviated, or the evidence of these witnesses might have been supplied by that of others.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b241-5\">Caub, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"APV\">The justice of this case is very clear. The bonds in which <em>Moore </em>was bound as surety, were entered into for a debt due from <em>Baxter to Dunlap, </em>and <em>Moore was induced to join in </em>the bonds, by the request of <em>Baxter </em>that he would become <em>his </em>surety. This is surely enough, as between them, to constitute the relation of principal and surety. The objection to the jurisdiction is not sound. Nor can the exception to the competency of the evidence of <em>Dufjield </em>and <em>Given </em>prevail, considering that that exception is taken in this court for the Erst time. We are to rejudge the decree of the court of chancery: it \"was not error to read the depositions at the hearing <em>there, </em>when there was no exception taken to the evidence; and if it was not error then, <em>it </em>can hardly be error now. The decree, however, is erroneous in the amount decreed: it should have been for 672 dollars (the sum paid by <em>Moore, </em>and claimed in his bill) with interest &amp;c. instead of 721 dollars. The decree is to be reversed for this cause alone, and corrected.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
