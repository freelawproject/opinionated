That, in the progress of the work, <em>Goode, </em>finding it convenient to have an addition made to the building originally intended, which <em>Sturtevant </em>agreed to make, executed another covenant to <em>Sturtevant, </em>whereby he agreed to pay him for such addition, when completed according to additional articles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>agreement between them, the sum of 1500 dollars: that this second covenant of <em>Goode </em>was likewise delivered to <em>Sturtevant, </em>but the additional agreement therein mentioned was left in <em>Goode's </em>hands, and he still held it. That <em>Sturtevant </em>also executed a great deal of extra and very costly work, not stipulated in either of the written agreements, at <em>Goode's </em>special request, and upon his promise to make him a fair compensation for the same. That it was one of the stipulations in the agreements on <em>Sturtevant?s </em>part, that he should furnish materials; and he did furnish materials for the work, so far as it proceeded, and other materials to be used in completing it; but before it was completed, disputes arose between the parties, in consequence of which <em>Goode </em>refused to permit <em>Sturtevant </em>to. fulfil his whole contract, and put a stop to the work before it was finished. That <em>Sturtevant's </em>bill for the work actually done, including that done under both of the agreements and the extra work, at the stipulated and fair prices, amounted to 8658 dollars. That <em>Goode </em>had made various payments to <em>Sturtevant </em>on account of the work by him done, and <em>Sturtevant </em>was moreover indebted to <em>Goode </em>for provisions found and furnished by <em>Goode </em>to <em>Sturtevant </em>and his workmen, during the progress of the building, whereof there was a separate account between the parties, the amount of which it was agreed, should be deducted from the balance that should be found due to <em>Sturtevant </em>for the building, upon a final settlement. That there was a large balance due to <em>Sturtevant, </em>which <em>Goode </em>refused to pay; he also refused to come to a settlement of the accounts. That <em>Sturtevant, </em>thereupon, brought an action at law against <em>Goode; </em>but his counsel finding it impossible to prosecute that action, or even to frame his declaration, without a knowledge of the two. agreements between the parties, which were referred to in <em>Goode's </em>covenants to <em>Sturtevant, </em>and which were retained in <em>Goode's </em>possession, a written application was made to <em>Goode </em>for copies of those agreements, which he positively refused to furnish ; and <em>Sturtevant </em>being impeded and embarrassed in the prosecution of his action at law, by the want of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>documents, that action was dismissed, by agreement between the parties, that each should pay his own costs, that such dismission should be without prejudice to any other suit or suits which <em>Sturtevant </em>might bring, that <em>Goode </em>should not, in such future suit, rely on the statute of limitations in bar of any item of <em>Sturtevant's </em>claims, and <em>Sturtevant </em>should waive the statute as to any set-oils which <em>Goode </em>should offer, and that Goode, as he had not before procured, so he would not afterwards procure, any assignments of claims against <em>Sturtevant, </em>for the purpose of set-off against his demands. And Sturtevant, having thus stated his case, prayed, that <em>Goode </em>might be compelled to produce and file the two agreements between the parties, which he yet retained in his possession; that accounts of all the transactions between them, might be taken; and the balance which should be found due thereon to <em>Sturtevant, </em>might be decreed to him: the bill placing <em>Sturtevani's </em>claim to relief in equity, on two grounds, specially stated, 1. that the two agreements between the parties which <em>Goode </em>held in his own possession, were indispensable to enable him to proceed at law, and <em>Goode </em>refused to furnish copies of them; and 2. that the accounts between the parties as they arose out of, and were referable to, several distinct contracts, were so various and complicated, that they could not be accurately adjusted in any proceedings at law, and that several actions at law would be necessary to enforce the several claims of <em>Sturtevant </em>upon the several contracts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-5\"><em>Goode </em>first demurred to the bill, because the case therein stated was not properly relievable in equity, and then he proceeded to answer it, and to state the facts on which he relied for his defence, if the court should entertain the jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\">The chancellor sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill, without prejudice to any suit which the plaintiff might be advised to bring at law; declining jurisdiction upon the authority of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>2 Rand. 449. From this decree, <em>Sturtevant </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Alp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ai4b\"><em>Taylor, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ak1\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Avd\">I am clearly of opinion, that the bill in this case set forth facts that gave jurisdiction to the court of chancery. Without entering upon any other part of the case, than that which respects the withholding of the agreements by <em>Goode, </em>I will observe, that the agreements in <em>Goode\u2019s </em>possession, were so intimately connected with the covenants in <em>Sturtevant s </em>possession, that it is difficult to imagine how the latter could have declared in covenant without them. Admitting that this difficulty could have been avoided by alleging that <em>Goode </em>withheld the agreements, and had put a stop to the work before it was finished; yet new difficulties must have arisen on the trial. The refusal of <em>Goode </em>to permit <em>Sturtevant </em>to proceed, would have absolved him from the necessity of averring performance, and gave him a right of action against <em>Goode </em>upon the covenants; yet the quantum of damages would depend, in a good measure, upon the terms of the agreements; for though <em>Goode </em>did arrest the progress of the work, it might not follow, as of course, that <em>Sturtevant </em>was to recover the whole contract price. Part of that price being in consideration of the materials he was to furnish, if he was stopped in the work, and did not furnish them, part of the price should of course be abated. Again, as to the extra work, it was essential that the agreements should be exhibited to enable the plaintiff to prepare his case, by distinguishing the contract work from the extra work. Was it reasonable to expect, in such a transaction as this, that he could do this upon the spur of the occasion, in a trial at law, when the defendant should, after the jury were sworn, produce the agreements? Was it reasonable to expect him to go to trial with such a hazard? He did commence an action at law. His counsel felt the necessity, no doubt, of his having these papers; and, in consequence, he sent a note to <em>Goode, </em>requesting copies of the agreements. They were refused: <em>Goode </em>kept them in his possession, and would not even let <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>him have copies. What right had he to withhold copies of agreements signed by both, and which on principle belonged to both. What wonder, then, that <em>Sturtevant </em>found himself compelled to dismiss his suit? Would he have done so, if it had not been manifest to his counsel, that he could not get along witli the case without the agreements? <em>Goode </em>had no right to judge <em>for him, </em>whether the suit could have been maintained without them. He cannot be received to say here, through his counsel, \u201cI avow that I withheld these papers, which you thought necessary for the prosecution of your demand; you might have gone on to try your cause without them.\u201d If <em>Goode </em>preferred a jury trial, he should have frankly afforded copies of the papers, which his adversary thought essential for the prosecution of his suit. As he did not, he cannot complain, that he has been brought info a court of equity, since he compelled <em>Sturtevant </em>to come here. Nor can he, under such circumstances, object to the jurisdiction. He cannot be permitted to drive his adversary from the court of law, by withholding papers, and then to drive him from the court of chancery, because he did not hazard a trial at law without them. I am, therefore, clearly of opinion to sustain the jurisdiction. This is not the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Marks; </em>it is a case <em>sui generis. </em>I have rarely known one in which the objection to the jurisdiction of equity was made with less propriety by a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\">The other judges concurred. Decree reversed, and cause remanded to the court of chancery.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
