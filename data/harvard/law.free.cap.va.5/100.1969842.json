The plaintiff replied: 1. That the avowant did not demise, and issue thereon. 3. Entry by the defendant into parcel and expulsion of the plaintiff. 3. No rent arrear. 4. That defendant did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>not build certain walls on the premises. 5. .That defendant did not permit the plaintiff to clear and cultivate twenty acres of land in addition to the cleared lands. 6.

Which demurrer, the said <em>James Maxwell </em>by his attorney joins.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-7\">Upon the trial of the issues, the plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion, which stated that, the avowant offered a copy of an indenture of lease in evidence, the only probat of which was in these words: <em>\u201c </em>At a Court continued and held for <em>Berkeley </em>County, the ISth day of May, 1791. This indenture was proved by the oath of <em>Moses Hunter </em>a witness thereto, and ordered to' be recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-8\">\n<em>Teste,</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-9\">MOSES HUNTER.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-10\">To which the plaintiff objected, because, it was only a copy, and not so proved and authenticated as to make it legal evidence. That the avowant then proved, that the plaintiff had acknowledged, that a deed which he said was the original lease, was in the .possession .of the plaintiff since the date of the said certificate, who did not produce it, though called on to do so, at the trial of the cause. That the plaintiff proved, that <em>Moses Hunter, </em>one of the subscribing witnesses to the said deed, is alive, and within the jurisdiction of the Court. That the Court permitted the deed to go in evidence, without any proof from the subscribing witnesses, that the Original had been executed, or that the said copy was a true copy of the original. Another bill of exceptions stated, that the Court directed the jury, that the said copy of the deed was sufficient to prove the demise. A third bill of exceptions, to same effect as the last.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-12\">Verdict for the avowant in these words: \u201cWe of the jury, find for the avowant, and also find two hundred and twenty-five pounds <em>Pennsylvania </em>currency, of the value of one hundred and eighty pounds current money of <em>Vif</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number><em>ginia, </em>to be rent in arrear and due from the plaintiff to the avowant.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-4\">__</p>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AYWL\">After the verdict, the plaintiff filed a fourth bill of exceptions, which stated, that the landlord moved the Court for judgment for double the rent found by the jury to be in arrear, to which the plaintiff objected, and offered to prove to the Court, that the avowant had distrained for more rent than the jury had found due and arrear: which evidence,' the Court refused to hear, after the verdict received and the jury discharged, because <em>ex parte, </em>irregular and without notice.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b126-5\">The Court over-ruled the demurrers, and gave judgment for double the rent found by the jury to be in arrear, and the costs. From which judgment, <em>Maxwell </em>appealed to this Court.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-6\"><em>Washington, for </em>the appellant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW5\">The copy of the deed ought not to have been permitted to go in evidence to the jury. There are two ways of \u2022- proving deeds, one by witnesses, and the other by at-Jested copies from the records, where they have been ; proved as the law directs. The last is as good evidence, as the original itself would be; but, if the deed be not proved and recorded as the law directs, then a copy is not good evidence. In the present case, the deed was proved by one witness only; and, although it is recorded, yet that gives no degree of evidence to it; because, it was not done as the law directs. It is, therefore, no more than the Cleric\u2019s certificate, which is not evidence in any \u2022case; for, it is not on oath, and is of no more weight than the certificate of any other person. Therefore, the copy was not evidence, without proof that it was a true copy of the original, unless <em>Maxwell\u2019s </em>acknowledgment, that he had possession of the original, altered the case. But, it did not; for, to have that effect, it should have been proved that it was in his possession at the time of the trial, and not that it had been in his possession, at some time before. Because, he had once had it in possession, it did not follow that he was always to have it. Besides, notice should have been given him to produce it, or he was not bound to carry it to Court, or to bring it forward, when called for by the other party. <em>Gilb. </em>Law. Ev. 95, 97. <em>[Roe, </em>on dem. of <em>Haldane </em>et al. v. Harvey,] 4 Burr. 2487. There is a difference between proving the contents of a deed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>proving a copy- of a deed. In the last case, the witness must swear that it is a copy. <em>Gilb. </em>Law. Ev. 96. So, that although it should he admitted in any case, that a copy is evidence, still the party who would offer it, must prove, that what he produces is a copy of the original.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-6\">The Court erred in another instance. For, it appears by the bill of exceptions, that they affirmed to the jury, that the evidence offered was sufficient to maintain the issue. Whereas, they should merely have decided on the competency, and left the sufficiency to the jury ; and the decisions of this Court have been so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-7\">The Court were clearly wrong also, in refusing to hear the evidence, after the verdict, in order to prove that the 'distress was for more rent in arrear than the jury by their verdict had found to be due.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-8\"><em>Williams, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-10\">Three witnesses are not necessary in order to record a deed; for, one is enough to admit it to record, though three are requisite in order to give it effect against creditors. The words of the act of Assembly warrant this distinction^ as it does not prohibit probat by one ; but only speaks oft its being void against creditors and purchasers, unless proved by three, leaving the grantee to prove it as he pleases,/; between him and the grantor. The County Court, whenV the deed was recorded, had a right to receive the oath of the witness ; and, therefore, the certificate of that probat was sufficient proof of the execution of the deed. But, the deed has been recorded, and that record is effectual till reversed, so that this Court will not examine into it. The copy, therefore, was good evidence, especially as <em>Maxwell, </em>who accepted, is proved to have' acknowledged his having had possession, and does not state any subsequent dispossession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-15\">It was <em>Maxwell </em>who called for the opinion of the Court, and, therefore, he should not be allowed to except to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-16\">As to the other point, the quantum due was involved in the issues ; and the jury having decided it, no new evidence was admissible after the verdict, as to a point which was proper for their investigation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pA1I\">\n<em>Washington.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxK\">The copy was inadmissible. None but the copy of a deed recorded, as the law allows, could be admitted. For, if. not recorded as the law directs, it is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>same as if it was not recorded at all. In <em>England, </em>none but deeds of bargain and sale are enrolled, and a copy of the enrollment is evidence. But, suppose, a feoffment were enrolled, would that be evidence ? It was said, that as it had been recorded, it was effectual, till reversed. But, there is no mode of reversing it; no appeal or supersedeas lies; this argument, therefore, objects the want of that which cannot be. \u2022 It is said, that <em>Maxwell </em>required the opinion of the Court. But, that did not authorise them to give an improper direction to the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Az8\">\n<em>Washington.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmhA\">It is the province of the Court to assess it; because, they are to render the judgment, and, therefore, ought to hear the testimony on which it is to be founded. The object of the law was, to punish tenants who replevied when the rent was justly due ; but the landlord may dis-train for more than is. due, and if he does, then he is not entitled to double value.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AKq\">\n<em>Williams.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADK\">The practice would introduce inconvenience, and would tend to surprise the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b124-21\">[* See Act of <em>February </em>15th, 1823, <em>c. </em>29, \u00a7 3.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b128-8\">PENDLETON,</author>\n<p id=\"AYol\">President. Upon the third point, the question is, whether the Court or the jury are to assess the double value? For, if the Court, then the evidence was proper; but, if the jury, then it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">PENDLETON, President. If the landlord did dis-train for too much, was he entitled to the double value ?</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">The Court having taken a few days to consider the case;</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">PENDLETON, President, now delivered their resolution ; that the judgment was erroneous on account of the Court\u2019s permitting the copy of the deed to be given in evidence, without any other proof than the Clerk\u2019s certificate of its being proved by one witness. Because, although the copy would have been sufficient, if the appellant refused to produce the original when called on, yet, it ought to have been proved to have been a copy by other evidence. For, its being proved by one witness, did not authorise th\u00e9 recording of it under the act of Assembly. That, therefore, the judgment was to be reversed, and the cause remitted to the District Court for a new trial to be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The judgment was \u00e1s follows : \u201cThe Court is of opinion, that there is error in the said judgment in this, that the said District Court permitted the copy of the lease from the appellee to the appellant to be given in evidence on the trial without other proof of the execution of the original, or of its being a true copy thereof, than the certificate of <em>Moses Hunter </em>annexed to the copy ; since, although the proof of the execution ought to have been dispensed with, on the appellant\u2019s refusing to produce the original in his possession, it was incumbent on him to have proved the truth of the copy by better proof than the certificate of the Clerk from the records ; as the recording of the original on proof by one witness is not warranted by law. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Therefore, it is considered by the Court, that the said judgment be reversed and annulled, and that the appellant recover against the appellee his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here, and it is ordered, that the jurors\u2019 verdict be set aside, and that the cause be remanded to the said District Court for a new trial to be had therein, in which, if the appellant shall refuse to produce the original lease, the copy shall be admitted as evidence, upon the appellee\u2019s proving, either that it is a true copy, or that the probat in <em>Berekely </em>County Court, was made at the instance of the appellant. And, it is further ordered, that upon the trial and after the verdict, if the jury shall find for the <em>avowant, </em>and ascertain the rent due, the tenant shall be allowed to give in evidence to the Court, that more rent was distrained for, than shall be so found due, in order to avoid the entry of the judgment for double the vajue of the rent, and confine the same to the rent only,\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b129-4\">[* <em>Currie </em>v.
