And the court gave judgment for the plaintiffs on the defendant\u2019s demurrer to the declaration, and on their demurrer to his last plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-11\">Upon the trial of the general issue, the defendant fded exceptions to opinions of the court; from which it appeared\u2014 1. That the plaintiffs offered in evidence, as public statutes, two acts of assembly of Virginia, one passed in 1792, \u201cfor establishing a bank in the town of <em>Alexandria\u201d </em>and the other passed in January 1801, \u201cconcerning the bank of <em>Alexandria,\u201d </em>as the same were printed and published by authority, in the printed editions of the acts of each of those sessions of assembl\\r, and distributed to the clerks of the county courts &amp;c. and two acts of congress, one passed the 15th February 1810, entitled \u201c an act concerning the bank of <em>Alexandria,\u201d </em>and the other passed the 2nd March 1821, \u201cto extend the charters of banks in the district of <em>Colum</em>bia,\u201d\u2014that is to say, the printed copies of those acts of congress, in two pamphlets containing the sessions acts of congress, which pamphlets were transmitted to the executive of <em>Virginia, </em>and by the executive to the clerks of the county courts &amp;c. to be distributed among the justices &amp;c. Whereupon, the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the reading of the <em>two acts of congress </em>from the printed editions of the same, without further authentication and proof that they had been truly copied from the rolls,\u2014insisting that those acts of congress were either <em>foreign </em>or <em>private </em>acts, or both, and ought to be authenticated as such; but the court overruled the objection and admitted the said printed copies as evidence; to which opinion the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. 2. The defendant then objected to the reading of the first mentioned act of congress, entitled \u201c an act concerning the bank of Alexandria,\u201d because this act was passed on the 15th February 1810, and not the 15th February 1811, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>was the date of the act of that title mentioned in the declaration ; but the court overruled this objection also; and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-10\">The defendant then demurred to the evidence; which was, 1. The two acts of assembly of <em>Virginia, </em>and the two acts of congress before mentioned. <em>2. </em>The promissory note on which the action was founded: it was a note payable sixty days after date to <em>Jonah Thompson </em>or order, for 4800 dollars, expressed <em>to </em>be for value received, and negotiable at the bank of <em>Alexandria </em>(with a note at the foot that it was for the maker\u2019s use), signed by <em>Bushrod </em>Taylor, and indorsed and assigned by <em>Thompson </em>to the bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>the signatures of both being admitted. And 3. parol evidence, that the note was discounted at bank for the accommodation of the maker, and the proceeds placed to his credit. And then the defendant offered in evidence a bond executed by <em>Jonah Thompson </em>and <em>Jacob Hoffman, </em>in the penalty of 14,473 dollars, with condition, that whereas <em>Thompson </em>had indorsed a note of <em>Bitshrod Taylor </em>for 4800 dollars, which was discounted at the bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>and had been protested for non-payment, and the bank, at <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>request and for his relief, had caused suit to be instituted on the note against <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>representative, in the circuit court of <em>Frederick, </em>and the debt then amounted to 7236 dollars; therefore if <em>Thompson </em>should pay the said debt, with interest &amp;c. on or before &amp;c. then the obligation to be void; but it was understood and provided, that <em>Thompson </em>should have credit for whatever sums of money should, in the meantime, be recovered in the suit aforesaid, after deducting all costs of suit. And this being all the evidence in the cause, the defendant demurred thereto; and the court ruled that the plaintiffs should join in the demurrer, which thereupon they did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-11\">There was a verdict for the plaintiffs for the debt demanded, with interest &amp;c. subject to the opinion of the court on the demurrer to evidence. The court held that the law on the demurrer was for the plaintiffs, and gave them judgment: from which the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Leighj for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A1A\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b495-8\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AO4\">The court is of opinion, that there is no error in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">If the object of the demurrer to the declaration was, to try the right of a foreign corporation to sue, that right is settled by the case of <em>Bank of Marietta </em>v. <em>Pindall, 2 </em>Rand. 465. in which my brother <em>Cabell </em>has, with his accustomed clearness, established the affirmative of the proposition, upon the soundest reason, even if it could have been doubted, since the case of <em>Henriques </em>v. <em>Dutch, West India company, 2 </em>Ld. Raym. 1532. where a judgment having been rendered for the company, it was, on a writ of error in parliament, assigned for error, that a foreign corporation could not sue; but the judgment was affirmed, thus affirming also the right to sue. <em>2 </em>Bac. Abr. Corporations. E. <em>2. </em>p. 12. There could be nothing then in this objection. If the object of the demurrer was to assert the necessity of presentment and demand at the bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>that objection is conclusively met by the fact, that the promissory note was not payable there, though it was negotiable there; <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Wills, </em>4 Leigh 114. If the defect for which the defendant demurred, was any want of form in pleading the acts of congress for the continuance of the corporate powers of the bank, two answers present themselves: 1. that it was not necessary to set forth in the declaration, how the company was incorporated, but it would have been sufficient for the plaintiffs, on the general, issue, to prove their incorporation; <em>Grays </em>v. <em>Turnpike Company, </em>4 Rand. 578. following the long established principles of the english courts: 2. even if it had been necessary, the most that can be said is, that it has been informally pleaded; and upon the general demurrer here, the defendant could not take advantage of want of form. The fact of the incorporation, and the continuance of the charter, is substantially alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Then as to the exceptions. It was moved to exclude the acts of congress as evidence; first, because they were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>duly authenticated. The evidence offered was a copy of the laws printed under the orders of congress, by the public printer, and distributed by law to the executives of the several states, for the purpose of distribution among <em>the people. </em>In <em>England, </em>the printed statute books have been at times admitted as evidence of public acts of parliament. Phil. Law of Ev. [307.]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> So in <em>Virginia, </em>our printed statute book is evidence of the acts of the general assembly. The printed statute book of any government thus seems to be evidence of the statutes of that government. And who doubts it as to the laws of the <em>U. \u00a1States </em>? Their printed statute book is every day referred to as evidence of the public acts of congress. It is received in all courts of the union, as evidence that cannot be controverted, of the statutes which it contains. Now, among those statutes are the .statutes relating to this bank of <em>Alexandria. </em>Even if they were private statutes (which I do not think they are), yet that would only prove that they must be pleaded, but it would Hot invalidate the evidence that they were passed. Of that, the proof is as complete, as of any act, however universal in its character. If, indeed, we could consider, as to this matter, the laws of congress for the district of <em>Columbia, </em>in the light of the statutes of another power, we should at least place them on the footing of the laws of our sister states. And we concur in the opinion expressed by the supreme court of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>that the laws of a sister state, printed by public authority, are admissible evidence without other authentication. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Musser, </em>1 Dall. 462. 1 Stark. Law of Ev. part 2. p. 163. note 2.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Secondly, it was objected, that the act of congress having been misrecited as to date, was not admissible in evidence to prove the incorporation of the plaintiffs. As to this, without examining whether the case is precisely like those of <em>Mowry </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>3 Leigh 561. and <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Crenshaw, </em>4 Leigh 394. it is sufficient to remark, that the whole of this recital is under a <em>videlicet. </em>The material and substantive part of the allegation is, that the char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ter of the bank of <em>Alexandria </em>was continued by certain acts of congress to that effect and for that purpose passed; and then there comes the <em>videlicet, \u201c that is to </em>say, the act of congress passed the 15th February 1811, entitled &amp;c.\u201d In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>3 Leigh 196. the declaration alleged a presentment for payment when the bill became due and payable, <em>to </em>wit, on the 27th December, which was the <em>fourth </em>day after the time appointed for payment of the bill; yet it was held the plaintiff might prove presentment on the <em>third </em>day. See also 7 Moore 266. and 1 Bing. 23. where exactness as to the day is held immaterial, as the date of presentation was statedi under a <em>scilicit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Lastly, it was designed, we suppose, by the demurrer to evidence, to present the question whether <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>bond was not a discharge of the demand against <em>Taylor. </em>On this point too we are agreed, that as it was not proved that it was accepted as a satisfaction, or that it had been paid, it did not extinguish the demand against <em>Taylor. Thompson </em>was a mere guarantee; and the contract of a guarantee or surety, or other person only collaterally bound, though under seal, does not by operation of law, extinguish the debt of the principal. <em>White </em>v. <em>Cuyler, </em>6 T. R. 176. The admission that the guarantee is only collaterally bound, implies that the principal still remains directly bound. <em>Taylor's </em>estate is certainly indebted to somebody. It was confessedly indebted to the bank; and, unless <em>Thompson's </em>bond was accepted as a discharge, or has been paid by <em>Thompson, Taylor's </em>estate is certainly not yet indebted to him, and must, therefore, continue indebted to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\"> <em>New York </em>edi. of 1820.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"A6e\"> <em>Ingraham's </em>edi.
