That a written agreement was drawn, hearing, date the 5th of <em>January, </em>between <em>Graves, Stochdell </em>and the plaintiff, wherein the two former covenanted to pay the plaintiff bonds assigned by <em>Graves; </em>but there being no witnesses present, it was agreed that the plaintiff and <em>Stochdell </em>should sign, and <em>Graves </em>should witness it at that time; and that when the parties met again, a new writing should be drawn and executed by them all. That the agreement so executed by the plaintiff and <em>Stochdell, </em>and Witnessed by <em>Graves, </em>was left in the possession of the latter. That the plaintiff had in consequence of that agreement, soon afterwards conveyed the lands to <em>Graves </em>at the' request of <em>Stochdell. </em>That <em>Graves </em>has refused to assign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>bonds, or to give up the said written agreement to the plaintiff, and that <em>Stochdell </em>is insolvent. Therefore, the bill prays, that <em>Graves </em>may be decreed to pay to the plaintiff the balance due with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-5\">The answer of <em>Graves </em>admits, he attested the agreement as a witness, and kept possession of it at the request of the plaintiff and <em>Stochdell; </em>but states, that the contract was made by them whilst he was asleep; and that he jwas called up out of his sleep to attest it. That <em>Stochdell </em>applied to him for the loan of some bonds, which request he complied with; and that <em>Stochdell </em>asked <em>M\u2019Call, </em>if they would do for the present ? who answered, yes, if <em>Graves </em>will endorse them. That he did endorse them to the amount of 163/. <em>9s. 6d. </em>for which a receipt is endorsed on the agreement. Denies he ever contracted with the plaintiff for the land, or that he ever agreed to assign any other bonds, than those before-mentioned to have been assigned by him. Denies that he agreed to execute another agreement; but admits the plaintiff has conveyed the land to him; he having purchased it of <em>Stochdell, </em>to whom he paid a valuable consideration for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-6\">The agreement, after reciting the sale to <em>Stochdell </em>for the sum of 450/., goes on to say, <em>\u201cto </em>be paid in bonds, which is to be endorsed to the said <em>M\u2019Call, </em>by the said <em>Stochdell </em>and <em>Francis Graves.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-7\">The deposition fully proves <em>Graves\u2019s </em>responsibility; and the County Court decreed, that he should pay to the plaintiff the balance due, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-8\">From this decree <em>Graves </em>petitioned for, and obtained an appeal to the High Court of Chancery by order of the said Court; where the decree of the County Court was after-wards affirmed, with this addition, that <em>M\u2019Call </em>on receiving his money, should assign his claim against <em>Stochdell </em>by an irrevocable power of attorney to <em>Graves. </em>From this decree of affirmance, <em>Graves </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-9\">Copland.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-10\">The defendant having attested the paper, it is evidence of his knowledge of its contents, especially as he has not denied it in his answer. But, it is further proved by the endorsement, which speaks of the within bonds, <em>[Mocatta </em>et al. v. Murgatroyd,] 1 P. Wms. 393; <em>[Hobbs </em>v. Norton,] 1 Vern. 136. The reasoning in which cases ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>plies more forcibly to that at bar, where the knowledge is not denied by the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-7\"><em>Randolph, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWOr\">The contract of <em>January </em>was with the knowledge of <em>Graves; </em>who confesses the discourse; and admits he was informed of the bargain. But, in addition to this, the cases cited by Mr. <em>Copland, </em>expressly apply; and prove the presumption. The writings were left with .him, and he desired the deed to be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-8\">The Court will direct the Court of. Chancery, to give leave to <em>M\u2019 Call </em>to resort thither to charge the land in respect of the lien, should the decree not be satisfied out .of the personal estate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b386-9\">PENDLETON, President,</author>\n<p id=\"Aym\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The questions are, 1st. Whether <em>Graves </em>was originally liable for this demand, either'as principal or security, for it' matters not which? If he was, then, whether, he was discharged <em>hy M\u2019Call\u2019s </em>acceptance of <em>Stockdell\u2019s </em>bond, and the subsequent proceedings on it?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">We have not a moment\u2019s doubt, but that <em>Graves </em>was security for <em>Stockdell\u2019's </em>assigning good bonds; which <em>Graves </em>was to unite in the endorsement of, and, consequently, to become answerable for their success in payment. His idle story of having been waked from sleep to witness the agreement, without knowing its contents, if it deserved other notice, than the just ridicule bestowed on it by the <em>Chancellor, </em>is fully refuted by his having by the loan and endorsement of the bonds, paid in part, so far joinedin the execution of the agreement; and by his subsequent acknowledgment, as proved by the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">. His second objection is, that he carried a message from <em>M\u2019Call </em>to <em>Stockdell, </em>to send his bond for payment of the balance; that-he carried that bond on the 19th of <em>January, </em>to <em>M\u2019Call, </em>with a letter from <em>Stockdell, to </em>convey the land to the defendant, who had then purchased it; the bond was accepted by <em>M\u2019Call, </em>and the property conveyed, by which it is insisted that <em>Graves </em>was exonerated, if he was originally liable; and the dignity of the answer is relied on to establish, as well the fact, as the consequence.^</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">As to the fact, \u201cthat the bond of <em>Stockdell </em>was given and accepted, and the property conveyed to <em>Graves,\u201d </em>it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>not in controversy; but, that the effect, whether it operated as a discharge of <em>Graves? </em>is to be drawn from the <em>nature of the transaction, </em>and from the <em>understanding of the parties at the time.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">As to the 1st. The agreement was, that <em>Stockdell </em>should pay good bonds, endorsed by Graves, by the 1st of <em>March; Stockdell\u2019s </em>bond was to pay good bonds by the 1st of <em>March; </em>which bonds <em>he </em>would make <em>himself </em>liable for, as endorser. This requiring the endorsement of <em>Stockdell </em>only, differs in terms from the agreement, and would give the appearance of discharging <em>Graves </em>from his responsibility; but that appearance is changed, when coupled with the letter accompanying the bond, referring to the <em>agreement; </em>which was to be delivered to <em>M\u2019Call, </em>when it was performed <em>on his </em>part, by a conveyance, and delivering possession of the property. To no purpose was it to be delivered to him, if it was fulfilled also on the part of <em>Stockdell, </em>since it would be then of no consequence to either. The purpose of delivery could only be to enable <em>M\u2019Call </em>to resort to Graces finally, if <em>Stockdell </em>should fail in performing his bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">And how did the parties understand it?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">As soon as <em>Stockdell </em>failed in delivering the bonds, we find <em>M\u2019Call </em>applying to <em>Graves </em>for the agreement at several times, without effect; and, at last, is induced to drop that pursuit, upon the <em>repeated acknowledgment </em>of <em>Graves </em>that he was ultimately answerable; in confidence of which, like a humane creditor, willing to ease the security, he commenced his suit against <em>Stockdell, </em>to endeavor to get the money. But this proving fruitless, and he'not yet furnished with the agreement, he commenced this suit to have it brought forth and to obtain the benefit of it: All indicating that he never considered <em>Graves </em>as discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">And how did <em>Graves </em>understand it?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The testimony of <em>Stokes M\u2019Call </em>and <em>Miller </em>are full and plain, that he never considered himself as discharged, even as late as <em>July </em>following, six months after <em>Stockdell\u2019s </em>bond had been given: and there being two positive witnesses, corroborated by the written papers, the answer of <em>Graves </em>loses the dignity contended for.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">. Upon the whole, we have no doubt, but that <em>Graves </em>was originally security for this demand, and that his responsibility has never been extinguished by any of the subsequent proceedings. It is then objected that the decree should have been for the assignment of bonds, and not for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the money: But it would be very unjust to compel <em>M.\u2019Call to take </em>bonds now, (which he should have had ten years past,) and put him to the delay of new suits on them. Stock-<em>dell, </em>in whose place <em>Graves </em>is, by not delivering the bonds in time, lost the alternative, and must now pay the money. It was truly said, that a Court of Equity would not charge a security further than he is bound at law; but, if a security bound at law, cannot be charged there, for want of the instrument, of which the creditor is deprived by accident or fraud, a Court of Equity will restore the paper to its legal force. An instance is put, of a lost bond; but the present case is much stronger, the agreement being in the hands of the security and withheld by him..<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The part of the decree directing the assignment of <em>M\u2019 Call\u2019s </em>judgment to <em>Graves, </em>by an irrevocable power of attorney, was just and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">The decree is affirmed, with costs; both debt and costs to be paid out of the estate of <em>Graves </em>in the hands of the administrators, if sufficient; without prejudice to any suit, which the appellee may think proper to commence against the heirs of <em>Graves, </em>to subject the land conveyed, in their hands, to the-satisfaction of his demand, if necessary.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-11\">[* <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Webber </em>et ux., 1 Wash. 274; and see <em>East-India Co. </em>v <em>Boddam, </em>9 Ves. <em>jun. </em>464; <em>Skip </em>v. <em>Huey </em>et al., 3 Atk. 93.] Rand. 53; <em>Wilson </em>et al. v. <em>Graham\u2019s </em>ex\u2019r. et al., 5 Munf 297; <em>Bayley </em>v. <em>Greenleaf </em>et al., 7 Wheat. 46; <em>Gilman </em>v <em>Brown, </em>et al., 1 Mason, 212;</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b388-12\">[\u2020 See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Scot, </em>2 Wash. 141; <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Bibb, </em>4 H. &amp; M. 113; <em>Hatcher\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r. v. <em>Hatcher's </em>ex\u2019rs., 1 <em>Kauffelt </em>et al. v. <em>Bower, 7 </em>Serg. &amp; Raw. 64; <em>Semple </em>v. <em>Burd, </em>Ibid, 286.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
