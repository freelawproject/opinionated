The father put the son in possession of both parcels thus laid off for him; and then devised the same to him by his will, by particular description and reference to the boundaries, as containing <em>a hundred </em>acres. <em>William Erskine </em>held the land under his father\u2019s will, for many years, and then contracted to sell it to <em>Michael Alexander; </em>Alexander, at the time of the contract, knowing the land as well as <em>Erskine, </em>the boundaries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>of it, and the history of the title, and both parties, without question, supposing it to contain <em>a hundred </em>acres, and no more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AF2\">The contract between them for the sale and purchase of tjle janc\u00a1g (g0 far as material in this controversy) was in these words: \u201c Article of agreement between <em>W. Erskine </em>and <em>Michael Alexander, </em>both of <em>Monroe </em>county, witnesseth\u2014that the said <em>Erskine </em>hath this day bargained and sold unto the said <em>Alexander, </em>his tract of land near <em>Union, </em>whereon A. M. now lives, joining the lands of M. E. &amp;c. containing 100 acres, for the sum of 2000 dollars, to be paid in one, two and three years, in equal annual instalments.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-5\">Possession of the land was delivered by <em>Erskine </em>to <em>Alexander, </em>immediately after the contract was made. But before any thing further was done in execution of it, on either part, <em>Alexander, </em>with <em>Erskin\u00e9s </em>knowledge and consent, sold the land to <em>Andreio Bierne, </em>who took upon him the performance of the contract on the part of the vendee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">Sometime afterwards, and before the purchase money was paid, <em>Erskine, </em>still supposing the parcel of land to be only <em>a hundred </em>acres, offered to make a conveyance of it, as containing that quantity, to Bierne; upon which (as was clearly proved) <em>Bierne </em>asked <em>Erskine, </em>whether the -land had ever been surveyed? <em>Erskine </em>answered, that H. A. had run off <em>ninety-four </em>acres of it, and his father had got A. E. and H. O. to lay <em>off six </em>acres more, but that it had not been surveyed, all together, that he knew of. And then <em>Bierne </em>said, that he was going to <em>Alabama </em>in a few days, and he wished <em>Erskine </em>would let the matter stand till he should return home, and have it surveyed <em>; </em>that he wished to know, whether there were <em>a hundred </em>acres of it, or not: to which <em>Erskine </em>assented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AU\"><em>Erskine </em>had a survey of the land made, by which it was ascertained that it contained <em>a hundred and thirteen </em>acres; upon which he required <em>Bierne </em>to pay him for the surplus <em>thirteen </em>acres, at the rate of 20 dollars per acre, insisting that the contract was for a sale of the land by the acre. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>Bierne </em>insisted, that it was a sale in gross, of the whole parcel of land for 2000 dollars, which he paid, and refused to pay for the surplus <em>thirteen </em>acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ag1\">Whereupon, <em>Erskine </em>exhibited his bill against <em>Alexander </em>and Bierne, in the superiour court of chancery of Greenbrier, praying a specific execution of the contract according to his interpretation of it, and that the defendants should be compelled to pay him for the surplus <em>thirteen </em>acres at 20 dollars per acre, and exhibiting the survey that lie had had made, by which it appeared that the parcel contained <em>a hundred and thirteen </em>acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\"><em>Alexander </em>and Bierne, in their answers, both insisted, that the contract was a sale in gross, of the whole parcel, whatever might be the quantity, for 2000 dollars, and that the whole of the purchase money having been paid to the vednor, they were entitled to a conveyance from him, without paying for the surplus <em>thirteen </em>acres. Neither of them questioned the accuracy of the survey exhibited by <em>Erskine </em>with his bill, or controverted the fact that the parcel contained <em>a hundred, and thirteen </em>acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\">The facts of the case, as above stated, were proved. And there was parol evidence also adduced to prove, that <em>Erskine </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>both, in the treaty between them on the subject, intended a sale and purchase by the acre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-7\">The survey exhibited by <em>Erskine </em>with his bill, appeared to have been made by his direction, without notice to <em>Alexander </em>or <em>Bierne: </em>yet the defendants did not ask that a <em>new </em>survey should be made, and none was ordered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-8\">The chancellor, holding that <em>Erskin\u00e9s </em>interpretation of the contract of sale was right,\u2014that it was a sale by the acre,\u2014decreed, that the defendants should pay him for the surplus <em>thirteen </em>acres at the rate of 20 dollars per acre, and that he, on receiving such payment, should make a conveyance of the title. From this decree, the defendants appealed to.this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-9\">The cause Avas argued here, by the <em>attorney general </em>for the appellants, and <em>Johnson </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>1. The principal question was, Whether the agreement itself, without reference to the conduct of the parties, imported a sale by the acre, or a sale in gross, in which the vendee took the hazard of a defect, and the vendor that of an excess, in the quantity? \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-10\">2. The <em>attorney general </em>insisted, that parol evidence was not admissible to explain the written agreement between the parties, and that the court must look to that alone, to ascertain the terms of the contract. And <em>Johnson </em>admitted, that the parol evidence of what passed between <em>Erskine </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>in the treaty between them which resulted in the agreement, ought to be disregarded; but he said, that the proof as to the conduct of the parties, in regard to the execution of the agreement after it was made, was proper to shew their understanding of it; and that <em>Bierne\u2019s </em>demand of a survey, and <em>Erskine\u2019s </em>acquiescence in it, plainly evinced that they both understood it to be a sale by the acre.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-11\">3. The <em>attorney general </em>objected, that the survey exhibited with the bill, on which the chancellor founded his decree, was an <em>ex parte </em>one, and that he ought to have ordered a survey, to ascertain the quantity with accuracy, before he proceeded to decree the purchase money for the alleged excess of quantity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-12\"><em>Johnson </em>answered, that the objection was too late in this court: the appellants, in the court of chancery, nowise questioned the accuracy of the survey exhibited by the appellee with his bill; they had controverted his claim there, upon an admission, in effect, that there was an excess of <em>thirteen </em>acres; they did not ask for a new survey.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b82-13\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"APk\">It would be wrong to let in parol evidence to explain or alter the written agreement for the sale of the land. We must take the agreement uninfluenced by that evidence, since there is no allegation in the pleadings of fraud, surprize or mistake. Yet we may resort to the cotemporary and subsequent acts of the parties themselves (as this court has said-in several cases) to shew how they understood the contract. And I will remark here, that I consider <em>Bierne </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>as so far identified with Alexander,\u2014as having so completely taken his place,\u2014that his acts may be taken as the acts of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"A7J\">The contract itself impresses me with the idea, that both buyer and seller thought, that the one was selling and the other buying <em>a hundred </em>acres of land at 20 dollars per acre, making 2000 dollars for the <em>hundred </em>acres. <em>Erskine </em>sells his tract <em>containing a hundred acres. </em>This seems to me, not a description, but a representation of (quantity, which would bind him to make good the quantity of <em>a hundred </em>acres, for <em>2000 </em>dollars. If so, the obligation ought surely, to be reciprocal; binding <em>Alexander </em>to pay for any excess.The whole conduct of <em>Bierne </em>shews, that he understood the sale to be by the acre: he refused a deed without a previous survey, and it was only after the survey shewed an excess, that he took the opposite ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">I do not think it necessary to send back the case for another survey. There was not the shadow of a contest in the court below on that point. The parties received the survey, and went to hearing without exception to it; it is too late to take it here. I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b83-7\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A2A\">I think the decree clearly right. I consider the original contract between the parties, as having been entered into under an innocent mistake of both as to the quantity of land contained in the tract conveyed. That tract was held by <em>Erskine </em>under his father\u2019s will, and <em>Alexander </em>so understood it to have been. By that will, <em>a hundred </em>acres were devised to Erskine, which it seems had been carefully laid off for that quantity; for <em>ninety-four </em>acres were laid off first, and then <em>six </em>acres more were laid off to complete the quantity which the father designed to give to this son. No wonder, then, that he supposed he held exactly <em>a hundred </em>acres; and no wonder that <em>Alexander </em>also so understood it. It was not a case in which hazard was incurred or eschewed by either party. It was a case (as the whole transaction clearly proves) in which each took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>^ ^01\u2019 granted, that there was that identical quantity, and in therefore, as there proves to be an excess, it appears there was an innocent mistake on both sides. Against this, either was entitled to relief, according to well received principles, and on the authority of <em>Quesnel </em>v. <em>Woodlief now </em>well reported 6 Call 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">If the case was doubtful in this view of it, it is clear in another. <em>Erskine </em>being prepared to make a deed before the <em>excess </em>was discovered, <em>Bierne, </em>who was at that time the party concerned, inquired of <em>Erskine </em>whether it had been surveyed; and learning that it had not been surveyed, all together, he said, he was going to <em>Alabama, </em>and wished <em>Erskine </em>to let it stand till he returned home, and could have it surveyed; that he wished to know <em>whether </em>there was <em>a hundred </em>acres of it or not. Why ? What had the ascertaining of that fact to do with making the deed? It must be understood, as conveying his interpretation of the contract, that there was to be a hundred acres in the tract. To this <em>Erskine </em>assented; he agreed to wait. A survey was made, and when there turned out to be an excess, instead of a deficiency, <em>Bierne </em>refused to pay for the excess. In <em>Fleet </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>6 Munf. 188. the tract was actually sold for 15 dollars per acre; yet the purchaser having agreed to take the tract by the old survey, was held to be bound by that agreement, though in conflict with the terms of the contract. So here, <em>Bierne </em>having insisted that there should be a survey, with no other possible view than to get a deduction, if there was a deficiency, and <em>Erskine </em>having assented to it, the parties must abide the result. Whether we consider the transaction as a new agreement or not, it is the same thing. If it was a new agreement, by which compensation was to be made for risque or deficiency, then <em>Bierne </em>is clearly bound. If we look upon it only in the light of <em>Bierne\u2019s </em>insisting on that as the true interpretation of the old agreement, and <em>Erskine\u2019s </em>acquiescing, <em>Bierne </em>cannot now be permitted to recede from the ground he has taken, when the fact has turned out differently from what he expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
