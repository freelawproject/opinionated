That <em>Donally \u00bfp Steele, </em>pending <em>Ginatt's </em>action against them on the replevin bond, had recovered two judgments against <em>Ginatt </em>before a justice of the peace, one for 18 dollars, and the other for 20 dollars, with interest and costs, and had thereupon sued out writs of <em>ca. sa. </em>upon which <em>Ginatt </em>was taken in custody, and afterwards discharged as insolvent, he surrendering in his schedule of effects, his claim against <em>Donally Sp Steele </em>on their replevin bond. And that <em>Ginatt </em>was bound as special bail for one <em>Smith </em>in an action <em>which Donally </em>had brought against <em>Smith, </em>and that <em>Smith </em>had absconded. And the prayer of the bill was for an injunction to inhibit <em>Ginatt </em>from executing his judgment at law upon the replevin bond, on the ground that the 35 barrels of salt he had distrained was really, at the time, the property of <em>Donally Sp Steele, </em>and that the dismission of their action of <em>replevin </em>without a trial of the merits, was accidental ; or at least, that the plaintiffs\u2019 just claims against <em>Ginatt </em>upon the magistrate\u2019s judgments, and <em>Donally''s </em>claim against him as special bail of <em>Smith, </em>should be set-off against his judgment against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\"><em>Ginatt, </em>in his answer, denied that <em>Mr. Wilson </em>had been retained by <em>Donally Sp Steele </em>in their action of <em>replevin </em>against him, and shewed that that action was continued on the docket for nineteen months before it was dismissed for want of a declaration. And he demurred to so much of the bill as sought to open the question, whether there was any rent in arrear and due to him from <em>Cheek, </em>at the time of his distress for rent, or whether thp salt distrained was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>property of <em>Donally Sp Steele. </em>As to the set-offs claimed in the bill, he alleged, that he had other demands against <em>Donally Sp </em>Steele, which would nearly suffice to extinguish those set-offs; and as to his obligation, as special bail of <em>Smith </em>to Donally, he objected, that that would furnish no ground of set-off, until he should be made liable as bail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\">There were several depositions taken and filed by the plaintiffs, to prove that the 35 barrels of salt, which had been distrained by Ginatt, really belonged to them. And it appeared, that <em>Mr. Wilson </em>ordered the writ of <em>replevin </em>for <em>Donally Sp Steele </em>against <em>Ginatt; </em>but that a few days after, he informed them, that he should withdraw from the cause, in consequence of his being retained as <em>Ginatt\u2019s </em>counsel in several other cases, and that <em>Donally Sp Steele </em>acquiesced, and said they would retain other counsel. They never, in fact, retained any other counsel to prosecute the suit for them. It appeared also (as the answer alleged) that the action of <em>replevin </em>was continued on the docket for nineteen months, before it was dismissed for want of a declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">Pending the suit, the plaintiff <em>Steele </em>and the defendant <em>Ginatt </em>died; and it was revived against <em>Ginatt\u2019s </em>administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">The chancellor, on a hearing, allowed the surviving plaintiff three set-offs, one for 15 dollars 50 cents and one for 20 dollars (being the two magistrate\u2019s judgments recovered against Ginatt), and a third for 35 dollars 16 cents (being a balance due from <em>Ginatt </em>for prison fees, while he was in custody under the writs of <em>ca. sa.), </em>with interest on each &amp;c., and as to so much he perpetuated the injunction; and he dissolved it as to the residue of <em>Ginatt\u2019s </em>judgment at law; and decreed, that the plaintiff should pay the defendant his costs. The plaintiff appealed from the decree to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-9\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-10\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b381-11\">B\u00edtocKEmmoTTGH, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ANS\">I think the decree should be affirmed. The appellant had no right to come into equity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>after his great <em>laches </em>in prosecuting his action of <em>replevin. </em>The excuse he alleges for his negligence, has no foundation. The attorney whom he employed at first, and who ordered the writ against <em>Ginatt, </em>applied to him to be released from jjjg engagement, and the appellant agreed that he might withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">As to the decree for costs, I think that also right. The injunction was dissolved, except as to the sum of 71 dollars 66 cents, which the chancellor allowed as a good set-off against <em>Ginatt\u2019s </em>judgment. That sum was composed of two judgments on magistrate\u2019s warrants, which <em>Donally </em>had recovered against <em>Ginatt, </em>and for which he had taken him in execution, and of the jail fees for supporting <em>Ginatt </em>while in custody. The judgment of <em>Ginatt </em>against <em>Donally </em>and others on the replevin bond, was rendered in the circuit court after the two magistrate\u2019s judgments were rendered, and after the jail expenses were incurred. If <em>Donally </em>had applied by motion to the circuit court, to allow him a credit, for the amount of the two judgments and the jail fees, on the execution which <em>Ginatt </em>might issue on his judgment against him, that court would have heard the application, and allowed the credit. There would have been, then, no necessity for his applying to a court of equity to allow him the set-offs, since he could have obtained them as well by. applying to the court of law. I do not mean to say, that the chancellor did not rightly allow them; at any rate, the appellee does not complain of it. But, surely, the allowance of these set-offs to the appellant, affords no reason why the costs of the suit in chancery should be thrown on the appellee, who has substantially prevailed in that court, and in this court.</p>\n<author id=\"b382-5\">Care,, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ajj8\">The decree should be affirmed. The statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 113. \u00a7 23, 4, 5. pp. 451, 2. prescribes a particular mode in which a third person, claiming property dis-trained for rent, shall proceed to contest the right. <em>Donally Sp Steele </em>resorted to that mode; and it was their own gross neglect alone that prevented them from having a trial. For nineteen months, they seem wholly to have abandoned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>suit. They retained no attorney to prosecute it; for <em>Mr. Wilson </em>proves, very distinctly, that soon after ordering the writ, <em>Donally, </em>on his application, agreed that he might withdraw. On whom then could they depend? If negligence like this is to open the case to them, and raise up an equity in their favor, we must reverse the maxim, and say <em>dormientibus non vigilanlibus curat lex. </em>The decree was right for costs too. They would never have been incurred, but for the negligence of the plaintiffs; and it was the exercise of a sound discretion to make them pay them.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b383-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AW1\">To what has been said by my brother <em>Carr, </em>in which I entirely concur, I wish only to add as to the costs,\u2014that though, in general, if a party, plaintiff in injunction, succeeds in obtaining a perpetuation as to part, he is entitled to costs, and though this court may reverse for error in decreeing costs, though in all other respects the decree be affirmed <em>(Ross </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>2 Munf. 289.) yet where the party was under .no necessity of coming into equity to get his discounts allowed, he ought not to have costs. In this case, the discounts for which the injunction to <em>Ginatt\u2019s </em>judgment is perpetuated, consisted, first, of two small magistrate\u2019s judgments, on which <em>Ginalt </em>had been imprisoned by <em>Donally, </em>and on which lie swore out, surrendering as part of his schedule, this very demand against <em>Donally </em>on the replevin bond. By this act, these demands were set-off against each other, in effect, for the amount when recovered, must to the extent of the two magistrate\u2019s judgments be paid over, or (which is the same thing) allowed to <em>Donally </em>in part payment of <em>Ginatt\u2019s </em>judgment. Secondly, the set-off of 35 dollars, balance allowed for the prison fees, could not entitle the appellant to the costs of this suit in equity, because he asked for no such set-off in the bill. It has been allowed him without being demanded, and he has, therefore, more reason to be thankful than to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
