The jury .found a special verdict, which was adjudged insufficient by the Court and quashed. Upon the next trial, the plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion, which stated, that the defendant offered in evidence to the jury a copy of an execution without producing a copy of the judgment on which it issued; that the plaintiff objected to it; but the objection was over-ruled and the evidence permitted to go to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-9\">. The jury found a special verdict which stated, \u201cthat on the 10th of <em>August, </em>1788, an execution issued in behalf of <em>Toliver Craig </em>against <em>Richard </em>and <em>Thomas Bandy, </em>on which seven negroes were taken (the names not endorsed,) and a forthcoming bond executed by <em>John Hook </em>and <em>Absolam Jordan, </em>in <em>August, </em>1788, in these words: <em>Hails-ford, </em>Franklin <em>county, August </em>21 <em>st, </em>1788, <em>we </em>John Hook <em>and </em>Absolam Jordan, <em>are held and firmly bound unto </em>Hugh Innis, <em>Esqr. Sheriff of </em>Franklin <em>county, in the sum of four hundred and fifty pounds, current money </em>ofVirginia, <em>to deliver unto the said Sheriff the following property, </em>viz. <em>seven negroes, two horses, two beds and two blankets, also a Dutch oven, the same to be delivered on the </em>11 <em>th of next month, being taken in execution to satisfy </em>Toliver Craig, <em>and to satisfy public taxes against </em>Richard Bandy. <em>Witness our hands and seals this day above written, </em>John Hook, Absolam Jordan. That at <em>September </em>Court, 1788, an injunction was granted to <em>Bandy </em>to stay proceedings on the execution on his giving security by the next Court. That he failed to give such security; and, thereupon it was decreed that the plaintiffs should have the benefit of the judgment. That the Sheriff demanded the slaves, which were not delivered. That on the 25th of <em>September, </em>1788, <em>Absolam Jordan, Daniel Huddleston </em>and <em>Richard Bandy </em>executed a bill of sale to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the plaintiffs, for a negro wench named <em>Hannah, </em>and her child named <em>Jude; </em>setting forth the bill of sale <em>in hsec verba. </em>That <em>Hannah </em>is the mother of the other negroes. That the child <em>Hannah </em>has been born since the date of the bill of sale; and is in possession of the plaintiffs. That a second writ of <em>fieri facias </em>issued on the 2nd of <em>December, </em>1788; on which there was made 101/. 12s. <em>6d. </em>That another execution issued on the 16th of <em>August, </em>1790; on which there was made 51/. Is. <em>\u2018\u00bfd. </em>nett money deducting fees, &amp;e. That the plaintiff <em>Trigg </em>was allowed 20s. for keeping the said slaves whilst under execution. That <em>Eekhols </em>the deputy Sheriff of <em>Bedford, </em>who levied the ex-cution, paid to <em>John Craig, </em>52/. 10s., in <em>October </em>1790. That the plaintiff <em>Trigg </em>forbid the seizure and sale of the negroes in the declaration mentioned, seized by <em>James Eekhols </em>deputy Sheriff of <em>Bedford, </em>to satisfy the execution of <em>T. Craig, </em>assignee of <em>Hawkins </em>against the Bandys. That the said slaves continued in the possession of one of the plaintiffs, from the 25th of <em>September, </em>1788, to the seizure and sale of them. That <em>John Phelps </em>purchased the slaves in the declaration mentioned, for the said <em>William Trigg, </em>at 54/. 15s.;' and that the property was, and has been since the commencement of the suit in his possession. That <em>Daniel Huddleston </em>and <em>Absolam Jordan </em>were not possessed of any negro or negroes about the time of theirs and <em>Richard Bandy\u2019s </em>bill of sale to <em>Graham </em>and <em>Trigg, </em>for the negroes <em>Hannah, </em>&amp;c. before-mentioned. That <em>Hannah </em>mentioned as aforesaid was the property of the said Bandy, when <em>T. Craig </em>assignee of <em>Hawkins </em>first issued his execution. That when <em>Toliver Craig\u2019s </em>execution issued, the said <em>Bandy </em>had seven slaves.\u201d</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b453-4\">The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiffs, and the defendant appealed to this Court.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-5\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU9\">contended that the forthcoming bond was informal and void; that the <em>lien </em>created by the service of the execution continued; and, consequently, that the sale by <em>Bandy </em>to the plaintiff, was nugatory and of no force.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-6\"><em>Marshall, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-7\">There is nothing to shew that the execution was levied on these slaves; for, the jury have not found the fact, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the Court cannot presume it. Upon that ground alone, therefore, the defendant\u2019s title fails But, if that fact were found, still the names of the slaves were not endorsed upon the execution according to the directions of the act of Assembly; <em>\\_Oct. </em>1765, c. 22, 8 <em>Scat. Larg. </em>121, c. 134, \u00a722, <em>R. C. ed. </em>1819,] and, consequently, the defendant can derive <em>no </em>aid from the service of the execution. However, the return that a bond was taken, and the restoration of the property to <em>Bandy </em>by the Sheriff, are decisive; because the slaves were thereby clearly discharged from the execution. So that <em>Bandy </em>had power to sell them; and, therefore, the plaintiff who is a fair purchaser, has title to recover them.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b454-8\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AfJ\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that the names of the slaves ought to have been endorsed, in order to prevent purchasers from being deceived. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> That it would make no difference whether the bond taken was good or not.

But be that as it might, the Court were clearly of opinion, that by taking the second execution, he waived the first; and discharged the lien if any subsisted: Which answered the difficulty, whether there should not be a <em>venire facias de novo, </em>in order to ascertain the identity of the slaves? Because,.it could be to no purpose to ascertain that the slaves were taken on the execution; since, if it was so, the Couit were clear that the plaintiff, by taking the second execution, had waived all benefit under the first; and destroyed the lien if he had any.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-10\">[* <em>Dix </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>3 Munf. 308.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AGcm\">[\u2020 See <em>Lusk </em>v. <em>Ramsay, </em>3 Munf. 417.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
