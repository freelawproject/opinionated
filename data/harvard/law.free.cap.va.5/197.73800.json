Therefore, the bill prayed, that <em>Weaver </em>should answer the allegations thereof, and, particularly, that he should discover the date, the consideration, and the amount, of the bond of 1819; and an injunction to restrain <em>Weaver </em>from proceeding to execute his judgment at law, and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-4\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\"><em>Weaver </em>answered, that in 1814 or 1815 (he did not remember the particular date) he lent <em>Grigsby </em>the two bonds of <em>Ewell, </em>amounting to the sum mentioned in the bill, and afterwards in the same year, 1000 dollars in money; that he took no security for these loans at the time, but in May 1817 he applied to <em>Grigsby </em>for security, who thereupon gave him the bond in which <em>Foote </em>was bound as his surety, for 1636 dollars 44 cents; but he denied, that any usurious interest was included in this bond; on the contrary, the amount of <em>Ewell\u2019s </em>bonds and the 1000 dollars were added together, and only legal interest was computed from the dates of the respective loans thereof to the date of <em>Grigsby </em>and <em>Foote\u2019s </em>bond to him. And as to the other bond in the bill mentioned, he answered, that <em>Grigsby, </em>on the 1st May 1821 (not in 1819, as the bill alleged), called.on him, and, professing the great obligations he was under to him for his indulgence in not enforcing payment of the first bond, and for other services, tendered him a bond executed by <em>Grigsby </em>alone for 490 dollars 90 cents, which he at first refused to accept, telling <em>Grigsby </em>he neither expected nor desired such compensation; but, on <em>Grigsby\u2019s </em>earnest importunity, he took the bond, though he even then considered it as so much blank paper, and had since offered to return it to <em>G'igsby, </em>who had refused to receive it; and he was now convinced, that the kindness <em>Grigsby </em>then professed, in giving him this last bond, was intended to entrap him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\"><em>Grigsby </em>then amended his bill, alleging, that at the time he borrowed the 1000 dollars of <em>Weaver, </em>he agreed to give him an order on his attorney for the same amount, to be paid out of money for which the attorney was then prosecuting a suit for <em>Grigsby, </em>when the same should be recovered; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>lie gave <em>Weaver </em>the draft on his attorney, accordingly: that sometime afterwards, <em>Weaver </em>told him he was not satisfied with the draft, because of the delays in the suit which was still pending, and asked him for his bond in lieu of this draft: that thereupon, he gave <em>Weaver </em>his bond for the 490 dollars 90 cents, mentioned in <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>answer to the original bill, which sum was ascertained by <em>Weaver </em>by a calculation of usurious interest, at a rate not now recollected: that <em>Weaver, </em>however, retained the draft on the attorney for 1000 dollars, and yet held it.

As to the dates of his loans to <em>Grigsby, </em>he said, that he had stated in his answer to the. original bill, that the loan of <em>Ewell\u2019s </em>bonds was in 1814 or 1815, but the particular date he could not then nor could he now recollect, as he kept no <em>memorandum </em>in writing of the transaction; but, from circumstances, he was now induced to believe, that the loan of the bonds was in 1814, or prior thereto; he was certain the loan of the 1000 dollars was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>in 1815, and the loan of the bonds was between one and two years before: he was unable to answer as to the particular date in 1815 when the 1000 dollars was lent; he thought it was in the winter of 1814-15, or early in the spring of 1815; and he had some impression, that <em>Grigsby </em>did mention that he borrowed the money in order to subscribe for stock in the <em>Warrenton </em>bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-4\">Many affidavits of witnesses were taken and filed by the parties, which, in the opinion of the chancellor and of this court, did not establish usury in the bond of the 23rd May 1817, for 1636 dollars 44 cents, as charged in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\">The bonds of <em>Ewell, </em>which were lent by <em>Weaver </em>to <em>Grigsby, </em>were exhibited.

The object of the plaintiff is not to retain the money which he has actually received from the defendant, and used for his own purposes, but to get clear of the usury, to which the law superadds the interest and costs. He does not come full handed with proof but calls specially and particularly on the defendant for a discovery of the usury. To such bills 1 lend a willing ear: they seek not to inflict a penalty, and to make equity their hand maid in the act, but merely to escape a burden which the law has declared illegal and oppressive. Still the plaintiff\u2019s case must be made out, to entitle him to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The ground on which the bill seeks relief is, that in the bond executed by the plaintiff <em>Grigsby, </em>and <em>Foote, </em>his surety, to <em>Weaver, </em>on the 23rd May 1817, for 1636 dollars 44 cents, there is usury included, on which bond a judgment had been obtained, and an execution sued out and levied on the plaintiff\u2019s property. The rate of usury, or the amount of the excess included in the bond, the plaintiff does not state. He states, that sometime in the year 1815, he borrowed of <em>Weaver </em>two bonds of <em>Ewell, </em>amounting to 466 dollars 66 cents, and 1000 dollars in money; and that the bond of the 23rd May 1817 was executed to secure these sums, together with usurious interest. It is evident, that to establish the fact of usury, as well as the amount of it, we must ascertain when the loan was made, at least the loan of the bonds. These bonds are in the record; they are for 233 dollars 33 cents each\u2014the one is payable the 3rd February 1815, the other the 3rd February 1816; and they bear interest only from those dates. The usury is said to consist in charging interest on these bonds before they became due. Aware of the importance of fixing the date of the loan, both the bill and amended bill call for a discovery as to that. In his first answer <em>Weaver </em>says, that he lent <em>Grigsby </em>the bonds in 1814 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>or 1815, the particular day not recollected, and that sometime after, in the year 1815, he lent him the 10\u00d30 dollars, but took no security till'May 1817. Being called on by the amended bill, to answer to this point more particularly, he said, that in his answer to the original bill, he stated the loan of the bond or bonds, to have beeii in the year 1814 or 1815, but the particular date he' could not then nor could he now state, as he kept no <em>memorandum </em>of the transaction in writing ; but, from circumstances, he was now induced to believe, the loan of the bonds was in the year 1814 or previous thereto; he is certain the loan of the 1000 dollars was in 1815, and that the loan of the bonds was between one and two years before; he was unable to answer as to the particular time of the year the 1000 dollars was loaned, but he thought it was in the winter of 1814-15, or early in the spring of 1815. This leaves the date of the loan of the bonds entirely unfixed. Assuming that the 1000 dollars was lent in March or April 1815, the interest .on it, together with that on the bonds, from the\u2019 times they were payable, will overgo, somewhat, the sum of 1636 dollars 44 cents; but take the latter part of May (say 28th), it brings it to 1636 dollars 38 cents,\u2014six cents less than the bond of the 23rd May 1817. From these <em>data </em>it would seem that there was no usury in the bond for 1636 dollars 44 cents; for we know, that any small difference caused by the mistake of the calculator or the scrivener, can never affect the character of the transaction. Shall we reject this evidence given by the respondent ? He is most explicit in his declarations that no usury was included in the bond ; and this being a bill of discovery, the answer deserves more than common weight. But if we reject it, where shall we look for better evidence ? We must remember, that the plaintiff seeking to call the court of equity \u201cinto activity,\u201d must shew it satisfactory proof that there is usury, and what is its amount; otherwise, it cannot relieve him. Where shall we find this proof? in the loose and vague conversations of the parties ? They are both ways; and, certainly, the declarations of <em>Grigsby </em>are quite as strong to prove that the transaction was fair, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that it was usurious. Shall we find this proof in the conduct of the parties <em>1 </em>in the order on the attorney for 1000 dollars, and the bond for 490 dollars 90 cents ? These unquestionably look suspicious ; for presents of this kind made by a borrower to a lender, are naturally set down to the score of the trade and connexion between them: but, then, these transactions are long subsequent to the original loan, nor is there any proof so to connect them with it, as to taint it in the origin: and, moreover, if it might be permitted to have that weight, it would not support <em>this bill, </em>which seeks relief from <em>so much of the bond of </em>1636 <em>dollars </em>44 <em>cents only, </em>as is usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Great reliance is placed on the certificate of the judge of the circuit court; and it is insisted, that, as he states the verdict to be against evidence, the cases of <em>Pleasants &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>and <em>Southall </em>v. <em>M\u2019Keand &amp; al. </em>are peremptory, that the chancellor should not be satisfied, but <em>mus\u00ed </em>send the issue to another jury. I have examined those cases; and to my mind, the farthest they go, is to say, that as a general rule, the chancellor ought not to be satisfied, where the certificate is against the verdict; <em>admitting, at the </em>same time, that the rule only holds, where there is no circumstance appearing to vary the case. Thus, in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Pynes, </em>and in <em>M\u2019Rae\u2019s ex'or </em>v. <em>Wood's ex'or, </em>there were two verdicts of the jury one way, and two certificates of the judges against them; and in each case the court said, that the chancellor ought to be satisfied with the finding, notwithstanding the opinion of <em>the judge. If one verdict </em>is peremptorily to be pronounced unsatisfactory, because of a certificate against it, why is a second to be satisfactory, with the same battery against it which prostrated the first. The chancellor is not <em>obliged </em>to send an issue to a jury; he is himself the trier of facts by the constitution of the court. In his discretion, and for his convenience, he may send issues to the bar of the courts of law, or try them <em>at </em>his <em>own </em>bar, <em>for the </em>satisfaction of his conscience: would it not seem strange, then, that because he has once sent an issue to a jury, he must continue to have new trials of it, until he can get a court and jury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>agree, as to the weight of evidence ? Suppose, in the meantime, he should, have changed his mind, and upon a closer examination of the record, become satisfied that an issue was unnecessary; that the case ought to be sent to a commissioner instead of a jury; or that he had no jurisdiction : must he still persevere in sending the issue to a jury ? In the case before us, he might well change his mind; for, in my opinion, the plaintiff\u2019s proof was too defective to render an issue proper. Issues are not directed to enable parties to get a new supply of evidence where they have not enough : but, where there is clashing and conflicting evidence, leaving the fact in doubt, and rendering it necessary to weigh the character and credibility of witnesses, the chancellor, who sees them only on paper, considers that his conscience can be better satisfied by the verdict of a jury who shall see and hear them. In this case, there is no clashing. The point was to fix usury in the bond of May 1817, the consideration of which was confessedly composed of the loans of the bonds of <em>Ewell, </em>and the 1000 dollars. There was no charge, that usury had been taken on the 1000 dollars, but on the bonds only; and <em>that, </em>in calculating interest from the date of the loan, instead of the time when the bonds became due. Now, to shew this usury, it was most clear, that the date of the loan of these bonds must be somehow fixed; for without this starting point, no result could be produced. The plaintiff called on the defendant-twice for information to fix this point: he answered to each bill that he could not possibly speak as to the time, as he had taken no written <em>memorandum; </em>and the plaintiff could bring no witness to speak as to this date. Here, then, was a clear defect of proof, a failure to establish the very point upon which the usury, and the <em>quantum </em>of it, depended. It is the bounden duty of a plaintiff who calls for the solemn judgment of a court, to furnish that court with something like certainty to rest that judgment on: he may draw this from the defendant if he can; he may prove it by witnesses; he may establish it by documents; but in some way he must shew it, or he fails, and his bill should be dismissed. This is, in my mind, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>case: and instead of an issue, the bill ought to have been dismissed for defect of proof. But the chancellor sent the issue to a jury, and it is said lie was bound to obey the certificate of the judge of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Let us look a moment at this certificate. Generally, when a judge is asked to certify, he states (without detailing the proofs at all) that the weight of evidence was against the verdict; and, in such case, the chancellor can have no knowledge of what evidence was heard by the jury: but here,' the judge sets out by stating that usury was proved, and then goes into a statement of the evidence, shewing plainly on what grounds his conclusions rested; and to leave no doubt of this, he concludes his narrative, that <em>\u201c </em>such being the material facts proved, the court considered the finding of the jury clearly against evidence.\u201d Again, the judge certifies, that no other witnesses were examined, upon the trial of the issue, but such as had heretofore given their affidavits or depositions, copies of which were found in the record. Now, there being copies in the record, of all that those witnesses had before sworn, who gave testimony on the trial of the issue, can we presume, that any one then swore differently in the face of his former oath ?- if he had, would not this have utterly discredited him? and would not such a fact have been certified, when the judge was telling us he had none but the witnesses in the record? It is to be noticed too, that there was no contradiction here, between the witnesses. But, particularly, the judge was pressed to certify, that there was no such parol evidence as would fix the time when <em>EwelVs </em>bonds were lent: he said, he would not make such certificate; not that there was such proof, but because he did not choose to state the evidence his certificate rested on. This seems to me very like an admission, that there was no such proof\u2014but there did not need such admission; for, in another part of his certificate, he expressly states the proof to have been, that these bonds were lent between the 18th July 1814 and the 15th December of the same year; leaving a clear space of five months, any day of which we have as much right to assume as another. Is it possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>upon such guessing as this, to ask the decree of a court ? to ask it to say, that this or that particular sum composes the usury, and must be stricken off? I think not.</p>\n<p id=\"A4J\">Both the case, then, as presented by the record, and that certified by the judge, leave this point, this vital point, unfixed. Why, then, should the chancellor have sent back the issue? It had been before two juries; all the evidence which could be obtained, we must conclude, had been adduced: could time furnish new or better proof? On the contrary, it was every day eating away something of that which existed ; witnesses die, or forget, and documents are lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">I think, therefore, upon all these grounds, that the chancellor did right in dismissing the bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b228-6\">Brooke, <em>J</em></author>\n<p id=\"AMC\">I concur in the opinion that the decree should be affirmed. When a party comes into a court of equity for relief, he ought to make out a case by proof, and not by conjecture, in order to entitle him to it. In the case before us, it seems to be admitted, that the proofs in the record are 'defective; that it is not satisfactorily proved, when <em>Ewell\u2019s </em>bonds and the 1000 dollars were lent by <em>Weaver </em>to <em>Grigsby; </em>without which proof it is impossible to decide, whether the bond of the 23rd May 1817, on which <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>judgment at law was founded, was usurious or not. This fact was as susceptible of proof in the court of chancery, as any other fact in the case; and there being no clashing of testimony in the record, nor any impeachment of any portion of it, I think the chancellor ought to have dismissed the bill on the hearing. But he directed an issue to try the question of usury; that is, to ascertain the facts as to the date of the loan of <em>Ewell\u2019s </em>bonds, and that of the loan of the 1000 dollars; and a jury (certified by the judge to be highly respectable for intelligence and integrity) found a verdict that the bond of May 1817 was not usurious. There was some evidence adduced on the trial, which was not within the allegations of the bills. Whether this evidence influenced the judge in coming to the conclusions stated in his certificate, we do not know. That no agreement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>proved, that the loan was on <em>twelve </em>or <em>tioelve and a half per cent, </em>interest, is admitted by the judges here; yet the judge who presided at the trial of the issue, by assuming the time when the loan was made, has come to that conclusion. Weighing the verdict of the jury, which is supported by the evidence in the record, I think (admitting the chancellor was right in directing the issue) that the verdict must outweigh the certificate of the judge. Both were intended to satisfy the conscience of the chancellor; and although if the judge had certified, that the verdict was contrary to the evidence, and no more, he would have been bound to direct a new trial, yet when the certificate of the judge assumes facts, and shews that he did not believe some of the evidence which the jury may have credited (as, for instance, the evidence, that both <em>Grigsby </em>and <em>Weaver </em>had declared the bond not usurious), I cannot think the chancellor was bound to set aside the verdict; especially, as it is fairly to be inferred from the certificate, though vaguely expressed, that there was no other evidence before the jury, than that found in the depositions in the record. Usury is an offence against the statute, which ought to be well proved before a party is convicted of it: I do not mean by direct proof only, but by inevitable inference, drawn from established facts. T am of opinion, that neither existed in this case, and that the chancellor erred in directing the issue, on the ground first stated; and that he was right in dismissing the bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b229-4\">Brockenbrougii, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A8G\">dissented. He said\u2014I am disposed to pay more respect to the certificate of the judge before whom the issue in this case was tried, than the chancellor did. A series of decisions has, I think, established the general principle, that where the judge of the court of law certifies, that the verdict is against evidence, the conscience of the chancellor should not be satisfied with the finding. It is true, the object in directing the issue is to obtain the decision of the jury on the disputed matter of fact; but I can see no reason why the salutary control which the courts of law exercise over verdicts in trials at common law, should not prevail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u25a0when they are called on to superintend the trial of issues directed by a chancellor. In the former case, they will grant new trials where the verdict is palpably against evidence; i the latter case, they cannot grant a new trial, but their opinion on the verdict is just as important as when they have entire control over it. To prove that the chancellor ought not to be satisfied where the certificate of the judge is against the verdict, I refer to what is said by president <em>Pendleton </em>in the cases of <em>Pleasants &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>and <em>Southall </em>v. <em>M\u2019Keand. </em>Nor is the principle there laid down shaken by <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Pynes, </em>and <em>M\u2019Rae </em>v. <em>Woods: </em>in the former case, there had been a verdict for the plaintiff in the suit at common law and a judgment of the district court, and the case having been carried into equity by an injunction, and an issue directed, the issue was found for the same party, and heavier damages assessed than before. The certificate of the judges was not allowed to prevail over two concurring verdicts, and the opinion of the first court of law. In <em>M\u2019Rae </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>there were also two concurring verdicts, and on the trial of the last issue, the 'court certified, that there was no evidence adduced except that which appeared in the record. That evidence was contradictory; and this court was of opinion, that it was difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile it. Under these circumstances it held, that after a protracted controversy of <em>thirty-eight </em>years, and the opinions of two juries, the verdicts ought to prevail, and the dispute to end. No case has been produced, in which, after a single trial, the certificate of the judge against the verdict, has been entirely disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In the present case, the judge did not content himself with making a general certificate, that the verdict was contrary to evidence; he has certified the facts which were proved on the trial. It is urged, that he had no other evidence before him than that which appears in this record, and that the chancellor could decide for himself, whether the judge had drawn the proper inferences from that evidence, and whether that evidence did prove the facts which he certified to have been proved. I do not think it clear, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>had no other evidence than that which we see. He certitied, that there were <em>no other witnesses examined </em>than such as had heretofore given their affidavits or depositions; the direct inference from which statement, is, that there was parol evidence before him; that the witnesses, who had given their depositions, were examined <em>vivd voce </em>in open court. This is also apparent from the circumstance, that <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>counsel applied to him to certify that there was no parol evidence before the jury <em>touching the fact as to the time of the loan of Ewell\u2019s notes ; </em>leaving the strong inference that there was parol evidence touching other facts than that specified. There having been, then, parol evidence before the circuit court, we cannot say, that the chancellor liad the same evidence before him, which the judge of the circuit, court had. The witnesses, although the same, might have been examined and cross examined, on many points not noticed in their depositions, and touching numerous circumstances, which though apparently trivial, were really important, and might have had an important bearing on the main question, but which did not occur to the parties or witnesses, when their depositions were taken in the country. The record does not shew the manner of the witnesses, by which the chancellor could judge of the weight of the evidence. In short, we all know the great difference between a trial by depositions, and a trial by <em>viva voce </em>examinations; and we cannot therefore say that the chancellor had, or that this court has, the same materials on which to found a judgment that the judge of the circuit court had.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">As the judge has certified the facts which were proved before him, I think we must see whether they support the allegations of the plaintiff. If they do so, I cannot perceive how the verdict can be satisfactory; but if they are not relevant to the case, or do not support the charges in the bill, the certificate was rightly disregarded. I admit, also, that if the judge has certified facts as proved, which shew that the defendant practised usury on the plaintiff, yet if the plaintiff has made no such allegation in his bills, the facts so certified, however important and however true, can have no weight. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Oa comparing the pleadings with the certificate, I have come to the conclusion, that some of the facts certified ought to have been held fatal to the claim of the plaintiff, for the whole amount of the bond on which the judgment at law was rendered,\u2014whilst others, though proved, were not such as the plaintiff had complained of, and were therefore out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The bill charges, amongst other things, that in December 1815, the sum of 1000 dollars in cash, and two bonds of <em>Ewell </em>of which the principal was 466 dollars 66 cents, were lent by the defendant to the plaintiff; that on the 23rd-May 1817, the plaintiff with <em>Foote </em>as his surety executed a bond to the defendant for 1636 dollars 44 cents; that the defendant exacted of him an usurious rate of interest on the money and bonds so lent, which usurious interest <em>was included in, and made part of the bond. </em>The issue directed, was to ascertain, whether that bond was given on an usurious consideration. The judge certified, that the three \u2022 following facts were proved: 1. that <em>Ewell\u2019s </em>bonds were lent between the 18th July and the 15th December 1814; 2. that afterwards, about and before the 15th December 1815, the sum of 1000 dollars was lent; and 3. that on the 23rd May 1817, the bond for 1636 dollars 44 cents was executed, and that it was compounded of <em>Ewell\u2019s </em>bonds with interest <em>from the date of the loan or transfer of them, </em>and the 1000 dollars with interest from the date of that loan. These three facts are within the allegations of the bill, and support them. The bonds of <em>Ewell </em>were payable at periods posteriour to the transfer of them, namely, one of them on the 3rd of February 1815, and the other on the 3rd February 1816. If, then, <em>Gh'igsby </em>was to pay interest on them from a prior period, and the principal with this additional interest entered into the composition of the bond of 23rd May 1817, can there be any question, that it was tainted with usury ?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">I admit, it is settled, that a man may lawfully purchase a <em>bond fide </em>bond at a discount; <em>Hansbrough </em>v. <em>Baylor, </em>2 Munf. 36. But I have yet to learn, that a lender may take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>a <em>premium </em>for a bond, that he may exact more for it than its value, without subjecting himself to the penalties of usury. The statute declares, that no person shall upon any contract take, directly or indirectly, for the loan of any commodity, above the value of six dollars for the forbearance of 100 dollars for one year. It was once doubted, whether the practice of bankers in discounting bills, by taking interest <em>in advance, </em>was not within the statutes of usury, for <em>\u201c </em>upon a nice calculation,\u201d said lord <em>Mansfield, \u201c </em>it will be found, that the practice of the hank in discounting bills exceeds the legal rate of interestyet it was determined not to be usury on the ground of long established mercantile usage, which the statute did not mean to destroy; Cowp. 115. So with us, it is looked upon as a settled point, that, in banking transactions, it is not usury to take interest in advance on discounts or loans: and this is on the ground, that an authority to discount or to make discounts, granted by all the hank charters, by the very force of the terms, necessarily includes an authority to take interest in advance; <em>Stribbling </em>v. <em>Bank of the Valley, </em>5 Rand. 144. <em>Fleckner </em>v. <em>U. S. Bank, </em>8 Wheat. 338. But, in the ordinary transactions of buying and selling, transferring and assigning bonds, I know of no mercantile usage, nor of any statutory enactment, that will authorize the lender to take more for the bond than the legal rate of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">I understood the counsel for the appellee as endeavouring to obviate the force of this objection, by stating cases in which it may be lawful to give more for a bond than the legal rate. Thus, if a <em>Louisiana </em>or <em>Mississippi </em>bond, where the rate of interest is higher than with us, be sold here, such a contract would be lawful. This may be so, but the cases are not alike. The bonds in this case are <em>Virginia </em>bonds. The transferring of them, for the purpose of lending their avails to another, will not, according to my apprehension, justify the taking for them more than the law allows.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">It has been urged, that notwithstanding the certificate of the judge that these facts were proved, yet the chancellor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ought to have disregarded it, on the ground, that there was probably a mistake in the calculation, by which mistake the amount due at the time of taking the bond of the 23rd May 1817, was made <em>larger </em>than it ought to be. I agree that a miscalculation would never charge a party <em>with usury: but </em>it will not be denied, that whenever the intention is <em>to take </em>more than legal interest, the party is chargeable with usury, although he may never have heard that such was the law, and may not have known that he was violating it. <em>Chillers </em>v. <em>Deane, </em>4 Rand. 410. But here, there is no ground for believing, that there was a miscalculation: the judge certifies, that the interest on the bonds was calculated from the time they were lent. I know the usury thus taken, was small in amount; but, nevertheless, it vitiated the contract, and justified the appellant in coming into a court of equity to compel the lender to receive his principal money without any interest, under the 3rd section of the statute against usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">I said, there were some facts certified by the judge to have been proved, which were not complained of, and therefore are out of the case. These facts are, that for the loan of 1000 dollars about and before the 15th December 1815, the plaintiff agreed to pay the defendant at the rate of <em>twelve or twelve and a half per cent, </em>interest, and that on the 23rd May 1817, when the consolidating bond was taken, that agreement was subsisting, and continued to subsist till May 1821, when the usurious bond of 490 dollars 90 cents was taken. These certainly are most important facts, and if there were allegations in the bill to justify such proof being made, I could not hesitate to say, that the whole of the contract, and not a part only, was usurious, and that another jury ought to pass on the whole subject. I think too, that the record exhibits cogent proof to justify the judge in certifying, that such were the facts. How else can we rationally account for the bond of May 1821, for 490 dollars 90 cents? Calculate the interest on 1000 dollars <em>at twelve and a half per cent, </em>from the 23rd May 1817 to the 1st May 1821, when the smaller bond was given, and it pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>duces almost exactly that very sum. I know, that an agreement to pay illegal interest <em>after </em>the loan made, will not vitiate the contract of loan, unless it can he fairly inferred, that such agreement or understanding existed at the time of the loan; but a bond taken at a subsequent period, with proof of declarations by the lender, that he did lend at the rate which the bond exhibits, may justify the inference, that the loan and the corrupt agreement were simultaneous. And I should not think, that such inference could bo repelled by the flimsy pretext, that a draft at one time of 1000 dollars, and a bond at another for nearly 500 dollars, both of which were actually delivered and received, were gratuitous donations from the borrower to the lender. It is an absurd and incredible proposition, that a needy and embarrassed borrower should make a present of large sums to a thriving wealthy lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">But it so happens, that the proof on this subject, however strong and apparent to the mind of the judge, was unavailing. He did not probably attend much to the pleadings, but looked to the issue he was required to try. The original bill no where alleges, that at the time of the loan of the 1000 dollars, there was any agreement to pay any usurious interest for the use of it, other than the usury which was included in the bond. Nor is there any allegation in the original bill, that at the time of taking the bond of the 23rd May 1817, the agreement to pay <em>such </em>usurious interest was subsisting, and continued to subsist till May 1821. On the contrary, after charging that the whole of the previous usury was included in the bond, it merely charges, that at a subsequent period, namely, in 1819, another bond for about 500 dollars was exacted, which was the <em>extra </em>and usurious interest on the debt, evidenced by the consolidating bond of the 23rd May 1817. Nor does the amended bill allege any agreement, at the time of the loan of the 1000 dollars, to pay <em>twelve or twelve and a half per </em>cent.; but it alleges, that for the use of it, the plaintiff agreed to give the draft on his counsel before mentioned. This agreement for the draft is not the one meant by the judge, when he says it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>agreed to give <em>twelve or twelve and a half per cent.; </em>but, on the contrary, he says, that this draft was given sometime afterwards, without saying that it was given in pursuance of a previous agre\u00e9ment. The allegation in the amended bill is different entirely from that which the <em>judge says was </em>proved, and, therefore, those two important facts proved before him, namely, the agreement to pay <em>twelve or twelve and a half per cent., </em>at the time of the loan of the 1000 dollars, and the subsistence of that agreement when the bond of May 1817 was executed, are entirely out of the case. Nor does the amended bill allege any new agreement at this latter period for that usury, but places the bond of 490 dollars 90 cents on the footing of a substitute for the before mentioned draft. But, although these last facts are out of the allegations of the bill, and therefore the certificate of the judge as to them should be disregarded, yet the other facts, which he certifies to have been proved, support the allegations; and I, therefore, think that the conscience of the chancellor should not have been satisfied with <em>the </em>verdict, and that it should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">The counsel for the appellee made a calculation from <em>data, </em>which he supposed the answer furnishes, by which he made the amount due from <em>Grigsby </em>on the 23rd May 1817, within a few cents of the amount of the bond on that day executed, without calculating the interest on the bonds from the day of their transfer, but from the days on <em>which </em>they respectively became due. This has been adopted also by my brotheTCarr. It is founded on the supposition, that the 1000 dollars were lent <em>late </em>in the spring of 1815. If, instead of taking a day not <em>late </em>but <em>early </em>in the spring, we calculate interest on the 1000 dollars, and then calculate interest on the bonds from the days on-which they are respectively payable, we produce a sum too large for the bond of 23rd May 1817; and, therefore, this argument proves too much. But let us attend to the terms of <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>answer to the amended bill. He says, he is now induced to believe, that the loan of <em>Ewell\u2019s </em>bonds was in 1814, or prior thereto: he is <em>certain, </em>that the loan of the 1000 dollars was in 1S15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>and the loan of the bonds was between one and two years before. He is unable to answer as to the particular time of the year 1815, in which the money was lent, but thinks it was in the winter of 1814, or <em>early in the spring of </em>1815, and he has some impression that <em>Grigsby </em>did mention to him that he had a wish to become a subscriber to the <em>Warrenton </em>bank then spoken of. Nothing can be more vague as to time, than this answer of the defendant, made to a pointed and direct question put in the amended bill, namely, at what time of the year 1815 did he lend the plaintiff the sum of 1000 dollars ? And whether it was not known to him, that it was for the purpose of subscribing to the <em>Warrenton </em>bank then about to be established ? If there is any thing of which he is <em>certain, </em>it is that he lent the money in 1815, and the loan of the bonds was between <em>one and two years before, </em>that is, more than one year before the loan of the money. Now, if the money was lent <em>early </em>in the spring of 1815, say, the 1st April, then the bonds must have been lent early in the spring, or late in the winter of the year before, that is, say February, or March 1814. But that is impossible, for the bonds were not executed by <em>Ewell </em>to <em>John Gordon, </em>till the 13th June 1814, and they were not assigned to <em>Weaver </em>until 28th September 1814; at least, such is the <em>date of the </em>assignment of one of them. Now, let us suppose that the bonds were transferred by <em>Weaver </em>to <em>Grigsby, </em>on the very day that they were assigned to him, and that the 1000 dollars were lent between one and two years, that is, more than one year after the transfer of the bonds. I shall assume the 20th of October 1815, as the date of the loan of the money, for that is more than a year after the bonds might have been transferred. Then, let interest be computed on the bonds, not from the day they were due, but from the day of their transfer, according to <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>admission in his first answer, and calculate interest on the money loaned, from the 20th October. The result is as follows: the principal sum of <em>Ewell\u2019s </em>two bonds was 466 dollars 66 cents, and the interest thereon from the 28th September 1814 to the 23rd May 1817, is 74 dollars 28 cents: the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>of the money loaned was 1000 dollars, and the interest on it from the 20th October 1815 to the 23rd May 1817, was 95 dollars 50 cents: the aggregate is 1636 dollars 44 cents\u2014 making the precise sum for which the bond of the 23rd May 1815 was taken: and if so, it was usurious, because of the interest calculated on <em>Ewell\u2019s </em>bonds from the time of their transfer. I do not mean to say, that the evidence in the cause proves that I have assumed the right <em>data </em>for my calculation; but I do maintain, that it furnishes better ground for my calculation than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">I think that the chancellor did right in directing an issue, but the issue was too broad. It should not have been, whether the bond was given for an usurious consideration, but to ascertain the following facts: 1. At what time were the <em>Ewell </em>bonds transferred from <em>Weaver </em>to <em>Grigsby </em>? 2. At what time was the loan of 1000 dollars made by <em>Weaver </em>to <em>Grigsby 7 </em>and 3. Of what sums was the bond of 23rd May 1817 compounded?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">On the whole matter, I am of opinion, that the decree should be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded, with directions to set aside the verdict, and direct a new issue as above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
