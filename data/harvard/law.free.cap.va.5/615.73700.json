Baldwin, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcnW\">said, 1. That the provision of the constitution of <em>Massachusetts, </em>which (it was said) the courts of that state had expounded into a general act of emancipation, was exactly like the declaration in our own bill of rights; the language of the former being <em>\u201c </em>that all men are born free and equal,\u201d and that of the latter, \u201c that all men are by nature equally free and independent.\u201d And admitting the authority of the judicial decisions of <em>Massachusetts, </em>as to the effect and meaning of this provision, so far as the people and the policy of that state were concerned, they said, the interpretation put upon the provision there, could not be admitted here, without acknowledging, that our own understanding of the like provision in our bill of rights, was erroneous, and shaking the tenure of all slave property. In truth, however, the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>exposition of the 'constitution of <em>Massachusetts, </em>was not found in this special verdict: only the constitution itself was found; and the court could not assume that there was any such judicial exposition of it. But, supposing there was such judicial exposition of the constitution of <em>Massachusetts, </em>and that it was right, so far as it affected the <em>status </em>of the plaintiffs while remaining there, it did not follow, that, when they were brought back to <em>Virginia, </em>the law of <em>Massachusetts </em>followed them, and was of force to make them free here,\u2014and free t.oo <em>from their </em>birth,\u2014for that would be the effect of declaring them free in this state, by force of the law of <em>Massachusetts. </em>Tt had been decided, that the laws and judicial decisions of the state of Ohio, declaring a person free, if inconsistent with the laws and policy of our own state, could not be respected and enforced hero; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Fullerton, </em>1 Rand. 15. <em>Blake </em>-was the lawful owner of these slaves in <em>Virginia </em>in 1797; he carried them with him to <em>Massachusetts, </em>by the laws of which country (let it be admitted) they could not be lawfully held as slaves; kept them there little more than a year; and then brought them back to Virginia, where ho had lawfully acquired them as slaves, and continued to hold them as slaves, under our laws : they were slaves here, notwithstanding the residence of their owner, with them in his possession, in <em>Massachusetts. Williams </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pull. 69. and the case of <em>The Mongrel woman Grace, </em>decided by lord <em>Stowell. </em>2. They contended, that these people were not emancipated by force of the statute laws of <em>Virginia. </em>The provisions of the statute did not apply to the case of a citizen of <em>Virginia, </em>being <em>then </em>the owner of slaves in another state of the union, and removing such slaves hither; and it authorized citizens of another state removing to and becoming citizens of this, to import slaves with them, provided they complied with the provisions contained in the 4th section of the statute. Then, by the statute of 1796, any citizen of the <em>U. Slates </em>residing or owning lands in this state, who had carried slaves born here to another state, and had not sold them there, might lawfully bring them back again to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number><em>Virginia, </em>and such slaves were not entitled to freedom on that account. Now, they said, the special verdict found, that <em>Blake removed to </em>Virginia,\u2014meaning that he <em>migrated </em>to this state, in the general sense of that word,\u2014that he came here to live here; it found, that he married in <em>Virginia; </em>and then, without finding how long he remained, the verdict found, that he left <em>Virginia, </em>and went back to <em>Massachusetts. </em>He was, then, domiciled in <em>Virginia, </em>and so became a citizen of this state. When he went back to <em>Massachusetts, </em>and resumed, for a brief space, his native domicil, he did not thereby so absolutely lose the citizenship of <em>Virginia </em>he had previously acquired, that, upon his subsequent return to <em>Virginia, </em>and abiding here, he was no longer a citizen of this state, in virtue of his first acquisition-of that character. He was a citizen of <em>Virginia, </em>who had carried <em>Virginia </em>born slaves from <em>Virginia </em>to <em>Massachusetts, </em>held them in his own service there, and then brought them back to <em>Virginia. </em>But, even if he had not been a citizen of <em>Virginia, </em>but a citizen of <em>Massachusetts, </em>at <em>the </em>time of his. second migration to this state, he had a right to bring these persons, <em>Virginia </em>born slaves as the} were, back with him to <em>Virginia. </em>And after the lapse of thirty years from the time they were so brought back to <em>Virginia </em>as slaves, the court must presume <em>omnia recte acta; </em>that they were lawfully brought back; that <em>Blake </em>complied with all the requisitions of the 4th section of the statute of 1792, to entitle him to import and hold them as slaves; and that he lawfully continued to hold them in slavery, which was the <em>status </em>in which they were born. <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>6 Munf. 159. <em>George </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>4 Rand. 659.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\"> 1 Old Rev.

He removed to <em>Virginia, </em>married a wife here, received the two slaves with her, and returned, with his wife and child, and the two slaves, to <em>Massachusetts. </em>This might all have been done in a residence of twelve months. The jury finds no dec\u00eda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ration made by him of any intention to make a permanent settlement in <em>Virginia; </em>no house or land bought; no business followed; nothing to distinguish him 1'rom a sojourner in the land. He married a citizen of this state, to be sure; but, it would seem, only to take her to his own country. In <em>Murray </em>v. <em>M'Carty, </em>2 Munf. 393. it was decided, that a <em>Virginian </em>marrying in <em>Maryland, </em>going thither, with the declared intention of residing in the state, and living there, between three and four years, did not lose his citizenship here. In <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Sam, </em>Gilm. 232. <em>Mrs. Teas </em>removed to <em>North Carolina, </em>and resided there three years; yet on her return, it was decided, that <em>\u201c </em>never having renounced her character of citizen of <em>Virginia, </em>nor acquired that of citizen of <em>North Carolina, </em>she did not come within the fourth section of the statute of 1792. If these cases are authority (and they have never been overruled), they decide the point, that, under the finding here, <em>Blake </em>never ceased to be a citizen of <em>Massachusetts. </em>He carried the slaves to <em>Boston, </em>with the declared intention of a permanent residence there; rented a house; opened a store; and, his business disappointing him, and his wife\u2019s health failing, he returned, after a residence of about fourteen months, to <em>Virginia. </em>I am clearly of opinion, that on thus returning, and bringing the slaves with him, he came fairly within the general prohibition of the statute of 1792, and could only protect himself, by going before a magistrate within sixty days, and taking the oath thereby prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">It was said, that after the great lapse of time which has taken place, it ought to be presumed, that every thing was properly done which the law required. This might have been a proper subject for a motion to the court to instruct, or a fair argument to the jury, who were at liberty to draw conclusions from facts: but it is too well settled to be questioned, that upon a special verdict, the court can presume nothing. See <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>6 Munf. 159. <em>M\u2019Michen </em>v. <em>Amos, </em>4 Rand. 134. <em>George </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>Id. 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Thinking the point, on which I have rested my opinion very clear, I have not noticed the effect, on this subject, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the constitution of <em>Massachusetts </em>and their judicial construclion of it. I will remark, however, that my impression is, that from this source, as well as that I have relied on, the paupers derive a good <em>cl </em>aim <em>to </em>their freedom. But it is a point which I have not been able (for the want of books) so thoroughly to investigate as I could wish.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">I am of opinion, that the judgment should be reversed, and judgment entered for the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Cabell, <em>J </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b642-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ATU\">The plaintiffs in this case rest their right to freedom, 1. upon the constitution and laws of the state of <em>Massachusetts, </em>and 2. upon the statute law of <em>Virginia. </em>It is contended, that <em>Betty </em>and <em>Pleasant, </em>by being removed by their master from <em>Virginia </em>to <em>Boston, </em>in 1797, became free under the former; or if not, that their removal back again to <em>Virginia, </em>after they had lost the character of <em>Virginia </em>slaves, gave them a right to freedom under the statute of 1792, at that time in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">As to the first; the jury has found the constitution of <em>Massachusetts, </em>containing a provision, like our own bill of rights, declaring that \u201call men are born free and equal.\u201d This, it would seem, is the only provision in the laws or constitution of that state, upon this interesting subject. Looking to the actual state of that commonwealth, and knowing, as we all know, that its slaves were few in number, at the time of the adoption of its constitution, <em>we </em>should be disposed to take this declaration less as an abstraction, than we must regard that which is contained in our own bill of rights. We should readily extend it to mean at least as much as the common law, which does not recognize slavery as reconcile-able with a residence upon british soil. I am inclined to think, however, it may go farther. The common law, I take it, is to be considered rather as declaring the mere <em>status </em>of the party, while in <em>Great Britain, </em>than as annulling the bond by which he is fettered, unless he asserts his right and establishes it by the adjudication of a competent tribunal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Then, indeed, it passes <em>in rent, adjudicatam; </em>and, upon well received principles of national law, this decision upon the right, by a tribunal having complete jurisdiction over the subject, is conclusive every where. But, unless the right of the slave is so asserted and established, the common law has not the effect of knocking off his shackles; nor can it be invoked as his protector, upon his return to that country where he had formerly been a slave. Such, I incline to think, is the substance of the cases of <em>Williams </em>v. Brown, 3 Bos. &amp; Pull. 69. and of <em>\u201c The Mongrel woman Grace,\u201d </em>decided by lord <em>Stowell, </em>and mentioned by counsel and by judge <em>Green </em>in <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Fulcher, </em>1 Leigh 179. 181. In <em>Massachusetts, </em>however, it seems, that the constitution of the state must have been interpreted to have a more extensive operation, as it appears to have been decided, that the issue of a female slave, though bom prior to the constitution, was free; 2 Kent\u2019s Comm. 205. If this be so, the constitution has received an interpretation, which goes to divest the title of the master, to break the bonds of the slave, and to annul the condition of servitude. It emancipates and sets free, by its own force and efficacy, and does not await the enforcement of its principles by judicial decision. It is more operative than the common law, and more resembles the effect of our statute declaring free all slaves imported contrary to law. But this depends upon the construction of the constitution of <em>Massachusetts </em>by its courts, which we would of course respect and follow, if we were sufficiently advised of them. But without their reports here, we should, perhaps, venture too far to rest our decision upon the <em>Massachusetts </em>constitution. It is not deemed necessary. The case may be decided upon the <em>Virginia </em>law.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">By the statute of 1792, it was declared (and the provision was in force at the time of this transaction), that \u201cslaves which should thereafter be brought into this commonwealth, and kept therein one whole year, or so long at different times as should amount to one year, should bo free.\u201d From the operation of the statute were excepted \u201c those persons who might incline to <em>remove </em>from any of the <em>U. States </em>and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>come citizens of this, upon taking certain oaths within a limited time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4X6\">In this case, it appears, that <em>Blake </em>was a native of <em>Massachusetts, </em>who, when a young man, removed to <em>Southampton, Virginia, </em>married, and received the negroes <em>Betty </em>and <em>Pleasant </em>with his wife. It might, perhaps, well he questioned, whether by this finding we should be justified in inferring that <em>Virginia </em>became the domicil of <em>Blake, </em>as it appears, that, some time after his marriage, he took his wife and slaves to his native state, and there went into business. Admit, however, that he did acquire a domicil in <em>Virginia, </em>we next find, that he left this state in 1797, <em>taking </em>with him his wife and child, and the plaintiffs, then small girls. ' He arrived in <em>Boston </em>in July 1797, where he spent three months in visiting his friends, after which he rented a house, in which his family resided, opened a store, and declared his intention to spend the rest of his days there; and there, accordingly, he continued to reside and carry on business until July or August 1798. This constituted a <em>complete </em>domicil in <em>Boston. </em>Whether <em>Blake </em>ever had a domicil in <em>Virginia </em>or not, it is very certain, that no evidences or declarations are found of his intention to make it the place of his permanent abode; and when, therefore, he returned from this absence,\u2014 of what duration we know not,\u2014to the land of his nativity, which he does not appear to have renounced, and declared his intention of spending his life there, and set up an establishment and a mercantile concern, I cannot but consider him as reinvested, to all intents and purposes, <em>with his </em>original character of a man of <em>Massachusetts. </em>To <em>Virginia </em>he was no longer bound. He had owed her a temporary allegiance for temporary protection, but the tie was dissolved, so soon as he returned to his native state, and settled himself in business, with a design of permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">As to the length of time of his residence in <em>Boston, </em>that, it would seem, is unimportant, except as an index of his real purpose. \u201cThere is no fixed or definite period of time,\u201d says chancellor <em>Kent, \u201c </em>requisite to create the domicil of a party. The residence to create it, may be long or short, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>cording to circumstances. It depends on the actual or presumed intention of the party.\u201d 2 Kent\u2019s Comm. 346. in note. <em>As </em>soon as the act is unequivocally done, and the intent clearly demonstrated to fix the residence or domicil of the party, so soon do all the consequences flow from the establishment of that domicil. From the moment the intent of <em>Blake </em>was shown by the correspondence of his acts with his declared intention to make <em>Boston </em>his permanent residence, he became at once domiciliated there. And if he had removed the next day to Virginia, although that might have thrown doubts over the sincerity of his previous declarations, it would not have changed his <em>status </em>for the time being, if we could rest assured that those previous acts and declarations had indeed been <em>bond fide.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Blake, then, having become an inhabitant of Boston, resident, and domiciliated there, in about twelve months, is induced by the state of his wife\u2019s health, to change his plans, and come to <em>Virginia </em>once more. Having acquired a residence or domicil in <em>Boston, </em>he was in the strictest sense of the words of our statute, \u201ca person desirous of removing from one of the <em>U. States.\u201d </em>But be this as it may, when he came to <em>Virginia </em>with his slaves, their destiny having been linked to that of their master, and they having acquired like him a <em>Boston </em>home, he was bringing into <em>Virginia, simes'vrhich </em>bad ceased to belong to tills commonwealth. This was directly within the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The verdict is not very definite as to the length of time the slaves were or have been in <em>Virginia, </em>all together. But in <em>M\u2019Michen </em>v. <em>Amos, </em>4 Rand. 134. it was very justly said, that the same strictness, as to form, will not be required in actions for freedom as in other cases. For, the master is deeply interested in not prolonging the litigation by mere technicalities. Here we find, that <em>Blake </em>left <em>Boston </em>for <em>Virginia </em>in 1798, bringing the slaves with him; and we find, that <em>since her return, Betty </em>has had two children ; and she is here, moreover, when she exhibits her petition thirty years afterwards. We must take it, then, that she was brought hack to <em>Virginia, </em>and has been kept here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>more than one whole year; and if so, she is free, unless her master complied with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"AOT\">There is no question, that after twenty years a jury may presume, that the requisitions of this statute have been complied with, if, in the meantime, there has been no suit for freedom, and if there be no circumstances to repel the presumption. 5 Munf. 542. 6 Munf. 159. 4 Rand. 141. 659. In all these cases, the principle is clearly recognized. But the jury alone can presume this fact. It is like most presumptions, liable to be rebutted, and therefore cannot be made by the court. In this case, the verdict is silent, and the fact must therefore be taken to be against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The consequence is, that the plaintiffs are entitled to their freedom, and to a judgment in their favor upon the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Judgment reversed, and judgment entered for the paupers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
