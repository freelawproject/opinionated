Verdict and judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion ; which stated, <em>\u201cthat </em>the defendant offered in evidence, the depositions of <em>John Taylor </em>and <em>Gabriel </em>Mitchell, to the reading of which, the counsel for the plaintiffs objected; because, they appeared to have been taken in a suit between the said <em>William Lyne </em>as plaintiff, and <em>Andrew Crawford </em>defendant, lately depending in this Court, which abated by the death of the said <em>Crawford; </em>a copy of the declaration, in which suit was thereunto annexed. That the Court over-ruled the objection; it appearing, that the said <em>Crawford </em>was the same person mentioned in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration as fheir factor; that <em>he </em>had received due notice of the taking of the depositions; and that it did not appear that the plaintiffs had any other representative, than the said <em>Crawford, </em>in <em>Virginia. </em>That <em>John Ryburn, </em>who was afterwards the factor or agent for the said plaintiffs, in <em>Virginia, </em>as well as the said <em>Crawford, </em>received due notice of the taking of the said <em>Mitchell\u2019s </em>deposition. That, the suit brought by the said <em>Lyne </em>against the said <em>Crawford, </em>was a cross-action, founded upon the same dealings, which gave rise to this cause; in which the said <em>Lyne </em>claimed a balance as due to himself, which balance the present plaintiffs would have been answerable for, in the opinion of the Court, had the said <em>Crawford </em>lived, and a recovery thereof taken place. That the evidence, in the said depositions contained, related to the said <em>Lyne\u2019s </em>dealings with the said <em>Andrew Crawford, </em>as factor for the said plaintiffs; and, upon those dealings, this action is founded.\u201d The declaration, referred to in the bill of exceptions, counted on a contract betwixt the said <em>William Lyne </em>and the said <em>Andrew Crawford, </em>without mentioning or referring to the said <em>Ritchie &amp;; Co. </em>Verdict and judgment for the defendant; and from that judgment, <em>Ritchie Co. </em>appealed to this Court,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-8\"><em>Warden, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-9\">The depositions were inadmissible; because they were not taken in a suit between the same parties. <em>Rowe </em>v, <em>Smith, </em>in this Court, during the present term, <em>[ante. </em>4S7.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-10\"><em>Marshall, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-11\">The cases are not alike; because <em>Crawford </em>represented his principal completely. For, such, was the mode of doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>business at that time, that the factor unavoidably, and from the nature of the connection, stood in the place of his principal. So, that his contracts bound the principal, as he had the entire control over the business, and might be said to be the same person with him. Now, here, was a suit with the factor, on behalf of his principal,' touching the same subject with the present action; and, the objection is, that the Court did wrong in hearing testimony to those points, which can never be considered as a just ground of exception, or it destroys the relation which subsisted between them. It must, therefore, be considered as a cause between the same parties; and, consequently, the District Court did right in receiving the testimony. There is no case which comes completely up to the present; the nearest in principle, is that of a verdict in favor of a termor against a stranger; in which case, the verdict may be used in a suit with the reversioner; for, the reversioner would have been dispossessed by the verdict, if it had gone against the termor, and the stranger can have no prejudice, because he had liberty to cross-examine the witnesses. The case here, is the same in principle, because <em>Ritchie %\u2022 Co. </em>would have had the benefit of the verdict had it passed in favor of <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-4\"><em>Warden, </em>in reply.

But no such thing does appear; and as <em>it </em>might have related to his own .private affairs, the depositions in that cause were improperly admitted in this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-6\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b451-7\">LYONS, Judge..</author>\n<p id=\"Anxp\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that the judgment of the District Court ought to be affirmed: That they were in fact cross-suits between the same parties in interest: That it appeared the factor who represented his principals had notice of the time and place of taking the depositions; and, therefore, might have cross-examined the witnesses if he had chosen to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
