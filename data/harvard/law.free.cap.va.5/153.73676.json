In the case of several sureties bound in the same bond, each contracts on the faith of the obligation of the others to contribute, in the event of loss. The legislature could not have intended to authorize one of several sureties to require the creditor to commence proceedings, and upon his failure to do so, to discharge that surety only, and thus, either to leave his co-sureties to bear the whole burden of a responsibility contracted on the faith of his joint and equal liability, or else to leave the mutual duties contracted by the sureties to each other unimpaired, so that the surety who had been discharged from the direct claim of the creditor, by force of his proceeding under the statute, should still be liable to his co-sureties for contribution. Certainly, the surety who effects a discharge under the statute, is discharged absolutely. The co-sureties, though no parties to the proceeding, must be discharged also; otherwise, in the case of many sureties, all but one may join in the requisition, without notice of their proceeding to their co-surety, obtain an absolute discharge for themselves in his absence, and leave the whole burden of their joint suretyship on him alone. It is the conduct of the creditor that discharges the sureties who make the requisition ; namely, his failure to bring suit for the debt. Now, it is a well settled principle of the common law, that if one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>of several joint obligors be released or discharged, no matter how, the others are discharged; and the <em>proviso </em>in the 8th section of the statute, saves to the creditor his remedy against the principal debtor, but not against him and any surety not j0ining in the requisition on him to proceed. The judgment of the circuit court must have been founded on a strict literal construction of the 6th section, which provides, that the <em>surety or sureties </em>may make the requisition on the creditor, and upon his failure to comply with the requisition of <em>sueh </em>surety or sureties, he shall forfeit the right to demand the debt from <em>such </em>surety or sureties; and this was supposed to give a discharge to <em>such </em>sureties only as made the requisition. But the literal construction, which would require that all the sureties must join in order to the discharge of all, would also require, that all must join in order to discharge <em>any, </em>so that the refusal of one surety to join the requisition, would preelude the others from availing themselves of the relief provided by the statute. The creditor is bound in conscience, as soon as he is warned by any one surety, of the danger affecting all the sureties alike, to commence his proceedings promptly, for the sake of the sureties who have not joined in the warning, as well as the surety who gave it; and it would be inequitable and mischievous to allow him, after full warning of danger to the sureties, to indulge the principal, so long as there is any one surety who has not joined in the requisition, of whose sufficiency he is himself satisfied, and then to throw the whole loss on him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-4\">The <em>attorney general, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR5q\">The statute was intended to enable any surety or sureties, apprehending danger of loss from the indulgence of the creditor to the principal, to hasten his proceedings, by a written requisition. It was designed for the benefit of such surety or sureties as apprehend danger, and are desirous to anticipate and avert it, not for such as apprehend no danger, and are therefore content to remain responsible. Accordingly, its provisions are expressly confined to such sureties as apprehend danger, and therefore make the requisition; and it makes the failure of the creditor to comply with the requi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>sition a forfeiture of his right to demand the debt from <em>such </em>surety or sureties; meaning, obviously, such as apprehend danger and join in the requisition. The legislature did not intend, that the requisition of the sureties, and the failure of the creditor to comply with it, should amount to a release of the bond ; it imposed a particular forfeiture on the creditor; a forfeiture of his rights against the sureties who objected to longer indulgence of the principal debtor. The <em>proviso </em>of the 8th section, saving the creditor\u2019s rights against the principal debtor, was inserted <em>ex abundante cautela; </em>and it supposes a case in which all the sureties have joined in the requisition, and in which the creditor, by failing to comply with it, has forfeited his rights against them all. The court in its construction of the statute, instead of having regard to the technical principle of the common law, whereby a release of one joint obligor works a release of all, should rather follow the analogy of another common law doctrine, that a covenant by the obligee not to sue one joint obligor, does not preclude him from suing the others; <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Newhall, </em>8 T. R. 168. <em>Hutton </em>v. <em>Eyre, </em>6 Taunt. 289. 1 Eng. C. L. R. 385. For the conduct of a creditor receiving a requisition to bring suit, from some of several sureties, and failing to comply with it, amounts to no more than a waiver of his right of action against those who make the requisition. The surety who does not join in the requisition, cannot complain. It is his business to take care of himself; he has no right to rely on others to take care of him; and it is fair to infer from his silence, either that he apprehends no danger, and is content to abide the responsibility, out of regard to the principal for whose sake he first incurred it; or that, if he apprehends danger, he does not wish to precipitate the measures of the creditor. The co-sureties ought not to be allowed to hasten a suit against him as well as themselves, and then give him the benefit of the creditor\u2019s delay, though <em>he </em>desires the delay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-4\">But suppose the matter of this plea a good bar, if well pleaded, the plea is faulty, not in form only but in substance. 1st, It does not shew, that the sureties who made the rcqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>sition on the creditor to sue, stated in their notice, any reason for apprehending danger of loss. The statute gave them a right to make such requisition, in case they apprehended that their principal was likely to become insolvent, or to mjgra(;e from the commonwealth; and they were bound to state their apprehension of one or the other, in order to entitle them to make such a requisition. The creditor was not bound to comply with their requisition, if they did not even pretend any just cause for making it. 2ndly, The statute makes the forfeiture of the creditor\u2019s right to sue the sureties, depend on his failure to commence his action on the bond, within a reasonable time after the requisition made by them. What is a reasonable time, is a question of law. Therefore, the plea ought to have stated the time to which the. obligee delayed to commence the action on the bond, distinctly and precisely. But in this plea, the date to which the obligee delayed to bring the action, is left in blank.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-3\">.Johnson, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APND\">'The statute does not require the sureties to state their reasons for apprehending danger, in their requisition upon the creditor to commence his action.

In the construction of statutes, we are told, we must first look to the mischief, and then to the remedy, and so administer the law as to advance the one and suppress the other. The mischief this statute was made to remedy, was, that a creditor having his debt secure, and being careless whether he made it out of the real debtor, or the surety, would often delay to sue till the debtor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>became insolvent, and the whole burden was thrown on the surety, nor had <em>he </em>any mode of protection, but by the tedious and expensive proceeding of a bill <em>quia timet </em>in equity. The remedy which the statute gives instead of this, is a written requisition to the creditor to sue; and if after receiving this, he chooses to give indulgence, it is at his own risk. The object of the statute being protection to the sureties, we must to that end, give it a liberal construction; more especially, as it is to take the place, in a measure, of the equitable remedy, and is itself founded on equitable principles. In this case, <em>the </em>creditor was required to sue by three of the sureties, and delayed to do so, for an unreasonable time; in consequence of which delay, the three sureties who joined in the requisition, have been discharged by a judgment, from all liability. This is stated in the plea, and admitted by the demurrer. It is contended, that this does not discharge the defendant, because his intestate did not join in the requisition upon the plaintiff to bring suit. If we take the statute literally, it would seem to require, that where there are more sureties than one, all shall join in the requisition; for the words are \u201cwhere any person or persons shall become bound as the security or securities in a bond &amp;c. and shall <em>apprehend </em>that his or their principal is likely to become insolvent &amp;c. it shall be lawful for <em>such </em>security or securities to give notice &amp;c.\u201d Yet this construction would in a great measure defeat the remedy, as it would put it in the power of <em>one </em>where there were many sureties, to prevent the notice, by refusing to join. Indeed, such a construction was not contended lor. If wo look at the object and reason of the law, it would seem, that a notice to sue by a part of the sureties, would be as effectual, as one given by them all. The purpose is to inform the creditor, that there is danger to the sureties in his further indulgence, and that if he gives it, he must do so at his own hazard. The statute authorizes the sureties to give the notice, when they apprehend, either that the principal is likely to become insolvent, or to migrate from the state: now, suppose the sureties to live at a distance, and that one of them chances to discover that the debtor is on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the eve of leaving the state, and gives the creditor such notice as would enable him, by a prompt movement, to arrest him and get <em>bail] </em>but he takes no step, and the debtor migrates : can it be imagined, that he would be afterwards suffered to recover the debt of those sureties who gave him no notice? Yet the words of the law are the same in both cases, and so is the reason. Again, we know that there is a principle of the common law attaching to all joint obligations, by which a discharge of one obligor is a discharge of all. If it be said, that this principle contemplates some <em>act </em>done by the obligee, I admit it, but I hold that in this case there was such an act. The statute makes it the business of the sureties to keep a watch upon their principal: the creditor is not obliged to move, till he receives notice; and if then he promptly puts the bond in suit, gets his judgment, and issues his execution in the usual course, the sureties remain just as liable as if no notice had been given. It is not the notice, then, which discharges the <em>sureties; but </em>(says the statute) unless the creditor so required to sue, shall in a reasonable time commence an action on the bond &amp;c. he shall forfeit the right to recover of the sureties. This, therefore, is the operating principle in the discharge of the sureties; this unreasonable delay, this culpable indulgence given to the debtor after notice to sue, is the act which <em>forfeits </em>the creditor\u2019s right to recover of the sureties; in other words, releases them from the debt. The act of the obligee, then, in the case before us, having released the three sureties who gave him notice, how can it be doubted, that the common law principle applies, and discharges the defendant here ? It is very clear, the legislature thought this principle applied, or it would not have provided against its affecting the right of the creditor to recover of the debtor himself. There is another ground, on which I think the defendant discharged. The well established rule of equity, adopted also by courts of law, is, that if the creditor takes any step, or does any act, by which he changes the situation of the surety, without his assent, the surety is released. We know, that every surety paying the debt, has a right to call on his co-sureties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>for contribution: this is a vital element in his contract, that at the worst he shall only pay his rateable proportion. Now, by the unreasonable indulgence given by the creditor here to the debtor, after she was required to sue, she has released three of the sureties ; they are wholly free: and if in this suit there should be a recovery against the defendant, he will have to pay the whole debt, without a right to call upon his co-sureties for contribution. This important change in his liability, having been effected by the act of the creditor, he is wholly discharged. Therefore, on every ground, I think the plea presents a good bar, and that the judgment of the circuit court should be reversed, and that of the county court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b181-11\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aqa\">The first question is, whether the defence set up in the plea, supposing it well pleaded, is a good bar ?\u2022 The real defence is founded on a well established principle of the common law, that if one of several obligors is discharged by the act of the obligee, as by release, breaking off his seal &amp;c. the other obligors are also discharged. The reason is, that they did not engage to incur the obligation singly; each looked to the aid of his co-obligors. Therefore, when the obligee discharges one, he changes the contract, and unless it be a discharge to all, he would thus bind the others by a new contract without their assent. This cannot be allowed; and, therefore, his discharge of one is a discharge of all. Again, if a joint suit be brought, a joint judgment must be recovered; which cannot be if one be discharged; nor can suit be brought without joining him who has been discharged. And again, if a joint judgment be recovered against all, and one of them pays it, he may compel the others to contribute; but he who has been discharged, cannot be compelled to contribute; and so the obligee, by discharging one, has taken away the right of the others to call on him for contribution. The creditor cannot recover judgment for the supposed proportion of those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>have not been discharged; for, if the debt has in no part been paid, judgment must be rendered for the whole. In short, where parties are thus bound together, the privity between them gives to each, the advantage of any release, or any eounter security, which the others may obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"A5h\">The question in this case, then, is whether the discharge of the three sureties, has been effected by the act of the obligee ? I think it has. The statute, indeed, says the sureties giving the notice and making the requisition on the obligee to bring suit, shall be discharged, unless the obligee bring suit in a reasonable time. If he does not bring the suit, they are discharged, The omission to bring suit is the act of the obligee, and so the discharge is the consequence-of his act. If it were otherwise, the most unjust consequences would follow. For, before the statute, any one of several sureties might file a hill <em>quia timet </em>in equity; and, upon the plain construction of the statute, I take it, that any one of several sureties may require the creditor to commence his action. Then, so soon as the bond has become payable, any one surety might absolve himself, by a notice to the creditor requiring him to bring suit, without any notice to his coobligors ; or all but one might join in the notice to the creditor, and in the end throw the whole burden upon him who never dreamed of it. The effect of this would be a scramble among the sureties to get clear, as soon as the bond <em>falls </em>due, lest others should get clear first.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The only seeming difficulty is, that in the view we take of the case, one surety is enabled to hurry the suit of the creditor against all. But I think that no objection. The creditor may take a new bond if he is disposed to give time; if not, let him sue. There is no doubt, any one surety has a right, by bill <em>quia timet, </em>to compel the creditor to proceed, even when he apprehends the insolvency, not of the principal only, but of a co-surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">There is a plain difference between this case and that of a covenant not to sue one of several obligors. Notwithstanding the covenant not to sue, the obligee may sue all, and recover judgment against all; each is bound to pay his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>proportion; and then the covenantee recovers back what he has been compelled to pay. But in the case of a release or discharge of one, it is a bar to the action against all or any, and may be so pleaded. There can be no recovery against the release; and, therefore, either there can be no recovery against any of the obligors, or the burden must, contrary to the contract, fall upon those who are not released, and they cannot have contribution. So here, the creditor having, by his own conduct, lost all right of recovery against three of the sureties, and thus debarred the fourth of his remedy over against them, the fourth is also discharged. For, by force of this statute, the omission of the obligee to sue upon the requisition of the three sureties, was equivalent to a release of those sureties.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">As to the particular objections to the plea, it is sufficient to say, that I hold it well enough pleaded, upon general demurrer to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Judgment of the circuit court reversed, and that of the county court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
