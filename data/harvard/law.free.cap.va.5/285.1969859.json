For, the act directs a jury for special purposes only; which is a proof that they are not to be summoned in ordinary cases. As, therefore, the title is not one of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>enumerated purposes, it is a fair presumption that it was not the intention of the Legislature that there should be a jury with regard to that point. The practice would involve this preposterous doctrine, namely, that a jury might be summoned to review the judgment of the County Court: Which being a matter of law,, it exclusively belonged to the Court to decide it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-8\"><em>Warden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-9\">The District Court have- decided upon what was before them. They thought that the title consisted of facts, as well as law, and, therefore, that a jury (who are the proper triers of all matters of fact) ought to decide the question. It is probable that the counsel agreed to make up the issue; and where any doubt about facts occurs, a jury oughtto be impannelled, according to the spirit of the bill of rights. The direction for a jury was consequently right, in order to ascertain the title; and after that, the Court could judge, upon the other circumstances, whether the petitioner, his title being established, should have leave to build a mill.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-10\">\n<em>Washington,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZAM\">on the same side. Although the Court are not bound to direct ah issue, yet I do not think that it is error in them to have done it, as it was used merely to inform the conscience of the Court; and the verdict is only to be considered as an evidence of the title. But, by joining issue, the parties on both sides have virtually consented to the order. It will be said perhaps, that being the order of the Court it could not be resisted; but I answer, that the party should have excepted to the opinion of the Court. It is not necessary that the express consent should appear on record, for the act of the parties may amount to it. An exception is constantly taken to the opinion of the Court in all cases of interlocutory orders; and when omitted, the party is considered as waiving the objection. In the case of forthcoming bonds, judgment is to be rendered on motion and no jury is necessary.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Yet, in a case where <em>non esf factum </em>was pleaded to a bond of this land, and issue taken on-the plea, to, be tried by a jury, it did not occur to the Court that the order for a jury was erroneous.Although the judgment was reversed upon a ground that rather maintained the propriety of a jury; for,.it was deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>mined that the Court below erred in rendering judgment against the sureties until it was decided whether it was the bond <em>of </em>the principal or not. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Such an issue in the case of mills, is like an issue directed by a Court of Chancery; and in practice it is not unusual for the High Court of Chancery to direct an issue to ascertain a fact, on an appeal from a County Court. So, in this case the Judges of the District Court, sitting to decide on the circumstances, might direct an issue to determine a particular fact concerning which any doubts arose.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-4\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-5\">The joining issue and <em>neglecting to </em>except, was <em>not </em>any consent, nor operated as a waiver of the objection; because, decency directed that he should submit after the Court had' ordered it. It was the duty of the Court to decide the question; and they could not depute the authority to others. Their decision upon the title would not have been conclusive; but an ejectment would have lain afterwards: Which obviates the argument drawn from the bill of rights; because the party would have been divested of his property, by the decision.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-11\">[* See <em>Burke, </em>adm\u2019r. v. <em>Levy\u2019s </em>ex\u2019rs. 1 Rand. 1.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\">[* <em>Asberry </em>et al. v. <em>Calloway </em>et al. 1 Wash. 72.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b311-6\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"AYs\">Delivered the resolution of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The first question that occurs is, whether the act of Assembly authorises this Court, upon this summary proceeding, to enter into a contest about the title of the parties? or, whether the words of the act, <em>owning lands on one or both sides of the run, </em>are not satisfied by the petitioners being in possession as visible owners? leaving any person claiming title to pursue the legal remedy for asserting it, since it could not be prejudiced by the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">It is probable that the latter was the intention of the Legislature, or they would have provided some mode for conducting the trial; and not have left an enquiry, which might prove very important, to have been decided by the Court, without the necessity of a jury, contrary to the spirit of our judiciary system; and, by which, in a suit about an acre in this summary method, the title to a large tract might be involved.</p>\n<p id=\"AkW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The ownership, therefore, is rather supposed, and aceordingly the subsequent enquiries are directed to other objects. Probably if an enquiry into the title be proper, it is a case omitted and ought to be supplied by the Legislature. Our, present impressions are, that this mode is improper under the act, without consent of the parties; but, we give no opinion, because, in this case, as in <em>Home </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>the enquiry seems to have proceeded from consent of parties; for, although no consent is stated, there is no compulsory order to introduce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The directing of an issue by jury in the District Court we do not consider as error: For; although we still approve of the decision in <em>Home </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>that the Court were not obliged to direct such issue, yet they might at their discretion adopt this ordinary constitutional mode for their better information; since the case upon the merits was 1 eft open for their discussion. This power is justly assimilated to that of the <em>Chancellor, </em>in directing issues to sa-. tisfy his conscience. In neither, is the verdict conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"A86\">Upon the merits we have very little doubt; the supposed conflict between the titles derived to old <em>Boughan </em>from <em>Holt\u2019s </em>patent, and that of the appellant under <em>Boughan\u2019s </em>own patent, seems to have no influence, since <em>Boughan </em>in 1705, when he purchased from <em>Holt, </em>appears to have been conscious that his title did not extend beyond the <em>Walnut </em>at H. or <em>red </em>A, and, therefore, in the same year, he purchased of <em>Harper, </em>claiming under the other patent, the five acres: the location of which is the dispute at present, and which, upon the whole proceedings, there is little difficulty in deciding. The appellant\u2019s location O, P, Q, R, the Surveyor states to be a mere protraction without paper or evidence to support it; and the appellee\u2019s location red <em>A', </em>JB, C and D, appears to agree with the natural descriptions, as testified by the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Upon the merits, therefore, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
