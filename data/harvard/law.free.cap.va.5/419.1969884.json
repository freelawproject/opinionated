The defendant craved <em>oyer </em>of the bond and condition, and pleaded <em>conditions performed. </em>The plaintiff took issue, and obtained a verdict and judgment. There was a bill of exceptions, which stated the bond and endorsement, with the defendant\u2019s objection to the admissibility of the evidence. The petition for the <em>supersedeas </em>assigned two errors; 1. That the bond was not assignable. 2. That no material issue was joined.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number><em>Wickham, </em>for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aao\">in the <em>supersedeas. </em>I shall not trouble the Court with any observations upon the last error, because I deem the first sufficient to reverse the judgment. The present act of Assembly, <em>\\JDec. </em>1795, c. 125, \u00a7 5, <em>E. C. </em>ed. 1819,] allows bonds of this nature to be assigned, and permits the assignee to sue in his own name. But this bond was made anterior to that act; and, therefore, is not affecte.d by it. So, that it stands upon the old act altogether; which merely relates to bonds for payment of money.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b444-8\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"As_0\">Then- you suppose the words <em>payment of money, </em>in the act, to relate to the condition of the bond?</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\"><em>Wickham, </em>yes.</p>\n<author id=\"b444-10\">\n<em>PEE C TJE.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A06\">The judgment must be reversed; because \u201cthe bond on which the suit is brought, not being for the payment of money or tobacco, but with a condition for performance of covenants, was not, by law, assignable at the time the suit was commenced; which was, therefore, not maintainable by the assignee. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Judgment reversed, with costs; and judgment entered for the defendant.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-12\">[* <em>Henderson </em>v.
