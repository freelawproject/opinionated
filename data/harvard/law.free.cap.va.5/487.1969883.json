The defendant plead <em>\u00f1on est factum; </em>and the plaintiffs took issue. Upon the trial of the cause, the plaintiffs filed a bill of exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion; which stated, \u201c that the plaintiffs offered in evidence to the jury, proof of the hand-writing of the subscribing witnesses to the bond; and that the said witnesses were dead. That the plaintiff moved the Court to instruct the jury, that the said testimony was sufficient proof of the execution and delivery of the bond; but, that the Court were of opinion and did instruct the jury, that the said testimony was not conclusive evidence to maintain the issue on the part of the plaintiffs; <em>but left it to the jury to determine the weight of such evidence.77</em></summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b511-12\">Verdict and judgment for the defendant.</disposition>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b511-13\">And now Bogle, <em>Somerville Sp Co. </em>petitioned this Court for a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>to that judgment.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-14\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-15\">The Court ought to have instructed the jury, according to the application; which went only to request their opi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>nion upon the sufficiency of such testimony in law.
