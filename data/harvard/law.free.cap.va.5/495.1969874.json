The bill states, that <em>Thomas </em>Payne, in <em>November, </em>1784, requested the appellant to take charge of a final settlement or commutation certificate, amounting to 628/., <em>and to keep the same for him, as a </em>friend/ and furnish him with certificates or money for his purposes. That such certificates were then of little value. That, in the same month and year, the appellant paid 290/. in certificates, of the like kind, for Payne; and, on the 19th of <em>January, </em>the further sum of 224/. in certificates; leaving a balance of 114/. in certificates, in favor of <em>Payne: </em>On which the appellant drew indents. That, in <em>March, May </em>and <em>July, </em>1786, the appellant paidfor the appellee, at his request, 22/. <em>3s. 9% </em>specie, which was equal to 189/. 19s. in certificates; leaving a balance of 29/. 19s. certificates in favor of the appellant. That the appellee admitted these debits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>but sued the appellant for a supposed balance; and the jury, through mistake, found a verdict for 215/. specie. That the mistake arose from the appellant being unable to prove upon the trial, that the 22/. <em>3s. </em>9J specie was equal to 139/. 19s. certificates. That the appellant moved for anew trial; which the County Court refused, and gave judgment for the verdict. The bill, therefore, prayed an <em>injunction, </em>which was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-8\">The answer admits the deposit for safe-keeping of the certificate for 628/.; having an interest due thereon, from the 22d of <em>March, </em>1783. That it was delivered, in order to be appropriated as the appellee should direct. That the appellee afterwards appropriated 150/. for the purchase of a horse from <em>the </em>appellant, for one <em>Lig\u00f3n. </em>. That he also drew for 50/. in favor of <em>Pollock, </em>and 80/. in favor of <em>Duke; </em>making in all <em>2801. </em>That on the 19th of <em>January, </em>1785, the appellant paid <em>Wade Woodson </em>170/.; and <em>John Shelton </em>54/.; all together making 504/.; and leaving a balance in favor of the appellee of 134/., exclusive of interest. That the charges in the bill relative to the specie account, were chiefly for goods and merchandize; for which the appellant was to take pay, out of the interest of the certificate. That the appellee on the trial at law, admitted all the appellant\u2019s <em>offsets; </em>but, contested their application; and the jury after a fair trial, found for the appellant; that the sum allowed by the jury, was not quite as much as the appellee was entitled to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-9\"><em>Lig\u00f3n </em>proves the payment to himself. <em>Pickett </em>proves that the price of final settlement certificates in 1784 and 1785, was <em>2s. 6d. </em>and in <em>1786, </em>from 2s. <em>9d. </em>to 3s. 6d.; with the interest due thereon .given up. <em>Crouch </em>proves, that the appellant had credit with him in 1786, for 10/. or 12/. of indents at par.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b520-10\">The High Court of Chancery dismissed the bill with costs; and <em>Woodson </em>appealed to this Court.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-11\"><em>Duval </em>and <em>Randolph, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-12\">The intention was, that the certificate should indemnify all advances and accruing claims against <em>Payne; </em>who ought not to be received to say, that the certificate was to lie, for the advantange of a rise in value, whilst his creditor was kept-out of his money; and left to rely only, upon the general credit of the debtor. <em>[Henriques </em>v. Franchise,] 2 Eq. Ca. Abr. 740; <em>[Prec. Ch. 205, </em>S. C.] The long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>-acquiescence of <em>Payne, </em>argues a consciousness upon his part, that he thought this the fund out of which the advances and claims were to be paid; and, that he has only come forward now, in consequence of the rise in value. The price at which they are credited by <em>Woodson, </em>is just, and conformable to the opinion of the Court in the case of <em>Groves </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>1 Wash. 1. At any rate, the Court will allow them to be restored in specie, or settled at the true current price of the time, according to that case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-4\"><em>M \u2019 Craw, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-5\">The certificate was deposited for safe-keeping; and only the interest was to be applied by <em>Woodson. </em>Of course, he could not appropriate the certificate itself, for advances or future claims. If the certificate had sunk in value, it would have been <em>Payne\u2019s, </em>and not <em>Woodson\u2019s </em>loss. It is fairly to be inferred, that <em>Woodson </em>now holds the certificate; and has never actually parted with it at any price. Of course, he was liable to restore-it to us upon equitable terms. . The case in 2 <em>Eq. Ca. Jibr. </em>turned upon the imposition; but here was none in <em>Payne: </em>'Who, though ready to do justice, has been kept out of his property by <em>Woodson-, </em>and, therefore, the latter is justly liable, for the rise in value.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b521-6\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Azr\">If the agreement, stated in the answer of the appellee, was rightly interpreted by the jury, who found the verdict in question, and there was no fraud used, or any improper conduct in the jury, which is not pretended, their verdict and the judgment upon it ought not to be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The substance of the agreement, as disclosed in-the answer of the appellee, and not disproved by any testimony, was <em>\u201c </em>that the appellant should in November, 1784, take into his custody and safe-keeping a final settlement certificate for 628/. having interest due thereon from the 22d of <em>March, </em>1783, to be thereafter appropriated agreeable to the directions of the appellee.\u201d Every appropriation, therefore, made by order of the appellee, (which includes all the advances in' certificates stated by the appellant, and admitted in the report of the commissioner,) was in pursuance of the agreement; and made the appellant a proprietor of the like sum in the certificate then in custody. But, with respect to his ulterior account, stated in specie, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>he was not only not warranted by the agreement to set off the balance of the certificate at the then current price as a payment thereof, but it is expressly stated in the answer, and not disproved, that the chief of the charges were for goods, wares, and merchandizes; and, that before he took one of those articles, the appellant gave him to understand, that he would receive payment therefor out <em>of the interest </em>on the certificate. The appropriation, then, of this balance of the appellee\u2019s certificate, without his consent and in violation of the agreement thus stated, was rightly estimated by the jury; and the principles, upon which their verdict was founded, are not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">With respect to the 10/. difference in the price of the horse, as resulting from the answer of the appellee in opposition to <em>Lig\u00f3n\u2019s </em>testimony, the answer in this respect ought not to avail him. For, admitting that answer in this instance to be positive, the deposition of <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>is equally so; and is supported by the following circumstances: 1st. That this charge was not objected to before the commissioner; although the appellee was personally present. 2d. That he says in another part of his answer, <em>\u201c </em>that he admitted at the trial at law, all the offsets which the appellant contended for, and now contends for;\u201d among which is comprehended the 10/. now in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">As then, it does not appear, from the present <em>case, </em>that the jury interpreted this agreement otherwise than is right; as it is not shewn that their calculations under this principle were erroneous, there is no ground to impeach the verdict. There is no ground to say, from the case before us,that they did not take into consideration, in assessing the damages, the circumstances that a part of this certificate, if funded, wouldiiave constituted what is called deferred stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">If, indeed, it now appeared to us, that this was not the ease; .if this could be deduced with any certainty, from any. testimony in the record, going to the value of these certificates about <em>the time of the demand, </em>or from other circumstances, it might be material to give relief in this respect. So, if the appellant had shewn that the price of certificates, by which the jury went, in assessing the damages, was not the price at the time of the demand, (which for want of other testimony, we must fix to be that of bringing the suit, which' time likewise is not mentioned in the proceedings,) but a higher price at some anterior period, this circumstance also might be a substantial ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>of relief. But, we cannot make the appellant\u2019s case better than he himself has made it; and, we must- not upon surmise and conjecture, overturn the verdict of a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Therefore, I think the decree must be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b523-5\">CARRINGTON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ7\">The judgment at law was probably unjust; but I cannot interfere without testimony; and the appellant has furnished none. I am, therefore, constrained to concur in affirming the decree, upon the principles mentioned by Judge Roane, although I fear injustice is done by it.</p>\n<author id=\"b523-6\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"ATb6\">The certificate for 628?. was delivered by <em>Payne </em>to <em>Woodson, </em>as bank stock, to be drawn for as <em>Payne </em>wanted it; and <em>Woodson </em>paid for <em>Payne </em>at different times 514?. In consequence of which, he became entitled to so much in the .stock and interest; and <em>Payne </em>to the balance of 114?. <em>Woodson </em>drew 66?. 12s. in specie, for the whole certificate; and was accountable to <em>Payne, </em>for his proportion as 514?. is to 114?.; \u00bfmounting to 12?. Is. <em>Qd, Woodson, </em>before and soon after, paid for <em>Payne, </em>in specie 22?. 3s. 9d.; leaving a balance due to <em>Woodson </em>in specie, to be changed into certificates at 3s. <em>6d. </em>of 10?. 2s. equal to 57?. 10s. Which left due to <em>Payne, </em>in certificates, the sum of 56?. 9s. 11 <em>d.% </em>worth then, something less than 10?. And the verdict is for 202?. 16s. <em>Id. </em>specie, on account of the aforesaid balance of 114?. certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">It is, therefore, very probable, that the verdict is unjust, hut the appellant has not made out a case for the interference of a Court of Equity; and, therefore, the decree must be affirmed. The appellant ought to have shewn the period when the certificate ought to be turned into money, in consequence of the conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The decree was affirmed without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
