After the death of the said <em>John Guthrie, </em>the testator, <em>James </em>his eldest son and heir at law as above mentioned, entered upon the said lands and messuage described by the said words <em>\u2018 This that I now live </em>unand died seised thereof in the month of <em>January, </em>1776, without having made a will; and leaving the lessor of the plaintiff his eldest son and heir at law. The testator\u2019s said brother <em>William. </em>died in the life-time of the testator\u2019s said son <em>James, </em>and from him the said <em>James </em>as his nephew and heir at law took certain lands and tenements by descent; which he likewise entered into and died seised thereof. After the death of the said <em>James, </em>the lessor of the plaintiff, as eldest son and heir at law to his father, entered into the said first mentioned messuage and sixty acres of land for which the present suit is brought, as well as into those which descended from <em>William, </em>and was thereof seised until the said <em>Richard Guthrie, </em>the son of the testator <em>John Guthrie, </em>evicted him of the said messuage and sixty acres of land, by virtue of a judgment of the.

After the death of the said <em>Richard </em>the testator, the defendant <em>Elizabeth </em>entered into the said sixty acres of land and messuage by virtue of the devise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>her as aforesaid, and continued possessed thereof at the time of finding the special verdict in this action. The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiff; from which judgment the defendants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pAdAE\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aok\">The first is, what estate <em>James </em>toolc under the will of <em>John Guthrie? </em>I contend he took a fee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pADa\"><em>Warden, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADs\">I shall insist also that he took a fee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pApc\">\n<em>Marshall.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Art\">It is not necessary then to proceed to prove the point. Supposing therefore that <em>James </em>took a fee, the case is no more than this, the lands in question are devised over to <em>Richard </em>if <em>James </em>takes other lands by descent\u00bf and it is found by the verdict that he did take other lands. <em>Richard </em>recovered, and the defendants claim under the devise over to him, insisting that the contingency on which it was to take effect has happened. It will be said that <em>James </em>had his election, for it cannot be contended that he is entitled to both tracts. Now, by the law of elections he who is to perform the first act, must make election <em>; </em>but if the time is suffered to pass away, the election is gone. <em>Co. Lift. </em>145, (a) <em>in notes. </em>As soon, therefore, as the other lands descended on <em>James, </em>he had his election; and although he has not made it in express words, yet his having entered on the descended lands either amounts to an election to take them, or else he has past the time and <em>Richard </em>may now elect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-10\">But this is in' nature of a limitation over to <em>Richard. </em>The reason of the difference between a limitation and a condition proves, that this was a limitation to <em>Richard </em>unless defeated by the election of <em>James. </em>For otherwise, what remedy could <em>Richard </em>have ? He could never force an election any way but by bringing an ejectment. <em>Richard </em>could not claim the lands which came by descent, he could only claim those under the limitation over. The principle of the rule that words of condition shall be construed into words of limitation, when the devise is to the heir at law, applies here.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-11\">\n<em>Warden.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqo\">An illiterate man like the testator cannot bo supposed to have understood the abstruse doctrine of elcc1ions. \u2022 The question is not, whether <em>Richard </em>had a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>to take, but how long he was entitled to hold. He took only an estate for life. The testator having died before his brother, had no right to dispose of what his son would take as heir to his brother. <em>John Guthrie </em>the testator never was heir to his brother, but <em>James </em>was and took as heir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-3\">There are no words of inheritance in the devise to <em>Richard; </em>and the heir shall not be disinherited without express words. <em>Cro. Car. </em>447, 449. He also cited <em>[Roe </em>v. <em>Holms,] 2 </em>Wils, 80.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-4\">In this case there are no words nor any apparent intent to disinherit the heir. In several instances the testator uses words of inheritance when he devises slaves and other things ; which shews he knew how to limit an inheritance when he was minded to do so. <em>[Frogmorton </em>v. <em>Wright,] 3 </em>Wils. <em>414; [Bowes </em>v. <em>Blackett,] </em>Cowp. <em>235, 657 </em>; <em>[Right </em>v. <em>Sidebotham,] </em>Dougl. 759.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-5\">There are not only no words of inheritance in the devise to <em>Richard; </em>but the will further says in another part, that if <em>Richard' </em>should make choice of the slave <em>Jeaney, </em>he should have no other part of the testator\u2019s estate. Now, as he was to take, upon his not making choice of <em>Jeaney, </em>the verdict should have found in so many words, that he did not make choice of her.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-6\">\n<em>Marshall.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al\">It is agreed that <em>James </em>took a fee ; and if so, I contend that the devise overpasses the same estate to <em>Richard.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-7\">\n<em>Warden.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AA3\">I did not mean to admit that <em>James </em>took a fee under the will, but that as heir at law he had a fee by his better title.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-8\">\n<em>Marshall.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdY\">As this point is now receded from, I must proceed to prove that <em>James </em>took a fee. The cases cited on the other side merely prove that where there are not words of limitation nor any manifest intent to give a fee, only an estate for life passes. The question then is, if there be such an intent in the present case ? The whole complexion of the will proves it. The testator was evidently very ignorant and illiterate and wholly unacquainted with technical terms. When this appears upon the face of the will as in the present case, the Court will strive to favor' the intent. The devise to <em>James </em>was unnecessary according to Mr. <em>Warden\u2019s </em>construction, because he was heir at law and would have taken as such ; it could, therefore, only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>have been introduced for the purpose of providing for <em>Rich</em>ard. He also contemplated a power in <em>James </em>to sell, and although <em>James </em>would have had such power without, yet the testator certainly thought it necessary to give it. All which proves his extreme ignorance of technical language and legal doctrines. The testator meant to provide only for two sons (as he gives but a shilling to <em>John,) </em>and contemplating the inheritance of <em>James </em>from his uncle, he made such a disposition of the small tract in his own possession as might provide for both of those two sons in case the contingency happened. That is to say, if one fee simple estate descended upon one son, the other should go to the other son. If any land descended to <em>James </em>by heir-ship, that <em>Richard </em>should have an equivalent estate in the other. As therefore the descended estate was a fee, so also is that devised to <em>Richard. </em>When he speaks of the descended estate which was clearly a fee, he used no words of inheritance to describe it. The testator certainly contemplated the right of election in <em>James, </em>and yet there could be no doubt which he would take if one was in fee and the other for life only. Almost all cases of wills stand upon their own bottom. They all depend upon the testator\u2019s intent; and therefore differ ; because there are different evidences of intent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-5\">A man cannot hold under a will and in contradiction to it too. A devise of <em>Blachacre </em>to A. and of <em>Whiteacre </em>(which is entailed on A.) to B. A cannot hold both; but if he takes possession of <em>Blachacre, </em>B shall have <em>Whiteacre. </em>Which is exactly our case. From this I draw an argument as to the amount of the estate given. If <em>James </em>had given up the descended estate, he would have given up \u00e1 fee. But as he retained it, he must give up his whole estate in the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-8\">As to the objection concerning the election with regard to the slave <em>Jeaney, </em>it is only necessary to remark that we are in possession, and if that choice was to defeat our right, the plaintiff should have had it found ; because he should prove a title to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-9\">If <em>James </em>had sold the land after <em>Richard\u2019s </em>death, the family of <em>Richard </em>would have been entitled to half the money, which is an additional argument to prove a fee was intended.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"pA2Z\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AVe\">The first question important to be considered is what estate <em>James </em>the heir at law took under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>will ? This will was made antecedent to the act of AssentWyj [1785, C. <em>62, 12 Slat. Larg. </em>157,] which considers a fee as passing unless restrained by words of limitation; and must therefore stand upon the acknowledged rules of law which then prevailed. At that time the rule was, that even in last wills, if words of inheritance were wanting, an estate for life only would pass, unless from a view of the whole will the intention of the testator obviously appeared, to be that a greater interest should pass. I shall then examine this will at large without confining myself to the particular clause under consideration, for by this means only can we come at an intention which the testator knew so little how to express. But let me premise in the first place that no inference is to be drawn from the want of technical words, unfavorable to an enlarged construction of the devise now under consideration; for it is apparent from the face of the will that the testator was wholly illiterate and incapable of expressing himself properly. Whenever he uses a technical word, he uses it improperly and unnecessarily. In some of the bequests of the personal estate, he uses the word heirs; the meaning or legal import of which he certainly knew not; for he uses the same word as synonymous with <em>children </em>in the clause where he gives a negro woman named <em>Dice </em>and <em>her heirs </em>to <em>Richard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\"><em>\u25a0 </em>Neither can any inference against an enlarged construction be drawn from a tenderness for the rights of the heir at law, who it was said is not to be disinherited without express words ; because the devisee in this case was the heir at law of the testator. The word have<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in the devise to <em>James </em>is the same as that used in the clause which disposed of the cattle. In the latter it not only passed the absolute interest according to the principles of law, but the testator certainly intended that it should have this operation, when applied to personal propei\u2019ty ; which fx\u2019om its nature was every day undergoing some change, and the value of which depended on the unlimited use in it. It is fair then to give to the same expression in the devise of the land the same meaning. It is the appropriate meaning of the testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>tor who certainly did not know that a difference of expression was necessary when applied to real and personal estate. The provision for <em>Richard </em>in case <em>James </em>should sell, does not directly give a power to sell (for if it did, no doubt could exist that a fee \"passed,) but it explains still further the meaning which the testator affixed to the term have, by shewing that he contemplated an existing right in <em>James </em>to sell, in consequence of the interest which the will gave him. For he certainly supposed that all the interest which <em>James </em>could claim was under the will, or else he would not have made the devise ; and as he could not sell unless he had a fee, it is clear that the intention was to give a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\">If then <em>James </em>took a fee, the next question is if the limitation over to <em>Richard </em>is good ? It certainly is so by way of executory devise, as the contingency on which it is to depend must happen within the time prescribed by the rules of law respecting limitations of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">The only remaining question then is, what estate <em>Richard </em>took in the lands limited to him upon the event which has happened of other lands coming to <em>James </em>by descent ? I think he also takes a fee. The same terms are used : He is to have the ,land; and according to the rule which I have before mentioned, that the same word used in different parts of the will shall have the same meaning, unless there be circumstances shewing an intention to vary it, <em>Richard </em>will take a fee if by force of the same expression a fee passed to <em>James. </em>If the tract was too small to divide between two sons, he could never have intended a division as to the interest in it. I am therefore for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b35-6\">FLEMING, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa\">The principal question is, whether <em>Richard </em>took an estate in fee or for life in the lands for which the present suit is brought ? To decide this we must search for the intention of the- testator, that we may see whether it be strong enough to over-rule the principle of common law, which requires words of inheritance to pass a fee. To discover this intention it may not be amiss to consider the situation and the circumstances of the testator. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> He had two sons, for whom he wished to provide, and a third for whom he intended nothing. His whole es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>tate consisted of about sixty acres of land, a few slaves, some stock and a tract of land in expectancy. To divide the sixty acres of land would afford but little benefit to-either son ; he therefore prefers the eldest, but was determined to provide for his second son. also, so soon as the estate, which he expected, should come to his family. These intentions were to be expressed by a very illiterate man, who from the face of the will it is evident knew not the necessity of using technical terms, or in what' manner to apply them. But in most cases of this sort unless contra-' dictory expressions are used, there will be some circumstance which will lead to the mind of the testator. Such is the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">The testator does not give a power to sell in express terms ; but he says that <em>James </em>shall have his lands, and immediately declares in substance that he supposed he had. given him such an estate as he might sell. The effect of this clause is equally powerful to my mind, in demonstrating the intention of the testator, as. if he had given a power to sell. For, whether in the act of giving he annexed a power which could only appertain to a fee, or first gives the land and then declares that such a power is acknowledged to exist, the intention is the same. If then <em>James </em>took a fee, which I am clear he did, the same estate passed over to <em>Richard. </em>For, it was obviously the intention of the testator that <em>James </em>should have one estate and <em>Richard </em>the other, with this difference only that <em>James </em>should have an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The objection to the limitation over as being to\u00f3 remote is unfounded. For, as <em>Richard </em>was <em>in esse </em>at the time the will was made, a perpetuity could not take place. Upon the whole, I have no doubt about the intention of the testator, and that a fee passed in the land in question to <em>Richard. </em>Of course I think the judgment ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b36-9\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A_3\">If we consult common sense and the reason of mankind, we shall be satisfied that where a man gives an estate in lands, without limitation or restraint, h\u00e9 means to give his whole int\u00e9rest in the same manner as if it had been a devise of money and 'personalties. But'the principle having been once admitted, that words of limitation were necessary in order to carry a fee, -there was, for a long time, no Judge found bold enough to emancipate himself from the influence of'the principle, though all of them have endeavored to undermine it. They have therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>laid hold on any words to avoid the rule of law, and effectuate the intention of the testator. Thus the word <em>estate, </em>charging the lands with a sum in gross, or giving a power to sell, have all been held to give a fee ; and it has finally been established by a long course of decisions that the manifest general intent of the testator shall prevail, if by any possibility it can be carried into effect without violating the rules of law.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">To apply these principles to the case under consideration. What did the testator mean when he said that <em>James </em>should <em>have </em>the land ? It will be said perhaps that this expression taken by itself is too doubtful to pass a fee ; but then the testator has explained what he meant by it. For he considers that his son <em>James </em>might possibly sell the estate; but, if he had such a power, the testator must necessarily have supposed that he derived it under the will; and of course conceived that he had before given such an interest as would authorise the sale. When therefore he says that <em>James </em>shall <em>have </em>his land, his meaning was that <em>James </em>should have the whole interest. '</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Having fixed an appropriate meaning therefore to the word <em>have, </em>it is fair to give it the same interpretation in the limitation over to <em>Richard. </em>Because, it is manifest that his intention was, that whatever estate <em>James </em>took, should go over to <em>Richard </em>in the event of a descent to <em>James. </em>Besides, if <em>James </em>sold the land, <em>Richard </em>was to have half the purchase money, not for life, but absolutely; for there is no restriction, he is to have half the purchase, which is a plain disposition of the whole interest. So that in that event the testator clearly meant the whole interest; and therefore the fair inference is, that he intended the same thing in case no sale took place. If there be a devise to A. unless his father purchase other lands of the same value for him, and then to another '; here A. has a fee, because purchase imports an absolute purchase, <em>[Green </em>v. <em>Armstead,] </em>Hob. 65. So if there be a devise to A. for life, and then to a son, except A. purchase land of the same value for the son, and then that A. shall sell; here, if A. does not purchase, the son takes a fee for the reason just mentioned. <em>2 Cro. Jac. </em>599, <em>Hob. </em>65. These two cases are in principle the same with that at bar, and appear to me to decide the cause. For the first expressly proves a fee in <em>James </em>and the latter a like estate in <em>Richard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>An objection was made to the remoteness of the limitation to <em>Richard ; </em>but as the estate was to descend to <em>James </em>himself, that is, in his life-time', it was to take place within a life in being, and consequently is within the allowed limits for the vesting of executory devises.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">I concur with the rest of the Judges, therefore, that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b34-8\">[* While I am not sure that too much stress was not placed upon the word \u201c have\u201d in the case of G. and G. it is certain that that word did not afford the governing principle of the decision: it was only an ingredient or circumstance in the case: the principal ground of the decision seems to have been, that a fee was inferred, from the testator\u2019s having legalized a power in the devisee to sell: and besides, <em>that </em>testator appears to have been <em>extremely </em>ignorant and illiterate.
