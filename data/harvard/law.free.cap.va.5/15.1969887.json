That <em>Baird </em>had since issued execution against <em>Rice </em>for the balance of the judgment; and, therefore, the bill prayed an <em>injunction. </em>The answer stated, that upon the day of sale, a bond of indemnity was demanded by the Sheriff in consequence of the sale having been forbid under some incumbrance, which neither <em>Rice </em>nor <em>Baird </em>would give. <em>Thzt^Black </em>offered to pay 150/. if his property was released ; which proposition <em>Mathews </em>urged <em>Rice </em>and <em>Baird </em>both to accede to. That <em>Rice </em>declared he was perfectly satisfied with whatever should be recommended by <em>Mathews: </em>and thereupon <em>Baird </em>accepted the 150/. That so far from <em>Rice\u2019s </em>appearing to consider himself exonerated from the debt, he afterwards solicited the loan of 220/. of <em>Baird </em>and one <em>TVestmore,- </em>which they consented to lend, provided he would give them good security for that sum as well as for whatever he might be previously indebted in to <em>Westmore, </em>and for the balance which he still owed <em>Baird </em>on the judgment. That <em>Rice </em>agreed thereto and offered them a deed of trust on his <em>Hackwood </em>estate; but this negociation afterwards breaking off, <em>Baird </em>issued the execution which is sought to be in-joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">It appeared by the evidence that a deed of trust had been given' on the property to secure a debt due to <em>Mar vault, </em>and to indemnify <em>Rice </em>against his suretyship aforesaid ; which was proved in the District Court of <em>Suffolk </em>by two \u25a0witnesses, and ordered to be recorded. That the sale was forbid in respect of <em>Marvault\u2019s </em>interest, but <em>Rice </em>insisted on its talcing place and offered to release his interest in the property: that the Sheriff demanded an indemnity, which neither <em>Baird </em>or <em>Rice </em>offered to give. That <em>Baird </em>upon receiving payment of the above-mentioned 150/. and <em>Black\u2019s </em>promising to have the property sold within four months under the said deed of trust, directed the Sheriff to restore the property to <em>Black ; </em>which he accordingly did. That an attorney was sent for to draw the mortgage on the <em>Hackwood </em>estate, but the treaty broke off and none was executed. That at this time <em>Baird </em>offered to advance a sum of money to <em>Rice </em>if he would secure the debt due from <em>Black. </em>That <em>Baird </em>stated an account against <em>Rice, </em>in which he charged the balance of <em>Black\u2019s </em>judgment; and that the same was shewn to <em>Rice, </em>during the period of ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>gociation for the mortgage. Upon the final hearing of the cause, the Borough Court dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill with costs. From which decree <em>Rice </em>appealed to the Court of Chancery, where the decree of the Borough Court was reversed, and the injunction made perpetual. From which decree <em>Baird </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-6\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-7\">The question is, whether the several acts of <em>Baird </em>upon the day of sale, exonerated <em>Rice </em>from his suretyship ? He could only be released by express agreement; the mere circumstance of <em>Baird\u2019s </em>having given time was not sufficient. <em>Dingwall </em>v. <em>Dunster, </em>Dougl. 235. Where the delay was greater and the circumstances stronger than in the present case: but it was decided, that nothing but an express declaration by the holder of the bill, would discharge the acceptor. The principle of which case is the same with that before the Court: for the acceptor there was in fact only a security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-8\">Besides, there are circumstances in the present case to justify the delay; for, an incumbrance was suggested, and the Sheriff demanded an indemnity which <em>Baird </em>was not bound to give. Because he was not obliged to run any risque, or encounter the consequences of an act, which might bring him into difficulties; but it was the proper business of the security to see that the debt was paid. <em>[Bishop </em>v. Church,] 2 Ves. <em>sen. </em>103, 372. If <em>Rice </em>wished diligence and activity to be used, he ought to have paid the money and taken an assignment of the judgment; after which he might have proceeded to sell or not as he thought proper. All this he could readily have done, as he was upon the spot and knew of the difficulties. If he failed to do so then, it was his own fault; and the <em>laches </em>was upon his side and not on ours. But he had the property incumbered for the very purpose of securing this debt; and therefore might have proceeded to sell under the deed of trust, as he was opposed by no creditor. His insisting on the sale was unimportant; for it was forbid by others, and the Sheriff demanded an indemnity which, as before observed, <em>Baird </em>was under no obligation to give.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-9\">If <em>Rice </em>is entitled to relief at all, it must be on the ground that his situation was altered. But it clearly was not; aS he was present at the sale, knew what was going on, was possessed of a deed of trust for the property, and had it a\u00e1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>amply in his power to secure himself afterwards as before.He cannot, therefore, with any propriety insist that the conduct of <em>Baird </em>lulled him into security; for he was fully apprised that the debt was not paid, and that there was no positive agreement for his exoneration.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-8\"><em>Wickham, </em>contra.-</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-9\">This was a joint judgment and execution, upon which the Sheriff took property which was afterwards released by order of <em>Baird, </em>who thereby exonerated <em>Rice. </em>For, if the Sheriff had returned the truth of the case, no new execution could have issued at common law; and although by the statute, a party may have several executions, yet a satisfaction of the first discharges the judgment; and the taking of a second is at the peril of the plaintiff. Indeed if the proper return had been made, <em>Baird </em>could not even under the statute have taken a second execution; because the first would have appeared upon record to be discharged. Now the omission of the officer to make the return will not alter the nature of the case, especially in equity, which always considers that as actually done, which ought to be done. For it was the Sheriff\u2019s duty to have made the return, the law obliged him to do so, and his failure ought not to prejudice any party. Therefore, <em>Rice </em>was entitled to the same benefit from the transaction, as if the return had been actually made; and consequently no second execution ought to have issued. The rule being, that if the first execution be from whatever cause discharged, that the judgment is satisfied and no other execution can issue on it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-10\">But it is said, the agreement was that if the money was ilot paid within four months, another execution should issue. Which is not correct; for the agreement was that the property should be sold under the deed of trust. If the fact though were that it was agreed, a second execution should issue after the four months, yet that would not alter the equity of <em>Rice; </em>because it was an agreement without his consent. On the contrary, he insisted on the sale; and the property taken, was clearly sufficient to have paid the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-11\">The deed of trust was no objection. For, if it be a mortgage, which it is most like in its terms, then having .been only proved by two witnesses, it was by the very words of the statute expressly void against creditors. If, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>however, it be taken as another kind of conveyance, then the possession of the property remaining with the grantor, it was equally void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-4\">The business of the loan proves clearly that in the apprehension of <em>Baird </em>himself, <em>Rice </em>was discharged. It was a bait on the hook, by which he hoped to allure bin? into the suretyship again.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-5\">The authorities cited on the other side, don\u2019t apply. That in <em>Dougl, </em>was merely a resort to the security after an ineffectual application to the principal. That in <em>Ves. </em>is indeed stronger; but there was no new agreement in that case, as there was in the present. For the plaintiff relied upon his first security, and made no alteration in it. But here <em>Baird </em>made an entirely new contract; which tended to lull <em>Rice </em>into repose, and without the aid of a Court of Equity, would have turned to his prejudice. The decree of the Court of Chancery therefore is right, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"pAqq\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A3N\">The taken in execution in this case being forbidden to be sold, under an idea of a prior lien, the Sheriff was nevertheless bound to proceed finally in the business, and to make his return upon the execution. Upon the refusal of the appellant to give an indemnity, he might, on application to the Court, have had further time given him to make his return, and in the mean time, have put it upon the parties concerned to litigate their right to the property in question, by filing a bill for that purpose. This is said to be within the power of the Sheriff in such cases in <em>Cowper </em>et al. v. <em>Chitty &amp; Blackston; </em>1 Burr. 34; and perhaps other cautionary steps are within his power. During all these measures, the plaintiff is not bound to -do any thing; he may remain a silent and inactive \u2022spectator: and is to be supposed totally unconcerned in the transaction. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">But, if he shall voluntarily intrude himself therein, he may release the obligation of the Sheriff to proceed, he may loose his lien upon the property and may discharge third persons otherwise liable, in the event of the property seized being insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">The testimony in this cause is, that the plaintiff, instead of leaving the Sheriff to encounter the difficulties in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>legal manner, made a compromise, and authorised the Sheriff to release the property; <em>Rice, </em>the now appellee, strenuously insisting, all the while, that the Sheriff should proceed to act in the legal manner: and, as an inducement thereto, offering to give up his claim to the property in question under the deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"ALSf\">This conduct, I conceive, as far as it respected the sum to he paid in future, amounted to a new contract; a simple contract, indeed, instead of a judgment; and one whereby <em>Black </em>alone became liable, instead of <em>Black </em>and <em>Rice: </em>and the consideration of this new assumpsit on the part of <em>Black, </em>was the releasement of his property then in the hands of the Sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">However improvident this contract might be, in these respects, no person can say that <em>Baird </em>had not a right to malee it; nor, that the consideration on which it was founded was not a good one to sustain an action against <em>Black: </em>but, the effect is, that the old contract was thereby at an end, and with it <em>Rice\u2019s </em>liability to pay the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"A46\">There is no testimony as at the time of the transaction, that <em>Rice </em>did not consider himself discharged; and if, at a future time, the belief of his being liable is inferred from his consenting, or at least not objecting that the balance of <em>Black\u2019s </em>debt should be comprised in the mortgage on the <em>Hackwood </em>estate, that inference is confronted on one hand, by the circumstance of his forbidding a sale of the property comprised in his trust deed at a time prior, but never pos-., terior to the compromise, although it appears from the record, that many executions attached on that property, as well after as before that period; and on the other hand, this circumstance may be merely considered as a tacit consent to become again liable for that debt, in consideration of advantages expected from the loan of the money by <em>Baird </em>and <em>Westmore. </em>Which, however, were never completed; and, possibly, he might have thought it of little consequence, having som\u00e9 prospect, for aught appears to the contrary, of being finally relieved by the Court. But, on the contrary, some opinion may be formed of <em>Baird\u2019s </em>own idea of <em>Rice\u2019s </em>being discharged, from his strenuously insisting on a security for that balance, and as soon as he probably got it by assignment of the bonds, seeming to reject the plan of the mortgage by directing <em>M\u2019Kenny </em>not to advance the money.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj\">These inferences are, however, too loose, and too nearly balanced for us tb form any decided opinion from them, as to the ideas of the parties subsequent to the compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The case rests, therefore, upon the transactions at that time, and these, in my opinion, amount to a discharge of the appellee from his \u25a0 liability. Of course, the <em>Chancellor\u2019s </em>decree, making the injunction perpetual, must be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"pAV7\">CARRINGTON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AF1\">An execution once levied and returned satisfied, discharges the judgment forever; and the law is the same, if what is equivalent thereto, be done. In the present case, the officer had taken the property which he restored by the order of <em>Baird, </em>but expressly against the consent of <em>Rice. </em>The Sheriff ought then to have returned the execution with a statement of the facts; and, if he had done so, no new execution 'could have issued. But, his omission did not affect the justice of the case, or alter the rights of the parties; which must be considered in the same manner as if the return had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">I admit that <em>Baird </em>was not bound to indemnify the Sheriff, and if the case rested upon that point, he would have been safe; but, his consenting that the payment should be delayed, and releasing the property, changed the complexion of the case altogether, and discharged <em>Rice </em>from his covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">It is true, the answer states that <em>Rice </em>was consenting to the release of the property; but it is not proved; and this part of the answer is not responsive to the bill. Consequently, it is not evidence. I think therefore that the decree of the Court of Chancery is right; and ought to be. affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b45-7\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"ADY\">The execution levied on considerable property, restored to <em>Black </em>by order of the creditor on payment of part of the money, and a further day given for the balance, was a total discharge of the judgment as to <em>Rice, </em>at law, if the Sheriff had done his duty in returning the execution with the truth of the case. But he having neglected this, <em>Rice </em>is driven into a Court of Equity for relief; where things are considered as performed, which, ought to have been done.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> He must indeed appear with a fair aspect, and not have done any act contributing to the omission; or forborne to do what he might to prevent it.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>It is said in the answer, that the transaction was with his privity and consent, and this, if proved, would have bound him, and operated no change in his original engagement. But this is not proved; on the contrary, it is disproved, as far as a negative can be, by testimony of facts inconsistent with the supposition. He pressed the sale, and waived his claim under the deed of trust, which repels the idea that he was consenting to the postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"AFP\">But it is said, he might have given security to the Sheriff, and proceeded to sell under the execution. I fancy this was rather a hasty and sudden assertion of the counsel; for I could refer it to that gentleman himself on cool reflection, whether the Sheriff could at the instance of <em>Rice </em>or' any other, proceed to sell under the execution, when he was ordered to forbear and restore the property by the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">As to a sale under the deed; that was to be made by <em>Leatry </em>when required by <em>Rice </em>and <em>Marvault; </em>the subject don\u2019t appear to have been contemplated by them at this time, and if <em>Rice </em>conceived himself discharged from the engagement, he had no right to proceed under the deed, nor was he obliged to involve himself anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In the list of executions filed amongst the testimony in the cause, there appears a series of them at the suit of <em>Knight </em>against <em>Black </em>from <em>December, </em>1788, to <em>September, </em>1792. On some of the intermediate ones, property contained in the trust deed was taken; and the sale forbid, at one time by <em>Leatry, </em>and another by <em>Rice: </em>But it does not appear that either of them forbid the sale on the last execution in <em>September, </em>1792, (four months after <em>Baird\u2019s </em>sale) leyied on two slaves; neither does it appeal that the slaves were in fact sold; but the creditor\u2019s receipt is endorsed for the debt, amounting to 143/. 4s. 1J. From hence two inferences seem natural; first, that <em>Rice </em>considered himself as discharged, and so did not appear to stop this sale, as he had done on the former occasions. Secondly, that 143/. was then raised on the seizure of two slaves; which makes it probable that <em>Baird </em>might have got his money, if he had pursued his execution and not made the compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">But it is said, that the transaction in <em>February, </em>1793, shews <em>Rice </em>at that time considered, and acknowledged himself liable for this debt. I forbear to review the evidence of that negociation, because I think myself warranted by reason and precedent, in deciding, that propo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>sitions on either side, made by parties on a treaty for compromising their differences, if that treaty be not effectual, are not to operate as evidence in a future contest in Court. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">I come now to the conduct of Mr. <em>Baird: </em>The cases from <em>Dougl. </em>and <em>Ves. </em>sen. were cited to prove that a creditor to preserve his remedy against a security, is not obliged to give him notice that the principal has not paid, nor to use legal diligence against him short of the time prescribed by the act of limitations, nor to sue though desired by the security.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Upon which I observe, that the case in <em>Ves. </em>sen. was going a long way for a Court of Equity; and perhaps our act of Assembly, <em>Dec. </em>1794, C. 116, \u00a7 6, <em>R. C. </em>ed. 1819,] which obliges the principal to sue if required by the security, is better. But, if full force be allowed the doctrine, it will not profit <em>Baird </em>in the present case. If, indeed, he had forborne to act, refused to give the security and left the Sheriff to the duty of his office, no <em>laches </em>could have been imputed to him; and <em>Rice\u2019s </em>exoneration must have depended on the final event of that \u00e9xecution. But <em>Baird </em>acted, he received a part of his money, gave <em>Black </em>a further day for the balance, and directed the property to be restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">I conclude, as I began, that the Sheriff ought to have returned that the property seized had been restored-hy order of the plaintiff, which would have been a discharge of <em>Rice </em>at law, and this Court considering it as done, will give it the legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Affirm the decree.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-13\">[* See act of <em>Feb. </em>8, 1808, c. 129, ed. 1808; c. 134 \u00a7 25, <em>R.
