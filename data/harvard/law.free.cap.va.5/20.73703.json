Prom this decree, the plaintiffs prayed an appeal, which was allowed by this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-7\"><em>Spooner, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An1\">maintained, 1. That the unexpended surplus of the interest of the fund of 2531 dollars, which the testator dedicated to the purpose of educating his nephew and nieces, <em>Archer, Polly </em>and <em>Martha, </em>was not bequeathed by implication to his sister <em>Mary; </em>for he had already made ample provision for her, without indicating a design to give her any interest whatever in this fund, principal or interest; and the postponement of the division of the principal among her seven children till her death, was to be accounted for by the circumstance, that he had appointed that period for the division of the slaves he had bequeathed her for life. He could not have intended, that any of the interest of the fund should enure to the benefit of his sister; for he directed, that the amount of the interest should be applied to the education of the three children. Yet he must have foreseen, that the children might attain to such an age before their mother\u2019s death, that the interest of the fund could no longer be applicable to their education. The legacy of the interest, then, was limited by the purpose to which it was destined. Indeed, he did not bequeath this interest to the three children; he only directed the application of it, or of so much as should bo sufficient for the purpose, to their education; that is, doubtless to their education during their minority. Therefore, he argued, the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>over and above what was sufficient for the purpose, and that which accrued after the purpose was accomplished, not being otherwise disposed of, sunk into the residuum, and belonged to <em>Martha Rowlett </em>the residuary legatee. 2. He contended, that the bequest of the principal of the fund, to the seven nephews and nieces, to be divided between them at the death of their mother, did not give a vested legacy to each, but a contingent legacy to each, dependant on the event of his surviving his mother, or if he died before her, leaving descendants; that, therefore, the legacies to <em>Peter, John </em>and <em>Archer, </em>who died before their mother without leaving descendants, were disappointed by the event; and that their shares of this fund also, sunk into the residuum, and passed to the residuary legatee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-5\"><em>Taylor, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT\">submitted, that it was quite clear, that the bequest of the principal gave a vested legacy to each of the seven legatees, to which they or their representatives were entitled, whether they survived their mother, or, dying before her, left descendants, or not. Upon the other point, he contended, that the surplus of the interest over and above what might be requisite for the education of <em>Archer, Polly </em>and <em>Martha, </em>and, especially, so much of the interest as could not be applied to their education, because it accrued after it was no longer capable of application to that purpose, belonged to the testator\u2019s sister <em>Mary; </em>that the effect of the will was a bequest by implication of the interest of the fund to her, charged with the education of those three children. Why did he postpone the division of the principal till her death, if he intended that no benefit should accrue to her from the fund during her life? He must h\u00e1ve foreseen (as the appellant\u2019s counsel had justly remarked) that the interest might cease to be wanting for the education of the three children, before their mother\u2019s death; he must have foreseen, too, that they might all three die within a short time after him: if he intended no benefit to their mother, he would have directed the division of the principal to be made, so soon as the means of educating the three children should cease to be wanted. But without regard to the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the education being accomplished, or ceasing, before his sister\u2019s death, he postponed the division of the principal till her death. This was a bequest, by implication, to the mother of the children, of the surplus profits accruing during her life. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Summerset, 5 </em>Burr. 2608. <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Hoski</em>ns, 9 East 306. <em>Hammond </em>v. Neame, 1 Swanst. 35. <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Hunsdon, 2 </em>Id. 342. The testator gave the mother of his nephews and nieces, the use for her life, of all the other property he destined as a future provision for them; of his slaves and all his visible personal chattels, and the dividends of his bank stock: and he made this provision for her, not merely for her own benefit, certainly, but to enable her to provide for the comfort of her children. The only difference intended by him in the disposition of this pecuniary fund, was to provide for the education of three of her children (the three youngest) out of the profits of it; and, subject to that charge, he meant to give her the profits of this fund, in like manner as he had given her the use of the other property for her life.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b45-7\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ACE\">The first question is, to whom the surplus of the interest of the pecuniary fund of 2531 dollars belonged? to the testator\u2019s sister <em>Mary Rowlett </em>? to the residuary legatee, <em>Martha </em>? or to the three children <em>Archer, Polly </em>and Martha, to the education of whom the testator directed the interest of the fund to be appropriated? The circuit superiour court decreed it to <em>Mary Rowlett; </em>and the decree has been sustained in argument here, on the ground, that the principal of the fund being directed to be divided among the seven nephews and nieces, <em>at her death, </em>amounted to a bequest to her by implication, of this surplus of interest accruing during her life; and many cases were cited to shew, that estates real and personal are given by implication, sometimes even to the disinheriting the heir. There can be no doubt of the doctrine; but it is equally clear, that an implication which will carry such estate, must be necessary, in order to effect the clear intent of the testator. Is it so here? I think not. To arrive at the conclusion, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the testator intended that the surplus interest should go to his sister <em>Mary, </em>we must first ascertain, that he contemplated the existence of such surplus. He directs his money to be put out at interest, and the amount of the interesf to be applied to the education of the three children; the <em>amount, </em>that is, not a half, a fourth, or so much as others may choose to expend, but the <em>whole </em>interest is to be so applied. This is the clear meaning. The fund would yield about 150 dollars a year; only 50 dollars for each; and this ought all to have been expended on their education. The kind of education intended by the testator, should have been measured by the fund; and they should have been benefited in.the cultivation of their minds and manners, to the full amount pf the sum he had appropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Seeing that the testator meant to appropriate the whole to their education, we cannot suppose he looked to any excess. If it be asked, how would the interest have gone, if the children had died soon .after the testator? I answer, this idea probably never occurred to him, and can furnish no ground of implication in favor of his sister, who being much older than these children, could hardly be looked to by him as likely to outlive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">As to the argument drawn from fixing the division of the principal money at the death of his sister; that may be accounted for, I think, on other ground. The land and slaves are lent to his sister expressly for her life, and at her death the different tracts are disposed of, and the slaves are to be divided among her seven children. This then being the time when these other distributions would take place, it might have struck the testator, as a convenient period to divide this money also. There is nothing, I think, which shews any intent to give this surplus to his sister, strong enough to raise a bequest to her by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Shall this go to the residuary legatee? This question is more doubtful. In <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Rous, </em>8 Ves. 25. sir <em>W. Grant </em>says, \u201cIt has been long settled, that a residuary bequest of personal property (for it is otherwise as to real) carries not only every thing not disposed of, but' every thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>that in the event turns out not to be disposed of: not in consequence of any direct or expressed intention; for it may be argued in ail cases, that particular legacies are separated from the residue, and that the testator does not mean, that the residuary legatee shall take what is given from him: no; for he does not contemplate the case: the residuary legatee is to take only what is left: but that does not prevent the right of the residuary legatee. <em>A </em>presumption arises for the residuary legatee, against every one except the particular legatee. The testator is supposed to give it away from the residuary legatee, only for the sake of the particular legatee.\u201d And again in <em>Dawson </em>v. Clark, 15 Ves. 41.6-7. the same distinguished judge says, <em>\u201cI have always </em>understood, that a general residue of personal property comprehended every thing, not otherwise effectually disposed of by the will; and that there is no difference, whether a legacy falls into it by lapse, or as being void at law.\u201d This, which seems to be the settled law on the subject, makes the case of a residuary legatee a strong one; and if it can be considered, that this surplus of interest is lapsed, undisposed of, or ineffectually disposed of, I agree, that, the residuary legatee must have it. That <em>it is </em>lapsed, was not contended; but the idea seemed to be, that it was no bequest of any thing to the three children, but merely a direction to the executor to apply so much of the interest, as he might choose, to their education, and that the surplus, if not given by implication to the mother, was undisposed of. The first, objection to this construction, is, that it holds out a strong temptation to neglect the education of the children; for here, the father, as executor and natural guardian, had control of this fund, and in right of his wife claims all the surplus interest. It is clear, then, that the less he expended on the education of the infants, the larger would bo the excess which he claimed. Hut look at the bequest itself: to my mind it is substantially this: My executor is to put to interest all my money, and it is to remain at interest till the death of my sister Mary; this interest, which will amount to about 1.50 dollars annually, I give to <em>Archer. Polly </em>and <em>Martha Powlell, </em>to be applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>their education. I think it is impossible to deny that this is a fair and faithful expression of the testator\u2019s meaning; and to what does it amount? Is it not a gift of this entire fund to these infants? Can one say, that the testator did not \"Yyish. and intend, that every cent of'this interest should be laid out in their education? If the <em>executor </em>and guardian had so expended it, who could have charged him with going beyond his duty? But he has suffered their minds to remain uncultivated, while the fund accumulated, by which neglect of duty he has probably done them an irreparable injury: shall this very injury be the foundation <em>of </em>a <em>claim to </em>the fund? Can any body doubt, that, if the guardian or some Mend of these infants had filed a bill, and brought the subject before a court of equity, the court would have taken effectual steps for the application of this whole fund to their education and maintenance? And as that is now impossible, and rendered so by no fault of theirs, will not equity repair the injury, as far as it can, by giving them this money now, which the testator devoted exclusively to their benefit? Feeling this strongly to be the justice of the matter, I could not but think, that cases would be found to support it; and an examination has satisfied me that the fact is so. The rule which these cases establish, is this: where a legacy is given to a person to answer a particular-purpose, to which it becomes impossible to appropriate it, but from no fault in the legatee, he will be entitled to the money; and it rests on this principle, that the <em>fund </em>being appropriated to the benefit of the legatee, the mode in which it shall be applied is but a secondary object, and does not enter into the substance of the gift. Thus, in <em>Barlow </em>v. Grant, 1 Vern. 255. the bequest was of \u00a3 30. to A. an infant, to bind him apprentice; A. died before attaining the proper age to be put out apprentice; and the question was, whether his executor was entitled to receive the money? It was decreed to him, on the ground that A. took a vested interest. In <em>Nevill </em>v. <em>Nevill, </em>2 Vern. 431. the testator gave \u00a3 500. to the eldest son of <em>John Nevill </em>(to be begotten) to place him out apprentice (or, as in the registrar\u2019s book, \u201cfor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>putting him forth either to law or merchandise\u201d): <em>John </em>had a son born after the death of the testator, who claimed the legacy; though he was unfit to be placed out, as directed by the will, yet the legacy was ordered to be paid to him. So in <em>Barton </em>v. Cooke, 5 Ves. 462. testator directed his executors to apply \u00a3100. for the board and education of J. B. until he were fit to be put out apprentice, and that then they should pay the further sum of \u00a3 100. with him, as an apprentice fee. It appeared, that J. B. attained the age of nineteen, but had not been placed out apprentice. The question was, whether he was entitled to the two legacies of \u00a3100? Lord <em>Alvanley </em>decreed them to him; adding, that if a legacy is given for the benefit of an infant in one way, and it cannot be so applied, it may be applied for his benefit in another way; and he put the case of a legacy given to put an infant into orders, and he should become a lunatic. Other cases are referred to in the books; 1 Rop. on Leg. 430. but these are enough to shew the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">I am, therefore, of opinion that this legacy vested equally in the three children, Archer, <em>Polly </em>and <em>Martha; </em>and that <em>Archer </em>dying, his portion went to his general distributees.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">I am of opinion also, that the seven children took vested interests in the principal sum put out to interest during their mother\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred. Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
