at which time, or at that son\u2019s death, if that event should first happen, he 'bequeathed one third of those slaves and their increase to his wife, and the other two thirds to and among his children <em>Robert, John, Joseph, James, Samuel, Isabel, Christian </em>and <em>Violetta: </em>that the testator\u2019s widow <em>Charity, </em>and <em>Robert </em>the son, qualified as executors of the will: that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Charity, the widow, afterwards married <em>John Millstead; </em>and during her second coverture, her son <em>Samuel </em>attaining to full age, division was duly made of the slaves; and one named <em>Sue </em>alias Susanna, was allotted to <em>Mrs. Millstead </em>in part of her third : that after the division, the -woman <em>Sue </em>had great increase, and all vested in <em>John </em>Millstead, the second husband: that <em>John </em>Millstead, by deed dated the 26th July 1791, gave <em>Sue </em>and her increase, nine in number, to the plaintiff <em>William Millstead: </em>and these slaves were in the possession of the defendants <em>James </em>and <em>Samuel Colvert </em>and <em>Isabella Bruce. </em>And the bill called <em>on </em>the defendants to discover the names, sexes and ages, of the slaves in their possession, respectively, and how long they had had them in possession; and prayed, that they might be ordered to deliver the property to the plaintiff, and to account for and pay him the profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-4\"><em>James </em>and <em>Samuel Colvert </em>answered, that the division pretended in the bill, was made <em>before </em>not after <em>Samuel\u2019s </em>attainment to full age, without any consent of parties, and w'ithout any order of court directing it; and that the pretended division was not made of the whole but of part only of the slaves, the parties who had agreed to the making of the division, having disagreed before the persons appointed to make it by <em>John </em>Millstead, had finished the division: that there were two slaves, <em>Leonard </em>and David, in possession of <em>James </em>Colvert, and two others, <em>Harry </em>and <em>Watt, </em>in possession of <em>Samuel Colvert; </em>which slaves formerly belonged, or descended from slaves that belonged, to the testator <em>Robert Calvert\u2019s </em>estate, but whether they were part, or the descendants of any, of those allotted to <em>Mrs. </em>Millstead, the defendants were ignorant: and that the defendants had been in possession of those four slaves from the autumn of the year 1796.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-5\"><em>Isabella Bruce </em>answered, that no such division of the testator <em>Robert Colvert\u2019s </em>slaves, as that alleged in the hill, was ever made;

there was an objection made, that what was done was not legal; so it stopped at that, till <em>Samuel </em>came of age to divide the estate; and the same <em>Mr. Courts </em>and <em>Mr. Luchetts </em>came to divide, but they never went through with the division.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">The plaintiff filed copies of seven depositions taken in 1793 and 1794, in an action of detinue then pending in the district court of <em>Frederick, </em>in which he was plaintiff and <em>Robert Bruce </em>was defendant; namely, the depositions, 1. Of <em>Walter Hanson; </em>who deposed, that he was called on, in 1768, by the executors and all the legatees of <em>Robert Colvert, </em>to make a settlement of that testator\u2019s estate, which had previously been referred to <em>Mr. Smallwood </em>and <em>Mr. Courts; </em>and that an account being laid before him, which the parties allowed to be a settlement made by <em>Mr. S. </em>and <em>Mr. C. </em>he, on examining it, thought the parties ought to abide by the settlement, so far as it was made by those gentlemen: and he proved the handwriting of <em>Mr. Smallwood </em>as subscribing witness to a bond executed by <em>Joseph Colvert </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Joseph Bruce, </em>and to several receipts given to the executors of the testator <em>Robert Colvert, </em>dated the 10th and 11th December 1705. 2. Of <em>Richard Barnes, </em>who also proved the handwriting of <em>Mr. S. </em>as subscribing witness to the <em>bond </em>and <em>receipts </em>mentioned by <em>Hanson; </em>and described those papers, as being <em>four receipts </em>given to <em>Robert Colvert's </em>executors, by the legatees <em>James </em>and <em>Joseph Colvert, </em>and by <em>C. Mason </em>and <em>Joseph Bruce </em>[who, it seemed, had married other legatees of the testator], and a <em>bond </em>executed by <em>Joseph Colvert </em>and <em>Joseph Bruce </em>to the executors, to indemnify them for making a division while <em>Samuel Colvert </em>was under age\u2014but the bond and receipts were not in this record. 3. Of <em>Henry Speake, </em>that he understood from his wife, who was the widow of the legatee <em>Joseph Colvert, </em>that her first husband had received his part of his father\u2019s estate, and a general settlement had been made with all the legatees; that the legatee <em>James Colvert </em>told the deponent, that he set up no claim against <em>John Millstead; </em>and tire deponent <em>always understoood, </em>that the woman <em>Sue </em>was <em>Mrs. Millstead!s </em>part of her first husband\u2019s estate, and that the slaves, <em>Hannah, Leonard </em>and <em>Harry, </em>were the children of <em>Sue </em>and <em>Wall </em>the son of <em>Hannah. </em>4. The deposition of <em>Godfrey Murdock; </em>who deposed, that ho was present at the division made by <em>Mr. Smallwood </em>and <em>Mr. Courts; </em>that he was told by <em>John Millstead, </em>that <em>Sue </em>was allotted to his wife; and he never heard of any objection to the division. 5. Of <em>Elizabeth Davis ; </em>who deposed, that she <em>always understood, </em>that on the division of <em>Robert Colvert's </em>estate, <em>Sue </em>was left with <em>Mrs. Millstead </em>as her part thereof, and the other slaves were divided among that testator\u2019s children, and that the slaves in possession of <em>Joseph Bruce, </em>claimed by <em>William Millstead, </em>were the descendants of <em>Sue. </em>6. Of <em>Ann Browner; </em>who deposed, that <em>Mrs. Millstead </em>told her, that <em>Sue </em>was allotted to her in the division; that she <em>always understood, </em>that such was the case, and that the division was made by <em>Mr. Smallwood </em>and <em>Mr. Courts, </em>and she had never heard of any objection to the division; that <em>after the division </em>she saw a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>named <em>Hannah </em>in <em>Sue\u2019s </em>arms, which she understood and believed was <em>Sue\u2019s </em>child; and that the slaves in <em>Joseph Bruce\u2019s </em>possession, claimed by <em>William Millstead, </em>were fbe descendants of <em>Sue. </em>And 7. Of <em>Joseph Young; </em>who prove(jj that <em>William Colvert </em>demanded the slaves in question of <em>Robert </em>Bruce, in 1791.

That the division of the testator <em>Robert Colvert's </em>estate made in <em>Maryland </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>1765, under which the appellee claimed title, was so irregular and incomplete that it conferred no right, especially, in respect to the appellant, <em>Samuel Colvert, </em>who was under age- 2. That as it is proved, that <em>Joseph </em>Bruce, under whom the defendants in the amended bill claimed, was in adversary possession of the slaves claimed by <em>William </em>Millstead, as early as 1791, more than five years before the commencement of this suit, the statute of limitations of itself afforded a complete defence to all persons claiming under him; nor'did the pendency of <em>Millstead!s </em>suit at law against <em>Bruce, </em>in the district court of <em>Fredericksburg, </em>avoid the operation of the statute; <em>Elam </em>v. <em>Bass\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>4 Munf. 301. And if <em>Samuel Colvert </em>claimed under <em>Joseph Bruce, </em>the statute was also a bar to the claim asserted in this suit, to the slaves held by him. 3. That if <em>Samuel Colvert </em>did not claim under <em>Joseph Bruce, </em>then there was no proof to sustain the appellee\u2019s claim to the two slaves <em>Harry </em>and <em>Watt </em>held by him. For, he contended, the only evidence properly belonging to this cause, was the deposition of <em>Mrs. Woodward; </em>and that proved nothing more than that the woman <em>Sue </em>was allotted to <em>Mrs. Millstead </em>in the division of 1765; it did not prove, that any one of the slaves claimed by the appellee, was descended from <em>Sue. </em>The depositions taken in the suit at law against <em>Joseph Bruce, </em>were not competent evidence against the appellant <em>Samuel Colvert, </em>because they were taken in a cause to which he was not party or privy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqb\">said, that admitting the division of 1765 to have been premature, and that division, as well as the division made in 1768, to have been ever so irregular and incomplete, yet it was obvious, that there must have been such a long continued and entire acquiescence in it by all parties, before this controversy arose, as alone sufficed to preclude them from disturbing it. As to the statute of limitations, he said, it did not appear how or under whom the appellant <em>Samuel Colvert </em>claimed; his possession commenced, as he admitted in his answer, as late as 1796, and this suit was brought in 1798; besides, the statute of lirni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>tations was nowise pleaded. He relied on the depositions taken in the suit at law between <em>Millstead </em>and <em>Bruce, </em>as containing the proof, that the slaves <em>Harry </em>and <em>Watt </em>descended from <em>Sue </em>who was allotted to <em>Mrs. Millstead. </em>He adverted to the established rule of practice in the courts of chancery, requiring exceptions to depositions to be taken in writing, before the hearing, which had been always and ought to be strictly enforced, in order to avoid surprize upon the party relying upon them to establish his case. Now, no exception to the reading of the depositions in question, was taken, before or at the hearing: they were read at the hearing before chancellor <em>Wythe </em>in 1804,\u2014read again at the hearing in 18.19, and lastly, read in 1822, against the appellant, without objection of any kind. It was too late to object to them now. And if the objection had been made in the court of chancery, and in due time, it ought not to have prevailed; for the only material purpose of these depositions was to prove the descent of the slaves held by the appellant, from the woman <em>Sue. </em>Hearsay and general reputation were competent evidence to prove pedigree; and these depositions ought to have been received as proof of general reputation as to the pedigree of the slaves.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-4\">\n<em>Beigh</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhD\">replied, that though hearsay and general reputation were competent proof on questions of pedigree, still such general reputation ought to be proved by the examination of witnesses in the cause in which it is offered, so that the party against whom it is offered, may have an opportunity to cross examine the witnesses. The depositions in question could not be regarded as depositions in this cause; they were evoked from another cause between other parties; they were, in fact, exhibits. Suppose a transcript of record of the proceedings in <em>Millstead\u2019s </em>suit against Bruce, had been exhibited in this cause; that, surely, could not have been read against <em>Samuel Colvert: </em>could copies of the depositions which were part of those proceedings, be read against him ? The rule of practice in the courts of chancery had never been understood to require, that exceptions to the reading of <em>exhibits, </em>should be taken in writing be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>fore the hearing; nor had it ever been understood to require that objections to evidence on the ground of competency, apparent on the face of the evidence itself, should be stated writing, before the hearing. The rule had been confined, jn practice, to objections to depositions on the score of -irregularity in the taking of them, such as the want of due notice, and the like. Objections to competency were always taken <em>ore tenus </em>at the bar; and it was the duty of the court, at the hearing, to discard from consideration all incompetent evidence; and if it founded its decree upon incompetent evidence, it was error.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\"> Nothing appeared in the record, to account for the delays in this cause in the court of chancery; they were probably owing to the neglect of the parties. After the cause was brought to this court, the parties entered into a treaty of compromise; and their counsel understood that it was compromised, and kept the cause in court, in order to enter decrees according to the compromise, when they should he furnished with evidence of the terms of it. When this evidence was furnished, it appeared, that the cause had been compromised by the appellee with the appellant <em>Robert Colvert, </em>but not with the appellant <em>Samuel Colvert. </em>It was the appeal of the latter that was heard here; hut it was necessary to state the whole case, in order to make it intelligible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b116-4\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AUC\">The first question I shall consider in this cause, is, whether the depositions taken in the suit brought at law by <em>Millstead </em>against <em>Bruce, </em>can be read hete? Without having made up my mind as to the effect of the objection to the competency of this evidence, if the exception had been timely taken in the court of chancery, I am of opinion, that such exception taken here, at this late day, cannot avail. It is to be remembered, that the question of title, with all the children of the testator <em>Robert </em>Colvert, was the same; all claimed the slaves under his will. <em>Joseph Bruce, </em>against whom the action at law was brought, was one of those claimants, in right of his wife <em>Isabella. </em>The plaintiff in that suit was the same, relying on the same right which he relied on here; and the title of the defendants here, was identical with that called in question there. Indeed, <em>Isabella </em>the widow of <em>Bruce </em>was a defendant to this bill. In addition to this, we must hold in mind, that this was a question of pedigree, on which hearsay and reputation are evidence; and on which, all must admit, the depositions of these witnesses would be unquestionable evidence, if the witnesses were dead. Under these circumstances, it seems clear to me, that these depositions ought to have been objected to in the court of chancery, if any where. Thirty years ago, chancellor <em>Wythe </em>decided this cause on this very evidence; can we say he did wrong in receiving it, when he found it filed in the record? when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>under certain circumstances (the death of the witnesses) it would have been clearly good? and when no objection was taken to the reading it? Again, eighteen years afterwards, chancellor <em>Green </em>made the same decree, upon the same evidence, without exception taken. And now, in this court of last resort, forty years after the depositions were taken (for that was in 1793-4) we are told, that they are not good evidence. Does any one imagine that a single one of the witnesses is now alive? Consider their ages in 1793. The youngest of them was then <em>forty-nine </em>years old, the eldest <em>eighty: </em>add <em>forty </em>years, and then tell me, whether it would be right, after all the delay which has already befallen this cause, to send it back for the purpose of ascertaining whether these witnesses are alive or dead? for if dead, the evidence is above exception. I am well satisfied, that we ought to receive the evidence, without the form of this useless inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">By the will of <em>Robert Colvert, </em>I think (with chancellor Wythe) that a \u201c full dominion, a perpetual property\u201d in one third of the slaves, after <em>Samuel Colvert\u2019s </em>attainment of age, was given to his widow; in the meantime, she had the possession and ownership of the whole. I think the evidence shews, that there was a division of the slaves and their increase, partially made in 1765, while <em>Samuel </em>was under age, and completed in 1768, after he attained to full age; and that in this division <em>Sue </em>was allotted to <em>Mrs. Millstead. </em>The division is proved by several witnesses. No doubt <em>Samuel </em>Colvert, when he came of age, might have set aside this division, so far as any injustice was done him; but there is not the slightest proof that he ever objected to it. On the contrary, it would seem from the evidence of Hanson, that he assented to it; for he says that, in 1768, he was applied to by the executors, and <em>all </em>the representatives of <em>Robert </em>Colvert, to settle the estate; that they laid before him the proceedings of <em>Smallwood </em>and <em>Courts, </em>which <em>they allowed </em>to be a settlement, and on which he, on examining it, was of opinion they ought to abide by, so far as it went. All the witnesses say, that in the division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Sue </em>was allotted to <em>Millstead, </em>the husband\u2014she had many children, it seems; and in 1791, <em>Millstead </em>made a deed of gift of her and them to <em>William Millstead, </em>the original plaintiff in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"AFd\">The next question is, are the slaves <em>Harry </em>and <em>Watt </em>(admitted by <em>Samuel Colvert </em>to be in his possession) descendants of <em>Sue ? </em>I think this sufficiently established by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">I do not think the statute of limitations applies, 1st, because it is not relied on either by plea or answer; and 2ndly, because the appellant says, in his answer, that the slaves held by him had come into his possession in the fall of 1796, and this bill was filed in 1798. I think the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b118-11\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AASF\">That there was a partition of the slaves bequeathed by <em>Robert Colvert </em>to be divided between his wife and children at the maturity or death of his son <em>Samuel, </em>that it took place about the year 1765, and that the slave <em>Sue </em>was assigned to the widow in part of her third, are facts that I do not think can be controverted. They are stated in the bill, and are not denied by the answers which rest the defence on the division\u2019s having been premature, without authority, and incomplete. They are moreover proved by <em>Mrs. Woodward, </em>the only witness in this case, though her testimony very distinctly proves that the division was imperfect and not completed. This partition, if such it may. be called, was made at least as long ago as the year 1777, since the testator, at that date, had been dead twenty years, and' <em>Samuel </em>was of course of age. It is, however, very probable it was made much earlier. <em>From the </em>time of the partition, when <em>John Millstead </em>was in possession of the slaves, and insisted that the allotment, so far as it had gone, should stand, we hear nothing of any portion of the slaves until 1791, when he conveyed them to his nephew <em>William Millstead, </em>by whom a suit was soon after insti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tuted for part of them, in the <em>Fredericksburg </em>district court. There being no evidence of a change of possession until that time, we must take it to be unchanged, and thus must presume, that <em>John Millstead </em>continued in possession of the slave <em>Sue, </em>and of course of her increase born after the partition, until some time anteriour to the year 1791. If <em>Samuel </em>did not arrive to full age until 1777, this was fourteen years after his maturity: if he attained to manhood about the 3ear 1768, it was twenty-three years after. During this period, we hear of no measures taken among the parties for the completion of the partition, no question made as to the allotment to the widow, no suit instituted for the purpose of compelling a new and more perfect, regular and equitable division, and no attempt to divest <em>John Millstead </em>of the possession he continued to hold under an allotment, which, at the time it was made, he insisted should stand as far at least as it had gone. Admitting then, as I do most distinctly, that this division was imperfect, irregular and premature, and that, in fact, it went no farther, probably, than the allotment of <em>Sue </em>to the widow, yet in this allotment I think we must infer a perfect acquiescence, and an acquiescence for a period between fourteen and twenty-three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The next question is, ought this imperfect and irregular division to be confirmed in consequence of that acquiescence ? I think it ought. There is no principle better settled, than that a partition long acquiesced in by the parties, generally, will not be disturbed for irregularity <em>(Carter\u2019s ex'or </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>5 Munf. 108. 114), not even by a party who never acquiesced in it, though all others concerned had done so, unless he can shew that it is unjust or unequal. It would be highly mischievous were it otherwise, particularly in this country, where divisions of estates, allotments of dower, and the like, are made with so little attention to the strict requirements of the law; <em>Fitzhugh </em>v. <em>Foote, </em>3 Call 13. <em>Ireland </em>v. <em>Rittle, </em>1 Atk. 542. Under these authorities, there can be no doubt, that, if this division had been completed, however irregular or premature it might be, it would now be ratified on the ground of long acquiescence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Now, I think, it is not going too far to say, that, as the allotment of the widow\u2019s part was made, as the husband insisted that so far as it had gone the division should stand, and as all concerned acquiesced for so many years in the allotment, anc] the ciaim 0f rjght under it, we must take the division as complete between the widow on the one part, and the children on the other, however incomplete it may have been as between the children themselves. There is nothing in the sanction given irregular partitions after long acquiescence, which does not fully apply to the circumstances of this case. I am, therefore, of opinion, that <em>John Millstead </em>was entitled to the slave <em>Sue </em>and her children born after the allotment.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">That <em>Harry </em>and <em>Watt </em>were the descendants of <em>Sue, </em>born after she was allotted to <em>Mrs. Millstead, </em>is sufficiently proved by the depositions in the other cause, if they are to be read in this. I come then to the inquiry, how far the depositions in the action at law between <em>Millstead, </em>and <em>Bruce, </em>are evidence against <em>Samuel Colvert, who </em>was no party to that suit ? That the depositions were properly introduced as evidence in this suit, and that they were read upon the hearing, can admit, I think, of no doubt. The cases of the <em>Bruces </em>and <em>Samuel Colvert </em>were not distinct in the court of chancery. There was but one bill, in which these several defendants were united. It cannot be denied, that the depositions taken between <em>Millstead </em>and <em>Bruce, </em>in the action at law, were evidence as against the defendants claiming under <em>Bruce, in the </em>suit in chancery, and were properly filed, and must have been read as to them, upon the hearing. The depositions, then, having been read and properly read, the question still recurs, were they evidence as against <em>Samuel Colvert, </em>who was no party to the suit in which they were taken. I am of opinion, they could not be evidence of any facts set forth in them, except the fact of pedigree; of that, indeed, they would have been properly referred'to as evidence, if it could have been shewn, that the witnesses were dead. This, however, does not appear; and therefore, unless they were properly evidence against <em>Sa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>muel Colvert in toto, </em>they cannot be used on the question of pedigree. Now, in the case of <em>Stubbs </em>v. <em>Burwell, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 536. it was decided, that though a deposition was regularly taken in the cause, as to one party, there having been due notice to him, yet it could not be received as evidence to af\u00edect the interest of another party, as to whom there was no notice. Much less, then, can these depositions taken in another suit, to which <em>Samuel Colvert </em>was <em>not </em>a party, be read as evidence against him. If, pursuing the idea of the counsel, we are to take it for granted, that the chancellor reads every thing at the hearing, that appears upon the record, we are to presume he read those depositions as evidence against <em>Samuel Colvert, </em>then I am of opinion he erred in doing so. If he did not, then he could have had no evidence before him, to establish the fact that <em>Harry </em>and <em>Watt </em>were descendants of <em>Sue. </em>But as it appears upon the face of the record, that there is evidence <em>attainable </em>by which <em>the fact can be </em>established, I am of opinion, that we should send the cause back for the purpose of inquiring into that fact. To this the case of <em>Stubbs </em>v. <em>Burwell </em>is full in point; for, in that case, the depositions not being taken upon notice to <em>Stubbs, </em>but appearing to contain matter which would have justified the decree, if they could properly have been read, this court sent the causes back with directions to the court of chancery to afford the plaintiff an opportunity to take the depositions over again, upon giving due notice to the defendant <em>Stubbs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
