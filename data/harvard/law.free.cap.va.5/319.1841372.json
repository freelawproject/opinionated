Archer, </em>administrator of <em>John Archer </em>of Amelia, deceased, filed his bill in the Chancery Court of Richmond, against <em>James Robertson </em>and others, children and legatees of <em>John Archer </em>of Chesterfield, deceased, and the descendants of such of the children of the said <em>John Archer </em>as were dead. The hill was filed on the 30th day of October, 1816; and set forth, that <em>John Archer </em>of Amelia, deceased, was appointed by <em>John Archer </em>of Chesterfield his executor: that the <em>former </em>undertook the execution of the will, and made sundry payments and advances, by which the estate became considerably indebted to him: that the legatees possessed themselves of all the estate and effects of the said <em>John Archer </em>of Chesterfh Id, without ths assent of the executor, and without having executed refunding bonds to him: that the executorial accounts were referred, by agreement between the parties, to an accountant, who found a considerable balance to be due to <em>John Archer </em>of Amelia, the intestate of the complainant; but,, as this account was taken without judicial authority, the complainant had no power to establish it: that several suits are pending against the estate, by which large sums will probably be recovered against the complainant. He therefore prays for an account of the administration of <em>John Archer </em>of Amelia, deceased, upon the estate of <em>John Archer </em>of Chesterfield, deceased: that he may recover what is due to him from that estate; and that he be mads safe \u25a0against the claims now hanging oyer him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>' The answer of <em>John Archer, </em>one of the defendants, denies that the legatees took possession of the estate of their testator without the assent of <em>John Archer, </em>the executor, and asserts that the estate was divided by a decree of the Connty Court of Chesterfield; which decree also directed a settlement of the executor\u2019s account of administration; but, that he neglected to do so, from the date of the decree in November, 1802, to the day of his death: that the defendant never did consent that the accounts should be settled by the person stated in the bill, or that he had any notice of the proceedings in that settlement, till he was informed of the account long after it was stated: that the account so stated was entirely <em>ex parte, </em>as respects him; and that the executor repeatedly neglected and refused to come to a settlement, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-5\">The answers of the other defendants are to the same effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">The accounts were referred to a commissioner, to state and settle the same, and the plaintiff was directed to render an account of his intestate\u2019s administration of the estate of <em>John Archer </em>of Chesterfield.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-7\">The commissioner reported a balance due to the complainant of $ 3061 13.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-8\">The defendants excepted to the account stated by the commissioner, inasmuch as it dispensed with vouchers to establish the items of debit in the said account.

That the commissioner was <em>wrong in allowing the </em>charges in the administration account, without any evidence to support them. They admitted the general rule. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>that if the defendants rely upon the <em>credits </em>of the account, they ought to admit the <em>debits. </em>But, all the authorities which lay down this rule, relate only to the simple case of <em>debtor </em>and creditor/ not to the case of <em>executors </em>or <em>trastees. </em>1 <em>Phill. Evid. </em>84; <em>Wagner v. </em>Gray, <em>2 </em>Hen. &amp; Munf. 603; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 447; <em>Free land\u2019s adm\u2019r. </em>v. <em>Cocke\u2019s ex\u2019or. </em>3 Munf. 352. The ease of <em>Cavendish </em>v. Fleming, 3 Munf. 198, does not contradict this principle. An executor differs from a man acting for himself, because he is bound by law to keep the account <em>on both sides. 1 Rev. </em>Code, 379, 380. The persons interested are often <em>infants, </em>who aro unable to produce evi - dence against the executor. The case of an executor and of one acting <em>sui juris </em>are materially different. It is the duty of an executor to shew, not only that money has been <em>paid, </em>but that it is paid <em>properly. </em>This latter cannot be shewn by the account alono. There is no <em>inventory </em>In this case, which is positively required by law, and by which the persons interested might know what property came to his hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-4\">2. The Court of Chancery ought not to have sustained this bill, because of the long delay, and implied admissions of <em>John Archer </em>of Amelia. <em>Bolling v. Bolling, </em>5 Munf. 334; <em>Hercy v. Dinwoody, </em>4 Bro. Ch. Cas. 257. In <em>Jones Fitzgerald, 1 </em>Munf. 150, a neglect of seven years was sufficient to exclude interest. Here interest <em>is </em>charged for a much longer time.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-7\">Johnson, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-8\">The rule of evidence which requires an account to fee taken altogether, if a part is relied on, is a rule of universal operation, and is founded on that well known principle of justice, that you are not to take a <em>garbled </em>statement of the evidence. The reason applies to an <em>executor, </em>as well as any one else. A merchant who keeps the account <em>on both sides, </em>if hi&gt; <em>credits </em>are relied on, is entitled to con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>eider his <em>debits </em>as admitted. An inventory would be o\u00ed n0 importance in this case, because it is only of the original estate which came to the executor\u2019s hands, not of the inc<em>rease or profits. </em>An executor is chosen by the testator himself, and renders his account <em>upon oath. Cavendish v. Fleming, </em>3 Munf. 198, and <em>M\u2019Call </em>v. Peachy, 3 Munf. 298, prove, that an executor is not chargeable with, credits, unless it is proved that they were received. This principle is not contradicted by the ease of <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>1 Wash. <em>224. Freeland v. Cocke, </em>3 Munf. 352, is strongly analogous to this case.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b330-4\"><em>June </em>12.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A3f\">Judge Coalter</author>\n<p id=\"ABKZ\">delivered the opinion of tho Court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AAl\">This is a suit by the appellee, as administrator of <em>John dircher </em>of Amelia, who was executor of <em>John dircher oL </em>Chesterfield, against the appellants, charging <em>that his </em>intestate was largely in advance to the estate, and that suits were brought against him in his life time, and which were still'pending against the appellee as his representative, to recover large sums as due from the estate; that the appellants are legatees of the said <em>John dircher </em>of Chesterfield, and had illegally and without the consent of the executor, possessed themselves of the whole of the assets, without giving refunding bonds according to law, &amp;c. The object of the bill is, to have a decree against the appellants for the monies so advanced by the executor beyond what he had received, and to have refunding bonds, in case future debts should be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">It appears from the answers and documents in the cause, that about twelve years after the executor had qualified and undertaken his trust, the appellant <em>Robertson </em>and his wife, in right of his wife, exhibited their bill in Chesterfield County Court, against the executor for a settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>of the executorial account, and for their one-fifth part of the slaves and other personal property, after specific legasics, and which they claimed under the will. To this bill, so answer could ever he obtained, though various coridiiional decrees were made. Finally, another of the daugh tors married, and she with her husband, and also the other appellants (then under age,) were made parties plaintiffs;, and in 1808, about 18 years after qualification of the executor, a deoreo is entered by consent appointing \"commissioners to allot to the plaintiffs severally their one-fifth part as aforesaid; and <em>Duncan Rose </em>was appointed to slate and <em>settle the </em>executorial account Ho status that ho gayo notice to the executor to attend him, hut he did not do so;, nor did he, make, any reply on the subject..</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\">In 1804, the commissioners report that they had made allotment, which is confirmed, and the executor directed to deliver over the property so allotted, on the parties, or .some one tor them, giving bond to indemnify him against debts thereafter coming against the estate. This bond, the appellants, in their answer, say, was never demanded of them. The suit still went on; and different sets of commissioners were appointed to settle the executorial account, some of whom, it appears, gave notice to the executor to appear with his accounts and vouchers; but, this he never did. The last of those orders is made in July, 1810, about twenty-six years after the qualification <em>of the </em>executor; but, from that time until his death, (which happened about the year 1811, or 1812,) no account was rendered. This suit was instituted and the bill filed in 1816, to which the answers were filed in 1,817; and in 1819, (about f&gt;C years after the qualification of the executor,) the accounts are referred to a commissioner. He reports, that the appellee produced the books of his intestate, containing his administration accounts, acknowledged to bn in his own hand writing; but, not having vouchers for all the debts, he insisted that those accounts were either to be taken ar sorrect throughout, <em>or </em>that <em>he </em>had a right to throw off fren?. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the credits, a sum equal to the debits which were not vouch\u00bb ed for; or, he proposed to the appellants, that the com mis sioner should make out his account of debits from the vouchers, and allow all credits which the appellants could establish by evidence. The appellant <em>John Archer, </em>however, who attended the settlement, stated that from the lapse of time, he could not establish credits, so as to change the accounts in their favour, from what they appeared on the books; and the commissioner, therefore, proceeded to state the accounts from those books, merely correcting some errors apparent upon their face, and reported a balance of principal and interest as due- to the executor, of $3061 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The appellants excepted to this report <em>in toto, </em>alleging that the principle so established by the commissioner, was illegal as applicable to administration accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Two questions present themselves; the <em>first, </em>arising on the report of the commissioner, and the exception thereto; the <em>second, </em>whether, after such a lapse of time, and under all the circumstances aforesaid, it was competent for the appellee to call for a settlement of the executorial accounts, so as to charge the appellants for advances made by the executor, beyond assets received; or for any other purpose, except to have refunding bonds executed, as directed by the decree of the County Court, so as to place the estate, as to the debts now claimed from it, in the same situation, as it would have stood, had such bonds been originally-given ?</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We are of opinion, as to the <em>first </em>point, that the rule, that where a party relies on an account furnished by the other party, and claims the benefit of the credits, he is bound to take it altogether and admit the debits also, unless he can surcharge and falsify it by proofs, is not applicable to an account furnished by an executor. Where there is no trust or confidence, neither party is bound by any legal obligation to furnish the other with charges against himself, since each can and ought to preserve the evidences of his charges against the other; and the account rendered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>either must be taken as the confession of the party, and as such, on the general principles of evidence, must not be garbled, but taken altogether, except so far as it may be disproved. But as to executors, they are under a moral and equitable, and indeed a legal obligation, from the very nature of their undertakings, to furnish those to whom they are accountable, the means of charging them jlo the full extent ot their liabilities; <em>White </em>v. <em>Lady Lincoln, </em>8 Ves. 363; for, those having a right to claim an account, have no other perfect means of getting this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">The decree is, therefore, erroneous in not sustaining the exception to the commissioner\u2019s report, in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">As to the <em>second </em>question, we are of opinion, that after so great a lapse of time, and particularly in a case accompanied with the other circumstances above stated, it might be of mischievous tendency to sustain a suit like the present, except for the purpose of procuring refunding bonds against legatees, who had so long ago received their share of the estate, and consequently had no right to suppose that they were in debt to the estate; unless indeed, it was the wish of such legatees to have an account taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">But, we are further of opinion, that as the appellants did not, revive or renew their suit, but permitted the matter to rest for four or five years after the death of the executor, the most certain way of obtaining justice in this case is, to consider all matters between the executor and the legatees, so far as relates <em>to </em>actual receipts and disbursements by the executor, up to the time of his death, as finally closed; that the appellants ought, respectively, to have been decreed to execute bonds with good security to the appellee, to indemnify the estate of his intestate against all future demands coming against the estate of the testator <em>John Archer, </em>so far as the value of the estate respectively received by them; so as to place the parties in the situation they would have been in, had such bond been given when the property was received; and that the bill, for every other purpose, be dismissed; and that each party pay their own costs in the said Court of Chancery,,</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\"> The President and Judge Cabell, absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
