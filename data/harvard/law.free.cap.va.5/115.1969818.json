On the 18th day of <em>January, </em>1774, <em>Reuben Wright, Reuben Turner, Benjamin C. -Spiller </em>and <em>William Aylett, </em>entered into a bond of the usual form, to <em>Robert M\u2019Kendlish, </em>in the penalty of <em>551. </em>with condition to be void on payment of <em>271. </em>10s. on or before the first day of <em>October, </em>thence next following, <em>\u201c </em>with interest from the date;\u201d which bond, <em>M\u2019Kendlish </em>assigned to the plaintiff by an endorsement in these words: <em>\u201c </em>Pay the within to <em>Archibald M\u2019 Call,\u201d </em>signed <em>Robert M\u2019Kendlish. </em>Upon which bond, <em>M\u2019Call </em>brought suit in the District Court of <em>King </em>and <em>Queen in July, </em>1793, against <em>Wright, Turner, </em>and <em>Spiller; Aylett </em>being then dead. The writ was executed by the Sheriff of <em>King William </em>County, on <em>Turner </em>only, and <em>Spiller </em>and <em>Wright </em>were returned <em>\u201c no inhabitants.\u201d </em>The plaintiff filed a declaration on the above bond, in the common form of declarations upon assigned bonds, after which follows an entry in these words: <em>\u201c </em>Abated as to the defendants <em>Reuben Wright </em>and <em>Benjamin C. Spiller, </em>by the return, and a conditional order against the defendant <em>Reuben Turner </em>and <em>James Turner </em>bail for his appearance.\u201d The conditional order was confirmed at the. next rules; and at the succeeding Court, <em>Reuben Turner </em>gave special bail, plead payment, and the plaintiff took issue. In <em>April, </em>1795, the cause stood for trial, and the jury being charged upon the issue, the plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion, which stated, that the defendant <em>\u201c </em>moved the Court to be permitted to give evidence to the jury that the plaintiff was absent in foreign parts beyond seas, and not within the State of <em>Virginia, </em>for the space of eight years, to wit: from the 19th day of <em>April, </em>1775, to the 19th day of <em>April, </em>1783, and that during that period, he had not any known agent or attorney within the Commonwealth, who would receive pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ment of the debt, and give a legal discharge for the same, on which the suit is founded, with a view of extinguishing the interest during that period, to which the counsel for the plaintiff objected, but the Court permitted the defendant to offer such evidence, if he should think fit to do so. And the defendant being permitted to give evidence to the jury, to the purpose aforesaid, it was proved that the plaintiff was out of <em>Virginia, </em>in parts beyond sea from some time in the year 1775, to some time in the year 1783, which was permitted to go to the jury.\u201d The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, that the defendant had not paid the debt in the declaration mentioned, but that the same ought, however, to be discharged by the payment of 271.10s. with interest thereon from the date of the bond until the 19th day of <em>Jlpril, </em>1775, and from the 19th day of <em>Jlpril, </em>1783, until paid, and assessed damages to a penny; the Court gave judgment for the plaintiff for the penalty of the bond, to be discharged according to the directions of the verdict, and the costs of suit. From which judgment, the plaintiff appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-8\"><em>Warden, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-9\">It is not necessary to say much upon this question; for, the record shews manifest error in admitting improper evidence to go to the jury. The plea was payment, and nothing but what went to prove that, could be admitted; for, nothing else was within the issue. Now, the notice is not to prove a payment, but only that the plaintiff was absent during a certain period; and it does not even appear, that there was no agent here to receive payment. All the jury, upon this issue, could do, was, to find that the debt was paid or not; and, if travelling out of the issue, they of their own accord should diminish the debt, the Court would grant a new trial. The law is, that judgment shall be for the penalty, to be discharged by the principal debt with interest and costs; and, so it is constantly done in cases of judgment by default, which proves the law of the case. It does not appear, that there was any other evidence, <em>though </em>the bill of exceptions does not state that this was all. Upon the whole, I conclude that the evidence was inadmissible; and, consequently, that the judgtaent is erroneous and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-4\">This was a suit upon a joint bond, which could neither be sued nor prosecuted severally. \u25a0 Therefore, the plaintiff should have pursued all the obligors, and should not have abated the suit as to the non-residents; for, he, thereby, discontinued as to the defendant who was arrested. It may be said, that this should have been pleaded in abatement; but, that was not necessary, because it appears upon the record, and <em>Turner </em>could not have pleaded it, because the declaration was joint. The act of Assembly had provided the means of bringing all the parties before the Court; and, therefore, it ought to have been done. At least, the plaintiff should have followed up his process.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-5\">Then, as to the point made by Mr. <em>Warden. </em>My own impression from the act of Assembly originally was, that the jury were merely to find, if any, and what payments had been made, and the Court were to ascertain the rest; but, on my first coming to the bar, I found the practice to be settled the other way, and that the jury were to find the sum by which the penalty should be discharged, which I suppose was done upon a proper consideration of the law. I had occasion once to submit this question to the <em>Federal </em>Court, and contended that the jury should find the payments specially; but, the Court enquired into the practice of the General Court, and being informed that it was to find generally, they submitted the cause to the jury. Therefore, I conclude, that the practice is now settled, that the jury may enquire into the amount; and, of course, be regulated by evidence and the circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-6\">The circumstances do not appear in this case; but if, under any circumstances, there might be a deduction of interest, the Court will suppose those circumstances appeared, as every thing transacted in a Court of Justice is presumed to be rightly done, until the contrary is shewn. The question, therefore, is whether, under any circumstances, a deduction of interest can be made by the jury ? The act of Assembly does not state from what period the interest shall commence. I suppose the act was founded on the practice in the. Courts of Chancery, of relievingthe obligor on payment of principal, interest and costs:<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in which Court, circumstances would clearly be taken into consideration, and a deduction made accordingly. As to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the case now under consideration, all the circumstances are not stated, but there are several mentioned which afford an equity. ' The plaintiff was absent during all the time mentioned in the notice, and there was no agent to whom payment could be made. Now, if, in this time, he attached himself to the other party and became an alien enemy, so that the defendant was prohibited from having any intercourse with or paying him the money; in that case, a reduc-' tion of interest would be highly reasonable: for, it would be against conscience, that the creditor should demand interest, when his own absence was the cause why the debt was not paid. I do not say that this was the cas\u00e9; but, although no proof of these circumstances is stated,-yet, as the contrary does not appear, the Court will intend that they, or some such, were proved, for the reason before given, namely, whatever is transacted in a Court of Justice shall be presumed to be rightly done, until the contrary is shewn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b142-8\">\n<em>Warden.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2O\">As to the question concerning the abatement, there is no difficulty in it. The Sheriff is bound to return the truth of the case; for, otherwise, the process might be infinite. In the County Courts it has been constantly done, both before and since the revolution. When this suit was commenced, the District Court did not possess the right to issue mesne process out of the limits of the district. There is a manifest distinction, in this respect, .between the act of 1788, [12 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>739,] under which this suit was brought, and the act of 1792, [13 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>438,] spoken of by Mr. <em>Wickham. </em>The plaintiff, therefore, proceeding under the act of 1788, was obliged to submit to the abatement; for, he could not follow up the process as to the 1 non-resident defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-9\">Then, as to the point of evidence. Any thing else might as well have been proved under the plea of payment, as the absence of the party. If, the defendant had pleaded the fact specially, it would have been demurrable to; which proves, that such evidence before the jury cannot be admitted ; for, whatever goes in destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s l\u2019ight, may be pleaded. Even a tender in this case would not have availed ; because, the day of payment had arrived before the plaintiff\u2019s departure from the State. A case in the <em>Federal </em>Court was mentioned, which I do not recollect ; but, I remember that in the case of <em>Jones\u2019s exrs. </em>v. Hylton, Chief Justice Jay, was of opinion, that the jury could not deduct interest. For, he said, that it was the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>of the. Court to ascertain the amount still due after the payments were deducted, which was all that the jury could en-quire into. It has been said, that no particular interest was fixed by law ; because the act of Assembly does not say, that any interest shall be recovered, but only that not more than 5 <em>per cent, </em>shall be taken. If, though, the law has said, that the obligee shall not take more than 5 <em>per cent., </em>it certainly implies that he may take that, and the uniform practice of the country has been to give judgment for it, which proves the universal opinion of the law. By the treaty of peace, we agreed to the payment; and there is no exception in it of cases where the party was absent. It is time for us to lay aside a conduct which has subjected us to the obloquy of all good men, both in <em>Europe </em>and <em>America, </em>and must be disagreeable in the sight of God and Angels. For, interest is a part of the debt, and the plea of payment signifies the payment of interest as well as principal, and, consequently, the deduction of interest, where there is no jjayment, is what a jury cannot do consistent with their oaths, and no Court can with propriety receive their verdict.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pA-8\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkE\">As to the first which I made, the discussion is new. It is admitted, that if the suit were in the General Court, or any other of unlimited jurisdiction, that the plaintiff ought to have continued the prosecution against all ; which goes the length of deciding the cause ; for, the act of Assembly has given jurisdiction <em>pro hac vice. </em>The act of 1792, does not admit of a doubt. I do not know that it has ever been decided, that the defendant, in such a case, could not plead the non-joindure in abatement, but, upon principle, I should think he might; and as the fact is open upon the record, he may take the same advantage of it, as if it were regularly pleaded. This is not an objection of form merely, but goes to the very essence of the plaintiff\u2019s right; who should pursue all jointly, and not harrass one without calling on the others, so, that he might have their aid in the defence and succour in the payment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pAlo\">\n<em>Warden.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADNT\">The act forbids issuing a writ into any district, but that in which the defendant resides, under pain of having the suit dismissed with costs. The subsequent clause only relates to the right of arresting the co-obligor, if found in the district in which the writ is issued. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>is clear from the next member, which gives a right to sue upon a copy. The plaintiff might have had separate suits depending against each defendant in his own district, which, by virtue of this clause, he is enabled to maintain: although, I admit, that satisfaction of one execution would have discharged all.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-8\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARq\">The District Courts uniformly interpret the law, as I understand it; and the constant practice is, to send writs into other districts.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b141-11\">[* See <em>Waller </em>v. Long, 6 Munf. 77-8.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"pAhd\">FLEMING, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AbpM\">There were two points made in this cause, one by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel on the propriety of admitting the evidence in order to extinguish the interest during the absence of the plaintiff from this country ; and the other by the defendant\u2019s counsel on the point, whether the plaintiff by failing to continue the process against the non-resident parties, had not discontinued his suit altogether ?</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">On the first question, it was said by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that such evidence could not be given on the plea of payment: which position is correct, if the case be considered at common law merely. But, the act of Assembly has altered the common law; and, by allowing the penalty <em>\u201c to be </em>discharged by payment of the principal and interest due thereon,\u201d [c. 13, \u00a7 5, 4 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>359; c. 7, \u00a7 6, 5 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>511; c. 128, \u00a7 83, <em>R. C. ed. </em>1819,] necessarily turns the quantum into a question to be determined by circumstances; and, I think it was the province of the jury to decide that question. The plaintiff by absenting himself from the country, put it out of the debtor\u2019s power to make payment; and, therefore, it is unreasonable that he should demand interest during that, period. This was a circumstance proper to be left to the jury upon a plea of this kind, in an action of debt upon a bond. It is like collateral evidence to mitigate damages in actions of assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">As to the other point. The act of Assembly does not give such extensive jurisdiction, as the plaintiff\u2019s counsel contended for; the clause relative to the copy of the bond proves it: which would have been unnecessary, if the Court had possessed general jurisdiction, so as to force the appearance of non-resident defendants <em>from </em>other districts. According to any construction, though, I think it ought to have been pleaded; and, therefore, I am of opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the judgment of the Court was right upon both grounds, and should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"pAVO\">CARRINGTON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AMz\">Every question in this case might have been saved, except that upon the bill of exceptions. If Mr. <em>Wickham\u2019s </em>argument were correct, a judgment might never be obtained where there are several defendants; because, it would seldom happen that they all could be found in one district. For, the act of Assembly does not admit of the enlarged jurisdiction which he contends it does. Although, the words of the proviso p. 83 [R. <em>C. ed. </em>1794,12 <em>St at. Larg. </em>739,] are calculated to give that impression at the first view, yet a close attention will lead to another construction. For, the next member of the sentence which allows a copy to be given in evidence, would, according to the other exposition, have been unnecessary. But, let the interpretation of the act be what it may, the matter should have been pleaded in abatement, without which, if it even be admitted that his argument is correct, the defendant\u2019s counsel cannot avail himself of it. Upon that ground, therefore, I think there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The whole question then rests upon the other point; and, I think the jury had a right to decide what was the amount of the interest due. The act of Assembly seems to me essentially to invest them with this power. For, by the express directions of the act, the penalty is \u201c to be discharged by payment of the principal and the interest due thereon,\u201d with the costs of suit! Who then are to say, what \u201cinterest is due thereon?\u201d The jury surely; who must decide upon the circumstances of the case, and say when it shall commence, how long it should continue, and when it should be suspended or extinguished. On all general issues, (and this is one) the whole circumstances of the cas\u00e9 should be submitted to the jury, who are to decide accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">As to the justice of the case, I do not think that its being a <em>British </em>debt or not, makes any difference; the same rule would apply in a case between two citizens. Now, suppose a case between two citizens, in which one is creditor, and the other debtor; and, that the creditor removes himself into parts unknown, so that the debtor could not come at him in order to make payment, would it be just that full interest should be given? And might not the jury to enquire into the circumstances, and reduce the interest accordingly ? Again; suppose there be a bargain and sale of property, and that the seller keeps the property a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>long time, would it be right that he should recover interest upon the purchase money during the time of his unjust detention of the property ? Surely not; no jury but what would deduct it; and, I think the law would warrant them in doing so. In this case, the plaintiff absented himself, went into a country with which we had no intercourse, and did not return till 1783; so, that his debtor could not make payment to himself, or by remittance. If, under these circumstances, he were to have full interest, he would be better off than our own citizens, who staid at home and sustained the injuries of the war. Upon the whole matter, the trial appears to have been fair; the plaintiff had notice of the evidence; the verdict I think was just,, and does not in my opinion endanger the honor of the country. Therefore, I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b146-8\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"A8Mk\">It is said by the appellee\u2019s counsel, that this being a joint bond, one obligor could not be proceeded against alone; that the abatement against the others on the return of the Sheriff of <em>King WiUiam, </em>that they were no inhabitants, was an error, and the plaintiff ought to have proceeded against them according to the directions of the District Court law. What that should be, was a matter of doubt at the hearing, either from a partial reading of the clause, or inattention in me. I thought a <em>testatum capias </em>might issue from <em>King-, </em>and <em>Queen, </em>to any County in the State, returnable and to be proceeded on there; and that the plaintiff should have so proceeded. I find, though, I was mistaken, and Mr. <em>Warden </em>right, that a distinct suit was to be commenced in the district where the others were to be found; in which, a copy of the bond was to be evidence, or the Court might order the Clerk of <em>King </em>and <em>Queen </em>to attend with the original.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">But, this proceeding seems intended for the benefit of the plaintiff, who might waive it and proceed against the defendant only who had been arrested, if he was satisfied of his ability. Mr. <em>Wickham, </em>in answer to the objection, that he ought to have pleaded this in abatement, endeavored to obviate it by observing, that he was prevented from pleading it, because the declaration stood against all. But, the abatement was before the plea, and had the same effect as to him, as if their names had been stricken out of the declaration; he had a right to waive it; and might chuse to do so, to save expense and delay, and relying on a total indemnity from the principal,.if solvent; or if he was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>solvent, a contribution from the co-securities. I concur in opinion, that, by pleading in bar, he legally waived the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">As to the question, on the merits, relative to interest:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We are told, that the juries through the State are branded with infamy by all impartial observers, as having, in their verdicts striking off interest during the war, violated the principles of justice, of law, of treaty, of the <em>Federal </em>Constitution, and, finally, of religion. A heavy charge, indeed, against a State; for, such it must be, since the jurors, dispersedly collected at the various Courts, uniformly pursue the opinion, which evidently proves the general sentiment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Who these impartial observers are, I know not, but will avow myself to be impartial, (unless I may be supposed to possess a national bias, and from that, it is equally probable that the gentleman<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> or his observers are not free,) and will endeavor, as far as my opinion will go, to redeem my country from this grievous charge) with equal sincerity, though with less acrimony, than the gentleman made it.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">1. Upon <em>thz justice </em>of the case. A claim of the principal debt is founded on the modern practice of war in Europe, securing individual property from confiscations in consequence of national wars. I, who am an utter enemy to all war, if it can be avoided, cannot but approve of this, and every other practice tending to soften its rigors. Our Legislature, in the preamble to their sequestration act, <em>[Oct. </em>1777, c. 9, 9 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>377,] acknowledge the principle, and manifest a wish to adopt it, but waited to discover whether our enemy would observe those rules in a war, different from one between independent nations. Did <em>Britain </em>meet us upon that liberal ground ? The recollection is painful. I wish it could be forgotten, and it is with an ill grace citizens of that country make it necessary to review it. Their treatment of our unhappy soldiers who became their captives; their wanton destruction of our towns, hou-' ses, and other private property; their plunder of plate and specie; but, above all, as most materially affecting this State, their tempting our slaves, by a delusive promise of manumission, to take arms against us; slaves, which they had introduced and received our money for, and in which property, alone, our citizens probably lost more value than the amount of all the debts they owed the British mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>chants: These, I say, were so many infractions, on their part, of the modern practice of war, which would, in reason and justice, deprive them of the beneficial parts of that practice, as against <em>American </em>debtors, and throw the creditors upon their own government for satisfaction; which, by its conduct, deprived them of their ordinary recourse against their debtors. So, that I am free to declare my opinion, that, independent of the treaty, they were not entitled, in justice, to recover one shilling of their <em>principal </em>debts from the debtors.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">I would not be understood, by wh\u00e1t I have said, to find fault with the treaty of. 1783, in this respect; much less to hint, that it ought not to have been performed. As a citizen, I have ever thought and expressed myself otherwise; because, a treaty disadvantageous in one article and bene- \u25a0 ficial in all others, was as much as we could expect, and, at any rate, preferable to a continuance of the war. When I say it ought to have been performed, let me be understood to mean upon condition, that <em>Britain </em>had complied with the treaty on her part, having no idea that in compacts, national or private, containing mutual covenants, a party who has broken his covenants, can complain in a Uourt of Justice, of a breach on the part of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">However, this is now out of the question; and I have no difficulty in deciding as a Judge, that we must regard that treaty as a law, controuling our confiscation acts, and that the debts are to be paid : the only question, therefore, is, whether interest during the war, constitutes a <em>bona fide </em>part of the debt ? And I do not hesitate to declare my opinion in the negative, whatever stigma may be attached to that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Our situation at that period, attacked by a powerful nation, to whose government we had been subjected ; called to the exertion of every power, personal and pecuniary, in defence of life, liberty and property; and without commerce, (which had been theretofore monopolised by that nation,) to enable our citizens to pay their debts, takes the case out of every principle on which interest is demandable.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">The objection applies to all creditors, but a <em>fortiori </em>against those of the nation, who unjustly brought us into <em>\u25a0that situation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\"><em>I </em>should suppose, that under the modern practice of war, all the creditors of the enemy nation could expect, would be, to be placed on the same ground with the citizen creditors ; subject to all inconveniences, which imperious ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>cessity imposed on the latter, in consequence of the' war. Strike out the interest in question, they are placed in a preferable state: they received their principal, and all preceding and subsequent interest in <em>speciej </em>the others received theirs in depreciated paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">But, suppose the plaintiff, a citizen, going beyond sea with his bond, and leaving no agent to receive the money, since the debtor could not by paying the debt, if the war had permitted his attention to it, have saved the interest, that alone ought to exempt him from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">On the merits, therefore, I am of opinion, that, no interest is due, and that none of the moral obligations stated, are violated by the opinion. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Whether religion has been transgressed, will rest with another and more unerring tribunal!</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">2. Having shewn on what ground my opinion is formed, that justice is attained in the decision appealed from, it only remains to consider the objections to the mode of proceeding upon the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">It is to the opinion of the Court, permitting the defendant to give evidence, \u201cthat the plaintiff was absent beyond sea, from <em>April </em>19th, 1775, to the <em>19th April, </em>1783, and had no known attorney here to whom the money could have been paid, with a view to extinguish the interest during that period,\u201d on previous notice, that such evidence would be offered, that the objection is taken; and it is said, the admission of such evidence is improper on the plea of payment; for, that even payment of principal and interest after the bond was forfeited, if pleaded, might be demurred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">If the counsel meant, that this was the case at the common law, he was correct; but it does not apply at present. At common law, if the money was not all paid at the day, although only a shilling remained due, the bond was .forfeited and the penalty was thenceforth considered.as the debt. This rigid law drove the debtor into a Court of Equity, whose maxims permitted it to relieve against penalties and forfeitures in all cases where just compensation could be made, of which in this instance principal and interest was adopted as a just measure; what had been paid was allowed, and, on payment of the balance, an injunction stood to the judgment for the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"A5E\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>This circuitous proceeding was a public evil, and the Legislature wisely provided a remedy, by the act to prevent frivolous and vexatious suits, long since introduced, [May, 1732, c. 13, \u00a7 5, 4 <em>St at. Larg. </em>359,] and continued in our Code, transferring to the juries the equitable jurisdiction. Upon the trial, not only payments but discounts are to be allowed, and the jury are to say what is due of principal and interest, on payment of which, the judgment for the penalty is to be discharged. Now, if instead of payment of interest, proof is made to their satisfaction, that in right and justice, the interest ought not to be paid, what shall restrain the jury from finding that interest not to be due, or the Court from permitting the evidence to that effect to be given ? I know of nothing, in law or reason, to interdict either. If, we recur to the principles of equity on the occasion, from whence the jurisdiction is drawn by Courts of law, persuaded I am, that no Chancellor, in. relieving against penalties, would impose upon a debtor the payment of interest, which, on proofs before him appeared not to be due in conscience.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The notice in this case was fair, though from the history of the business in general, .it does not seem to have been required, but it has been discussed as a thing of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">We are told, that the <em>Federal </em>Chief Justice, in an elaborate charge to the jury, in <em>Jones </em>v. Hylton, declared his opinion in favor of interest. I have no doubt, but he gave that opinion with the like sincerity, as I have delivered mine to the contrary; and mankind, if they think it worth while, will judge between us.</p>\n<p id=\"AIs\">So far as it concerns the present case, it seems, after telling the jury the interest was a question of law, in which I have also the misfortune to differ from him, thinking it proper for the jury to decide, what interest as well as principal is due, he finally said, the jury might decide both law and fact if they chose it. This power it seems the juries exercised; and their verdicts being uniform against the interest in the <em>Federal </em>as well as other Courts; the creditors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>and their counsel have acquiesced, and struck off the interest as a thing of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">This happy train of the business shall not he interrupted by my opinion.
