The 800 dollars was to be paid in three instalments; for which <em>Eib </em>executed his bonds to <em>Hickman, </em>all dated the 24th January 1805, one for 230 dollars, another for 340 dollars, and the last (which was payable the 1st April 1807) for 230 dollars. Hickman, on his return home, assigned the two last bonds to <em>Maulsby, </em>retaining the first to himself. <em>Eib, </em>having come to <em>'Virginia, </em>and examined <em>Barkley's </em>place, and being disappointed in its quality and value, availed himself of the condition in his contract for the purchase of it, and rescinded the bargain. Whereupon, a new contract was made between <em>Hickman </em>and Eib, in <em>July 1805, </em>whereby <em>Hickman </em>agreed to sell and convey to <em>Eib </em>another parcel of land in <em>Harrison, </em>called <em>Carpenter\u2019s </em>place, of which <em>Hickman </em>was the sole owner; in consideration of which <em>Eib </em>was to give him his land in <em>York </em>at the agreed value of \u00a3 550. <em>Pennsylvania </em>currency, and to pay him a sum of money; and it was expressly agreed, that the contract of January 1805, for the sale of <em>Barkley\u2019s </em>place to <em>Eib, </em>should be cancelled. In pursuance of the contract of July 1805, <em>Eib </em>conveyed his land in <em>York </em>to <em>Hickman, </em>and paid him the money in addition which he had agreed to pay for <em>Carpenter\u2019s </em>place, and <em>Hickman </em>surrendered to <em>Eib </em>his bond for 230 dollars which he himself held, and conveyed <em>Carpenter\u2019s </em>place to him. <em>Maulsby </em>was informed of the rescission of the first contract, and of the terms of the second contract; and acknowledged, that it was his duty to give up the two bonds of <em>Eib </em>which he held, and to look to <em>Hickman </em>for the amount, which he said had become due from <em>Hickman </em>to him, in the course of these dealings: but instead of surrendering <em>Eib\u2019s </em>two bonds to be cancelled, he had in fact assigned the bond of <em>Eib </em>for 340 dollars to <em>William Martin, </em>and he retained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>other bond for 230 dollars, payable the 1st April 1807, in his , . own hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABR\"><em>Maulsby's </em>reason for retaining this last bond, was, that lle had, before the contract of January 1805 was rescinded, execute(l following obligation to <em>Adam Weaver: </em>\u201cI promise to pay or cause to be paid to <em>Adam Weaver </em>&amp;c. the sum \u00b0f 120 dollars, to be paid out of a note of <em>Jacob Eib </em>to <em>Adam Hickman, </em>dated the 24th January 1805, and payable the 1st April 1807, as soon as the said money can be got from Eib,\u2014for value received.

He then exhibited the record of the suit which he had brought in 1806 against <em>Hickman, Maulsby </em>and <em>William Martin, </em>and which was decided in 1810; and he said, that the decree in that cause, whereby it was adjudged that <em>Hickman </em>should pay him 570 dollars, and that his bill should be dismissed as to <em>Maulsby </em>and <em>Martin, </em>was arranged between his counsel <em>Mr. Jackson, </em>and <em>Mr. Pindall, </em>the counsel for <em>Maidsby; </em>that that decree never was communicated to him; that he had never received any thing from <em>Hickman </em>under the decree; that he had discovered, that a <em>ca. sa. </em>was sued out upon it against <em>Hickman, </em>and that <em>Hickman </em>paid the debt to <em>Pindall, </em>the attorney of <em>Maulsby, </em>by allowing him a credit for the amount in part of the purchase money of land sold by <em>Hickman </em>to <em>Pindall; </em>that <em>Pindall </em>was also the counsel and attorney at law of <em>Jesse Martin </em>in the present suit, and that it was owing to his knowledge of <em>the </em>facts, which exempted <em>Eib </em>from all liability, that he had concealed those facts from <em>Eib, </em>had never ordered any process against <em>Eib </em>in this suit, and had dismissed it as to him in March 1826.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A1\">At the same time that <em>Eib </em>put in his answer to <em>Jesse Martinis </em>bill, he exhibited a bill (in the nature of a cross bill) against <em>Martin, Maulsby, </em>and the executrix of <em>Pindall </em>then recently deceased; wherein he, set forth the facts stated in his answer to <em>Martin\u2019s </em>bill, touching the receipt by <em>Pindall </em>from <em>Hickman, </em>of the 570 dollars which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>been adjudged to <em>Eib </em>by the decree of September 1810, and prayed, that if he himself should be held liable to <em>Martin\u2019s </em>demand, <em>Pindall\u2019s </em>executrix should be compelled to indemnify and exonerate him, by paying the money out of her testator\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASL\">_ To this bill, <em>PindalVs </em>executrix pleaded the statute of limitations; but the chancellor held, that it was not a bar.

And, in that case, the first question is, Whether <em>Martin, </em>upon his own shewing in his bill, ever had a right to make <em>Eib </em>a party defendant to it? Whether <em>Maulsby\u2019s </em>obligation of the 8th .March 1805 (on which <em>Martin\u2019s </em>claim is founded) to pay <em>Weaver </em>120 dollars, out of <em>Eib\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Hickman </em>(then held by <em>Maulsby) </em>dated the 24th January 1805, and payable the 1st April 1807, so soon as the money could be got from Eib,\u2014can be regarded as an equitable transferor <em>assignmentfiomMaulsby </em>to <em>Weaver, </em>of <em>Eib\u2019s </em>bond, or any part thereof? If it was not such an assignment, then <em>Eib </em>was never responsible to <em>Weaver, </em>or his immediate and remote assignees <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Jesse Martin. </em>This point was discussed in <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Fawcett\u2019s adm\u2019rs, </em>2 Leigh 19. In that case, there was an actual order drawn by <em>Fawcett </em>on <em>Baker, </em>who held the bond of <em>Carlisle </em>due to <em>Fawcett, </em>in which he requested <em>Baker, </em>as soon as he should collect the money due from <em>Carlisle, </em>to pay it to <em>Clayton, </em>as he owed him about 200 dollars of the money; but there was a restriction in the order, namely, that it was to be paid to <em>Clayton, </em>\u201c if I <em>(Faw</em>cett]) should not happen with you.\u201d That order was held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>not to be an equitable assignment by <em>Fawcett </em>to Clayton, of any part of <em>Carlisle's </em>debt to him: the restriction limited the power of <em>Clayton </em>to receive the money, to the case of <em>Fawcett's </em>being absent, and the order was merely directory to Baker, and an indication to him, that <em>Clayton </em>was to supply the place of Fawcett, in case of his absence, and to receive the money, not for himself but for <em>Fawcett, </em>the drawer: and, therefore, it was held, that as <em>Clayton </em>held no lien on the money, it should be paid to <em>Fawcett's </em>administrators to be paid to his creditors in a due course of administration. Now, the letter or order in that case, approached much nearer to the character of an assignment, than the obligation of <em>Maulsby </em>in the present case. Here was no order of any kind drawn by <em>Maulsby, </em>either on <em>Eib, </em>the obligor in the bond of January 1805, or on <em>Hickman </em>to whom it was payable; nor did <em>Eib </em>ever agree to pay any part of the money to <em>Weaver, </em>the obligee in <em>Maulsby's </em>obligation, or to <em>Lewis </em>or Martin, the successive assignees thereof. The obligation of <em>Maulsby </em>was not a draft on any particular fund in the hands of any other person, but a personal obligation on himself to pay 120 dollars to <em>Weaver </em>or his assigns, as soon as he should receive his money from <em>Eib. </em>If <em>Eib </em>did not pay his debt at the time stipulated, or refused to pay, then <em>Maulsby </em>was probably bound to use due diligence to recover the money from <em>Eib, </em>and on his failure to use such diligence, or on his failure to receive the money, the obligation of <em>Maulsby </em>to his obligee <em>Weaver </em>became absolute, and the plaintiff <em>Martin </em>might sue <em>Maulsby </em>at law on his own obligation; or, on the principle of <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>6 Munf. 23. he might have sued <em>Maulsby </em>in equity, and made <em>Weaver </em>and <em>Lewis </em>parties defendants to his bill. But there was no privity between <em>Eib </em>and either <em>Weaver, Lewis, </em>or <em>Martin; </em>and consequently he was not bound either at law, or in equity, to pay them. He was only bound to his own obligee or his assigns. <em>Eib, </em>then, might have demurred to <em>Martin's </em>bill, if he had been a party; but in fact he was no party to it. When <em>Martin </em>commenced his suit, his process of <em>subpoena </em>named only <em>Maulsby </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>Lewis, </em>and although his bill, which was filed more than a year afterwards, did indeed name <em>Eib </em>as a party; yet no process was ever served on him, nor did he ever appear in the suit, and the plaintiff actually dismissed his suit as to him, in 1825. He was directed to be made a party by the order of the chancellor of September 1826, giving the plaintiff leave to amend his bill by making him a party. This permission and order of the court was made, it is believed, in consequence of the development made by the copy of the record in <em>Eib\u2019s </em>suit, brought in 1806, against <em>Hickman </em>and others, which had been referred to in <em>Asher Leiois\u2019s </em>answer in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\"><em>Eib, </em>being thus made a party, promptly answered; and I am of opinion, that as he then appeared without process, he must be considered as having waived the irregularity of the former proceedings, so far as to make him a defendant, and to subject him to costs from the time he was so made a party, but no further. If it was proper to render a decree against <em>Eib </em>on the merits, yet it was not proper to have subjected him to the payment of the costs incurred during the eighteen years that the suit had been pending before he was a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Although Eib answered, the plaintiff <em>Martin </em>did not amend his bill; so that if he recover at all, he must stand on the original bill, and can only recover according <em>to the </em>allegations contained therein. He cannot recover on any new ground which did not exist at the time he filed his bill, or which was shewn by the defendant\u2019s answer to exist, but of which he did not avail himself, by alleging, in his new or amended bill, the newly discovered matter, even although it might have been sufficient, if alleged and proved, to entitle him to a decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">The new matter developed by the answer, consisted in the history of the transactions between <em>Eib </em>on the one part, and <em>Hickman </em>and <em>Maulsby </em>on the other, touching the contracts for the sale of <em>Barkley\u2019s </em>place to <em>Eib, </em>and the rescission thereof, as alleged and proved in <em>Eib\u2019s </em>suit against <em>Hickman, Maulsby </em>and others, brought in 1806, and deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>dec! in 1810. The decree in that, suit, instead of directing, \u2022 that the two bonds, which <em>Eib </em>had executed to <em>Hickman, </em>under the contract that was afterwards rescinded, and which <em>Hickman </em>had assigned to <em>Maulsby, </em>should be delivered up to be cancelled, adjudged, that <em>Hickman </em>should pay to <em>Eib 570 </em>dollars, the amount of the two bonds that had been assigned to <em>Maulsby, </em>with legal interest; which decree was rendered in September 1810, after <em>Jesse Martin, </em>the plaintiff in the present suit, had filed his bill. It is now insisted by the counsel for <em>Martin, </em>that as <em>Eib </em>obtained that decree in 1810, he either received from <em>Hickman </em>the amount of the two bonds held by <em>Maulsby, </em>or that he might have received it, and if he did not, it was his own <em>laches; </em>that, in either case, he was liable to pay to the holder of his two bonds the amount due on them; that he stood in the place of <em>Maulsby, </em>and was bound to pay over the 120 dollars due on the obligation executed <em>by Maulsby to Weaver, </em>on which this suit is brought; for that he had got hold of the fund out of which that money was to be paid, and having it, he ought to be considered as a trustee for <em>Weaver </em>or his assigns, and held liable to the appellee, <em>Jesse Martin, </em>for the amount. .All this may be true, and yet, in my opinion, the appellee ought, not to have recovered, unless he had alleged such a case, and brought forward such a claim, in his bill; which he has not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In the present case, it would be peculiarly improper to allow such a recovery to the appellee. If the appellant was to be condemned from his answer to allegations not made, he ought, at least to have had the benefit of the whole answer. The appellee ought not to have been allowed to fasten on the decree of 1810, exhibited in the answer, without giving any weight to the rest of the answer, in which the appellant swears, that he never knew of that decree, nor received any money under it; that <em>Pindall, </em>the counsel of <em>Maulsby, </em>one of his adversaries in that suit, claimed the benefit, of the decree either as counsel of <em>Maulsby, </em>or his assignee; that <em>Pindall, </em>in one of those characters, put <em>Hickman </em>in jail under the decree, forced the money from him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>and appropriated the proceeds of the decree to his own use. T- 7 . It the answer is to oe taken as true as to the fact of the decree being rendered, it must also be taken as true as to the appellant\u2019s ignorance of its existence, and as to the decep^011\u2019 ^aud, and crying injustice, perpetrated by <em>Pindall. </em>If the appellant had alleged in his bill, that <em>Eib </em>had obtained the decree against <em>Hickman, </em>and that he had thereby received the fund out of which his demand should be paid, or that he might have received it but for his own <em>laches, Eib </em>might have relied, in his answer, on the facts just <em>mentioned; </em>and so far as his answer was responsive to such charges in the bill, he would have thrown the burthen of proof on his adversary, and so far as it brought forward affirmative matter not responsive, he might have supported it by proof. He might have proved, that the decree was a collusive and fraudulent one in which he had no part; that he was ignorant of it, and that not he, but <em>Maulsby, </em>or his assignee or counsel, had received that fund. He might have shewn, that by the delay of the appellee for sixteen years, he, the appellant, had lost his remedy against <em>Pindall, </em>for that to any cross bill which he <em>(Eib) </em>might exhibit, <em>Pindall </em>might plead the statute of limitations, or rely on the staleness of the transaction to defeat the claim. But the allegations not having been made in the bill, the appellant could not be allowed to disprove them, however sufficient were his materials for <em>that </em>purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">I am of opinion, that the decree be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"b162-7\">Caer, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aaz\">We are first to consider, whether <em>Maulsby's </em>obligation to <em>Weaver, </em>on which the appellee <em>Martinis </em>claim is founded, gave <em>Weaver </em>or his assignees, any personal claim upon <em>Eib ? </em>any right to sue <em>him </em>either at law or in equity? By that obligation, <em>Maulsby </em>acknowledged himself indebted to <em>Weaver </em>120 dollars, and promised that <em>he </em>would pay him that debt, out of <em>Eib\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Hickman, </em>which he held by assignment from <em>Hickman, </em>as soon as the money might be <em>got </em>from <em>Eib. </em>Got by whom? by <em>Maulsby, </em>assuredly: he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>retained the bond, with the legal title; and he promised, that <em>he </em>would pay the money, when <em>he </em>should get it of <em>Eib. </em>Is this a transfer of the bond or of the debt due from <em>Eib, </em>or of any part of it ? Nothing like it, but a mere designation by the debtor, of the fund out of which he meant to pay the debt; and, so far from intending to give to his creditor any draft or order on this fund, he expressly reserves to himself the whole control over it, as respected his own debtor, and, especially, the exclusive right of receiving it himself. The case of <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Fawcett's adm'r, </em>in which the subject was much canvassed, and the authorities touching it examined, is decisive of the point. [Here, the judge stated the circumstances of that case, and the reasoning upon which it was decided; and shewed, that there was less reason in this case than in that, to hold that the debt was assigned]. I am of opinion, then, that <em>Eib </em>was in no form liable to the suit of <em>Weaver </em>or his assignee, and might safely have demurred to the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">But let us look at the merits. In 1805 <em>Adam Hickman </em>sold to <em>Eib, </em>a tract of land in <em>Harrison, </em>for which <em>Eib </em>gave his <em>Pennsylvania </em>land, and 800 dollars in three bonds. <em>Eib </em>reserved the privilege of cancelling the bargain, if when he examined the land, he should not like it. The land in <em>Harrison </em>was owned by <em>Hickman </em>and <em>Maulsby </em>in partnership, and two of the three bonds were transferred by <em>Hickman </em>to <em>Maulsby, </em>as his share of the purchase money. When <em>Eib </em>saw the land, he objected to taking it, and the bargain was cancelled. <em>Hickman gave </em>up the bond he retained, and promised to get those he had transferred to <em>Maulsby; </em>but he did not. <em>Maulsby </em>transferred one of these bonds to <em>William Martin, </em>who brought suit on it at law. And then <em>Eib </em>(in June 1806) filed a bill against <em>Hickman, Maulsby </em>and <em>Martin, </em>stating the facts, and praying that the two bonds might be cancelled. <em>Hickman </em>and <em>Maulsby </em>answered; proofs were taken; every allegation in the bill was supported ; and in September 1810, the cause was heard, and a final decree rendered, by which <em>Eib </em>had a decree against <em>Hickman, </em>for the amount of the two bonds, <em>570 </em>dollars with interest, and the bill was dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>as to <em>Maulsby </em>and <em>Martin. </em>Strange as this decree seems upon the proofs in the record, it has never been appealed from, and must be taken as conclusive between the parties. A <em>ca. sa. </em>was sued out on the decree against Hickman, on which he was taken and - committed to jail. In October 1810, <em>Hickman </em>being still in execution on the decree, an arrangement was entered into by <em>Jackson, </em>the attorney for <em>Eib, </em>and <em>Pindall, </em>who, besides being attorney at law for <em>Maulsby, </em>was moreover interested, as assignee, in the bonds of <em>Eib </em>to <em>Hickman; </em>by which arrangement, <em>Pindall </em>agreed to take <em>Eib\u2019s </em>decree against <em>Hickman, </em>in full satisfaction of <em>Eib\u2019s </em>two bonds, and thus to clear <em>Eib </em>of all claim on that score, which would effect the only object for which <em>Eib </em>went into equity. <em>Pindall, </em>being thus possessed of <em>Eib\u2019s </em>claim on <em>Hickman, </em>did, in October 1810, receive of <em>Hickman </em>full satisfaction of the decree, and released him from custody. I consider this a final settlement of the business, and that <em>Eib </em>could never after be called on for the bonds, or any part of them; for <em>Pindall, </em>whether he acted as attorney for <em>Maulsby, </em>or as owner, or in both characters, had certainly power to make the settlement, so far as to clear <em>Eib; </em>and if he exceeded his power as regarded <em>Maulsby, </em>he was liable to him alone. But it is in proof, that <em>Pindall </em>and <em>Maulsby, </em>have settled the account between them. Let it be remembered, that, during this whole time, the suit of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Maulsby, Eib </em>and others was slumbering on the county court chancery docket: <em>Eib </em>no party to it, and never intended by <em>Pindall, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, to be made a party; for he knew <em>Eib </em>was clear of the claim, and that this would come out so soon as he was brought into court. From the time <em>Eib </em>executed the bonds to <em>Hickman, </em>to the time he first had notice of this claim, was twenty-one years; long enough, of itself, to raise the presumption of payment of his bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">I am then, upon every view of this case, of opinion that the decree should be reversed and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"b164-5\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A18\">Waiving all objections as to the irregularity of the proceedings against <em>Eib, </em>and taking his answer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>voluntarily filed to <em>Martin\u2019s </em>bill, as an admission that he had been regularly brought before the court,\u2014I cannot comprehend, how <em>Maulsby\u2019s </em>obligation to pay <em>Weaver </em>120 dollars, out of the bond of <em>Eib </em>to <em>Hickman </em>then held by Maulsby, when the money should be got from Eib, can be regarded as an assignment of <em>Eib\u2019s </em>bond, or of so much of the debt due thereon, to <em>Weaver. </em>The terms of that obligalion of <em>Maulsby </em>import no such transfer, even by implication. The instrument gave no right to Weaver, or his assignees, to demand payment from <em>Eib; </em>nor did it authorize <em>Eib </em>to pay the money to them: <em>Maulsby </em>himself was to pay the money <em>to Weaver </em>or his assigns, so soon as he should get it <em>from Eib. The </em>grounds on which equitable transfers of debts are sustained, are fully explained in <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Pawcetfs ad/m\u2019r. </em>Here, there was no transfer, in law or equity. If, indeed, the instrument executed by <em>Maulsby </em>to <em>Weaver, </em>had amounted to an equitable assignment <em>pro tanto </em>of <em>Eib\u2019s </em>bond, there is no, proof that <em>Eib </em>had notice of such transfer, until he was made a party to this suit in 1826, long after <em>Eib\u2019s </em>decree against <em>Hickman, </em>for the amount of his two bonds that had been assigned by <em>Hickman </em>to <em>Maulsby, </em>had been applied to the satisfaction of <em>Maulsby\u2019s </em>claim upon those assigned bonds, by <em>Pindall, </em>the attorney of <em>Maulsby, </em>and, probably, the holder of all <em>Maulsby\u2019s rights. I </em>think the evidence in the cause warrants the belief, that <em>Maulsby\u2019s </em>interest in <em>Eib\u2019s </em>bonds, was assigned by him to <em>Pindall. </em>It is certain, that <em>Hickman </em>paid the amount of <em>Eib\u2019s </em>decree against him, to <em>Pindall, </em>and was thereupon released from custody under the execution sued out on that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The court is of opinion, that the decree in the case of <em>Eib </em>v. <em>Martin </em>be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">As to the case of <em>Pindall\u2019s ex\u2019x </em>v. <em>Eib, </em>the foundation of this suit being wholly removed by the reversal of <em>Martin\u2019s </em>decree against <em>Eib, </em>the decree in this case for <em>Eib </em>against <em>Pindall\u2019s </em>executrix, is also to be reversed, and the hill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
