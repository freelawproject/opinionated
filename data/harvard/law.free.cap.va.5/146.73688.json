After this deed was recorded, three writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>and five writs of <em>capias ad satisfaciendum, </em>upon judgments against <em>Colvert, </em>were sued out and delivered to the sheriff\u2019. The writs of <em>fi- fa. </em>were levied on twelve (being all then living) of the slaves mortgaged by the deed of trust to <em>Marshall; </em>and <em>Colvert </em>being taken on the writs of <em>ca. sa. </em>took the benefit of the statute for the relief of insolvent debtors, surrendered in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>schedule his equity of redemption in the subject mortgaged to <em>Marshall, </em>and was discharged from custody.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A1Q\">While the slaves taken under the writs of <em>fi. fa. </em>were in the sheriff\u2019s hands, <em>Marshall </em>exhibited his bill, in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Fredericksburg, </em>against <em>Colvert, </em>the sheriff, and the judgment creditors; setting forth the mortgage executed by <em>Colvert </em>for his indemnification; shewing, that he was exposed to danger of loss, though to an unascertained amount, by reason of waste committed by <em>Colvert </em>of the assets of his testator\u2019s estate, and particularly, <em>that </em>there was a claim against <em>the </em>estate, upon a decree against the testator in his lifetime, from which an appeal had been taken, and was then pending in the court of appeals; shewing also the executions sued out against <em>Colvert </em>by his creditors, the levy of the writs of <em>fi. fa. </em>on the mortgaged slaves, and the surrender by <em>Colvert </em>of his equity of redemption for the benefit of the <em>ca. sa. </em>creditors; and praying an injunction to inhibit the sheriff from proceeding to sell the slaves until further order, and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">The chancellor, in vacation, awarded an injunction to restrain the sheriff, not from selling the slaves, but from paying over the proceeds of his sales thereof, to the creditors in the executions, or any of them, until further order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">The sheriff proceeded to make sale of the slaves; and then put in his answer to the bill, with which he exhibited an account of his sales of the slaves, shewing 1721 dollars, net proceeds, in his hands. Whereupon the chancellor ordered him to deposit the money in the <em>Farmers Bank </em>at <em>Fredericksburg, </em>subject to future order in the cause. The deposit was made accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-7\">But one of the creditors answered; and he only insisted, that, as his <em>fi. fa. </em>had been the first delivered, he was entitled to have satisfaction out of the balance that should remain after satisfying the purposes of the deed of trust under which <em>Marshall </em>claimed, in preference to any other of the creditors by execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-8\">The chancellor, upon motion of the defendants, dissolved the injunction; and <em>Marshall </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ap4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>In the argument of the cause here, by <em>iStanard </em>for the appellant and <em>Harrison </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxfQ\">nothing was said touching the merits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJQ\"><em>Harrison </em>objected to the jurisdiction; suggesting, that <em>Marshall </em>might have brought trespass in the name of his trustee, against the sheriff, for taking the property, or detinue for the slaves, as to whom he wanted no discovery or account, and asked none; and so the case was not proper for relief in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-5\"><em>IStanard </em>answered, that the mortgage under which <em>Marshall </em>claimed, provided an indemnity to him against an apprehended loss, of which the amount was unascertained and unascertainable, at the time he exhibited his bill: the loss might never occur; it might occur at a distant day; it could only be ascertained by an account of <em>Colvert\u2019s </em>administration. The interference of the court of equity was necessary to prevent the property from being sacrificed at a sale by the sheriff, subject to such an incumbrance, and dispersed into many hands; and it was as necessary to the interests of the creditors and the purchasers under the executions, as it was for the protection of <em>Marshall. </em>Besides, the relief which the chancellor gave him by his order in vacation, was an injunction, not to prevent the sale by the sheriff, but to prevent him from paying over the proceeds, so as to preserve the fund for his indemnification. This injunction was allowed under the prayer of the bill for general relief; and it was a mode of relief entirely proper and judicious, and such as a court of equity alone could give.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b168-6\">Brooke, <em>J</em></author>\n<p id=\"AgY\">It was only in a court of equity, that the claim of <em>Marshall </em>could be adjusted. He claimed indemnity against his suretyship for <em>Colvert; </em>and as no fraud in the deed of trust is proved or alleged, that deed <em>gave </em>him priority over the executions. The only creditor, who answered the bill, claimed priority to any of the other creditors, out of the surplus after the purposes of the deed of trust were satisfied. An account ought to have been taken, the amount of the responsibility of <em>Marshall </em>for <em>Colvert </em>ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>tained, and the surplus, if any, applied to the payment of the executions, according to the priority they gave to the proceeds of the property. The decree is reversed, the injunction reinstated, and the cause remanded for further proceed-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
