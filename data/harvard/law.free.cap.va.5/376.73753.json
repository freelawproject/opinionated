Therefore, the bill called on <em>Sharrot </em>to disclose the truth of the transaction, and prayed relief in general terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-4\">An injunction was awarded, to inhibit <em>Sharrot </em>from proceeding to execute his judgment at law, till further order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\"><em>Sharrot </em>in his answer, denied every material allegation of the bill, and declared, that the transaction was an actual <em>bond fide </em>sale by him to <em>Lockridge, </em>of the twenty-two beeves, for 483 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">In September 1823, an order of court was made, by consent of parties, referring <em>the matters in dispute in the cause </em>to arbitrators. And in June 1825, the arbitrators met (in pursuance of a notice to <em>Lockridge, </em>though he was not present at the arbitration), and awarded that the injunction which <em>Lockridge </em>had obtained, should be dissolved, and his bill dismissed with costs, and that <em>Sharrot </em>should have the benefit of his judgment at law, and be at liberty to execute the same. The award was returned to court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-7\">In June 182G, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved the court to dissolve tire injunction, according to the award, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved for leave to file a supplemental bill. The court overruled the motion to dissolve, and gave <em>Lock-ridge </em>leave to file\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-9\">A supplemental bill, in which he stated, that after the order of reference to arbitrators was made, <em>Lockridge, </em>despairing of being able to prove his case as alleged in his original bill, against <em>Sharrot\u2019s </em>positive denial of the allegations thereof in his answer, came to a settlement with <em>Sharrot, </em>and paid him the whole amount of the debt, and took his receipt in full for the payment; and then <em>Sharrot </em>migrated from the commonwealth. That after this, <em>Given </em>the executor of <em>Dinwiddle, </em>pretending that <em>Sharrot </em>had assigned the claim to <em>Dinwiddle, </em>gave <em>Lockridge </em>notice to attend the arbitration, and promised him that nothing should be done till he should arrive at the place appointed for the meel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ing of the arbitrators. That <em>Lockridge </em>set out from home <em>to </em>attend the arbitration, with <em>Sharrot\u2019s </em>receipt for the debt in his pocket, to lay before the arbitrators; but, on the way, he met <em>Given, </em>who told him the arbitrators had met, and made their award. That <em>Lockridge </em>had since been advised, that his payment to <em>Sharrot </em>was a matter not within the terms of the submission, and that the arbitrators could not have taken it into consideration. That if an assignment of <em>Sharrot\u2019s </em>claim against <em>Lockridge </em>was made to <em>Dinwiddie </em>(as <em>Lockridge </em>now believed was the fact), <em>Dinwiddie </em>afterwards relinquished it; and, at all events, <em>Lockridge </em>had no notice of the assignment, at the time he paid the debt to <em>Sharrot. </em>Therefore, the bill made <em>Given </em>executor of <em>Dinwiddie </em>a party, and prayed, that the award should be set aside, that the defendants should be perpetually in-joined from executing the judgment at law, and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6z\"><em>Given </em>executor of <em>Dinwiddie </em>answered, that the debt was assigned to his testator for valuable consideration, <em>before </em>the judgment at law was recovered; that the reference of the original cause had been made by <em>Sharrot </em>contrary to <em>Dinwiddie\u2019s </em>wishes; that he as executor of Dinwiddie, gave <em>Lockridge </em>notice of the time and place of arbitration, but he denied, that he promised <em>Lockridge </em>that nothing should be done by the arbitrators until he should be present. Tp'd\u00ediid, the arbitration had been fairly made, upon due no-<em>^e^bt-Ihckridge ; </em>and, therefore, he insisted on the award. <em>,&amp; </em>alsqmuestioned the genuineness of the receipt of <em>Shar'ockridge </em>exhibited with the bill, and the fact <em>of the </em>\u00a1une ofiof the debt to <em>Sharrot.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-5\">* ceedings were had against <em>Sharrot, </em>on the amended</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-6\">There was no proof, that <em>Lockridge </em>had notice of the assignment to <em>Dinwiddie, </em>at any time before he received notice from his executor to attend the arbitration. On the other hand, there was no proof of the payment of the debt by <em>Lockridge </em>to <em>Sharrot, </em>or of the genuineness of <em>Sharrot\u2019s </em>receipt for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The chancellor (after overruling a motion made by <em>Lock- </em>' <em>m ridge </em>for a continuance) dissolved the injunction, and dismissed the bills with costs; from which decree <em>Lockridge </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-9\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-10\">Johnson, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b399-11\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A5sp\">This case is somewhat perplexed, owing to the awkward manner in which it has been conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">The original bill ought never to have been entertained, as it alleged a gross combination between the plaintiff and defendant to deceive others. But the allegation was denied by the defendant, and was not proved, and, the case being submitted to arbitration, was substantially disaffirmed by an award that the injunction should be dissolved. This, then, settled and put an end to the matters of contest in the first bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">On the return of the award, a dissolution being moved for, and there being, at the same time, a motion for leave to file a supplemental bill, the first motion was overruled, and the second granted. The supplemental bill alleged, that one <em>Given </em>the executor of <em>Dinwiddie </em>had assumed to bo entitled to the judgment at law as assignee of <em>Sharrot, </em>and had given notice to him to attend the arbitration, which h&lt;^ designed to do. His apology for not attending and not proved; so that that matter is out of the further alleged, however, that between the agreem* fer and the arbitration, he had, without knowled. assignment to <em>Dinwiddie, </em>paid off the amount maud to <em>Sharrot </em>himself; and he produced hii This receipt, he says, he designed to produce before bitrators, had he reached them before their award. He admitted his belief, that <em>Sharrot </em>had at one time assigned to <em>Dinwiddie, </em>but he alleged that <em>Dinwiddids </em>claim was afterwards relinquished; which allegation is denied, and not proved; so that, as between these parties, the assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>must be presumed. Of this assignment <em>Lockridge </em>said he ,, . , .. 7ai t had no notice; and no notice is proved. As the case stands, then, it in effect presents these questions only, as far as <em>Lock-ridge </em>and <em>Dinwiddi\u00e9s </em>executor are concerned: 1st, Can <em>Lockridge </em>now make this defence, as he failed to make it before the arbitrators ? And I think he can, since the receipt, being posteriora to the reference, and not in issue, formed no part of the matter referred. 2nd, Has <em>Lockridge </em>in fact paid the money, or (which is equivalent) is this receipt genuine ? This was the question fairly between these parties; and <em>Lockridge </em>having failed to prove the receipt, the injunction was properly dissolved, and the bills properly dismissed; that is to say, the original bill was properly dismissed, as to <em>Sharrot, </em>and the supplemental bill, as to <em>Given </em>the executor of <em>Dinwiddie. </em>But the cause not having been brought to hearing upon the supplemental bill as to <em>Sharrot, </em>I do not think it was right to pronounce a decree, which'closed forever <em>Lockridg\u00e9s </em>right of reclamation from <em>Sharrot, </em>if, in the same cause, or in any future contest, <em>he </em>should be able to prove the genuineness of the receipt. For, though <em>Lockridge </em>had no right to a continuance as against <em>Given, </em>who was before the court, who had filed his answer, and had been long delayed, yet as to <em>Sharrot, </em>who was not before the court, who was the party to the receipt, and whose conscience <em>Lockridge </em>had a right to .appeal to, he had a right, either that the cause should be continued as to him <em>(Key </em>v. <em>Hord, </em>4 Munf. 485.) or that the bill should, as to him, have been dismissed without prejudice. Which of these courses was most proper? The latter, assuredly. For <em>Sharrot, </em>being out of the state, and not appearing to have property within it, there was nothing upon which the decree of the court could properly have acted. Therefore, it was not amiss, under the circumstances, to dismiss the bill; but it should have been dismissed without prejudice; for if <em>Lock-ridge </em>should now be compelled to pay the amount of the judgment at law to <em>Given, </em>he would have a right of reclamation for the money paid to <em>Sharrot </em>as evidenced by the receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Must we, then, reverse for this cause, and throw the costs unjustly upon <em>Given ? </em>I think not. We have authority for affirming the decree with costs, and yet modifying it by a provision that it shall be without prejudice. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Baskerville, </em>and <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>6 Munf. 20. 456. The court is, therefore, of opinion, that the decree be affirmed, but this affirmance to be without prejudice to any suit or action at law or in equity, on the part of <em>Lockridge, </em>to recover back from <em>Sharrot, </em>the amount alleged to have been paid by him, and to be evidenced by the receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Decree affirmed, without prejudice &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
