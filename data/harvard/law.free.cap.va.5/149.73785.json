And he denied, that he had any intention to leave the commonwealth or to remove the slaves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-8\">The plaintiff <em>Martin Parks, </em>having taken administration <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>John Parks\u2019s </em>estate, the plaintiffs filed an amended bi^l, making him a party in that character, and making <em>Benjamin Parks </em>also a party, alleging, that <em>Elizabeth, </em>the widow of the intestate <em>John Parks, </em>had been his administratrix; that she qualified as such in 1786; that she had returned an inventory of his estate, and that the slaves in question had been allotted to her as her dower of her intestate\u2019s estate; and praying that <em>Rucker </em>should render an account of his own and his deceased wife\u2019s administration of <em>John Parks\u2019s </em>estate, and an account of the profits of the slaves in question, and a decree against him for the slaves and the profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-9\"><em>Rucker </em>demurred to the amended bill as altogether irregular, presenting a different case and claim from those shewn in the original bill. And then answering, he said that the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>John Parks, </em>had as such no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>colour of right. He admitted, that his wife had taken ad- \u00b0 <em>J t </em>ministration of her first husband\u2019s estate; but he said, she had done nothing in that character; that the pretended inveutory was not signed by her; that there were never any accounts of administration to render: and that the plaintiffs, at this late day, had certainly no right to call for such accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-7\">The plaintiffs failed in the proof of their case; and, on the contrary, <em>Rucker </em>adduced very strong evidence to shew, that he was entitled to the slaves, even if they had ever been held by his wife as dower of her first husband\u2019s estate, by a compromise between him and <em>Benjamin Parks </em>the heir at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-8\">The chancellor dismissed the bill, and the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-9\">The cause was argued here by <em>Garland </em>for the appellants, and <em>Rianard </em>for the appellee;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIm\">the former insisting on the merits, that the appellants were entitled to the property; the latter confining himself to the question of jurisdiction, and maintaining that the case was not a proper one for relief in equity.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b169-12\"> That is, he died before tbe statute of 1792 was passed, malting slaves, thenceforth, <em>personal </em>estate. Prior to that statute, slaves were <em>real </em>estate (though subject to some very peculiar regulations) and the widow was entitled to dower of them; the reversion, of course, belonged to the heir at law.

This case has been strangely managed, and curiously compounded, in the court below. Taking it upon the original bill, it is simply the case of the heirs at law claiming the dower slaves, after the death of the dowress; and this is a clear legal claim; for after the assignment of dower the administrator had nothing to do with the dower slaves. The widow had a life estate in them; they never afterwards devolved to the administrator, or formed any part of the assets. At the death of the dowress, then, what was to impede the claim of the heir, in a court of law\"? I can see nothing. No discovery was sought. As to the prayer .for a <em>ne </em>exeat, that could not give jurisdiction, if the plaintiffs had a legal demand. The <em>ne exeat </em>is a proceeding in equity to obtain bail, in a case where there is a demand or claim in equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>but not at law; for if it be a legal claim, then the plaintiff may have bail at law; and equity (except in a few cases of concurrent jurisdiction) will not entertain him. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Cousins, </em>6 Rand. 188. Upon the original bill, then, the claim was a legal one, and the bill was properly dismissed. But the amended bill alleges, that <em>Mrs. Rucker </em>was administratrix of the first husband\u2019s estate; and an order of court is produced to prove her qualification in 1786, and an inventory of the estate. And <em>Martin Parks, </em>one of the plaintiffs, qualifies as administrator <em>de bonis non of John Parks; </em>and, in that character, calls upon <em>Rucker </em>to account for his wife\u2019s administration, and his own. The answer of <em>Rucker </em>demurs to this new modelling of the case, and adding new plaintiffs and defendants, admits, that his wife did qualify as administratrix, but denies that she ever acted in that character, or received or held any property as administratrix, or that she ever had any thing to do with the inventory, and he relies on the great length of time after which he is called on to account for himself and wife. He denies also, that she or he ever held the slaves as dower slaves, or that any dower was ever assigned to her; and says, that they have held them as their own property exclusively, for above thirty years; and he relies on this holding for title. There is no proof in the record, that <em>Mrs. Rucker, </em>or her second husband <em>Rucker, </em>ever acted as administrators; and the call for an account after this length of time, is certainly loo stale. Nor is there any proof, that these were assigned as dower. There are many witnesses who speak of the hearsays and rumours, and impressions of the neighbours; but none know any thing of the matter. The inventory is not signed by the administratrix, and therefore is no inventory; no proof that the property mentioned in it belonged to the intestate. This is expressly decided in <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Anderson, 2 </em>Hen. &amp; Munf. 361. Therefore, whether we take the case upon the original or supplemental bill, the decree must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
