That in June 1819, an execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>having been sued out of the countv court of Rockbridge, by one <em>Scott </em>against <em>Nick, </em>on a forthcoming bond, and having been put in the hands of <em>Hyde, </em>a deputy sheriff of the county, and by him levied on <em>Nick\u2019s </em>property, <em>Hyde </em>came to <em>Nick\u2019s </em>house to make sale of the property to satisfy the execution ; the amount then due thereon being 154 dollars. That <em>Hyde </em>was in the habit of shaving and speculating on the needy and distressed; and being apprised that <em>Nick </em>held a bond of one <em>Flint </em>for 358 dollars, payable the 1st October 1821, and professing friendship for <em>Nick, </em>proposed to him, that if he would put that bond of <em>Flint </em>in his hands by way of pawn, he would indulge him for four weeks; and <em>Nick </em>expressing his doubts, whether he would be able to raise the money within that time, <em>Hyde </em>replied, that if he should not, it would make no difference. That <em>Nick </em>agreed to put the bond in pawn upon those terms; and <em>Hyde </em>gave him a receipt for the bond, specifying the terms of the pawn. That on the day appointed for the payment of the money, <em>Nick </em>having raised about 80 dollars, tendered that sum to <em>Hyde, </em>who refused to receive any sum short of the whole amount of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>execution. That <em>Nick </em>then made a contract with one <em>Sloan, </em>whereby <em>Sloan </em>undertook to advance the whole of the money, and in fact offered it to <em>Hyde, </em>but he refused to receive it from <em>Sloan, </em>and persisted in holding the bond; and upon <em>Nick\u2019s </em>remonstrating against this injustice, and threatening to bring suit, <em>Hyde </em>told him he was too poor to go to law. That, a few months afterwards, <em>Hyde, </em>fearing that the receipt he had given <em>Nick </em>for the bond, might defeat his purpose of appropriating the whole bond to his own use, began to practice new wiles on <em>Nick, </em>and finally proposed to him, that he should exchange that receipt for another, and <em>Hyde </em>would give him <em>ten </em>dollars to boot; and <em>Nick, </em>poor and ignorant, and thinking it probable it was all he could ever get, consented, received the ten dollars from <em>Hyde, </em>gave up to him his first receipt (which explained the original contract of pawn), and received another receipt from him, expressing that <em>Hyde </em>had bought of <em>Nick </em>the bond of <em>Flint </em>for 358 dollars, and paid him for it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>and that <em>Hyde </em>had received of <em>Nick </em>154 dollars in full of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>execution against him. That <em>Hyde </em>had since collected the whole or the greater part of the money due on the bond. That <em>Hyde </em>had thus got from <em>Nick </em>the bond of <em>Flint </em>for 358 dollars by fraudulent devices and pretences, and that his conduct, in his character of sheriff and as an individual, was fraudulent, oppressive and unjust. Therefore, the bill called on <em>Hyde </em>to produce the first receipt he had given for the bond, shewing the terms of the original contract, or to account for the loss of it, and answer as to its contents; and prayed a decree against Hyde, for the <em>excess </em>of the principal and interest of <em>Flint\u2019s </em>bond, over and above the principal and interest due on <em>Scott\u2019s </em>execution against <em>Nick.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0F\"><em>Hyde </em>answered, that on the day appointed for the sale of <em>Nick\u2019s </em>property under <em>Scott\u2019s </em>execution, <em>Nick </em>offered to sell him the bond of <em>Flint </em>for 358 dollars, payable the 1st October 1821, for the amount of the execution, and earnestly solicited him to make the purchase of it, in order to prevent a sacrifice of his property at a sale under the execution. That <em>Hyde </em>considering the distant day on which the bond was payable, and doubting the solvency of both <em>Flint </em>and <em>Nick, at </em>first declined the purchase of the bond; but after-wards, in consequence of <em>Nick\u2019s </em>anxiety to prevent the sale of his property under the execution, he agreed to purchase it, if <em>Nick </em>would give him surety in the contract of assignment thereof. That <em>Nick </em>procured one <em>Morris </em>to join in the assignment, and <em>Nick </em>purchased the bond unconditionally and absolutely. That after the contract was made, <em>Nick </em>indicating some dissatisfaction on account of the small value he had <em>got </em>for the bond, and <em>Hyde </em>not thinking that it was a very advantageous bargain to himself, he agreed to give <em>Nick a </em>limited time, perhaps a month, to pay the money given for the bond, namely, the amount of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>execution with interest, and if the money was paid accordingly, to return him the bond; and he gave <em>Nick a </em>written <em>memorandum </em>expressing the terms of this agreement. That this was the whole of that transaction : <em>Hyde </em>practised no arts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>to induce <em>Nick </em>to sell him the bond; he was ignorant of its existence till <em>Nick </em>proposed to sell it to him, and importuned him to purchase it; ho made no professions of friendship. That <em>Nick </em>did not, within the time appointed for paying <em>Hyde </em>the money, offer to pay it or any part of it, and in fact he made no proposition in relation to it. That after the time had passed by, <em>Nick </em>applied to <em>Hyde </em>to make some arrangement on the subject through Sloan,\u2014he did not recollect what was the arrangement proposed,\u2014but no money was offered either by <em>Nick </em>or <em>Sloan ; </em>and he refused to accede to the proposition. That <em>Nick </em>never threatened him with a suit: but he complained, that <em>Hyde </em>had made too profitable a bargain out of him; he said that <em>Hyde </em>ought to allow him at least as much as <em>Sloan </em>had offered for the bond, which was <em>ten </em>dollars more than <em>Hyde </em>had given him ; and thereupon <em>Hyde, </em>though he felt under no obligation to give him any thing more, yet being desirous to get rid of his complaints, and to put an end to all controversy, asked him, whether he would be content, if <em>Hyde </em>would give him <em>ten </em>dollars, in addition to what he liad already given him for the bond; and after some chaffering about the terms of final adjustment, it was agreed, that <em>Hyde </em>should pay <em>Nick ten </em>dollars, give him a receipt for <em>Flint\u2019s </em>bond as having been assigned to him without recourse, and a receipt for the amount of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>execution; and that <em>Nick </em>should surrender to <em>Hyde </em>the first receipt he had given for the bond, expressing the terms of the original contract, and give him a receipt in full of all demands on account of the assigned bond. That this agreement was executed on the part of them both; and was regarded by both as a final adjustment. That, as to the original memorandum,,, which was surrendered by <em>Nick </em>at the time of the final adjustment, he believed it was destroyed as being no longer of any use; he had made search for it among his papers, and could not find it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\">The <em>memorandum </em>of the original contract, expressing the terms on which <em>Hyde </em>was to return <em>Flint\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Nick, </em>was never exhibited.

The substance of the evidence deemed material by the court, is stated in the opinions of the judges. There was no proof whatever of any tender of any money, by <em>Nick </em>to <em>Hyde, </em>according to the terms of the original contract, at the time appointed for the payment thereof by <em>Nick.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">The chancellor, without deciding whether <em>Hyde </em>had acquired <em>Flint's </em>bond from <em>Nick, </em>by extortion practised in his character of sheriff, was of opinion, that <em>Hyde </em>had not shewn that <em>Nick's </em>original assignment of the bond to <em>Hyde </em>was a sale thereof, but on the contrary, he withheld a paper executed at the time, which might explain the exact terms of the contract; that, therefore, it was just to presume, that the contract of transfer of <em>Flint's </em>bond by <em>Nick </em>to <em>Hyde, </em>was a pawn, reserving to <em>Nick </em>the right of redemption within a reasonable time; that, as to the alleged compromise, the circumstances rendered that transaction very questionable, and it was incumbent on <em>Hyde </em>to shew that it was fair, and that <em>Nick, </em>in making it, was fully acquainted with his rights, which <em>Hyde </em>had not shewn: therefore, he decreed, that <em>Hyde </em>should pay <em>Nick </em>the balance of the money he had collected on <em>Flint's </em>bond, after deducting the amount of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>execution against <em>Nick, </em>with interest &amp;c. From this decree, <em>Hyde </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ADeO\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Brockentirouoh, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A0a\">I consider it a matter of very little consequence, in the present case, whether the original contract between the parties, is to be considered as a sale or a mortgage. If it be the former, it ought to be set aside on account of the gross inadequacy of price, accompanied with the extortion practised on a necessitous man, at the moment that the extortioner was about to proceed, as the officer of the law', to sell his property under an execution, on a forthcoming bond, from which there was no escape, for no security was to be taken. If it be a mortgage, then the debtor has unquestionably the right to redeem.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">I admit that according to the terms of the assignment of the bond, the contract at first amounted to an absolute sale : but, according to the evidence of <em>Gilmore, </em>it seems tq me that before <em>Nick </em>left the room, the parties converted the sale into a mortgage. <em>Hyde </em>agreed, that if <em>Nick </em>would pay him his money again in a month, lie should have his bond back again, and thereupon a <em>memorandum </em>was written to that effect. Now, if that <em>memorandum </em>had been written on the same piece of paper with the assignment, I think it would be immediately seen to be a simple defeasance. The contract was either not completely closed, or if it was, they agreed, before they parted, to open and change it. Whether <em>Hyde </em>became ashamed of the extravagant imposition which he had practised, and on <em>Nick\u2019s </em>appeal to him relented, or thought that <em>Nick </em>was too poor to raise the money within the time limited, and therefore he was safe, is a matter of no moment. The agreement to give the time, made it, I think, a mortgage. The sheriff agreed to pay off <em>Scott\u2019s' </em>execution, and to insure his safety, took the bond in pledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">I do not think that the subsequent transaction between the parties (which appears, from the evidence of <em>Gold, </em>to have been on the 11th April 1820) \u201cmended the bargain\u201d between them, as it is proved <em>Hyde </em>designed it should. <em>Hyde </em>seems to have been very anxious to get in the <em>memorandum, </em>which he had previously given. While that paper was in existence, it would speak for itself, and if it could now be produced, would most probably shew clearly, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the original transaction was a mortgage. The obtaining of the possession of that paper by <em>Hyde, </em>and the non-production 0f are stVOng circumstances against him. Every thing should be presumed against him who suppresses a document which would explain the contract. The witness <em>Morris </em>describes the scene which occurred when that paper was surrendered. <em>Nick, </em>who was poor and illiterate, was in company with <em>Hyde, </em>and asked the witness to examine his pocket book for the receipt which <em>Hyde </em>had given him: while the witness was examining the papers, <em>Hyde </em>was looking over his shoulder, and when in passing them over, one was turned up, <em>Hyde </em>exclaimed that was the one; he took possession of it, and again observed to <em>Nick, </em>that that was the one, to which the latter assented; and so quick was this operation, that the witness had no opportunity of examining it. It was pocketed by <em>Hyde, </em>and has not been seen since. The money, which appears to have been <em>ten </em>dollars, was paid, and the new receipt was executed. This new transaction was not a confirmation of the former, but a change of the bargain, and has in it not one ingredient to recommend it to the favorable consideration of a court of equity. It was an act of extortion; it was an advance of <em>ten </em>dollars in cash, for a bond the net .proceeds of which would produce to <em>Hyde </em>about 200 dollars in less than eighteen months from that time. It was so hard a bargain against <em>Nick, </em>that, to my mind, it is clear that his poverty and not his will consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">I am of opinion, that the decree of the chancellor was correct in principle, but a small error has been made in the sum decreed; for which error the decree, must be reversed with costs, and a decree entered here for the exact sum due.</p>\n<author id=\"b362-5\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ajqv\">The chancellor considered the bond of <em>Flint </em>for 358 dollars transferred by <em>Nick </em>to <em>Hyde, </em>as a pledge, which might be redeemed in a reasonable time, by paying the amount of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>execution against <em>Nick. </em>I think differently. To my mind, it is clearly proved to have been a conditional sale of the bond. The answer responding to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the bill, affirms this positively; the assignment on the bond was in terms unconditional: but what seems conclusive of the fact, is the evidence of <em>Gilmore, </em>a witness examined by <em>Nick. </em>He was present at the transaction, and details clearly the circumstances shewing an absolute sale of the bond; but (he adds) \u201c when <em>Hyde </em>and this deponent were going to leave the place, <em>Nick </em>called out and observed <em>to Hyde, </em>that he had given him too good a bargain; <em>Hyde </em>replied, that if he would repay him the money in a month, he should have the bond back again; whereupon <em>Hyde </em>wrote a <em>memorandum </em>or receipt to that effect; this deponent thinks he witnessed it, and it was given to <em>Nick.\u201d </em>In the course of his evidence he is asked by <em>Hyde, </em>whether the offer that <em>Nick </em>might get the bond by paying the money in a month, did not come voluntarily from him? He answers, \u201cMy understanding was, that the bargain was final, but that when <em>Nick </em>complained, you made him that proposition.\u201d This proof, I think, fixes this as a conditional sale of the bond, according to the distinction taken between such sales and mortgages, in our books. <em>Chapman's adm'x </em>v. Turner, 1 Call 280. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Campbell, 2 </em>Call 421. <em>Roberts\u2019s adm'r </em>v. <em>Cocke, </em>1 Rand. 121. <em>King </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>2 Munf. 40. <em>Pennington </em>v. <em>Hanby, </em>4 Munf. 140. In <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>president <em>Pendleton, </em>delivering the opinion of the court, says,\u2014\u201c The great desideratum, which the court has made the ground of their decision, is, whether the purpose of the parties was to treat of a purchase, the value of the commodity contemplated, and the price fixed; or whether the object was the loan of money, and a security or pledge for repayment intended ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Rut though I consider this a conditional sale, and that the condition not being complied with, the party cannot, after the day, come to equity for redemption, on the ground of a pledge; yet it is a case, in which an officer of the law, armed with an execution, where no security could be taken, and the day of sale come, buys from the debtor his property to satisfy that execution, on terms so grossly inadequate, that, if the case stood upon the purchase alone, I should be in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>dined, indeed I should be dear, to correct the procedure, by decreeing .for the plaintiff all beyond the amount of the execution, and the <em>ten </em>dollars. But the circumstance which thwarts me in this, is the after settlement between these parties. The sale of the bond was in July 1819. The money was to be paid in a month to get it back. We have it in proof, that the party made exertions to raise this money, but failed. He tells us in his bill, that it was at this time he discovered the fraudulent designs of Hyde, and that he remonstrated with him, and threatened to sue him. This indicates both a knowledge of the wrong which had been practised on him, and a disposition to apply to the law for redress. It was a <em>lis </em>mota, at least. Eight months after this (11th April 1820) <em>Nick </em>agreed to receive of <em>Hyde, ten </em>dollars in addition to the sum for which he had sold the bond,\u2014actually received it,\u2014gave up the former memorandum,\u2014 took a receipt from <em>Hyde </em>for the amount of the execution,\u2014 and gave him one, as follows ; <em>\u201c </em>I have received of <em>C. Hyde </em>the full amount he was to give me for a bond of <em>358 </em>dollars I sold to said <em>Hyde, </em>on <em>C. Flint, </em>witness my hand and seal.\u201d Now, here is a confirmation under seal, of the first contract; and this when the party was no longer in the power of the sheriff, for the execution was paid off; this too, as far as we can perceive, coolly, deliberately and understandingly done; done, as <em>Gold </em>the witness to the receipt says, after his advice to both parties to compromise their dispute; and done, as we must conclude, both from the nature of the transaction and from <em>Gold\u2019s </em>evidence, with a direct view to a compromise. Can we, without the slightest proof to impeach this transaction, set it aside ? It seems to me, that this would be going too far. And I think this is the language of the cases on this subject. Thus, in <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>3 P. Wms. 289. <em>Martin </em>had \u00a3 500. given him by his uncle\u2019s will, in case he should survive the testator\u2019s wife; after the testator\u2019s death, <em>Martin </em>being extravagant, needy and in debt, sold this legacy (he being then twenty-four years old, and his aunt sixty-four) for \u00a3100. to be paid by \u00a3 5-. <em>per annum, </em>but-' that if testator\u2019s wife should die before <em>Martin, </em>in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>case the rest of the money to be paid in one year next; <em>Martin </em>survived his aunt, and after her death, with full knowledge of the facts, confirmed the bargain. He after-wards filed a bill to set it aside. It was first heard by lord chancellor <em>King, </em>and afterwards reheard by lord chancellor <em>Talbot. </em>They concurred in decreeing, that by his deliberate confirmation of the bargain, <em>Martin </em>was bound: lord <em>Talbot </em>remarked, that had all depended on the first assignment, he would have set it aside, as being an unreasonable advantage made of a necessitous man; but seeing that <em>Martin </em>was afterwards <em>fully </em>apprised <em>of every </em>thing, had the executor\u2019s answer read to him, and yet chose to execute a deed of confirmation of his former assignment, and since not the least fraud or surprize had appeared on the part of the defendant, it was too much for any court to set all this aside. In a note on the same case, there is a case reported as decided by lord chancellor <em>Cowper. </em>A man was caught in bed with another\u2019s wife, and the husband who caught him, having a sword in his hand, was about to kill him, he being unarmed and in his power; but upon the man\u2019s desiring the husband not to take advantage of him, and saying that he would make him reparation, they went into another room, where the man gave the husband a note for <em>ij </em>100.: the husband called for payment; the man excused himself for not being ready to pay, but gave his bond for the money, and after filed a bill to be relieved: lord <em>Cowper </em>declared, that if the matter had rested on the note, which was gained by a man armed from one naked, and by duress, he should have made no difficulty of granting relief; but when, after-wards, the plaintiff had coolly, and without any pretence of fear or duress, entered into a bond to the husband, he had thereby himself ascertained the damages, and ought not to be relieved. The great case of <em>Chesterfield </em>v. Jansen, 1 Atk. 301. contains all the doctrine upon this subject, and is a case of the highest authority; and the decree there was in conformity with the cases I have quoted. Upon this view of the case, I cannot but think that the parties, having deli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>berately settled their dispute, must abide by it; and that the kill ought on this ground to have been dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"Aqg\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Av-\">I am of opinion, that the bill, in this case, is sufficiently broad to entitle the plaintiff to relief on one of two grounds; either that the transaction between the parties, if to be considered as an absolute sale of <em>Flint\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Hyde, </em>was unconscionable and oppressive; or that, if it be considered as a mortgage, <em>Nick </em>was entitled to redeem. In either aspect it appears to me to have been a shameful imposition on the part of <em>Hyde.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Take it to have been, as he now says it was, an absolute sale, and look to the circumstances. First, the time: it was on the day of sale of <em>Nick\u2019s </em>property under an execution on a forthcoming bond, when all further delay was hopeless. Next, the parties: <em>Nick </em>(as it proved) a poor and very ignorant, but honest man; <em>Hyde, </em>a deputy sheriff, astute and vigilant, versed in business, in no small degree conusant of the law of these matters, and skilled in \u201c mending a bargain\u201d (as he said to one of the witnesses) when he had committed a <em>faux pas. </em>This man holds the execution over <em>Nick, </em>and has him in his power. Then, the circumstances: He took <em>Nick </em>aside, and \u201cafter some conversation <em>apart\u2019\u2019 Nick </em>let him have the bond: what passed in this conversation, who knows save the parties ? <em>Nick </em>says, <em>Hyde </em>pretended friendship for him, and <em>Hyde </em>denies it; but he himself acknowledges, in his answer, <em>Nick\u2019s </em>great <em>\u201c </em>anxiety for the sale of the bond, to prevent a sacrifice of his other property;\u201d and in that state of things he gets from a needy man, who was in his power, a bond for 358 dollars, for 154 dollars. Did the risque of insolvency justify this discount? Not at all. The bond (it seems) was secured upon real property ; and <em>Hyde </em>not satisfied with that, requires and obtains a man of unquestioned solvency to join in and become responsible for the assignment. It would be a waste of labour to cite authorities, and of words to enter upon an argument, to prove, that this was a most unconscionable and oppressive bargain, obtained by an officer of the law from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>debtor in his power, and therefore peculiarly the object of jealousy and distrust. Nothing is more- easy than for persons so situated, to affect a pain they do not feel, at the cruel necessity which duty and their own safety impose, of pursuing the strict course of the law, and to seem to the world indulgent and lenient, while they are practising the most fraudulent arts to obtain their ends. Nothing is more easy for them, than to deceive even their victim himself by blandishments, while they are in reality only tightening the cords which bind him, and enclosing him more inextricably in their fatal toils. The law, therefore, closely scrutinizes all such transactions, and avoids them, where there is a taint of fraud. In this case, it is rank and offensive, if we consider the transaction as an absolute sale, such it is now affirmed by <em>Hyde </em>to have been. It were charity to him to consider it to have been originally a mortgage. But he discards this interpretation of his conduct, and insists that he did make an absolute purchase of the bond. He thus, in effect, avows himself guilty of this gross and shameful imposition; but he is defended upon the ground that the bill does not charge 'official misconduct, oppression or extortion, and that therefore the case proved is not the case made by the pleadings.-</p>\n<p id=\"ABA\">I concur in the belief that the transaction, in its origin, was an absolute sale; and I am of opinion, that the bill is broad enough to comprehend the case, as proved by the indisputable facts in the cause, and to justify a rescission of the contract, if the parties themselves had not rescinded it and substituted a contract of mortgage in its stead. To prove this, let us look at the bill. It charges that the execution against the plaintiff came into the hands of <em>Hyde, </em>as deputy sheriff. It alleges his habit of shaving and speculating upon the needy and distressed. It alleges that, on the day when <em>Hyde </em>came to sell his property under the execution, <em>Hyde </em>pretended to be his friend, and promised to give him time if he would place the 358 dollar bond in his hands as a pledge; that he did so, and took a receipt from Hyde, acknowledging that he held it as a pledge, which <em>Hyde </em>afterwards, by another fraud, got from him. It charges, that the bond of 358 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>dollars was thus by fraudulent devices and pretences got from him, and that the acts of <em>Hyde, </em>in his character as sheriff and as an individual, were oppressive, fraudulent and unjust: and it asks for general relief. It does <em>not, </em>indeed, set forth that the original act was an absolute sale; but this matter is set forth by <em>Hyde </em>himself, and the circumstances intrinsically prove, that if so, it was fraudulent and oppressive, and entitled the plaintiff to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"A5D\">The chancellor, however, considers the case as one of a mortgage. I think he was right. That the incipient act was an absolute purchase, I do not doubt; and if <em>Hyde </em>had once gpt awayfrom the house, it is probable he would have stuck to it. But <em>Nick </em>called him back at once; and told him he had given him too great a bargain; and <em>Hyde </em>then agreed, that if he would pay the money in a given time, he would give up the bond. This part of the affair, the counsel for <em>Hyde </em>looks upon as a <em>resale, </em>upon a condition strictly to be complied with. I cannot consider it so. There are two other views of it, much more natural and more favorable ,to the character of the appellant, if less so to his pecuniary interest. I should consider the contract for an absolute sale, rescinded by the parties, and a contract for a mortgage substituted; or I should regard the whole affair as forming but -one transaction, and that transaction a mortgage of the bond. The witness says, \u201c when <em>Hyde </em>and the deponent'were going to leave the place, <em>Nick </em>called out, and observed to <em>Hyde, </em>that he had given him too good a bargain; <em>Hyde </em>replied, if he would pay him the money in a month, he should have his bond back again, and wrote a <em>memorandum </em>to that effect.\u201d What was this <em>memorandum, </em>but a defeasance of the act that moment done? It has, indeed, been destroyed by <em>Hyde, </em>but the account of it speaks plainly enough its character, while it is the business of the court to give to it its fair effect. Now, if a transaction can be interpreted with equal fairness in two ways, in one of which the parties will be found to have acted fairly, legally and honestly, while the other involves them in guilt, fraud and oppression, this court cannot hesitate how to choose between them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Accordingly, I am of opinion that the whole transaction must be taken together, and thus be considered as a mortgage, or the first contract for a sale must be deemed to have been rescinded, and a contract for a mortgage substituted therefor. Either of these alternatives is better than to suppose that <em>Hyde </em>intended to hold on to the sale, to protect himself by the principle of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>and to insist upon a contract, which is disgraceful to himself, and most oppressive to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">I have carefully examined the cases which have been cited by my brother <em>Carr, </em>but they have not made the same impression on my mind, which he has received from them. In <em>Cole </em>v. Gibbons, the purchaser <em>Cole </em>gave \u00a3 100. for a contingent legacy of \u00a3500. dependent upon the event of <em>Martin </em>the legatee surviving the testator\u2019s wife. Such a purchase, if there was no fraud or surprize, was capable of confirmation, though the court considered it an unreasonable advantage made of a necessitous man. Now, lord <em>King </em>and lord <em>Talbot </em>both relied upon the fact, that there was no fraud in obtaining the first assignment; and, as it was subsequently confirmed with deliberation, after the death of the wife and the determination of the contingency, they were of opinion it should be binding. So in the anonymous case. Though the note for \u00a3 100. was void (when given) for duress, yet as the maker was liable to damages for the criminal conversation with the payee\u2019s wife, there was an ample consideration to sustain the bond which was afterwards given, deliberately and without duress. But in this case, the oppression is monstrous and revolting, and the act of confirmation, as it is called, is more outrageously unreasonable than the original purchase of the bond. For in the purchase, <em>Hyde </em>gave 154 dollars for a bond of 358 dollars; somewhat less than one half: in the compromise, as it is called, he gave <em>ten </em>dollars for 204 dollars; less than one twentieth. It <em>is true Nick </em>was no <em>longer in </em>execution, but he was ignorant and necessitous, and the deputy sheriff took advantage of him and obtained for <em>ten </em>dollars the release of an equity of redemption to the value of 204 dollars. Surely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the cases cited cannot sustain this corrupt and vicious transaction. Though fair compromises must not be broken in upon, yet no agreement of whatever kind is binding, when there is fraud and oppression on one hand, and ignorance and necessity on the other. Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the decree is right in principle, though there is an error of a few dollars more than the appellee was entitled to, in the amount decreed; for which error the decree must be reversed with costs, and a decree entered here for the proper sum.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
