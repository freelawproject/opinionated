Poore, and thus to obtain satisfaction of the debt due from <em>Barrett </em>to himself. But <em>Barrett </em>positively refused to sell the property to Price, until the debt for which it was mortgaged to Poore, should be satisfied; and Price, on his part, in order to. make the property available to him, in case he should accomplish the purchase of it, was solicitous to relieve it from <em>Poore's </em>incumbrance, and, at the same time, to convert into available funds three negotiable notes of which he was the holder, and in which <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Brooks </em>were bound as maker and indorser. Price, therefore, opened a treaty with Poore, to purchase a release of the mortgage he held on <em>Barrett's </em>property; in which he proposed to transfer to Poore, the three negotiable notes of <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Brooks </em>(whom he represented to be solvent) which had not then come to maturity, one for 1160 dollars, another for 550 dollars, and the third for 253 dollars, and to pay him the balance of the mortgage debt, in other funds. <em>Poore </em>made no question as to the solvency of <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Brooks; </em>he objected, however, that the notes were probably usurious; but this <em>Price </em>positively denied, asserting that they were good, and secured on property of tenfold the value. <em>Poore </em>still declined taking these notes; saying, that he would not purchase a law suit; that, whether the notes were usurious or not, he might be tied up in chancery upon an allegation of usury: upon which <em>Price </em>expressly undertook and promised Poore, that if, and so soon as, any objection should be raised to the payment of the notes on the score of usury, he would himself immediately pay him the contents of the notes. By these representations and this express promise of Price, <em>Poore </em>was induced to accept a transfer of these notes of <em>Campbell </em>and Brooks, without an indorsement of them by Price, and to release the mortgage he held of <em>Barrett's </em>property; which <em>Price </em>immediately purchased of <em>Barrett. </em>The representation made by <em>Price </em>to Poore, that the notes were secured by ample collateral security, was, in the opinion of this court, clearly proved to be false and fraudulent. When the notes came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>to maturity, the smaller note of 253 dollars was paid. The other two were renewed for six months; but <em>Price </em>assented. to this, and indeed proposed it, saying, that if such indulgence was given, he had no doubt they would be punctually paid. The renewed notes were protested at maturity, for non-payment; upon which <em>Poore </em>brought suit on them; and thereupon, <em>Campbell </em>exhibited a bill in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Richmond </em>against <em>Poore </em>and <em>Price, </em>charging that the consideration of the notes was usurious,\u2014 that they grew out of transactions between <em>Price </em>and him, in which <em>Price </em>had practised most grievous extortion upon him; and praying relief from the usury: and when <em>Poore </em>recovered judgments against him at law, he prayed an injunction to stay further proceedings on them; which was awarded. In that suit, a long controversy ensued between <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Price; </em>but <em>Campbell </em>having left the state, and security for costs being required of him and he failing to give it, his bill was for that cause dismissed, before the decree was made in this suit between <em>Poore </em>and <em>Price.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">Immediately after <em>Campbell </em>had brought his suit against <em>Poore </em>and Price, for relief against his notes transferred by <em>Price </em>to <em>Poore, </em>on the allegation of usury, <em>Poore </em>brought this suit against <em>Price, </em>setting forth, in his bill,' the facts of the transaction between him and <em>Price, </em>as above stated; praying relief in equity, on the ground of the fraud practised upon him by <em>Price, </em>by which he had been induced to take the transfer of <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Brooks\u2019s </em>notes without <em>Price\u2019s </em>indorsement, and to release his lien on <em>Barrett\u2019s </em>property, and of <em>Price\u2019s </em>promise, that if any objection should be raised, and so soon as it should be raised, to the payment of the notes, on the score of usury, he would himself pay the contents thereof; and praying further, that, as <em>Price </em>still held the property he had purchased of <em>Barrett, </em>the court would restore to <em>Poore </em>the benefit of his original lien on it, of which <em>Price </em>had, by false representations and fraud, procured a release from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\"><em>Price, </em>in his answer, denied all the material facts alleged in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The chancellor did not, in his decree, intimate the ground on which he dismissed the bill; but, most probably, he thought the case alleged in the bill was not proper for relief in equity; that if the plaintiff had right, he had a complete remedy at law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-4\">The argument of the cause here, by <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Planar d </em>for the appellant, and <em>Johnson </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A04b\">turned chiefly on the controverted questions of fact. The only point of law raised, was the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b75-5\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AqNd\">I feel no doubt about the facts of this case: the evidence establishes all the material allegations of the bill, and wholly discredits the answer. [He stated the case as alleged, and, in liis opinion, fully proved]. My only difficulty has been on the question of jurisdiction; for I am principled against stretching the doctrines of equity, to take in every case which seems to present hardship. Upon examination, however, I am satisfied, that the bill presents a case proper lor relief in equity. It expressly charges fraud in the contract, and prays a decree against <em>Price </em>for the amount of the notes, and a sale of the house and lot in default of payment. Fraud is one of the largest and most fruitful heads of equity. In 1 Madd. Ch. Prac. 258. the general proposition is laid down, and many cases cited in support of it, that <em>\u201c </em>in all cases of fraud not penal, a court of equity has a <em>concurrent jurisdiction </em>with courts of law, with the exception as to fraud in obtaining a will.\u201d It will be observed, that the very phrase <em>(concurrent jurisdiction,) </em>gives the idea, that equity may act, where there is also a remedy at law; and the cases shew this clearly. Thus, in <em>Colt </em>v. <em>Woollaston, </em>2 P. Wms. 156. the defendant had invented a project for extracting oil out of radishes, for which he obtained a patent and sold out shares, at \u00a3 20. a piece; the plaintiffs had bought six shares, and paid <em>\u00a3, </em>120. for them; the thing turned out a bubble, and they filed their bill to recover back the money. It was objected, that if ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>grieved, they had a plain remedy at law; but the bill.was grained, and a decree rendered. On the point of jurisdiction, the court said, <em>\u201c </em>It is no objection, that the parties have their remedy at law, and may bring an action, for money had and received to the plaintiff\u2019s own use; for in cases of fraud, the court of equity has a concurrent jurisdiction with the common law,\u2014matter of fraud being the great subject of relief here.\u201d <em>Stent </em>v. <em>Bailis, </em>Id. 220. is a case of the same kind, where the same objection received the same answer. I consider these cases exactly in point. But it seems to me, there is another ground of equity. <em>Poore </em>had a lien on <em>Barretts </em>property (I do not speak of the equitable lien\u2014he had an actual incumbrance by deed) and this he was induced to release, by that false and fraudulent representation, which <em>Price </em>made as to the notes, and which formed a part of the very contract, by which <em>Price </em>obtained the property. Now, we know, that fraud or covin (as is said in <em>Fermor\u2019s </em>case 3 Co. <em>77. </em>and repeated by lord Mansfield, in <em>Bright </em>v. <em>Eynon, </em>1 Burr. 395.) may, in judgment of law, <em>avoid </em>every kind of act; and we know also, that, in such cases, it is the peculiar province of equity, to place the parties as nearly as may be in their former situation. <em>Price </em>still holds this property, and the bill prays that the plaintiff\u2019s lien on it may be revived, and that in default of payment of the notes by <em>Price, </em>there may be a decree for the sale of the property. And this seems to me clearly just. We do not know what may be the circumstances of <em>Price, </em>nor can this make any difference in the principle: but suppose him insolvent, except as to this property, would it not be very unjust, that he should hold it clear of the lien which he had, by his own fraud, induced the plaintiff to give up?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">I think, therefore, that the decree should be reversed and a decree entered here, for the amount of the notes, with interest, to be paid within a given time; and, in default of such payment, that the property be sold to raise the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A05\">The case alleged in the hill is completely proved. The bill sets forth a detail of facts, out of which arise two substantive reasons for charging the defendant. That, indeed, on which the draftsman of the bill seems to have principally relied, was the promise of <em>Price </em>to pay the notes, if the defence of usury should be set up. JBut it is also alleged, that Price, when he transferred the notes of <em>Campbell </em>and Brooks, stated them to be perfectly good, the payment being secured upon property of tenfold the value. Now, if this was not true; if <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Brooks </em>were insolvent; if <em>Price\u2019s </em>indorsement of the notes was dispensed with, so that there was to be no responsibility on his part on the ground of insolvency; and if, obviously, this was all done in consequence of <em>Price\u2019s </em>assurance that <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Brooks </em>were good, and those notes well secured; it is very clear, that this allegation is all important, and that if the waiver of <em>Price\u2019s </em>own responsibility as an indorser, was the consequence of these false representations made by him, such release of <em>Price </em>must be considered void, and he regarded as bound for the demand. There are, then, two foundations for the claim to relief: 1. the agreement to be responsible upon the plea of usury being resorted to ; and 2. \u2022the fraud of Price, in representing the paper as well secured, and absolving himself from liability by transferring the notes without indorsing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The last of these grounds is amply sufficient to sustain the jurisdiction of the court; lor <em>Poore </em>could not make <em>Price </em>responsible at law for the insolvency of <em>Campbell </em>and Brooks, since his name does not appear upon the notes, and it was understood that there was to be no responsibility on the ground of insolvency. But in equity, he is made responsible, by reason of the fraud and misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The first ground may also be maintained in a court of equity, under the circumstances of this case; a suit being at that time in progress between <em>Campbell on </em>the <em>one </em>part, and <em>Poore </em>and <em>Price </em>on the other, in relation to the same transaction. This suit gave the court of equity cognizance of the controversy, and there could be no doubt of the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>of <em>Poore </em>to file a cross bill, asking relief in case the <em>usury should be established. </em>But he claimed to charge him <em>as soon as the defence of usury should be set up. </em>Here, then, were two grounds, upon which <em>Price </em>might be chargeable, on the last of which <em>Poore </em>might fail; and even though it should be admitted that <em>Poore </em>might have asserted his right, as to either, in a court of law, yet, as the court of equity clearly had jurisdiction as to the former, as incidental to the suit already depending there, it was proper that the other matter should be also brought before it, instead of having two litigations, before different tribunals, in relation to the same transaction. But if this be not so, still as <em>Poore </em>was induced to take the paper by false representations, equity has cognizance to relieve against the fraud, to set aside the contract, and place <em>Poore </em>in the situation he held before it; that is, as a creditor having an express lien for his debt, upon the property purchased by <em>Price. </em>In all these various points of view, I think the court had jurisdiction, and instead of dismissing the bill should have decreed for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\">This decree, I think, should have been, in the first instance, personal against Price, with liberty to Poore, if it proved unavailing, to resort to his lien, in the same manner and to the same extent (but no farther), as if that lien had never been released; for, in my opinion, upon setting aside the fraudulent transaction, <em>Poore </em>should be reinstated in his rights, in the same extent as if the contract never had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
