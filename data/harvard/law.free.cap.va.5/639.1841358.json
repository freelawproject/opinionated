The execution bore date the 27th July, 1822; was returnable on the fourth Monday in September following, and having come into the hands of the sheriff, was returned by him with this endorsement, \u201c Not executed by order of plaintiff\u2019s attorney.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-9\">Another execution issued in the name of the same plain\u00bb tiff, on the same judgment against the goods of the defendant, bearing date the 10th October, 1823. Immediately thereafter, the defendant moved the County Court of Orange to quash the last, execution, on the ground that the amount of the judgment on which the execution issued, was paid to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney after the rendition of the judgment, and before the emanation of the said execution. In support of his motion, the defendant gave in evidence the first mentioned execution, with the return thereon, and a receipt of <em>Edmund Banks, </em>the attorney for the plaintiff, in the words and figures following: \u201c Received 25th November, 1822, from Col. <em>Laurence T.

Quarles\u2019s </em>bond, either to <em>Banks </em>or <em>Smock, </em>nor had it ever been returned or accounted for to <em>Dade. </em>The defendant also gave in evidence the execution from the same office against the goods and chattels of the defendant, in the name of <em>Peter Smock, </em>(as mentioned in the receipt,) for S 354, with interest from 22d December, 1820, till payment, bearing date the 27th July, 1822, and returned, \u201cNot executed by order of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney;\u201d for the collection of which last execution, also, the said <em>Banks </em>Was attorney. The Court being of opinion, that the said receipt and other facts, were sufficient to sustain the mption, gave judgment that the execution of 10th October, 1823, should be quashed. The plaintiff excepted to <em>the </em>opinion of the Court, and spread all the foregoing facts on his bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-4\">The plaintiff obtained from a Judge of this Court a <em>Supersedeas to </em>the judgment, it being allowed on the petitioner\u2019s entering into bond with security in the penalty of fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\">The case came on before the Superior Court of Law for Orange, and the Judge thereof adjourned for decision to this Court the following questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-6\">1.

Co. </em>of 1819, ch. 71, sec. 72 and 73, and to ch. 69, sec. 58, 59; and admitted that the <em>Supersedeas </em>bond was right in this case. He contended, that the Writ of <em>Audita Querela, </em>had become obsolete, and that in modern practice the <em>motion. </em>had been substituted for it. For the whole doctrine on this subject, he referred to the following authorities: 1 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>311. <em>Audita Querela, </em>B.; 1 <em>Comyn\u2019s, </em>778, <em>Aud. Quer. </em>D.; 3 <em>Black. Com. </em>405-6; <em>Lester </em>v. <em>Mundell, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pull. 427; <em>Anonymous, </em>1 Salk. 93; <em>Wicket v. Creamer, </em>Ib. 264, and 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>439; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>The Judges of Ulster, </em>4 Johns. Rep. 1; <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>17 Johns. 484; <em>Bebee </em>v. <em>Bank of N. Y. </em>1 Johns. 529; <em>Wardell </em>v. <em>Eden, </em>Ib. 522.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-10\">He referred to <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Frazer, </em>2 Wash. 130, to shew that the <em>motion </em>had substituted the Writ of Error <em>Coram Vobis. </em>Also to <em>Hendricks </em>v. <em>Dundas, </em>2 Wash. 50, 54, to shew the general power exercised by Courts over their executions, upon motion; to <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>1 Rand. 1, to shew that the Court may have a jury, or not, at their election: and to prove the power of the attorney in receiving the money, and discharging the execution, for his client, he referred to 1 <em>Comyn's, </em>157, 158, B. 9, B. 10; <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>1 Wash. 10; <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Burnley, </em>1 Call, 147.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b649-12\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-13\">I. As the claim to relief is founded on the allegation that the judgment was paid, relief ought to have been sought by <em>Audita Querela, </em>or <em>injunction, </em>and not by motion. Though the <em>motion </em>is substituted in many cases in the place of the <em>Audita Querela, </em>yet it is not, when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>depends on a contested matter of fact. 1 <em>Salk. </em>264; Barnes, 204; 1 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>531; 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>439.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUQ3\">II. When relief depends on matter of law only, it is not granted on motion, unless the case be clear. 1 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>531, in note. The case of <em>Lester </em>v. <em>Mundell, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pull. 427, is not supported by any case previous, or subsequent, and is in direct contravention of the decision of Holt, 1 Salk. 264. \u00b0 The modern practice is not that the motion has superseded the <em>Audita Querela, </em>in all cases, but in many or most cases. 2 <em>Cromp. </em>416; 5 <em>Taunt. </em>561.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-5\">III. If it is.objected, that the <em>Audita Querela </em>has gone entirely out of use, the answer is, that it has not been substituted by motion, where relief depends on'matters <em>in pais, </em>as payment, &amp;e. If there be no modern example of a resort to the <em>Audita Querela, </em>there is none of a motion as its substitute. It has been substituted by Injunction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-6\">IV. He contended, that the Court should not have decided the fact of payment, but should have submitted it toa jury. In the only case in which relief, depending on matter of fact or <em>in pais, </em>has been granted on motion, (1 <em>Bos. 8r Pull. </em>437,) the fact was ascertained by an issue tried by a jury, and it is not surmised, that it is competent to the Court to assume the decision of the fact. The control of the Court over its practice, may give them power to modify the form by which contested questions may be brought to adjudication, but gives no right to transfer to itself the functions of the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-7\">It is incongruous, that the Court should try the fact of payment where the debt is evidenced by record, and have no such power when it is founded on a bond, note, or promise. If the Court can endow itself with jurisdiction to try the fact, in such suit, by a change of the manner of bringing the facts in judgment, why not in every other suit ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-8\">But, it is objected, that in motions on forthcoming bonds, and other summary remedies, questions of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>that arise may, in the discretion of the Court, be decided by it, without the intervention of a jury. The answer is, ibat in those cases, the Courts are endowed by express statute law, with the power of deciding the motion, and giving judgment, and the decision sustaining their right to dispense with a jury, is nothing more than an interpretation of the statute, and a determination of the extent of power which such statute communicates. The power claimed and exercised, is derived from the legislative grant, not assumed tinder color of a change of the mode of bringing questions to adjudication. Suppose the statute law had not provided a remedy by motion, in the case of forthcoming bonds, could the Court assume the trial of the fact ? English Judges have not ventured on such an usurpation. If the statutes giving the Court power to grant judgments on forthcoming bonds were repealed, the argument founded on the practice under those statutes, would lose its foundation. Can the right of the Judge to try and decide the question, whether a judgment has been paid or released, depend on the existence, or non-existence, of the statute giving remedy by motion on forthcoming bonds?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-5\">The Courts in England entertain motions to vacate judgments entered under warrants of attorney given on an usurious consideration, but they do not assume the power of deciding the fact of usury, but have an issue to try it. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>Cowp. 727. Would the Courts here assume the power of trying the fact ? He presumed not; and yet if the position assumed, that the power to entertain the motion, carries with it the power to try and decide all matters connected with the motion, be correct, the Courts would have thkt-power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-7\">V. The decision on the fact was wrong. The attorney had no right, as such, to make a commutation of the debts, and bind his client by any such arrangement. His sole power was to collect the debt due from <em>Dade </em>to his client, and could bind him by the receipt of the money only. This is the utmost extent, which the decision of the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>of Appeals has given to the authority of the attorney. Suppose he had neglected the collection of <em>Quarles\u2019s </em>bond, was <em>Smock </em>chargeable with the consequences ? <em>Smock </em>had not confided that agency to him; <em>Dade </em>had: and in the collection of <em>Quarles\u2019s </em>bond, he was the agent of <em>Dade </em>only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADV\">VI. Had <em>Smock </em>given the receipt himself, it would not have established the fact of payment. The receipt imports that the bond was taken as a security for the debt, not as a payment. If <em>Smock </em>had sanctioned the act of Banks, he could not have maintained a motion against him on the proofs in the record; he must further have proved that the bond was paid. . Could the Court have been warranted in entering a satisfaction of the judgment? If not, the execution ought not to have been quashed. Indeed, the motion ought to have been to enter satisfaction of the judgment; for that would be the result of a successful prosecution of the <em>Audita Querela; </em>and if the motion be an authorised substitute for that writ, and the fact be made out, that should have been the judgment in this case. If the proofs do authorise such judgment, that which was given cannot be vindicated.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b652-6\">Summers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO2\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">It is conceded by the counsel <em>for the </em>defendant, and the' Court concur with him in the opinion, that the Writ of <em>Supersedeas </em>was properly allowed, and that the law respecting an appeal by the plaintiff or demandant, has no relation to Writs of Error and <em>Supersedeas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">On examining the question, whether the remedy sought in this case should have been by an <em>Audita </em>Querela, or Injunction, and not by motion, we are satisfied, as well from the uniform practice in Virginia, as from the modern decisions in England, that the more summary, and less expensive mode of proceeding by motion was proper, and that relief may be given in this way in all cases, where by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>the ancient practice the party would be entitled to an <em>viudita Querela.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">When the claim of the party to relief depends on matters of fact, the Court may, in its discretion, cause them to be submitted to a jury, and such course is particularly proper where the evidence is contradictory, or where it may authorise conflicting inferences, and either of the parties are desirous of referring it to that forum. But, the ease before us does not, in our opinion, fall within this rule, nor does the record disclose any objection by the parlies to the mode of trial adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The authority of the attorney to receive payment of the debt which he is employed to recover, we think well settled; but, that authority, in our opinion, does not extend to its commutation without the assent of the client. In relation to <em>Quarles\u2019s </em>bond, we regard <em>Banks, </em>as the attorney of <em>Dade, </em>not of <em>Smock. </em>On giving an acquittance, or receipt for the money, he must have represented the former, not the latter. It was a new engagement, in which all his authority was derived from <em>Dade: </em>to him he must have looked for compensation, and to him he was accountable. To extend the authority of the attorney beyond this limit, without a general discretionary power from the party employing him, would carry the responsibility of the first client into transactions far beyond the first engagement, and which might be induced solely with a view to the profit of the attorney, or the accommodation of the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">If, however, the receipt set out in the record had been the act. of <em>Smock </em>himself, it would not, in our opinion, have authorised the quashing of the execution, without further proof of the receipt of the money; as that paper imports that: the bond of <em>Quarles </em>was taken as a security, not as a pay ment. of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">As the money actually paid to <em>Banks </em>by <em>Dade, </em>and by <em>Buck </em>on <em>Dade\u2019s </em>order, did not amount to a full satisfaction of the judgments on account of which those payments were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>made, the execution ought not to have been quashed, although it would have been entirely proper, if such motion had been submitted, for the Court to have entered a satisfaction of the judgments to the extent of those payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The following is to be entered as the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">1. The law respecting an appeal by the plaintiff, or demandant, does not apply to. a Writ of Error, or <em>Supersedeas, </em>and therefore the penalty of the bond was properly directed by the Judge on awarding the Writ of <em>Supersedeas </em>in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">2. The law did not authorise the County Court to quash the execution on the evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">3. The Superior Court of Law ought to reverse the judgment of the County Court, and proceeding to give such judgment as the County Court ought to have rendered, to adjudge that the plaintiff below take nothing by his motion, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
