The execution only amounted to 187/. 13s. <em>7d. </em>but the condition of the bond recited that it amounted to 195/. <em>12s. 6d. \u201c </em>including interest, Sheriff\u2019s commissions and all legal costs.\u201d The bond acknowledged the obligors to be held and firmly bound to <em>Duncan M\u2019\u2019 Lochlin </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2022 <em>Co. </em>in the sum of 391/. <em>5s. 6d. </em>to be paid to the said <em>Duncan M\u2019Lochlin, his certain attorney, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">The condition recites, <em>whereas Duncan M\u2019Lochlin hath sued out of the County Court of Cumberland a writ of fieri facias, 8?c.</em></summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b66-8\">The County Court gave judgment for the amount of the condition of the bond. The District Court affirmed the judgment, and from the judgment of affirmance <em>Wilkinson </em>appealed to this Court.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-9\"><em>Washington, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-10\">Upon the ground that the bond is taken for too much, the obligation will not be held void ; but the Court will enter judgment for as much as is really due, if the party will release.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXb\">And as to the exception that the execution is at the suit of <em>M\u2019 Lochlin 8? Co. </em>and the condition of the bond is for payment to <em>M\u2019Lochlin </em>only; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Hornsby, </em>the other day*, went the full length of deciding that point: in which case the Court determined that the bond might be corrected by the execution. For, although the condition mentions <em>M\u2019Lochwa </em>only, yet that is an evident mistake; because the penalty mentions the right name, and therefore, we need not go out of the record to ascertain it. If we reason by analogy to the statute of <em>Jeoffails, </em>which being in <em>pari materia </em>is therefore applicable, it will be clear ; for the provisions of that statute are, that if the sum or name be right in any part, it shall not vitiate. Though in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>motions upon bonds of this kind the Court may hold to some strictness, yet the bond being for the benefit of the defendant he ought not to be allowed to object.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-4\"><em>Duval, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-5\">The bond is in the nature of a <em>scire facias: </em>in which such a variance would have been fatal. The including of the Sheriff\u2019s commissions was palpable error.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b67-6\">\n<em>PER C UR.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AiM\">The error as to the Sheriff\u2019s commissions might have been corrected; but the <em>solvendum </em>is to <em>Lochlin </em>only, and so does not pursue the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\"><em>Washington. </em>That will not prejudice ; because the <em>teneri </em>is right, and the <em>solvendum </em>is repugnant, and therefore void. It is the <em>teneri </em>which creates the obligation, and the subsequent matter will not vitiate, <em>Robert </em>v. <em>Harnage, 2 </em>Ld. Raym. 1043 ; 5 Bac. Abr. [163, ed. Gwil.] <em>[Queen Mother </em>v. <em>Challoner,] </em>1 Sid. 295 ; 3 Dyer, 350. Upon these authorities the bond is clearly good.</p>\n<author id=\"b67-10\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A5J\">Those authorities are satisfactory. The act requires the bond should be made payable to the creditor; and the legal effect of this bond is, that the obligor is bound to the creditor for payment of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">The rest of the Judges concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b67-13\">\n<em>PER C UR.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AzED\">Correct the mistake as to the commissions, ' and enter such judgment for the appellee as the District Court ought to have entered; that is, for the sum due by the execution without the Sheriff\u2019s commissions. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b67-15\"> The four preceding cases being all, in one respect, upon the same subject, are printed together, in order that the reader might have the whole doctrine before him at one view,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
