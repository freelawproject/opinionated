The bill states, that Blane, a merchant of <em>London, </em>in the year 1789, empowered <em>William Hunter, </em>of <em>Alexandria, </em>in <em>Virginia, </em>to transact business for him in the mercantile line; and especially, by his letter of the 23d of <em>November, </em>1789, he gave him ample power to purchase grain, and draw on the said <em>Blane, </em>at the discretion of <em>Hunter. </em>That, on the credit of this letter, which was shewn to the plaintiff, he, on the 22d <em>February, </em>1790, took the bills of <em>Hunter </em>drawn on <em>Blane, </em>for 400/. sterling, for value thereof in current money here advanced. That 50/. of those bills were paid, and the <em>residue </em>protested. That <em>Blane </em>was liable for these bills; and, therefore, the plaintiff prayed an attachment against his effects in the hands of the garnishees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-10\">The answer of <em>Blane </em>states, that the defendant admits he empowered <em>Hunter </em>to transact <em>some </em>business for him, as by the letter of the 23d of <em>November, </em>1789, and another of the 20th of the same month, to which that of the'23d refers. That the defendant does not know whether these letters were shewn the plaintiff, but if he saw that of the 23d, he ought also to have demanded a sight of that of the 20th; whereby he would have discovered that <em>Hunter\u2019s, </em>authority was limited to a particular conjuncture of commercial inducements, not expected to last long. That the defendant does not admit, that the plaintiff paid value in current money for the bills; but believes he received them in payment for tobacco sold by the plaintiff to <em>Hunter </em>on the 22d of <em>February, </em>1790, because the plaintiff\u2019s account, rendered to <em>Hunter, </em>shews it to have been so. The answer then refers to copies of two letters from the plaintiff to <em>Hunter, </em>and states that the defendant does not know what <em>Hunter </em>did with the tobacco. That the bill for 50/. was paid; but that was owing to the defendant\u2019s having accepted it, on its first presentation, without knowing on what account it was drawn, or that <em>Hunter </em>had exceeded his authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AT2\">The letter of the 20th of <em>November </em>mentions, that a great scarcity of grain prevailed in <em>France </em>as well as <em>Bri</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>tain, </em>and other parts of <em>Europe, </em>and that supplies must-come from <em>America. </em>In consequence of which, <em>Blane </em>had chartered several small vessels of about 140 to 180 tons, which would be despatched, early in the next month, to the address of <em>Hunter, M\u2019Cauly, Patten axi\u00e1 Dairy mple, </em>and another Mr. <em>Hunter, </em>of <em>Alexandria, </em>who were to act together., and adopt such measures as would procure the most immediate despatch. The first object being to despatch them before other vessels of a larger size, so as to get sooner to market; and the next, to make two trips before the 1st of <em>July, </em>that being the expiration of the time limited for the <em>bounty </em>to continue. And that he wished provision to be made for the despatch of one such vessel immediately, so that there might no detention arise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">The letter of the 23d <em>November, </em>refers to that of the 20th, and adds the reasons which induced him to enter into the business; which were as follows: 1st. His confidence in the activity of his correspondents, and as it would be impossible to guard against every contingency by instructions, he gives them full latitude, according to circumstances, to act as may appear most conducive to his interest; having always in view the general spirit of his intentions. 2d. The-scarcity of grain in <em>Europe, </em>and consequently in the <em>West Indies, </em>with the <em>French </em>bounty: supplies for all which, could only come from <em>America. </em>3d. Freight would be high, and the demand for vessels greater than could be supplied. 4th. The markets in <em>Europe </em>and the <em>West Indies </em>would be so high as to justify the giving high prices by his correspondents in <em>America. </em>5th. That, if prices should be higher than in the opinion of his correspondents ought to be given, the vessels might then be let to freight. 6th. That the scarcity in <em>Europe </em>and bounty in' <em>France, </em>would attract <em>American </em>vessels thither, and might render the <em>West Indies </em>a greater object. And if so, <em>British </em>vessels would be the safest vessels for the <em>British West India </em>Islands, unless those ports should be opened. Of all which his correspondents were to .judge. 7th. That the vessels chartered suited any destination, and despatch was, therefore, of unspeakable importance; for which reason, he would rather gi-ve .the full extent of the prices here, than that any detention should arise. 8th. That the giving <em>Blane </em>early funds was important, and would have considerable influence on the operations of his correspondents: a circumstance which favored the <em>Falmouth </em>destination. For, as soon as he got</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>Hunter\u2019s </em>advice of a cargo, and bills of lading, he could raise funds on them. 9th. That wheat and flour were doubtless the best articles for <em>European </em>markets, but when the difference between them and <em>Indian </em>corn should be great, as might be the case about the spring, it would probably suit to purchase that. 10th. <em>That in regard to drawing bills, </em>Hunter <em>would, of course, negotiate them on the best terms that circumstances uiould admit of, and that it might, perhaps, facilitate the operations of </em>Hunter, <em>by making the purchases payable in bills on certain terms. </em>11th. Gives addresses, as to certain houses in the <em>West Indies, </em>(who were to be instructed to sell on the spot, and remit to <em>Blane,) </em>and urges the importance of despatch. 12th. Mentions the destruction to shipping in <em>Britain </em>from a storm the month before, which had increased the demand for vessels amongst tbe colliers; and, although there might .be plenty for a while, it could not last long, on account of the great freight that must arise in <em>America </em>for <em>\u201c </em>wheat, flour, corn, lumber, turpentine, tobacco, &amp;c.\u201d adding, <em>\u201cand I must beg that it may never be forgot, that in whatever way a vessel can be quickest despatched is what I shall always prefer; as no consideration can possibly compensate to me for detention and want of time.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-4\">The account spoken of in the answer, is an account current between <em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Hunter, </em>which states a balance of accounts, settled on the 31st <em>December, </em>1789, amounting to 47/. 17i. <em>3d. </em>due <em>Hopkins. </em>Then, a debit of 496/. 155. <em>9d. </em>for 50 <em>hhds. </em>tobacco on the 22d of <em>February, </em>1790, and 210/. for two bank bills. Then follow charges for interest and protest. This account is credited by some small articles of merchandize on the 22d <em>February, </em>1790, and bills on <em>Blane </em>for 490/. to'gether with some lottery tickets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">The letters- of the plaintiff to <em>Hunter </em>are dated the 4th and 24th of <em>March, </em>1790: That of the 4th states the rate of exchange, and mentions some other subjects not relevant to the present suit. That of the 24th, after speaking of some other, matters, not connected with this business, adds, \u201cI am under pressing calls for money, and request you to forward me, at least, the money for the bank notes, and for the former balance due me. The bills on <em>London </em>I do not like to part with at this very low state of exchange, say 16 <em>per cent. </em>Such, however, are my necessities, that unless you supply me, and that very speedily, I must be obliged to make a sacrifice of them. <em>\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>There is in the record, another letter from <em>Hopkins </em>to <em>Hunter, </em>of the 30th of <em>March, </em>1790; which complains, that his former letters had not been answered, and adds \u201cI have frequently informed you, that the bills on <em>London, </em>which I received of you, have not yet been disposed of, owing to the great fall of exchange; and, it was never my wish to sacrifice them, without the most pressing necessity. With this determination, I have regularly acquainted you;.to which, I have received no answer. I now send the bills by Mr. <em>Adams, </em>with a request, that you will be pleased to pay him the money for them; or, return them to me, limiting the price, at which, I may dispose of them. It is, however, proper to observe, that exchange is now down to 16; nor, can I say with confidence, that there is any prospect of its immediate rise.- I have this day drawn <em>on you, in his favor, for the amount of </em>the bank notes, and the balance of my former account; which I left with you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-8\">There is also in the record, a letter from <em>Hopkins </em>to <em>Hunter, </em>of the 4th of <em>May, </em>1790, which is as follows: <em>\u201c </em>Sir, I enclose you a statement of my account; by which, you will perceive a very considerable balance, in my favor, for money lent and tobacco sold. The situation to which I am reduced, from my funds being in other hands, is truly a most melancholy one; and, without these funds can be drawn forth, to answer my own engagement's, the consequences must and will be ruinous to me. . When <em>you </em>view the face of my account, you will readily perceive a very considerable <em>sum of money, from </em>which I have derived no advantage; and, which has too long (and much longer than I expected or intended) lain in your hands. It is not only unfriendly, (and I consider it so) but is cruel and unjust to keep it longer. You will, therefore, send it down to me without delay. It is I conceive needless to say I want it. Every man wants his money; and, the principle of detention, cannot be justified, at least, in the present instance. Your bills are still on hand. I have not, nor can I sell them, unless at the present low exchange; respecting which, I have repeatedly written you; but, have not been favored with a word in reply. The bank notes lent, ought at all events to be returned; and, the propriety of this was so clear, that I sent to you for the money, by Mr. <em>Adams. </em>What was the reply ? Verbally, <em>sell the bills and be damned. </em>I have so often troubled you with letters since I saw you, without an answer to any one of them, that I can hardly expect one on this occasion; but once more, I intreat it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>There is the deposition of a witness, which proves that it appears, by Hunter\u2019s, books, the bills were drawn for the payment of the tobacco purchased by him, of <em>Hopkins; </em>that he lived with <em>Hunter </em>at that time; recollects the disposal of the tobacco, and that no part thereof was shipped to <em>Blane; </em>but, that the same was shipped to <em>Fanny </em>and <em>Forrest </em>of <em>Havre de Grace, </em>for an advance made by them here, to <em>Hunter; </em>Which Was applied as <em>Hunter\u2019s business required; whether for the purchase of produce, or the payment of his debts. </em>That <em>Hunter </em>shewed <em>Blanc\u2019s </em>letter in some instances, when he wanted to sell bills on <em>Blane; </em>but, does not know whether he shewed it to the plaintiff; that these were the first bills, drawn by <em>Hunter </em>on <em>Blane, </em>after the.receipt of the letter of the 23d of <em>November, </em>1789.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-4\">Another deposition states, that the witness had, in the beginning of the year 1790, heard <em>Hunter </em>say, he had a right to draw on <em>Blane; </em>and, that he afterwards heard the plaintiff say, he had bills from <em>Hunter </em>on <em>Blane; </em>and, that <em>Hunter </em>had shewn him <em>Blane\u2019s </em>letter.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b343-5\">The High Court of Chancery dismissed the bill with costs. And <em>Hopkins </em>appealed to this Court.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-6\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\">That <em>Hopkins </em>made advances for the bills, and that he took the bills upon the authority of <em>Blanc\u2019s </em>letter, is clearly collectable from the circumstances of the case. The question, therefore, is, whether <em>Blane, </em>upon that authority, is bound to pay the bills ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-8\">The mode of negotiating the bills, was left by <em>Blane to </em>the discretion of his agent; and, the instructions were, to negotiate them in the best manner in his power. Of course, the agent was not limited by his instructions; and, therefore, whether he appropriated them rightly or not, the bill-holder could not be affected by it, since he had no control over him; and, consequently, was not responsible for his conduct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-9\">It does not matter whether the bills were negotiated for tobacco or money, because the agent might as well have misapplied money as tobacco: and, yet it was essential to his agency, that he should be able to change them into one, or the other. For, it might not suit the merchant or planter here, to take bills for his grain; and, therefore, the agent would be obliged to give them some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>thing which they would take; and this, he had no other means of raising, but by the bills. Either, therefore, he must have sold the bills for money, or if that could not be done, for tobacco; which he might change into money, in. order to make grain purchases with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\">The principles of this case, have'been already decided by this Court in <em>Hooe </em>v. <em>Oxley, </em>1 Wash. 19. But, the case at bar is not so strong as that; for, upon examining the record, in that case, it will be found that the authority of <em>Ponsonby, </em>was much more limited there, than that of <em>Hunter </em>was here. In other respects, the cases perfectly resemble each other in principle. For, the bills there, were drawn for other objects, than the principals intended, as well as here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-9\">The powers given in the letter were ample enough, to authorise <em>Hunter </em>to purchase tobacco itself and ship it to <em>Blane. </em>For, it enumerates tobacco amongst the articles of commerce; and begs, that despatch may be used at all events, in any of the enumerated ways; as nothing could compensate the injury of delay. By which it may be fairly argued, that the purchase of tobacco was authorised.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-10\">Wickham, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-11\">It is clear, that <em>Blane </em>never has received value for the bills; and, that he did not even know of the plaintiff\u2019s contract with <em>Hunter. </em>It is also clear, that the bills were not drawn upon the credit of <em>Blane\u2019s </em>letter; but, that the plaintiff trusted <em>Hunter only. </em>Their <em>letters shew </em>an explicit reciprocal confidence in each other. Therefore, the argument that the plaintiff proceeded upon the authority of <em>Blane\u2019s </em>letter, cannot <em>be </em>maintained. There is no proof that he ever saw it; and, the circumstances repel such an1 inference. It was wholly unlikely, that <em>Hunter </em>would have shewn it, or that he, from his confidence in <em>Hunter, </em>would have required a sight of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-12\">If'the plaintiff bought the bills of <em>Hunter, </em>they must 'have been paid for, either in the bank notes or tobacco. The letters prove it was not the first; because, they treat the bank notes as a loan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-13\">And, as to the tobacco; the inference is, that it was tobacco which the plaintiff lodged with <em>Hunter, </em>to sell for him; and, that it was not an original contract of sale for tobacco, to be paid for in bills; but, that the bills were deposited with the plaintiff, to be sold for <em>Hunter: </em>Which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>is manifested, by the difference of exchange, at which they were to be settled. The plaintiff, therefore, should not have sent the bills to London, and had them protested; but, should, have returned them to <em>Hunter.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-4\">Perhaps it will be said, that he took them as a pledge; but, it never could have been intended, that such a power should have been within the limits of <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>agency. Such a construction would ruin trade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\"><em>Plane\u2019s </em>name was never mentioned in the correspondence; and, therefore, the presumption is, that the plaintiff did not rdly upon him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxQ\">The agency of <em>Hunter </em>was limited and confined to the purchase of grain, during a scarcity which prevailed abroad. This was the primary object; despatch was subordinate to it; although, that- was important through fear that the market might be lost: But, freight was entirely secondary; and, only to be taken in case the other failed. The agent, therefore, had no authority to meddle with any thing else, whilst grain could he got.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-7\"><em>Plane </em>never contemplated the purchase of tobacco, or any other article but grain: he, only went on the idea, that people would put them on board, on freight. For, he says nothing of the places, to which they were to be sent. Therefore, <em>Hunter </em>must be taken to have bought ths tobacco on his own account; and,- not upon that of Plane.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-8\"><em>Hooe </em>v. <em>Oxley, </em>1 Wash. 19, differs from this case. <em>Ponsonby </em>there, was in the character of an agent merely, and not of merchant. Of course, when he drew a bill, the presumption was, that he drew it in his authorised character of agent; but here, <em>Hunter </em>was acknowledgedly a general merchant; and, therefore, not to be presumed to have acted as agent, except where the circumstances evidently shew it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-9\">If in the case of <em>Hooe </em>v. <em>Oxley, </em>the bills had been drawn for the purchase of grain, the principals of <em>Ponsonby </em>would not have been bound. That case would then in fact have resembled this; but, at present it does not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-10\">An exception is made in that case, which, according to legal inferences, will apply here. It is there said by the Court, that the general principles which they laid down, \u201c excluded the idea of collusion between the bill-holder and the agent, to abuse the powers confided by the principal. Such a circumstance would defeat the bill-holder, in his attempt to charge the principal.\u201d If, then, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>did \u2019see the letter of Biane, he necessarily saw that his powers were confined, and, therefore, having entered into a contract with him, out of the limits of his instructions, the law will interpret it a collusion; which will defeat his attempt to charge the principal. However, I do not charge the plaintiff with any actual collusion; I only insist upon the inference which the law would make, had he actually seen the letter. For, as <em>Biane </em>evidently never intended his bills to be applied to the purchas'e of tobacco; such a contract founded on a view of the letter, would fall within the exception above-mentioned. ^</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-5\">\n<em>Randolph,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AulG\">on the same side. The bills have been endorsed over by <em>Hopkins; </em>and, he does not shew his right to hold them again: which we might fairly insist, he was bound to do, if it were necessary to support our cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">But, <em>Hunter </em>could not buy tobacco with the bills; for, he was expressly limited to the purchase of grain. The enumeration of commercial articles, did not authorise the purchase of tobacco; for, it was not one of them. \u2022 Grain was the great object; and the others were merely secondary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-7\">Either the plaintiff saw the letter of <em>Biane, </em>or he did not. If the last, then there is no room to argue, that he relied Upon the credit of <em>Biane. </em>But, if the-former, then, he falls within the exception mentioned in <em>Hooe </em>v. <em>Oxley.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJz\">If the bills were merely pawned as a security for payment for the tobacco, then the plaintiff\u2019s claim cannot be\u2019 maintained,\" because, <em>a </em>factor cannot pledge the property of his principal as a security for his own debt. <em>Paterson </em>v. <em>Tash, 2 </em>Stra. 1178.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s delay in calling on <em>Biane, </em>shews he did not think him liable; and,\u2019that he was probably endeavoring to get it of <em>Hunter; </em>whose credit he knew was declining.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-10\">Upon principle, if the plaintiff saw <em>Biane\u2019s </em>letter, he took the bills subject to the conditions and restrictions which it contained. <em>[Mason </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>et al.] Dough 297.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-11\"><em>Marshall, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-12\">The authority of <em>Hooe </em>v. <em>Oxley, </em>as applied to this case, remains unimpeached. For, although <em>Biane </em>did not receive value for his bills in this case, no more did <em>Oxley 8; Hancock </em>for their\u2019s, in that.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Whether the principal receives value or not is unimportant, provided the agent has power to draw. The plaintiff clearly took the bills on the credit of <em>Blane. </em>It is, at first sight, presumable that the payee sees the authority, before he takes the bill; to omit it would be such a gross act of indiscretion, as few men would be guilty of. The conclusion, therefore, is, that the plaintiff saw the power, and having seen it, he was not bound to enquire further, whether the principal actually received value for the bills or not ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-4\">But, whether the plaintiff saw the power or not, he was bound by it; because, he ought to have seen it: and if he did not, it was a folly, which would not avail him. For, by contracting under it, he, in judgment of law, undertook to know it, and, therefore, was bound by its contents. But if he is bound by it, he should, on the other hand, have all the benefits of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">In <em>Hooe </em>v. <em>Oxley, </em>it was not proved that all the letters were.shewn to the sellers; but <em>Ponsonby </em>held them; and, therefore, it was decided that <em>Hooe Harrison </em>might avail themselves of them, because they would have been bound, by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">The intimacy between the plaintiff and <em>Hunter, </em>forms no objection; it would equally have held in <em>Hooe </em>v. <em>Oxley: </em>But it was considered as unimportant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-7\">If the plaintiff had trusted <em>Hunter </em>only, he would have taken his note or bond; but omiting to do so, he must be held to have relied on Blane: Who, having trusted an improper man, should bear the loss when the trust.has been abused, and not an innocent man, who, through him, confided in <em>Blane.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s letters do hot shew, that the bills were paid for in tobacco, more than money. For, he was only remonstrating with <em>Hunter, </em>whether he would suffer the bills to be sacrificed: But, this did not destroy <em>Blane\u2019s </em>obligation to pay the bills, which were properly issued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-9\">The bills were not taken as a pledge; for, the plaintiff took them as a payment, and had an immediate right to sell them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-10\">The argument, that <em>Hunter </em>was an agent for a particular purpose only, proves nothing. For, if he was a particular agent, it was to draw bills within a certain limited time, and he has done it, within that time. He was not circumscribed by <em>Blane, </em>as to the mode of negotiating the bills; and, therefore, the payee was not bound to make enquiry relative thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>As to the argument, founded on the exception to the ge\u00ab nerai principles laid down by the Court, with regard to agency in <em>Hooe </em>v. <em>Oxley; </em>the answer is, that there is nothing to bring the case within it. That exception means a fraudulent combination between the bill-holder and the agent, to defraud the principal; as, for instance, to get payment of an old debt, or for some other corrupt purpose; but it was not intended to apply to the case of a fair bargain, for an article as current as money, and capable of being turned into it, at any moment. Such a transaction, instead of being collusive, was actually putting funds into the hands of the agent, to enable him to exercise his functions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8Mt\">But, all the principles contended for on the other side, were over-ruled in the case of <em>Hooe </em>v. <em>Oxley; </em>which is stronger than this for another reason, beside that, which I mentioned before; namely, that here there was an express authority given the agent, which the Court thought could only be implied there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-5\">In that case, <em>Ponsonby </em>had no right to substitute himself for the planters; yet, the Court held the principals bound by the substitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-6\">That <em>Hunter </em>was a merchant, makes no difference; or if any, it is against <em>Plane. </em>Because, if <em>Ponsonby </em>was not a general merchant, it was more manifest that he acted as agent; and, therefore, the bill-holder was the more bound to exact a stricter conformity to his agency, and to take care that he did not exceed his powers in the transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s not sending the bills immediately, does not alter the case; because no loss is proved to have been sustained in consequence of it; and, being amongst the first that were drawn, they could have created neither caution nor suspicion in <em>Plane: </em>who would have concluded that they were drawn for the purposes of the agency. Besides, it was held in this Court, in the case of <em>Stott </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>1 Wash. 331, that eighteen months was a reasonable time for negotiating bills of exchange drawn here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-8\">Both agent and principal were liable, if the plaintiff chose to consider them so; and he might pursue them one after the other, if he thought proper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-9\">In short, upon principle, as well as upon the authority of <em>Hooe </em>v. Oxley, (which, in all its parts comes completely up to the present case,) I contend that the decree is erroneous, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"A5K\">On this occasion we are referred to the case of <em>Hooe &amp; Harrison </em>v. <em>Oxley &amp; Hancock, </em>1 Wash. 19, as a case where the principles are established which direct the present decision. We have revised that case, and approve, as well of the general principles laid down, as of the application of them to that case,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and if those principles apply equally to the present case, the same decree will be made, which makes it necessary to compare the circumstances of the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Both powers are of the second class mentioned in that case; <em>limited as to the object, </em>or the business to be done, and the agent <em>left at large </em>as to the <em>mode </em>of transacting it. In that ease the business of <em>Ponsonby </em>was to procure consignments of tobacco to <em>Oxley Co. </em>shipped on board their vessels; to facilitate which, he was empowered to make advances to the shippers, and for that purpose, to draw bills of exchange on <em>Oxley 8\u00a1\" Co. </em>which they promised should be duly honored. In this respect, that c\u00e1se is mistated in the outset, that he was authorised to purchase tobacco; but, the mistake is corrected in the opinion of the Court. The bills in that case, were drawn for the tobacco purchased to load the <em>Lady Johnson, </em>and shipped on board her by <em>Ponsonby </em>himself, consigned to <em>Oxley </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>when other consignments were not to be procured for her loading; so that the principal purposes were answered; namely, that of loading their vessel, and entitling them to commissions for the sale of the tobacco. . The only difference was, that in case the tobacco did not produce the amount of the advance, he would become their debtor for the difference, instead of many correspondents; and they left the opportunity of <em>engaging </em>such correspondents in future: Which being of an inferior nature to the other, it was doubted whether <em>Posonby </em>was not within the strict limits .of his agency, so as to entitle him to his damages against <em>Oxley, </em>for having protested his bills, if the case had come on as between them; especially, as by their letter of <em>November </em>the 30th, 1784, with full information before them of what he had done, they seemed to confirm it, but forbid its being repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In this case, if the cause had come on between <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Blane, </em>it would not admit of a moment\u2019s doubt. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>bills were drawn for the purchase of tobacco, not authorised by the power, nor applied to the use of Blane, either as a remittance, or for the despatch of his vessels: it is consigned to merchants at <em>Havre de </em>Grace, not named in the power, and the proceeds advanced to Mr. <em>Hunter </em>here, and applied in the purchase of produce and payment of his debts. The produce not stated, to be that of grain sent to Mr. <em>Blane, </em>was to bring it, by a circuitous operation within the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">We then compare the case of the bill-holders. <em>Ponsonby </em>had been from <em>May, </em>1783, in the exercise of his power of loading <em>Oxley\u2019s </em>vessels and in the habit of drawing bills for advances to the shippers, and his power communicated in a circular letter, written to engage correspondents. However, in the infancy, his power to draw was not so <em>notorious; </em>and an endorser was in some instances required. Mr. <em>Smith </em>endorsed one of his bills; of which Mr. <em>Smith </em>informs <em>Oxley </em>by letter in <em>September, </em>1783, taking notice, that <em>Ponsonby </em>had applied to him to endorse his bills on them, to get money to advance to the shippers; and that he had endorsed one. In answer to this letter, they thank <em>Smith </em>for his assistance to <em>Ponsonby, </em>whose bills on them they say <em>will meet due honor: </em>A general expression, not confined to that particular bill, but to <em>Ponsonby\u2019s </em>bills generally, which continued to. be frequently drawn, and as constantly paid; until those in dispute were drawn, circumstanced as before stated, in fall <em>1784, </em>and were protested.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">In the present case, the bills were drawn in the commencement of the agency; when the agent\u2019s power to draw had gained no accession from his habit of drawing, and <em>Blane\u2019s </em>of paying; and, therefore, must depend on the power itself, and the circumstances under which Mr. <em>Hopkins </em>received the bills; that is to say, whether he took them upon the credit of <em>Hunter </em>himself, or was induced to take them on the credit of <em>Blane, </em>from a well founded opinion that he was bound to pay them? It was laid down by the appellant\u2019s counsel, that bills of exchange are purchased upon the credit of the person on whom they are drawn; but this as a general position is not correct: <em>they </em>are <em>generally </em>taken on credit of the <em>drawer, </em>which, if doubted, is fortified by an endorser, the drawee not being bound until his acceptance; and then the drawer is not discharged till actual payment, unless by delay the holder gives credit to the accepter, and so loses the other resort</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>We suppose the counsel only meant the case of a bill drawn by an agent on his principal, pursuant to his power given to draw, and to such bills the observation applies. That these bills were not within the letter or spirit of the power, has been stated; and whether Mr. <em>Hopkins </em>was induced to take them, on' a supposition that they were drawn to procure money to fulfil the purposes of the agency, by circuitous operation, depends upon the circumstances.attending the negotiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">That <em>Hunter </em>shewed these letters to some persons to whom he wished to sell bills, as a proof of his power to draw, is proved, but this would seem to be after these bills were drawn; which <em>Scott </em>proves to have been the first drawn by <em>Hunter, </em>after the receipt of the letters. That they were shewn to Mr. <em>Hopkins </em>at the time, is not otherwise proved than by his own declaration to <em>Watson; </em>when made, does not appear, nor is it material, since, whatever credit may be privately due to the assertions of that gentleman, they are not here to be taken for proof. It might be, that <em>Hunter </em>found it unnecessary to shew those letters; since his bills might pass to Mr. <em>Hopkins </em>upon his <em>oten credit as a merchant, </em>with whom Mr. <em>Hopkins </em>had had former dealings, and been in intimacy. The accounts be; tween them, with Mr. <em>Hopkins\u2019s </em>subsequent letters, make a strong impression that this was really the case, and the bills, taken upon <em>Hunter\u2019s credit; </em>the powers, from <em>JBlane, </em>being only now resorted to, when <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>insolvency would otherwise occasion a loss of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Whether the bills were at first taken absolutely, or oh trust, to be sold for <em>Hunter, </em>and whether the exchange was fixed or left to depend upon what they would sell for, seems quite immaterial to <em>Blane, </em>and, therefore, need not be considered. One circumstance drawn from the correspondence though, seems of weight. If Mr. <em>Hopldns </em>took these bills upon the credit of <em>Blane, </em>it was certainly his duty, upon the general principle of negotiation, to have presented them to <em>Blane, </em>or given him early notice of them, to enable him to regulate his conduct as to the agency of <em>Hunter;, </em>for want of which, he might have paid other bills which he would have refused, if he had known himself bound to pay these bills: or finding his agent abusing his confidence, he might have put an end to his powers at an earlier period. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But these bills received the <em>22d </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>February, remained in Mr. <em>Hopkins\u2019s </em>hands, for reasons disclosed in the correspondence with <em>Hunter, </em>at least till <em>May the 4th, </em>the date of Mr. <em>Hopkins\u2019s </em>last letter, and probably longer, since by the note at the foot of the bill, they do not appear to be presented till the 31st of <em>Augusts </em>and that is the first notice which <em>Blane </em>had, of their being drawn. There seems to be the same reason for diligence in the application to Mr. <em>Blane, </em>if he was chargeable in this case, as there is for the like diligence to charge the <em>drawer, </em>when he is to be made liable for want of acceptance and payment. The form of the bill too, directs the money to be charged to the <em>account of Hunter, </em>instead of directing it to be placed to account of grain purchased for your use by me as your agent; a circumstance, which ought in these cases to be observed; in order to show, on whose credit the bills were drawn, and to avoid disputes of the present nature. But, as this is not always attended to, and was not observed in <em>Oxley\u2019s </em>Case, it would not alone have weight; yet, it has some, when added to the other circumstances. The accounts shew thattheplaintiff and <em>Hunter </em>had dealings together <em>as ordinary merchants; </em>an account of which was settled in <em>December, </em>1789. The balance begins the account, in which are added sundry articles of debit and credit, undoubtedly of a <em>private nature; </em>and with <em>these </em>are intermixed a debit <em>for the </em>tobacco and the credit for the bills, differing in amount; and, although that difference is only <em>61. 15s. 9d., </em>it is yet a circumstance to shew that those articles were not a <em>separate </em>independent dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The correspondence confirms the idea of the bills having been taken from <em>Hunter </em>in his <em>private cupacity, </em>and notin his agency; since not a word or hint is given of <em>Blane\u2019s </em>having any concern in them, in any of the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">When we return to the accounts, there are two which agree; the 1st annexed to <em>Blane\u2019s </em>answer, the other I suppose introduced by Mr. <em>Hopkins, </em>making a balance of 248/. 4s <em>9d. </em>due to him. There is a third account with the same articles and making the same balance; which being made an article of debit, this article is added, <em>\u201cto </em>bills of exchange on <em>Thomas Blane, </em>returned protested with costs 560/. 6s. <em>9d. </em>making .808/. 11s. <em>6d\\\u201d </em>and this account, so far, has the name of Mr. <em>Hopkins, October </em>9, 1790, the same date of the other two. Then follow several credits, amounting to 375/. 1 Is. <em>Id. </em>which would leave a balance of 432/. 19s. <em>10id. </em>only due from <em>Hunter, </em>shewing 127/. 6s. 10-J-c?. to have been paid him in part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>of the bills; and this would evince further, that Mr. <em>Hopkins, </em>after the protest, considered <em>Hunter </em>as his debtor. But at the foot is a certificate of Mr. <em>Scott\u2019s, </em>that <em>\u201c </em>the above is a true statement <em>o\u00ed'John Hopkins\u2019s </em>account as it stands on the hooks of the late William&gt; <em>Hunter;\u201d </em>which creates a doubt, whether the debit of the protested hills as well as the latter credits were not taken from <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>books, so as to do away the influence of Mr. <em>Hopkins\u2019s </em>having made it a debit in his account; and that circumstance is disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">But, another circumstance has considerable weight; namely, that although these bills were protested on the 2d of <em>November, </em>1790, Mr. <em>Hopkins </em>does not appear to have made any application to Mr. <em>Blane </em>until <em>May, </em>1793; when he commenced this suit: Which evinces, that during that time he relied on Mr. <em>Hunter; </em>thus depriving Mr. <em>Blane </em>of an opportunity of pursuing a remedy against <em>Hunter, </em>as he might have done, if a demand had been made at an earlier period, by Mr. <em>Hopkins. </em>Upon the whole circumstances then, we are of opinion, that Mr. <em>Hopkins </em>took these bills upon the credit of Mr. <em>Hunter, {unconnected </em>with his agency for <em>Blane;) </em>and not upon the credit of <em>Blane </em>in consequence of that agency.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Therefore, upon general principles, as well as in conformity to the decision in <em>Oxley\u2019s </em>Case, we are unanimously, for affirming the <em>Chancellor\u2019s </em>decree, dismissing the bill.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">[* In <em>Blane </em>v. <em>Proudfit, 3 </em>Call, 214, Lyons, J. delivering the opinion of the Court, said <em>6i </em>That case carried the principle of responsibility far enough, and we are not disposed to push it any further.\u201d]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\">[* For the general rule as to <em>the </em>period of presentment, see <em>Muilman </em>v. <em>De Eugino, 2 </em>H.
