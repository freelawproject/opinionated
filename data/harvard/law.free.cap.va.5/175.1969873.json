At <em>November </em>rules, there was a conditional order; at <em>December </em>rules, the conditional order was confirmed, <em>\u201c </em>unless the defendant should appear at the next quarterly sessions to be held for the said County, and answer the bill aforesaid.\u201d On the 23d of <em>March, </em>he gave special bail; but, did not plead. On the 24th of <em>March, </em>the bail surrendered him to the Sheriff, who <em>gave </em>a certificate that he had him in custody. On the 25th of <em>March, </em>a writ of <em>habeas corpus cum causa, </em>issued from the District Court of <em>Richmond </em>(but it does not appear that it was ever presented to the Court, or delivered to the Sheriff:) And on the 26th of <em>March, </em>being the last day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the term, the Court on the motion .of the plaintiff confirmed the conditional judgment The District Court awarded a <em>procedendo. </em>To which order, the plaintiff prayed a writ of <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-8\">Duval, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-9\">The act of 1792, <em>R. C. </em>98, [ed. 1794, 13 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>465,] only restrained the removal of the suit to cases, where there is an issue or demurrer joined, and does not extend to those where there is no appearance. There is good sense in the distinction too. For, it is reasonable that a man who is sued in a Court, and has submitted to the jurisdiction by pleading, or otherwise referring the cause to their decision, should not be allowed to translate the suit into another Court, until a final hearing; but, it is otherwise, where he has never submitted at all, as in' the present case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"pAHW\">\n<em>PER CUR.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A2Ob\">It does not that the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>was ever shewn to the County Court, or delivered to the Sheriff, without which there could be no removal of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\"><em>Supersedeas </em>denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
