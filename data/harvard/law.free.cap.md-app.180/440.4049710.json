In the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, she pleaded guilty to one count of robbery and the State entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>on the remaining charges. The circuit court sentenced appellant to a mandatory term of ten years\u2019 incarceration in accordance with Maryland Code (2002, 2007 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 14-101(e) of the Criminal Law Article. Appellant subsequently filed a Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence, which the circuit court denied. Appellant noted a timely appeal from that denial and presents one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">Did the circuit court err in denying appellant\u2019s Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence when appellant had not previously been sentenced to a term of incarceration for a crime of violence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">We conclude that the circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion; therefore, we vacate her sentence and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">On May 3, 2004, the date appellant entered her guilty plea to robbery in this case, the State filed a notice in accordance with Maryland Rule 4-245<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that it intended to proceed against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>appellant as a repeat violent offender under \u00a7 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article (hereinafter \u201cC.L.\u201d). The State\u2019s notice provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">The Defendant has been convicted of an offense defined as a crime of violence pursuant to Maryland Annotated Code, Article 14-101, and has served a term of confinement in [a] correctional institution, for that conviction, namely:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">On 4/3/92, Defendant was convicted in Baltimore City, before the Honorable Judge J. Bothe of Bobbery. Defendant was sentenced to the Baltimore City Detention Center for a period of two (2) months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">The Defendant, if convicted, in case 03CE4405 [the robbery case to which appellant entered the guilty plea], of a crime of violence, will receive imprisonment for the term allowed by law, but not less than ten (10) years, none of which may be suspended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">When appellant entered her guilty plea, she did not contest that she had been convicted in 1992 of robbery in Baltimore City. She also understood that she would be sentenced as a repeat offender to a mandatory ten-year term. Following acceptance of the plea, the trial court imposed the mandatory ten-year sentence under C.L. \u00a7 14-101(e), which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">(e) Second conviction of crime of violence. \u2014 (1) On conviction for a second time of a crime of violence committed on or after October 1, 1994, a person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for the term allowed by law, but not less than 10 years, if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>(1) has been convicted on a prior occasion of a crime of violence, including a conviction for a crime committed before October 1,1994; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">(ii) served a term of confinement in a correctional facility for that conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">(2) The court may not suspend all or part of the mandatory 10-year sentence required under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">In C.L. \u00a7 14 \u2014 101(a)(9), robbery is defined as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">In appellant\u2019s Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence, she again agreed that she had been \u201cconvicted on a prior occasion\u201d within the meaning of C.L. \u00a7 14 \u2014 101 (e)(1)(i). Appellant also indicated that in the 2004 Baltimore County case, she had pleaded guilty \u201cto one count of robbery with the understanding that she would be sentenced as a subsequent offender for a second crime of violence, pursuant to [C.L.] \u00a7 14 \u2014 101(e)(1).\u201d Appellant claimed, however, that her 1992 Baltimore City conviction resulted in a suspended sentence and not a sentence of two months, as alleged by the State in its notice and at her plea hearing. According to appellant, the only time she served in relation to the 1992 Baltimore City conviction was the forty-five days she spent on pretrial detention. Appellant thus claimed that she had not served \u201ca term of confinement in a correctional facility for that conviction\u201d as required by C.L. \u00a7 14 \u2014 101(e)(l)(ii). She referred the circuit court to <em>Mel-gar v. State, </em>355 Md. 339, 734 A.2d 712 (1999), in support of her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">On August 2, 2006, a hearing was held on appellant\u2019s motion, and counsel reiterated the arguments presented in the written motion and supporting memorandum of law. Counsel thus asserted that appellant had a prior conviction for robbery, but that she had not served a term of confinement resulting from that conviction because all of the five-year sentence had been suspended. Counsel conceded that appellant had served forty-five days of pretrial incarceration, but claimed that under <em>Melgar, </em>that period of incarceration was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>not served in a correctional facility for the 1992 Baltimore City conviction. Counsel presented the court with several exhibits concerning the 1992 Baltimore City conviction, including: (1) the docket entries; (2) the sentencing guidelines worksheet; (3) the order of probation; and (4) the Division of Parole and Probation Supervision Summary. All these documents indicated that, for the 1992 Baltimore City conviction, appellant had received a five-year sentence, all of which was suspended. As a result, counsel asserted, the second prong of C.L. \u00a7 14-101(e)(1) had not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The prosecutor responded that <em>Melgar </em>addressed repeat drug offenders under Art. 27, \u00a7 286, now codified at C.L. \u00a7 5-609, and that it did not apply to repeat offenders under C.L. \u00a7 14-101. The prosecutor agreed, however, that for the 1992 Baltimore City conviction, appellant had been \u201cgiven a sentence of suspend all but time served____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">I\u2019m sure we have a judge at the Court of Special Appeals who can assign a law clerk down there that can spend copious amounts of time researching this problem and make a determination. But I\u2019m not going to do it. Because I think the sentence was fair and reasonable under all of the circumstances, given the fact that this defendant served a prior conviction for robbery, then goes out and commits another one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">The motion to correct an illegal sentence is going to be denied, which would put it in the appropriate position for appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">Appellant claims that the circuit court erred in failing to determine whether she had served a term of confinement in a correctional facility for her 1992 Baltimore City conviction. She refers us to the evidence presented at the hearing on the motion to assert that she was not sentenced to any term of confinement in that case and that she was merely credited for time spent in pretrial custody. Appellant also cites to <em>Melgar </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>and contends that her case falls squarely within its holding, <em>i.e., </em>that credit for pretrial incarceration cannot constitute a term of confinement for her 1992 Baltimore City conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Here, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion, but declined to address the merits of her claim. Before this Court, appellant raises the same issue that she presented to the circuit court; therefore, despite the circuit court\u2019s avoidance of that issue, it is properly before us. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (generally, an appellate court will not decide issues not \u201craised in or decided by the trial court\u201d); <em>Curry v. Dept. of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., </em>102 Md.App. 620, 632, 651 A.2d 390 (1994) (addressing issue raised in the circuit court but not decided by the circuit court), <em>cert. granted, </em>338 Md. 252, 657 A.2d 1182 <em>cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, </em>340 Md. 175, 665 A.2d 1038 (1995); <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Howard County v. Scheidt, </em>85 Md.App. 154, 158 n. 1, 582 A.2d 563 (1990) (issue not discussed or determined in the Tax Court or circuit court was properly before appellate court because the argument had been made in the pleadings before the circuit court and, thus, in accordance with Maryland Rule 8-131(a), had been raised in the circuit court).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u201cWhere the General Assembly has required or permitted enhanced punishment for multiple offenders, the burden is on the State to prove, by competent evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of all of the statutory conditions precedent for the imposition of enhanced punishment.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>324 Md. 32, 37, 595 A.2d 463 (1991). An erroneously imposed mandatory sentence is an illegal sentence. <em>See Bowman v. State, </em>314 Md. 725, 738, 552 A.2d 1303 (1989); <em>see also Sutton v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 308, 327-28, 738 A.2d 286 (1999) (although no objection raised at sentencing, allegation that mandatory sentence was illegal due to State\u2019s failure to establish prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt was addressed on appeal). Further, the fact that appellant was sentenced to the mandatory term of incarceration pursuant to a guilty plea would not alter the illegality of the sentence imposed. <em>See Holmes v. State, </em>362 Md. 190, 195-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>96, 763 A.2d 737 (2000) (per curiam) (stating that \u201c[a] defendant cannot consent to an illegal sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In this case, we are asked to construe the meaning of C.L. \u00a7 14-101(e)(l)(ii). \u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 688, 861 A.2d 727 (2004). \u201cThe legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself, through its very own words.\u201d <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478 (2000) (citations omitted). \u201c[W]e view the words of a statute in ordinary terms, in their natural meaning, in the manner in which they are most commonly understood.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484 (2004) (\u201cOrdinary and popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of terminology within legislation.\u201d). \u201cIf the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends and we need investigate no further, but simply apply the statute as it reads.\u201d <em>Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426 (2002). In <em>Chow v. State, </em>393 Md. 431, 443, 903 A.2d 388 (2006), the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201cIn construing the plain language, \u2018[a] court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u2019 \u201d <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387[, 835 A.2d 1221] (2003); <em>County Council v. Dutcher, </em>365 Md. 399, 416-17[, 780 A.2d 1137] (2001). Statutory text \u2018should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u2019 <em>Collins [v. State], </em>383 Md. 684, 691[, 861 A.2d 727] (2004) (quoting <em>James v. Butler, </em>378 Md. 683, 696[, 838 A.2d 1180] (2003)). The plain language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation. Rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect. <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223[, 858 A.2d 484]; <em>Navarro-Monzo v. Washington Adventist, </em>380 Md. 195, 204[, 844 A.2d 406] (2004).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>(Quoting <em>Kushell v. Dept. of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576-77, 870 A.2d 186 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u201cIf a statute has more than one reasonable interpretation, it is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Twine v. State, </em>395 Md. 539, 550, 910 A.2d 1132 (2006); <em>see also Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003) (\u201c[B]efore judges may look to other sources for interpretation, first there must exist an ambiguity within the statute, i.e., two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute.\u201d) When \u201cthe statutory language is ambiguous, we resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, considering the legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 453, 879 A.2d 1111 (2005). Further, \u201c[a]n ambiguity in a criminal penal statute, in accordance with the rule of lenity, ordinarily is to be construed against the State and in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>Webster v. State, </em>359 Md. 465, 481, 754 A.2d 1004 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">With these principles in mind, we have no difficulty concluding that the plain language of C.L. \u00a7 14 \u2014 101(e)(l)(ii) requires the same conclusion as that reached by the Court of Appeals in <em>Melgar v. State, </em>355 Md. 339, 734 A.2d 712 (1999). In that case, Melgar was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and related offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 342, 734 A.2d 712. The trial court sentenced him to twenty-five years\u2019 incarceration without the possibility of parole pursuant to the enhanced penalty provision contained in Article 27, \u00a7 286(d) of the Maryland Code, <em>id., </em>which then provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al7\">(d)(1) A person who is convicted under subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section or of conspiracy to violate subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be sentenced to imprisonment for the term allowed by law, but, in any event, not less than 25 years if the person previously:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">(i) Has served at least 1 term of confinement of at least 180 days in a correctional institution as a result of a conviction of a previous violation of this section or \u00a7 286A of this article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">(ii) Has been convicted twice, where the convictions do not arise from a single incident:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>1. Under subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">2. Of conspiracy to violate subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">3. Of an offense under the laws of another state, the District of Columbia, or the United States that would be a violation of subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section if committed in this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">4. Of any combination of these offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">(2) Neither the sentence required under paragraph (1) of this subsection nor any part of it may be suspended, and the person may not be eligible for parole except in accordance with Article 31B, \u00a7 11 of the Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">On appeal, Melgar argued that the State had not established one of the statutory predicates for imposing the enhanced penalty, <em>i.e., </em>that he had served at least one 180-day term of confinement in a correctional institution as a result of a conviction for a previous violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 286 or \u00a7 286A. 355 Md. at 342, 734 A.2d 712. Melgar had served 248 days concurrently for two prior convictions before he was released on probation. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 734 A.2d 712. When he was sentenced for those offenses, however, the trial court gave him credit for 107 days that he had spent in pretrial detention because he had been unable to post bond. <em>Id. </em>at 344-45, 734 A.2d 712. As a result, Melgar alleged that he had served only 141 days \u201cas a result of\u2019 a previous conviction and not the 180 days required under \u00a7 286(d)(1)\u00ae. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 734 A.2d 712. The Court of Appeals agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 353, 734 A.2d 712. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">[W]e conclude that the 180-day previous term of confinement required under \u00a7 286(d) as a statutory predicate for imposing a twenty-five year mandatory sentence without parole may not be satisfied by cumulating a term of confinement of less than 180 days served post-conviction under the Division of Correction along with however many days have been credited for time spent in pretrial detention. This is true even though all time was served in relation to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>offense for which a defendant was previously charged and sentenced under \u00a7 286.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">The plain language of the statute \u201cas a result of a conviction\u201d is clear and unambiguous. Time spent in pretrial detention does not come within the 180-day requirement mandated by \u00a7 286(d) because such time is not \u201cas a result of a conviction\u201d but merely the consequence of a defendant\u2019s not posting bail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 348, 734 A.2d 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The Court of Appeals further noted that this interpretation of \u00a7 286(d)(1)\u00a9 was \u201cconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s desire to accord to a defendant a true opportunity and fair chance at rehabilitation before being sentenced under the enhanced penalty statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 734 A.2d 712. The Court explained that \u201c[m]any opportunities for rehabilitation that are bestowed upon inmates who have been sentenced to incarceration generally are not available to pretrial detainees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, without access to all the available programs, there was \u201cthe lesser potential for reducing recidivism in pretrial offenders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 734 A.2d 712. As an example, the Court pointed out that a federally funded program called High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, which was \u201cdesigned specifically to treat chronic substance-abusing, criminal offenders,\u201d was \u201croutinely limited to sentenced inmates and is not usually made available to pretrial detainees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 734 A.2d 712. Most notably, such a restriction was in place where Melgar spent his pretrial detention. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The Court of Appeals added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">In sum, the public policy goal of affording criminal offenders a meaningful chance at rehabilitation before subjecting them to mandatory, enhanced penalties and the incomplete availability of rehabilitative services to pretrial detainees underscore the purposefulness of the Legislature\u2019s choice of the phrase \u201cas a result of conviction.\u201d In our view, this distinct statutory phrase reflects the legislative intent that time in pretrial detention neither suffice nor in any degree supplement the statutory prerequisite of a minimum 180-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>day term of prior confinement for imposing an enhanced penalty upon a three-time drug offender under \u00a7 286.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">We therefore conclude that [Melgar\u2019s] 107 days of pretrial detention were not \u201cas a result of conviction\u201d and that cumulating those days to reach the statutory 180-day predicate under \u00a7 286(d)(l)(i) is inconsistent with both the plain language and legislative purpose of the statute as a whole. Because [Melgar] had not served at least one term of confinement of at least 180 days in a correctional institution as a result of a conviction of a previous violation of \u00a7 286, he was improperly sentenced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 352-53, 734 A.2d 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Under the plain language of C.L. \u00a7 14 \u2014 101(e)(l)(ii), appellant had to have served a term of confinement for her 1992 Baltimore City conviction before the mandatory ten-year term could be imposed. As explained in <em>Melgar, </em>appellant did not serve a term of confinement \u201cfor that conviction.\u201d Rather, she served only a term of pretrial incarceration because she could not, for whatever reason, post bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The State notes that, under Art. 27, \u00a7 286(d)(l)(i), Melgar could only be sentenced to the enhanced penalty if he had \u201cserved at least 1 term of confinement of at least 180 days in a correctional institution <em>as a result of </em>a conviction of a previous violation of this section or \u00a7 286A of this article\u00ae\u201d (Emphasis added.) In contrast, C.L. \u00a7 14-101(e)(l)(ii) requires that appellant had \u201cserved a term of confinement in a correctional facility <em>for that </em>conviction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The State also asserts that a time-served sentence meets the requirements of C.L. \u00a7 14 \u2014 101(e)(l)(ii) because, in contrast to Art. 27, \u00a7 286(d)(1)\u00ae, it does not require a specific period of time spent in confinement prior to the imposition of an enhanced sentence. The State thus claims that the reasoning of <em>Melgar </em>does not apply. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">In <em>State v. Polley, </em>97 Md.App. 192, 194, 627 A.2d 562 (1993), the defendant was convicted of distribution of cocaine and sentenced as a repeat offender under Art. 27, \u00a7 286(c) to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, the first ten to be served without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the possibility of parole. On appeal, the State asserted that the trial court erred in failing to impose the mandatory sentence of twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment without the possibility of parole under Art. 27, \u00a7 286(d) because Polley had two prior convictions and had served a term of at least 180 days. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 627 A.2d 562. Polley asserted that he had not served a term of confinement of 180 days when the most recent offense occurred, and referred this Court to cases interpreting other subsequent offender statutes, including Art. 27, \u00a7 643B, from which C.L. \u00a7 14-101 was derived without substantive change. <em>Id. </em>at 197-98, 627 A.2d 562. In considering those cases, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">Although the cases cited by Polley are persuasive only and are not binding upon this Court, we believe that \u00a7 643B, which is narrowly directed towards repeat offenders of violent crimes who, having been exposed to the correctional system three distinct times, have nevertheless failed to rehabilitate but have instead committed a fourth violent crime, is relevant to the issue in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The principles underlying the creation of both \u00a7 643B and \u00a7 286(d) are similar. We interpret that the Legislature intended that the sentences available under them encompass not only punishment objectives, as in \u00a7 286(c), but be enhanced because a defendant has committed another offense <em>after </em>having served an extended period of incarceration, thereby showing that the defendant has failed to take advantage of the opportunity to reform his or her conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A86\"><em>Id. </em>at 199, 627 A.2d 562 (first emphasis added). Accordingly, we may rely on the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis of Art. 27, \u00a7 286(d) in <em>Melgar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Further, C.L. \u00a7 14-101 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">(c) Fourth conviction of crime of violence. \u2014 (1) Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, on conviction for a fourth time of a crime of violence, a person who has served three separate terms of confinement in a correctional facility as a result of three separate convictions of any crime of violence shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>(2) Notwithstanding any other law, the provisions of this subsection are mandatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">(d) Third conviction of crime of violence. \u2014 (1) Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, on conviction for a third time of a crime of violence, a person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for the term allowed by law but not less than 25 years, if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">(1) has been convicted of a crime of violence on two prior separate occasions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">1. in which the second or succeeding crime is committed after there has been a charging document filed for the preceding occasion; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">. 2. for which the convictions do not arise from a single incident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">(ii) has served at least one term of confinement in a correctional facility as a result of a conviction of a crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">(2) The court may not suspend all or part of the mandatory 25-year sentence required under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">(3) A person sentenced under this subsection is not eligible for parole except in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 4-305 of the Correctional Services Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">(e) Second conviction of crime of violence. \u2014 (1) On conviction for a second time of a crime of violence committed on or after October 1, 1994, a person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for the term allowed by law, but not less than 10 years, if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-13\">(i) has been convicted on a prior occasion of a crime of violence, including a conviction for a crime committed before October 1,1994; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-14\">(i) served a term of confinement in a correctional facility for that conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>(2) The court may not suspend all or part of the mandatory 10-year sentence required under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">To draw the distinction between the language \u201cas a result of\u2019 and \u201cfor that\u201d advocated by the State would lead to absurd results because a defendant whom the State sought to have sentenced as a three- or four-time violent offender under C.L. \u00a7 14-101(c) and (d), which contain the \u201cas a result of\u2019 language, would not be considered to have served a term of confinement for a prior offense if the defendant had served only a term of pretrial incarceration. Yet, according to the State, a period of pretrial incarceration would bring the defendant within C.L. \u00a7 14-101(e), which contains the language \u201cfor that conviction.\u201d Moreover, the General Assembly clearly intended the same result for offenders falling within each subsection. It used the different language in subsection (e), which requires imposition of a mandatory penalty upon a second conviction for a violent offense, because only one prior conviction would trigger the application of this subsection. The General Assembly thus referred to the term of confinement \u201cfor that conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">We also disagree with the State\u2019s argument that a term of pretrial incarceration meet the requirements of C.L. \u00a7 14-101(e)(l)(ii), because the General Assembly did not require, in contrast to Art. 26, \u00a7 286(d)(1)\u00ae, that a specific period of time have been spent in confinement prior to imposition of the mandatory penalty. To adopt the State\u2019s position would require us to ignore the plain language of the statute, which requires that appellant\u2019s prior term of confinement be served \u201cfor that [1992 Baltimore City] conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The State also claims that appellant\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>arguments are offset by the off result that occurs if one is not given credit for time served pre-trial in the context of enhanced sentencing. Indeed, it is likely that accepting [appellant\u2019s] interpretation would require judges to ignore credit for time served in their discretionary sentencing decisions and could lead to imposition of longer sentences simply in order to facilitate the possibility of subsequent mandatory sentences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In general, credit for time served must be given. Md.Code (2001, 2007 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 6-218(b) of the Criminal Procedure Article states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">(b) In general. \u2014 (1) A defendant who is convicted and sentenced shall receive credit against and a reduction of the term of a definite or life sentence, or the minimum and maximum terms of an indeterminate sentence, for all time spent in the custody of a correctional facility, hospital, facility for persons with mental disorders, or other unit because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">(i) the charge for which the sentence is imposed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">(ii) the conduct on which the charge is based.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">In <em>Toney v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 690, 692, 782 A.2d 383 (2001) (citations omitted), this Court stated that Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a), the precursor to \u00a7 6-218 of the Criminal Procedure Article,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqA\">mandates that when an individual is in custody before trial and is subsequently convicted on the charge for which he or she was held, the time spent in custody prior to the imposition of sentence must be credited against the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>imposed. The intent of the statute is to insure that a defendant receives as much credit as possible for time spent in custody, consistent with constitutional and practical considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><em>See also Wilson v. Simms, </em>157 Md.App. 82, 94, 849 A.2d 88 (2004) (\u201cIn 2001, the legislature enacted \u00a7 6-218 of the Crim[inal] Procedure] Article, without substantive change from \u00a7 638C of Article 27. In 1974, the legislature enacted \u00a7 638C of Article 27 for the purpose of providing that, under certain circumstances, persons shall receive credit against their sentences for any time spent in custody.\u201d) (Citations omitted). A trial court thus <em>must </em>give a defendant credit for a period of pre-trial incarceration on the charge for which he or she was held; our holding in the case <em>sub judice </em>does not suggest otherwise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In sum, appellant did not serve a term of confinement for her 1992 Baltimore City conviction within the meaning of C.L. \u00a7 14 \u2014 101(e)(l)(ii). The circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">SENTENCE VACATED.

When the law prescribes a mandatory sentence because of a specified previous conviction, the State\u2019s Attorney shall serve a notice of the alleged prior conviction on the defendant or counsel at least 15 days before sentencing in circuit court or five days before sentencing in District Court. If the State\u2019s Attorney fails to give timely notice, the court shall postpone sentencing at least 15 days unless the defendant waives the notice requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The timeliness of the State's notice is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-9\">. In <em>Melgar, </em>the Court of Appeals supported its interpretation of the language of Art. 27 \u00a7 286(d)(l)(i) by reference to drug treatment programs that may be available to defendants following their convictions, but that are not available to those in pretrial detention. 355 Md. at 351, 734 A.2d 712. Because there is a close connection between drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>and crime, the treatment needed by a <em>violent offender </em>may include drug rehabilitation that, as explained in <em>Melgar, </em>may not be available to a pretrial detainee. <em>See generally State v.
