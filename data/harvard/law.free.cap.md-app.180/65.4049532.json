EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">Michael Raheem Duran, appellant, was charged, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, with indecent exposure in three separate criminal cases: CT06-2373X (one count), CT06-2374X (one count), and CT06-2375X (two counts).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, appellant pled guilty to count one in each case, and was sentenced to three years imprisonment, with all but 224 days suspended, in each case, the sentences to run concurrently. Appellant was also sentenced to five years supervised probation upon his release, with certain restrictions, including that he register as an \u201coffender\u201d under the provisions of Maryland Code (2002 Repl.Vol., Supp.2007) Criminal Procedure Article, Title 11, Subtitle 7. On appeal, appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s requirement that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>register as an offender as a condition of probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We shall vacate that condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">On March 9, 2007, appellant, who was detained prior to the trial date, appeared in court with counsel. The State informed the court that a plea had been negotiated, and the following transpired.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">THE STATE: Your Honor, the agreement is that he will plead guilty to Count 1 of each case. There are three cases. That each side is free to allocute for the suspended portion of the sentence, the maximum is three years on each case, and that he will be given credit. All of that will be suspended except for the time that he\u2019s served. He\u2019s been in jail since September 15th. And that as part of the plea agreement, through Parole and Probation, he will be evaluated as a sexual predator and he will follow all treatment recommendations if there are any from that evaluation. No contact with any of the victims. The State is asking for no unsupervised contact with any children under the age of 18 at this juncture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">THE STATE: I believe that\u2019s all of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">THE COURT: What is your full, complete and correct name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-12\">APPELLANT: Michael Raheem Duran.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">THE COURT: How old are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">APPELLANT: Thirty-eight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-15\">THE COURT: What\u2019s the last grade in school that you finished?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-16\">APPELLANT: High school diploma. High school graduate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>THE COURT: So you read, write and understand the English language?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">THE COURT: Are you in good health mentally and physically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">THE COURT: Are you under the influence right now of any alcohol, any drugs or any medication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">APPELLANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">THE COURT: Your attorney indicates that you want to enter pleas of guilty to Count 1 in each of these three indictments; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">THE COURT: Have you discussed the matter with your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">Hi * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-14\">THE COURT: Do you understand the nature of the offenses to which you\u2019re pleading guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-15\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-16\">THE COURT: Indecent exposure means exactly that. That you exposed your penis in this case \u2014 in each case to three different persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-17\">Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-18\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7K\">THE COURT: Do you understand that once I accept your plea of guilty, the only thing left to be done is to sentence you and <em>I\u2019ve agreed to sentence you according to the agreement your attorney reached with the State\u2019s Attorney and sentence you to no more than a guideline sentence as to the executed part of the sentence? </em>Both sides are free to allocute as to the amount of the suspended sentence and the period of probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-20\">\n<em>We\u2019re going to order a Presentence Investigation which will include an evaluation as to whether or not you are a sexual predator by Parole and Probation. The conditions of your </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\n<em>probation will be that you\u2019re required to follow their recommendations as to treatment. That you are to have no contact with any of the individuals named in these indictments, and that you\u2019re to have no unsupervised contact with any child under the age of 18.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">\n<em>Is that your understanding of the plea agreement?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS7\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">THE COURT: Did you understand all of the rights I told you about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">THE COURT: Is it your intention to give up those rights and enter a plea of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">THE COURT: Have a seat. Listen to the State\u2019s Attorney tell me what happened in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">Subsequently, the State read into the record the agreed upon statement of facts, as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-13\">Had this matter gone to trial witnesses would have testified to the following: That on September 1st of the year 2006 at approximately 9:05 in the morning somewhere at the intersection of Plata Street and Megan Drive in Clinton, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, this Defendant ... approached Jasmin H[.] who was on her way to school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-14\">He was driving a greenish-colored 1995 Toyota Corolla, and he asked Jasmin H[.] if she knew the location of Surrattsville High School. Jasmin H[.] was on her way to middle school. She was age 12, 13 approximately. When this Defendant called Jasmin H[.] over, she observed the Defendant was not wearing any pants, that he was fondling his penis. Jasmin H[.] then walked away and notified the police of the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-15\">During the course of the investigation, similar instances in the area were noted. The victim in this case provided a description of the vehicle and the Maryland registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>plate number CBM-821. A computer check of that license plate number revealed that it did belong to this ... Defendant\u2019s mother. This Defendant was eventually located and was advised of his rights per Miranda. He waived his rights, and he made a confession involving this incident with Jasmin H[.] who was 13 years of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">Your Honor, this victim was shown a six-person photo identification and identified this Defendant in the photo spread as the one who had called her over and exposed his penis to her. All of those events occurred in Prince George\u2019s County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">Witnesses would have testified that on September 4th of the year 2006 that victim, Ciara W[.], was also walking to middle school when this Defendant approached her, also in Prince George\u2019s County. He approached her at about ten minutes to nine in the morning. And he pulled his vehicle alongside of where this victim was walking and asked if she knew where Surrattsville High School was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">The victim said that she looked over and observed this Defendant. He didn\u2019t have any pants on, and he was exposing himself to her. This victim fled, and this Defendant also fled in the listed vehicle. She indicated that she had seen this Defendant prior to this exposing himself to kids as they were walking to school. The police responded and checked the area with negative results at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">This victim was shown a six-person photo spread on September 21st of the year 2006 and identified this Defendant as the person who had exposed himself to her while she was walking to middle school on September 4th of the year 2006. In CT 06-2375X, September 14th of the year 2006, the 6000 block of Hil Mar Drive in Forestville, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, this Defendant, who again would be identified as Michael Raheem Duran, approached Shaunice R[J. She was on her way to school, to middle school. He exposed himself by touching his penis. His pants were down to his ankles as he was sitting in his vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">Again, all of the victims described a similar vehicle, Toyota Corolla. This Defendant again used the same way to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the children to the car and that was he was asking for directions to a certain school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\">On September 15th, the day after this, the Defendant was arrested. He waived his rights per Miranda. He gave a ten-page written statement, and in that statement he did admit to exposing himself to these children. He also admitted that he was a security guard at the Smithsonian Institute or he had just resigned that job days before and that he was in the process of applying for and becoming a Montgomery County police officer. All events occurred in Prince George\u2019s County. That would be the proffer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The court accepted appellant\u2019s plea as freely, voluntarily, and intelligently made, found that there was a factual basis for the plea, and entered the guilty pleas as to Count 1 in each case. The court also ordered a Presentence Investigation, to be conducted prior to sentencing. The Presentence Investigation report submitted to the court recommended that appellant \u201cbe placed on a lengthy period of supervised probation with the following special conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">1) No unsupervised contact with any female under the age of eighteen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">2) Sex Offender treatment as directed by the assigned probation agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">3) Maryland Sex Offender Registry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">4) Mandatory Psychiatric Evaluation and Treatment as directed by the assigned probation agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">5) Pay Parole and Probation Monthly Supervision Fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">At sentencing, on April 27, 2007, the following transpired, relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">THE COURT: All right. Was there a plea agreement in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">THE STATE: Your Honor, the plea agreement was actually just a free to allocute, and I think the only agreement was some of the terms of probation, but it was a free to allocute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: I believe it was free to allocute within Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">THE STATE: Right. Within Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">THE COURT: So, what is the State recommending?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">THE STATE:____We would like, as part of his sentence, five years of supervised probation. They are also asking for a lengthy period of supervised probation. No unsupervised contact with any female under the age of 18. The [S]tate is asking for \u2014 and this was already agreed upon \u2014 evaluation and treatment as a sexual predator. That was part of the conditions agreed upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">\n<em>The State is also asking that this Defendant register as a sex offender. That is a strong recommendation from this Presentence Investigation, and it\u2019s not very often seen in cases where it is not a mandatory registration.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">Also, the Presentence Investigation, and the State is joining in the request, for mandatory psychiatric evaluation and treatment as directed by the probation agent. Supervision fees, I will leave that up to the [cjourt. That is what the PSI, the Presentence Investigation, is requesting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">Your Honor, the reason why the State is asking the [cjourt to follow the recommendation of the Presentence Investigation in this matter in terms very specifically of the sexual registration, the [cjourt will recall that this was not just one isolated case, but it was three cases that had very disturbing similarities. And I will say, just for purposes of sentencing, and it was given in the discovery, there were other children involved, but that their parents didn\u2019t come forward. So, they were not charged as part of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">But, Your Honor, these actions are disturbing in the type that, in this particular field, indicate issues. And the State feels that this Defendant should be watched, and there should be some accountability for safety of children in the community. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the requirement that appellant register as an offender, and the following transpired.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: I believe as far as recommendations on Page 3, 1, 2, 4, and 5, we don\u2019t have any issues with, and were part of the agreement. As to the sex offender registry, we do object. And I don\u2019t believe that there is any authority under the sex offender registry statute to order [appellant] to register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-4\">The conditions in that, and I believe it\u2019s Criminal Procedure Article 11-701, I think, 704, and they list the definitions of people who have to register. And the definitions are based upon specific crimes committed, and indecent exposure is not one of the enumerated offenses. However, there is a catchall that was discussed in <em>Cain v. State, </em>386 Maryland 320[, 872 A.2d 681 (2005) ]. And in that case, a person was charged with various sex offenses and second degree assault. And the Court of Appeals held that in the catchall exception, which I believe is 11 \u2014 701(d)(7), and that\u2019s, had been convicted of a crime that involves conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against a person under the age of 18 years, and they held that crime, that by its nature, refers only to the elements of the offense. And indecent exposure, I don\u2019t believe\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">THE COURT: What do you mean, refers only to the elements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Basically, as they held, that second degree assault is just an offensive touching and you can offensively touch anyone\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">THE COURT: But you can\u2019t look behind the crime? Is that what\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Yes. Yes. You can\u2019t look to the Defendant\u2019s actions, you look to the crime itself. I guess, the crime as charged. And, so, they also approve\u2014 they also cite with approval a case from Hawaii, and I don\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t look up the Hawaii indecent exposure statute. But in the Hawaii case they said indecent exposure is a crime that does not require registration. And that case is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>THE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t see how indecent exposure can\u2019t be a crime of a sexual nature\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: But it\u2019s a crime\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">THE COURT: \u2014 because it involves exposing his penis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: That may be true. But to be \u2014 it also has to be a crime that, by its nature, involves someone under the age of 18. And indecent exposure does not involve, by its nature, exposing yourself to someone under the age of 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">THE STATE: I disagree with the second part, that it has to \u2014 the crime involves a crime of a sexual nature, and exposing yourself is a type of paraphilia, which is a sexual\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">THE COURT: I mean, I think that case stands for the proposition that if somebody negotiates a plea, or if a jury convicts someone of a second degree assault, which, by its nature, is not sexual, that\u2019s something different. But indecent exposure, I have no problem finding that is an offense that is sexual in nature. And while it does not require necessarily that the audience be under 18 years of age, in this case, that was, in fact, the case, that we\u2019re dealing with children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">So, by its nature in this case, I think it fits. And I don\u2019t think there is \u2014 well, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any distinction made statutorily between an adult of a child, which would mean that you could expose yourself to millions of school children and not have to register, which makes absolutely no sense. But nice argument, counsel. Anything else you want to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:____ I guess the only other argument I would make is that I believe that all the terms of the agreement were put on the record, and sex offender registration was not one of the things that [appellant] agreed to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Subsequently, appellant was sentenced, as recited above. With regard to the terms of probation, the court ordered the following.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">You will be placed on five years active supervised probation with the following special conditions. First, that you have absolutely no unsupervised contact with any female under the age of 18. Two, that he receive sex offender treatment as directed by Parole and Probation, and follow all their directions in that regard. That he have a mandatory psychiatric evaluation and treatment as directed; <em>and, lastly, that he does, in fact, register at the Maryland Sex Offender Registry. I think, as I indicated earlier, it is appropriate given the nature of the offense and the intended audience.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred by requiring him to register as an offender because (1) that requirement \u201crepresented an additional requirement falling outside of the boundaries of the plea agreement reached by the parties,\u201d and (2) that in any event, \u201cthe crime of indecent exposure is not one of the enumerated crimes to which the registration requirements found in [Maryland Code (2001 Repl.Vol., Supp. 2007), \u00a7 ll-701(d) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u2018C.P.\u2019) ], are applicable.\u201d Thus, appellant requests that the requirement that he register as an offender as a condition of probation \u201cbe stricken\u201d from his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">As to appellant\u2019s first argument, the State responds that \u201cby agreeing to be evaluated by the Department of Parole and Probation to determine his status as a sexual predator, [appellant] implicitly agreed to the registration requirement if recommended to do so as a result of the evaluation.\u201d In the alternative, the State avers that \u201cbecause the order to register is not punitive,\u201d pursuant to <em>Young v. State, </em>370 Md. 686, 806 A.2d 233 (2002), the \u201ccourt\u2019s order in this instance was collateral to [appellant\u2019s] plea agreement and does not violate the terms of his agreement.\u201d With regard to appellant\u2019s second argument, the State suggests that \u201cit is clear that the ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>crime of indecent exposure includes conduct that is, by its nature, sexual conduct,\u201d and in this case appellant \u201ccommitted that conduct against a minor\u201d; thus, pursuant to C.P. \u00a7 11-701(d)(7) and \u00a7 11-704, appellant \u201cwas subject to the registration requirement.\u201d The State also suggests that, \u201ceven if [appellant] is correct and the registration condition is illegal because indecent exposure is not a qualifying offense, [appellant] is still not entitled to a simple release from the obligation of registration\u201d because the plea agreement \u201cclearly contemplated\u201d that appellant be \u201cevaluated and treated, if necessary, as a sexual offender so as to reduce the threat to the community of the consequences of his release from incarceration,\u201d and \u201c[s]imply striking the requirement that [appellant] register would frustrate the \u2018parties\u2019 expectations\u2019 with regard to the agreement.\u201d Thus, the State opines that the \u201c \u2018fairest remedy\u2019 in this case would be to rescind the agreement and place \u2018the parties in their original positions, unprejudiced by the mistake of law\u2019 attendant to requiring [appellant] to register when he had not been convicted of a qualifying offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We are unpersuaded by the State\u2019s arguments, and shall explain, reversing the order in which the issues were presented by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">A. <em>Indecent Exposure and Registration Requirements for Certain Offenders</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">In Maryland, the crime of indecent exposure is a common law offense. <em>See Wisneski v. State, </em>398 Md. 578, 921 A.2d 273 (2007). At common law, the offense necessitated \u201copen and notorious lewdness,\u201d and was a misdemeanor \u201coffense against morality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 921 A.2d 273. There are three elements of the crime of indecent exposure: (1) a public exposure; (2) made wilfully and intentionally, as opposed to inadvertently or accidentally; (3) which was observed, or was likely to have been observed, by one or more persons, as opposed to performed in secret, or hidden from the view of others. <em>Id. </em>at 593, 921 A.2d 273. Today, the penalty for the crime of indecent exposure is set forth by statute, specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Maryland Code, (2002 RepLVol., Supp.2007), \u00a7 11-107 of the Criminal Law Article, and provides: \u201cA person convicted of indecent exposure is guilty of a misdemeanor and is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 3 years or a fine not exceeding $1,000 or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Maryland\u2019s registration of offenders statute is set forth in Title 11, subtitle 7, of the Criminal Procedure Article. C.P. \u00a7 11-704, entitled \u201cRegistration required,\u201d provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 A person <em>shall register </em>with the person\u2019s supervising authority if the person is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">(1) a child sexual offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">(2) an offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">(3) a sexually violent offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">(4) a sexually violent predator[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">\u2756 * \u2756</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">As we have no difficulty concluding that (1), (3), and (4), do not require registration for the crime of indecent exposure, we turn to the definition of \u201coffender,\u201d pursuant to C.P. \u00a7 11-701(d), to determine if it requires registration.

It is not clear, however, whether indecent exposure is a crime pursuant to (d)(7), that \u201cby its nature is a sexual offense,\u201d and, moreover, that is \u201cagainst a person under the age of 18 years.\u201d We conclude that it is not, and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">In <em>Cain v. State, </em>386 Md. 320, 872 A.2d 681 (2005), the Court of Appeals considered the issue of who must register as an offender pursuant to C.P. \u00a7 11 \u2014 701(d)(7). In that case, the appellant was charged with one count of child abuse, two counts of third degree sexual offense, and one count of second degree assault. The victim of the criminal conduct was a minor. Cain pled guilty solely to the second degree assault charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Part of the plea agreement was that the State would request the court to order Cain to register as an offender, and the defense was free to argue that the registration statute was inapplicable. The court sentenced Cain to five-years impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>onment, with five years of supervised probation to follow, with a condition that Cain register as an offender under the registration statute. <em>Id. </em>at 323-24, 872 A.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The statutory crime of assault in the second degree consists of the common law offenses of assault, assault and battery, and battery, and has been defined as \u201ceither [ ] \u2018an attempt to commit a battery\u2019 \u201d which is \u201cthe unlawful application of force to the person of another,\u201d or \u201can intentional placing of another in apprehension of receiving an immediate battery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, n. 11, 872 A.2d 681 (citing <em>Snowden v. State, </em>321 Md. 612, 617, 583 A.2d 1056 (1991)). Cain argued that his conviction for second degree assault did not fall within the definition of \u201coffender\u201d under C.P. \u00a7 ll-701(d) because assault was not an enumerated offense requiring registration, and, likewise, the elements of assault did not come within any of the subsections. The State conceded that second degree assault was not an enumerated crime, but maintained that Cain should be required to register as an offender \u201cbecause the underlying facts establishing the assault were sexual in nature, [against a person under the age of 18 years], mandating registration, rather than the elements of the offense.\u201d C.P. \u00a7 11 \u2014 701(d)(7); <em>Cain, </em>386 Md. at 329, 872 A.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In <em>Cain, </em>when interpreting (d)(7), the stated issue was whether the elements of the crime for which Cain was convicted govern, or whether the underlying conduct governs. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 872 A.2d 681. At the beginning of its opinion, the Court expressly stated its holding as, \u201c... a person convicted of second degree assault is not required to register as an offender under the Registration of Offenders statute, unless the elements of the crime contain reference to a sexual offense against a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 872 A.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In its discussion, the Court engaged in a lengthy review of the history and legislative intent of the registration laws, which we shall recite below, in relevant part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">.... In formulating the language of Section 11 \u2014 701(d)(7), the General Assembly chose the words to define an \u201coffender\u201d as one \u201cconvicted of a <em>crime </em>that involves conduct that</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>by its nature is a sexual offense\u201d against a minor. Use of this language suggests that the elements of the crime for which one stands convicted is that to which we must look to determine whether registration is appropriate. To determine otherwise, would be to read the word \u201ccrime\u201d out of the definition and rely solely on the offender\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">This interpretation of the plain meaning of the definition at issue finds support in the statute\u2019s legislative history informed by the federal [Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Program, 42 U.S.C., \u00a7 14071 (2000) ] act\u2019s interpretation. The Maryland Offender Registration Act was first introduced as Senate Bill 605 and originally did not contain a specific category of \u201coffenders.\u201d <em>See </em>1st Reading, S.B. 605 (Jan. 31,1997). The DPSCS[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] submitted a letter to the Senate stating that Senate Bill 605 \u201cwould not bring Maryland into full compliance with the Wetterling Act and subsequent U.S. Department of Justice guidelines ... due, in part, to the bill\u2019s deficiency in specifying all of the crimes against minors covered by Wetterling.\u201d <em>See </em>DPSCS Comments on S.B. 605 (1997) (Feb. 27,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Included among the offenses in the Wetterling Act that Senate bill 605 did not contain was a <em>crime consisting of any conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against a minor. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071(a)(2)(A)(vii) (2004 Supp.), as amended by Pub.L. 104-145, \u00a7 2, 110 Stat. 1345 (1996); Pub.L. 104-236, \u00a7\u00a7 3-7, 110 Stat. 3096, 3097 (1996) (emphasis added [in original]). On April 4, 1996, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) promulgated guidelines interpreting the definition of criminal offenses that consist of conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against a minor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">Clause (vii) covers <em>offenses </em>consisting of any conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against a minor. <em>This clause is intended to insure uniform coverage of convictions under statutes defining sex offenses in which the status of the victim as a minor is an element of an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>offense, such as specially defined child molestation offenses, and other offenses prohibiting sexual activity with underage persons. </em>States can comply with this clause by including convictions under these statutes uniformly in the registration requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><em>See </em>DOJ, Final Guidelines for the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act (\u201cFinal Guidelines\u201d), 61 Fed.Reg. 15110 (1996), amended by 62 Fed.Reg. 572 (Jan. 5,1999) (emphasis added [in original]). Therefore, the <em>elements </em>of the offense were the gravamen of the interpretive guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In an effort to bring Maryland\u2019s registration act in compliance with the Wetterling Act, the House adopted a companion bill, House Bill 343, to broaden the scope of the registration law by changing the term \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d to \u201coffender.\u201d <em>See </em>Floor Report, H.B. 343 (1997). The bill file for House Bill 343 contains copies of both the Wetterling Act and the DOJ\u2019s Final Guidelines, indicating the General Assembly\u2019s awareness of both in drafting the amendments to Maryland\u2019s registration laws. <em>See </em>Bill File, H.B. 343 (1997). The Floor Report for House Bill 343 stated, \u201c[t]his bill is designed to bring the State into compliance with that part of the [Wetterling Act] dealing with [child offenders and] sex offender ... [and] expand[s] the types of offenders required to register to include offenders convicted of ... <em>crime[s] that involve[] conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against an individual under the age of 18 years.\u201d </em>Floor Report, H.B. 343 (emphasis added [in original]). On April 5, 1997, House Bill 343 was adopted and set forth the types of crimes that required an offender to register. <em>See </em>H.B. 343. Subsequently, on April 7, 1997, Senate Bill 605 was amended to include the category of \u201coffenders\u201d as provided by the final adopted version of House Bill 343. <em>See </em>Amendment to S.B. 605 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Obviously, the definition of \u201coffender\u201d in the Maryland statute is derived from the corresponding definition in the Wetterling Act. As explained <em>supra, </em>the U.S. Attorney</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>General\u2019s Final Guidelines explained that the Wetterling Act\u2019s provision relating to crimes involving conduct that is inherently a sexual offense was intended to insure uniform coverage of convictions under statutes defining sex offenses and was based upon the elements of the offense. <em>See </em>Final Guidelines, 61 Fed.Reg. at 15112.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><em>Cain, </em>386 Md. at 336-38, 872 A.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Thus, the Court concluded that Cain was not required to register as an \u201coffender\u201d under C.P. \u00a7 11 \u2014 701(d)(7), as the elements of second degree assault for which Cain was convicted, as quoted above, did not contain reference to a sexual offense against a minor, and did not \u201ccontemplate conduct that by its nature involves a sexual offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 872 A.2d 681. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">In order to qualify a person as an offender pursuant to Section 11 \u2014 701(d)(7), there must be something more than an assault. <em>The statute requires that sexual conduct that involves an underage person also must be presented within the crime charged and which the person stands convicted. </em>To hold otherwise would expose individuals to possible registration that have been convicted of crimes that do not include elements related to sexual conduct with a minor, and would interpret the statute in a manner inconsistent with the General Assembly\u2019s intended coverage of qualified \u201coffenders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Although the Court in <em>Cain </em>dealt solely with the issue of whether a conviction for the crime of second degree assault required registration as an \u201coffender,\u201d in doing so, it compared the holdings of other state courts, and found them to be consistent with its view that individuals convicted of crimes of which the elements do not inherently and facially prohibit conduct constituting a sexual offense, are not required to register as sex offenders. <em>Id. </em>at 339, 872 A.2d 681. Particularly noteworthy here was the Court\u2019s citation to a 2003 case decide by the Supreme Court of Hawaii, <em>State v. Chun, </em>102 Hawai\u2019i 383, 76 P.3d 935 (2003). In that case, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>pled no contest to a charge of indecent exposure, which apparently occurred in the presence of a minor, and the trial court ordered him to register as a \u201csex offender\u201d under Hawaii\u2019s registration statute pertaining to criminal offenses comprising sexual conduct toward a minor. <em>Id. </em>at 936-37.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On appeal, the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that the crime of indecent exposure \u201cdoes not constitute an offense that entails \u2018criminal sexual conduct\u2019 and, consequently, that persons convicted of indecent exposure are not \u2018sex offenders\u2019 \u201d for purposes of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 942. In reaching its conclusion, the court explained that \u201can offense comprises \u2018criminal sexual conduct toward a minor\u2019 if, and only if, the <em>elements of the offense </em>generically describe \u2018criminal sexual conduct toward a minor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added). The court noted that the \u201celements of indecent exposure ... do not entail \u2018conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against a minor,\u2019 \u201d because the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Final Guidelines interpreting the Wetterling Act, upon which the Hawaii statute was taken verbatim, provided that the provision applied to \u201csex offenses in which the status of the victim as a minor is an element of [the] offense,\u201d which indecent exposure did not include. <em>Id. </em>The court noted that \u201c[accordingly, if a person\u2019s actions entail criminal sexual conduct toward a minor, the prosecution should charge the person with an offense that includes criminal sexual conduct among its elements if it wishes to implicate the provisions of [Hawaii\u2019s sex offender registration statute.].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">As indicated above, in the present case, the crime of indecent exposure is not one of the enumerated crimes requiring registration. Moreover, here, as in <em>Cain, </em>the elements of the crime \u2014 in this case a public exposure, made wilfully and intentionally, and which was observed, or was likely to have been observed, by one or more persons \u2014 do not contain refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ence to a sexual offense against a minor, and do not contemplate conduct that by its nature involves a sexual offense. The crime of indecent exposure can be committed by an exhibitionist. It is a general intent crime and includes an innumerable variety of offenses, ranging from \u201creprehensible to the arguably innocuous,\u201d <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 709, 436 A.2d 906 (1981), or from \u201cmoral depravity\u201d to \u201cmomentary poor judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710, 436 A.2d 906. Its elements do not include sexual contact, a sexual act, sexual arousal, gratification, or any other element normally associated with a sexual offense. Consequently, appellant could not have been required to register as an \u201coffender\u201d under the statute. We now turn our attention to the plea agreement to determine whether the court\u2019s imposition of registration as a term of probation was contemplated by the agreement, or whether it was an \u201cadditional requirement\u201d; and thus, cannot be enforced for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">B. <em>Plea Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">At the outset, we note that whether a trial court has violated the terms of a plea agreement is a question of law which we review <em>de novo. Tweedy v. State, </em>380 Md. 475, 482, 845 A.2d 1215 (2004). We construe the terms of a plea agreement according to the reasonable understanding of the defendant when he pled guilty. <em>Id. </em>\u201cBecause plea bargains are similar to contracts, \u2018contract principles should generally guide the determination of the proper remedy of a broken plea agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Solorzano v. State, </em>397 Md. 661, 668, 919 A.2d 652 (2007) (quoting <em>State v. Parker, </em>334 Md. 576, 604, 640 A.2d 1104 (1994)). \u201cThus, when either the prosecution breaches its promise with respect to a plea agreement, or the court breaches a plea agreement that it agreed to abide by, the defendant is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Solorzano, </em>397 Md. at 667-68, 919 A.2d 652; <em>see also Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971) (\u201c[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d). \u201c[Wlhere the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>plea agreement is breached, and it was not caused by the defendant, the general remedy for the breach is to permit the defendant to choose either specific performance or withdrawal of the plea.\u201d <em>Solorzano, </em>397 Md. at 668, 919 A.2d 652 (citing <em>Tweedy, </em>380 Md. at 488, 845 A.2d 1215) (other citations omitted); <em>see also Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 263, 92 S.Ct. 495 (noting that where a defendant has not received the benefit of a plea bargain, the defendant can either have the bargain specifically enforced, or withdraw his plea of guilty.). \u201cContract principles alone, however, are not enough to resolve disputes over the proper interpretation of a plea bargain.\u201d <em>Solorzano, </em>397 Md. at 668, 919 A.2d 652 (other citations omitted). Indeed, \u201c[d]ue process concerns for fairness and the adequacy of procedural safeguards guide any interpretation of a court approved plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 261-62, 92 S.Ct. 495).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">To be valid, a plea of guilty must be made voluntarily and intelligently, <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), with knowledge of the direct consequences of the plea. <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970). To ensure that a plea is valid, Maryland Rule 4-242(c) requires that, before accepting a guilty plea, the trial court must determine, upon an examination of the defendant on the record in open court, that (1) the defendant is pleading voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, (2) there is a factual basis for the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Maryland Rule 4-243 sets forth the procedures to be followed when the State and a defendant have entered into a plea agreement. The Rule provides, in pertinent part, as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">(c) Agreements of sentence, disposition, or other judicial action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">(1) Presentation to the court. If a plea agreement has been reached pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(F) of this Rule for a plea of guilty or nolo contendere which contemplates a particular sentence, disposition, or other judicial action, the defense counsel and the State\u2019s Attorney shall advise the judge of the terms of the agreement when the defendant pleads.

Moreover, \u201ca sentencing court cannot modify a plea agreement unilaterally after a defendant has entered a guilty plea in reliance on the terms of that agreement.\u201d <em>Tweedy, </em>380 Md. at 486, 845 A.2d 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In the present case, the court accepted appellant\u2019s guilty plea on March 9, 2007, after determining that appellant freely, voluntarily, and intelligently entered into the agreement. The agreement, as recited by the State at the plea hearing, was that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">[Appellant] ... will plead guilty to Count 1 of each case. There are three cases. That each side is free to allocute for the suspended portion of the sentence, the maximum is three years on each case, and that he will be given credit. All of that will be suspended except for the time that he\u2019s served. He\u2019s been in jail since September 15th. <em>And that as part of the plea agreement, through Parole and Probation, he will be evaluated as a sexual predator and he will follow all treatment recommendations if there are any from that evaluation. </em>No contact with any of the victims. The State is asking for no unsupervised contact with any children under the age of 18 at this juncture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The court reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">... I\u2019ve agreed to sentence you according to the agreement your attorney reached with the State\u2019s Attorney and sentence you to no more than a guideline sentence as to the executed part of the sentence^] Both sides are free to allocute as to the amount of the suspended sentence and the period of probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>We\u2019re going to order a Presentence Investigation which will include an evaluation as to whether or not you are a sexual predator by Parole and Probation.

The court was free to accept or reject the plea or to defer decision as to its approval or rejection until after the pre-sentence proceedings and investigation were conducted as directed by it. The court did not defer its decision until after the presentence investigation, however, and chose instead to accept appellant\u2019s plea, at the March 9 plea hearing, on the terms set forth above. Registration as an offender was not one of those terms.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">Nevertheless, at sentencing, the State argued that ... this Defendant [should be required to] register as a sex offender.

On appeal, however, the State, impliedly conceding that indecent exposure is not a \u201cqualifying offense\u201d requiring registration, argues that, nevertheless, the plea agreement \u201cclearly contemplated\u201d that appellant be \u201cevaluated and treated, if necessary, as a sexual offender so as to reduce the threat to the community of the consequences of his release from incarceration .... \u201d Presumably, then, the State includes registration as an offender under the umbrella of \u201cevaluation and treatment.\u201d We disagree, and in any event, even if we were to assume that the agreement was ambiguous in that regard, the ambiguity would be construed in favor of appellant. <em>See Solorzano, </em>397 Md. at 673, 919 A.2d 652, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Registration as an offender was not one of the terms of the plea agreement. The State argues that, nevertheless, appellant is only entitled to a rescission of the plea agreement, not to a striking of the registration requirement. The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Rojas v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 440, 450 A.2d 490 (1982), is misplaced. In that case, as part of a plea agreement, the court imposed what the parties later learned was an illegal condition, <em>ie., </em>Rojas agreed to relinquish his resident alien status and not oppose deportation. After concluding that the condition was illegal because the federal government has exclusive authority over deportation, this Court concluded that it was unfair to permit Rojas to obtain the benefit of his agreement by leaving his suspended sentence intact but not have to give up his resident alien status. Consequently, we rescinded the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 446, 450 A.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The facts in the case before us are totally dissimilar. In this case, there was no mutual mistake of law or fact. The agreement did not include a registration requirement in the first instance. Thus, appellant is entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>CONDITION OF PROBATION REQUIRING REGISTRATION AS AN OFFENDER UNDER MARYLAND CODE, CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ARTICLE, TITLE 11, SUBTITLE 7 VACATED.

The Court of Appeals noted that \"Hawaii\u2019s sex offender registration statute mandating registration of an \u201coffender\u201d is the same as Maryland\u2019s definition of \"offender\u201d under Section ll-701(d) of the Criminal Procedure Article.

We have not had occasion to decide whether required registration by certain offenders is a direct or collateral consequence of a plea of guilty, <em>see Dawson v.

State, </em>370 Md. 686, 806 A.2d 233 (2002). We need not decide whether registration is a direct or a collateral consequence of a guilty plea here either, as the issue is not whether appellant\u2019s plea was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>knowing and voluntary because a registration requirement was applicable and was not disclosed to him. In this case, a registration requirement was not part of the plea agreement, <em>see infra, </em>and as we have concluded, the crime of indecent exposure is not within the registration statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
