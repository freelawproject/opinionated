We shall hold that the statutory cap as set forth in Md.Code. (2006 RepLVol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., sections 11-108 and 11-109 applies to all actions for personal injury and wrongful death, including actions based on statutory or constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Kelly Green (\u201cKelly\u201d), a minor, by her mother and next friend, Celestine Green, (\u201cMs.Green\u201d) appeals a decision that was later reflected in an order to apply Maryland\u2019s statutory cap on non-economic damages to a jury verdict entered against Stanley Rochkind, N.B.S., Inc., Charles Runkles and Dear Management, Inc. (collectively \u201cappellees\u201d). The verdict was entered in a lawsuit Ms. Green filed against appellees for injuries Kelly suffered due to her exposure to lead-based paint while living at 1547 Montpelier Street in Baltimore, Maryland. Appellees\u2019 conduct in failing to maintain the property resulted in their being found liable for common law negligence as well as for violations of Maryland\u2019s Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCPA\u201d). <em>See </em>Md.Code., (1975, 2005 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article. Over Ms. Green\u2019s objection, the verdict was reduced from $2,300,000 to $515,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Ms. Green gave birth to Kelly on January 16, 1995. Ms. Green had been living at 1547 Montpelier Street for approximately eight months prior to Kelly\u2019s birth. When Ms. Green moved into the house there was chipping paint around the window frames in the bedrooms as well as around several doorways within the home. Paint would fall to the floor whenever Ms. Green lifted the windows or closed the doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Kelly was diagnosed with having an elevated lead level in November 1995, when she was ten months old. After appellees were informed of Kelly\u2019s condition, appellees\u2019 agents failed to scrape off all the lead based paint and instead painted over some of it. Due to the condition of the house and Kelly\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>diagnosis, Ms. Green and Kelly moved to another location in November 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Ms. Green, as Kelly\u2019s next friend, brought suit against the appellees in the summer of 2002. The complaint alleged that appellees were negligent in their ownership and/or management of 1547 Montpelier Street and, due to their negligence, Kelly was exposed to chipping, flaking and peeling lead-based paint. The complaint also alleged that appellees violated the CPA because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">by marketing, and otherwise making available to the public for lease ... [they] impliedly represented that the [Montpelier home] was in compliance with the [Baltimore] Housing Code and other Public Local Laws of Baltimore City and statutes of the state of Maryland and of the United States and thus was fit for human habitation and contained no flaking, loose or peeling paint or plaster, or lead based paint accessible to children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">According to the complaint, appellees \u201cknew the dwelling was not fit for human habitation and contained flaking, loose <em>or </em>peeling paint or plaster or lead-based paint accessible to children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">A jury trial commenced on March 19, 2007. Dr. John F. Rosen was called as an expert witness by appellant. He established that the Center for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d) considers a child with blood levels of 10 or more micrograms per deciliter (\u201cmg/dl\u201d) of lead to be lead poisoned. In Dr. Rosen\u2019s opinion, however, a child may lose IQ points even if that child has a blood lead level of less than 7.5 mg/dl.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Kelly\u2019s blood was tested seven times for the presence of lead. Those tests yielded the following results:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATqn\">Date Lead Level</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">11/15/1995 9 mg/dl</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeq\">01/10/1996 8 mg/dl</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHe\">09/26/1996 20 mg/dl</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqF\">12/02/1996 15 mg/dl</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APP\">12/1996 12 mg/dl</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aptm\">01/01/1997 8 mg/dl</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adhr\">09/13/1997 8 mg/dl</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Based upon Kelly\u2019s blood level values and upon peer review literature, Dr. Rosen opined that her exposure to lead caused Kelly to lose 10 IQ points.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">At the close of the entire case, the court granted judgment in favor of Kelly\u2019s mother and against the appellees as to liability based on common law negligence and violation of the CPA. The only issues submitted to the jury were (1) whether Kelly suffered any injury due to appellees\u2019 wrongful conduct and, (2) if so, the amount of non-economic damages she suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">After the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>reduced the $2,800,000 verdict to $515,000, appellant filed a Motion for Reconsideration and/or Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment arguing that the statutory cap was not applicable to the CPA claim and, alternatively, even if the cap was applicable to all claims, the appropriate cap should have been $530,000. Both motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Appellant argues that the damages cap only applies to common law tort actions. This is important, appellant maintains, because an action brought by a plaintiff seeking damages for personal injury as a result of a violation of the CPA is not a common law tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Section 11-108 of the Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., provides, insofar as here pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">(a) (1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">(2)(i) \u201cNoneconomic damages\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">1. In an action for personal injury, pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement, loss of consortium, or other nonpecuniary injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">2. In an action for wrongful death, mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of society, companionship, comfort, protection, care, marital care, parental care, filial care, attention, advice, counsel, training, guidance, or education, or other noneconomic damages authorized under Title 3, Subtitle 9 of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">(b) (1) <em>In any action for damages for personal injury in which the cause of action arises on or after July 1, 1986, </em>an award for noneconomic damages may not exceed $350,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">(2) (i) Except as provided in paragraph (3)(ii) of this subsection, <em>in any action for damages for personal injury </em>or wrongful death in which the cause of action arises on or after October 1, 1994, an award for noneconomic damages may not exceed $500,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">(ii) The limitation on noneconomic damages provided under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall increase by $15,000 on October 1 of each year beginning on October 1, 1995. The increased amount shall apply to causes of action arising between October 1 of that year and September 30 of the following year, inclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">(3) (i) The limitation established under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall apply in a personal injury action to each direct victim of <em>tortious conduct </em>and all persons who claim injury by or through that victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">(ii) In a wrongful death action in which there are two or more claimants or beneficiaries, an award for noneconomic damages may not exceed 150% of the limitation estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>lished under paragraph (2) of this subsection, regardless of the number of claimants or beneficiaries who share in the award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In support of her argument appellant stresses that section 11-10 8(b)(3)(i) uses the term \u201cvictim of tortious conduct.\u201d She also emphasizes that a claim under the CPA is statutorily-created. This, of course, is true. Appellant then argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKG\">As can be seen from the plain language of Section 3(i), in order for the Cap to apply two conditions precedent must be satisfied: First, there must be a \u201cpersonal injury action\u201d and second, there must be a victim of <em>\u201ctortious </em>\u201d <em>conduct. </em>Appellant does not dispute that this case is a \u201cpersonal injury action.\u201d However, not all personal injury actions are based on a defendant\u2019s \u201ctortious\u201d conduct. Sometimes, as in this case, personal injury actions are based upon statutory causes of action. Because a cause of action based on the CPA is a statutory cause of action and not a tort, the Cap does not apply and the trial court erred when it reduced the jury\u2019s award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">(Emphasis supplied in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Section 11-108 does not define the words \u201ctortious conduct\u201d and there are no reported cases from either this Court or the Court of Appeals where the interpretation of those words, as used in the cap statute, were already at issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We shall, therefore, begin by examining the dictionary definition of the words in controversy. <em>See Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 447, 697 A.2d 455 (1997) (\u201cAlthough dictionary definitions do not provide dispositive resolutions of the meaning of statutory terms, dictionaries do provide a useful starting point for determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>what statutory terms mean, at least in the abstract, by suggesting what the legislature could have meant by using particular terms.\u201d) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cTortious\u201d is defined as \u201c[constituting a tort; wrongful.\u201d Blacks Law Dictionary 1497 (7th ed.1999). A \u201ctort\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] civil wrong for which a remedy may be obtained, usually in the form of damages; a breach of a duty that the law imposes on everyone in the same relation to one another as those involved in a given transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1496, 697 A.2d 455. Therefore, the term \u201ctort\u201d as defined by Blacks encompasses all \u201ccivil wrongs,\u201d not just wrongs that were recognized as a civil wrong at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">In <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 863 A.2d 297 (2004), the Court was called upon to decide whether \u201cthe Maryland Tort Claims Act grants qualified immunity to state personnel for <em>tortious ads or omissions, </em>within the scope of the state employees\u2019 public duties, when those acts or omissions involve violations of state constitutional rights....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 863 A.2d 297. At issue was the interpretation of Md.Code (2004 Repl.Vol.), State Government Article, section 12-105 [part of the Maryland Tort Claims Act], which in material part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">\u00a7 12-105. Immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">State personnel shall have the immunity from liability described under \u00a7 5-522(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Section 5-522(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">(b) State personnel, as defined in 12-101 of the State Government Article, are immune from suit in courts of the State <em>and from liability in tort for a tortious ad or omission </em>that is within the scope of the public duties of the State personnel and is made without malice or gross negligence, and for which the State or its units have waived immunity under Title 12, Subtitle 1 of the State Government Article, even if the damages exceed the limits of that waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">In <em>Lee, </em>the Court interpreted the term \u201ctortious act or omission\u201d to include causes of action to recover for constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>tional torts. 384 Md. at 266, 863 A.2d 297. This is important for our purposes because a constitutional tort is obviously not a \u201ccommon law\u201d tort. The <em>Lee </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">While this Court has not, until today, directly decided whether intentional torts and constitutional torts are covered by the Maryland Tort Claims Act, thereby granting state personnel qualified immunity for such torts, our prior opinions do support such coverage. <em>See Larsen v. Chinwuba, </em>377 Md. 92, 99, 107-109, 832 A.2d 193 (2003) (A tort action against the Insurance Commissioner setting forth causes of action for defamation, invasion of privacy, abuse of process, <em>and violation of rights guaranteed by the Maryland Declaration of Rights, </em>and this Court held that the Commissioner was entitled to immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act, although the issue before the Court concerned scope of employment rather than the basic coverage of the statute); <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 757 A.2d 118 (2000) (A tort action against state governmental officials based upon allegations of various common law intentional torts, <em>violations of the federal constitution, and violations of the state constitution, </em>and the issues included (1) the sufficiency of the evidence to show malice, thereby defeating Maryland Tort Claims Act immunity, (2) liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and (3) the inapplicability of the public official immunity doctrine to state constitutional torts; the Court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was sufficient evidence of malice to defeat Maryland Tort Claims Act immunity, although no other issue was raised regarding the coverage of the Act); <em>DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 49-56, 729 A.2d 354 (1999) <em>(Holding that there was coverage under the Local Government Tort Claims Act for certain intentional and constitutional </em>torts); <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 107-108, 123-124, 660 A.2d 447 (1995) (same)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 257-58, 863 A2d 297 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Although perhaps not dispositive of the issue here presented, the interpretation of the term \u201ctortious injury\u201d by the <em>Lee </em>Court at least suggests that the term \u201ctortious conduct\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>includes more than conduct that constituted a tort at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">In support of her argument that \u201c[a] cause of action based on a statutory right is not a tort\u201d, appellant cites to two out-of-state cases, viz.: <em>Facchina v. Mut. Benefits Corp., </em>735 So.2d 499 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999) and <em>Treanor v. Metro. Transp. Auth., </em>414 F.Supp.2d 297, 303-05 (S.D.N.Y.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">In <em>Facchina, </em>the District Court of Appeals of Florida held that a statute that created a claim for unauthorized publication of a person\u2019s likeness was \u201cbased not on tort or contract law but on a statutory right\u201d; therefore, the economic loss rule, which is a judicial limitation on common law remedies in tort and contract, did not apply. 735 So.2d at 502. In reaching this conclusion, however, the Court noted that the text of the statute evidenced the legislature\u2019s intent not to apply judicial limits on common law remedies (i.e., the economic loss rule) to the new statutory cause of action. <em>Id. </em>As will be demonstrated <em>infra, </em>nothing in the text of the cap statute or in its legislative history suggests that the cap statute was intended to apply only to common law torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Appellant is correct when she states in her brief that <em>Treanor, </em>which was a case interpreting New York law, held that appellant\u2019s discrimination claim was not a tort and was therefore not subject to a one-year statute of limitations applicable to causes of action against the Long Island Railroad \u201cfounded on tort.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Treanor </em>Court concluded, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>several decisions by New York state courts, that the statute at issue (along with a similar one covering suits against the New York City Transit Authority) \u201cwere designed for traditional tort actions\u201d and thus were not intended to cover a statutory tort. <em>Id. </em>at 301-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Courts in other states have interpreted the phrase \u201ctort\u201d far more broadly than did <em>Treanor, </em>at least in the context of applying various long-arm statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute is found in Maryland Code (2006 RepLVol.) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, section 6-103. Subsections (b)(3) and (4) of section 6-103 use the term \u201ctortious injury.\u201d The phrase is used in the following context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">(b) A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who directly or by an agent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-10\">(3) <em>Causes tortious injury </em>in the State by act or omission in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">(4) <em>Causes tortious injury </em>in the State or outside of the State by an act or omission outside the State if he regularly does or solicits business, engages in any other persistent course of conduct in the State or derives substantial revenue from goods, food, service, or manufactured products used or consumed in the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">Although no reported appellate court decision in Maryland has construed the term \u201ctortious injury\u201d in the context of our long-arm statute, the court in <em>Craig v. Gen. Fin. Corp. of Illinois, </em>504 F.Supp. 1033, 1037 (D.Md.1980), did construe that phrase. The <em>Craig </em>Court held that the fact that a cause of action is statutory is irrelevant to the issue of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>defendant committed a tortious act in Maryland resulting in injury in Maryland for purposes of construing Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, section 6-103(b). <em>See also Cable/Home Communication Corp. v. Network Prods., Inc., </em>902 F.2d 829, 856-57 (11th Cir.1990) (finding violation of state and federal copyright and communications laws to be sufficient to trigger jurisdiction under Florida\u2019s long-arm statute, which required a \u201ctortious act\u201d within the state); <em>Williams Elec.

Bertoni &amp; Cotti, </em>314 F.Supp. 169, 171 (S.D.N.Y.1970) (Clayton Act violation, although \u201cpurely statutory,\u201d constitutes a \u201ctortious act\u201d for purposes of New York\u2019s long-arm statute); <em>Bucchere v.

Calvin Presbyterian Church, </em>897 F.3d 790, 793 (9th Cir.2005) (Title YII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 creates statutory torts); <em>Schobert v. Illinois Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>304 F.3d 725, 731 (7th Cir.2002) (same); <em>Fenton v. HiSAN, Inc., </em>174 F.3d 827, 829-30 (6th Cir.1999) (same); <em>see also Home Builders Ass\u2019n of Greater St. Louis v.

Universal Marine Co., </em>543 F.2d 1107, 1109 (5th Cir.1976) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Appellant also relies on <em>United States v. Streidel, </em>329 Md. 533, 620 A.2d 905 (1993), in support of her position. In <em>Streidel, </em>the Court of Appeals was asked by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">Whether the Maryland solatium cap of $350,000 is applicable to each claimant of solatium, or is it a comprehensive overall solatium maximum applicable only once, no matter how many claimants there are.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 535, 620 A.2d 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The <em>Streidel </em>Court held that it was unnecessary to decide the certified question, because Maryland\u2019s cap statute did not apply to wrongful death actions. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 620 A.2d 905. This holding overruled <em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Smith, </em>79 Md.App. 591, 558 A.2d 768 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Appellant asserts that the <em>Streidel </em>Court \u201crefused to apply the [statutory] [c]ap to the statutory cause of action of wrongful death because, among other reasons, such causes of actions are not traditional tort actions for personal injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">The <em>Streidel </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-11\">The language of the cap statute refers only to damages awarded in an action for \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d \u00a7 ll-108(b). The term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d or \u201cinjury\u201d normally connotes a physical injury to a victim. The death of a victim as a result of a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d or \u201cinjury\u201d is, of course, the ultimate injury to that victim. The damages recoverable by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>victim\u2019s estate in a survival action, for a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d resulting in death, are, however, distinct from the damages recoverable by the family of that victim under the Wrongful Death Act, \u00a7 3-901 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The damages which the victim\u2019s family are entitled to recover under the Wrongful Death Act are for the value, pecuniary or otherwise, of the life of the deceased to the persons entitled to recover. This recovery for \u201cdeath\u201d under the wrongful death act does not compensate for the \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to the direct victim of the tortious conduct. Thus, ordinarily, unless the context indicates otherwise, damages for an \u201cinjury\u201d or a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d or a \u201cbodily injury\u201d do not include those damages recoverable in a wrongful death action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">329 Md. at 539-40, 620 A.2d 905 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The <em>Streidel </em>Court never used the phrase \u201ctraditional tort action for personal injury\u201d in its analysis and nothing said in <em>Streidel </em>supports appellant\u2019s position that one of the reasons that the cap statute was deemed inapplicable to a wrongful death action was because such actions were not \u201ctraditional tort aetion[s].\u201d The crux of the <em>Streidel </em>decision was that wrongful death statute cases were not governed by the cap statute because such suits did not assert a claim for personal injury. <em>Id. </em>at 539-44, 620 A.2d 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In <em>Streidel </em>the Court quoted, in full, the cap statute as it existed in 1993. <em>See id. </em>at 537-39, 620 A.2d 905.

Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 34-35, 660 A.2d 423 (1995) (citations omitted). The Court of Appeals in <em>Murphy v.

This crisis resulted in the unavailability of liability insurance for some individuals and entities, especially those engaged in hazardous activities such as asbestos removal, and increasing difficulty in obtaining reinsurance. <em>See Report of the Governor\u2019s Task Force to Study Liability Insurance, </em>3-4 (Dec.1985). The crisis also affected the medical profession, resulting in excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>insurance premiums for doctors and declining services for patients, especially in high risk specialties such as obstetrics. <em>See Report of the Joint Executive/Legislative Task Force on Medical Malpractice Insurance, </em>5 (Dec.1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aac\">Id. at 368, 601 A.2d 102 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Both businesses and individuals need insurance for economic protection against suits seeking non-economic damages regardless of whether the lawsuits are based on acts of commission or omission that were torts at common law or are based on conduct that breaches a duty imposed by a statute or by constitution. With that in mind, we turn to the pertinent legislative history behind the 1994 amendment to the cap statute, which was accurately summarized by Schobel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">One year after <em>Murphy [v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 601 A.2d 102 (1992) ] came the <em>Streidel </em>decision, which disturbed the settled statutory interpretation that the General Assembly intended the cap to apply to wrongful death cases. The <em>Streidel </em>Court examined the statute\u2019s requirement that juries itemize awards for \u201cpersonal injury\u201d actions in order to indicate how much they have allocated for past and future lost earnings, medical expenses, noneconomic damages, and other damages, and pointed out that such categories of damages do not apply to recoveries in wrongful death actions. The court found, moreover, nothing in the available legislative history that indicated the cap on noneconomic damages would apply to wrongful death cases. <em>Given this finding, the court saw no need to reach the question certified before it: whether the damage cap would apply individually or in the aggregate to plaintiffs in the wrongful death action.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">b. Legislative and Political History. \u2014 The legislative proposal to reverse <em>Streidel </em>was assigned to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, chaired by the Bill\u2019s sponsor, Senator Walter Baker (D-Cecil). A member of the conference committee that formulated the 1986 cap, Senator Baker believed that, contrary to <em>Streidel\u2019s </em>analysis, the legislature always intended the damage ceiling to cover wrongful death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>actions. This belief reflected the fear of many legislators and insurers that medical malpractice rates, presumably stabilized by the 1986 cap, would soar in the face of wrongful death damage awards no longer restrained by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">Insurance industry representatives joined forces with the state\u2019s medical community to support the legislation. One insurance company cited a Baltimore County case, in which a plaintiff received nearly $6,000,000 in noneconomic damages, in order to show the danger of leaving the jury to its own devices. Moreover, malpractice rates that had doubled in Maryland between 1984 and 1987 remained essentially constant from 1988 to 1993, at least in part, because of the cap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">Despite a proposed raise in the statutory ceiling from $350,000 to $450,000 and an allowance for yearly increases for inflation, victims\u2019 rights groups and the plaintiffs [sic] bar objected. They denied any correlation between caps on noneconomic damages and medical malpractice premiums while insisting insurers were simply trying to protect their substantial profit margins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">The proposed legislation emerged from the Senate Committee by the slimmest of margins. In addition to the primary issue of whether to extend the cap to cover wrongful death, the Judicial Proceedings Committee wrestled with the Bill\u2019s retroactive application to wrongful death suits still pending. Proponents of retroactivity argued that until <em>Streidel, </em>insurance rates were set with the assumption that wrongful death was already included by law. Premiums had been collected to reflect the presence of the cap, and would have to be increased immediately to cover possible noneconomic awards exceeding the old cap. Although the Attorney General advised that there was no constitutional bar to the retroactivity provision, the Committee ultimately opted to amend the legislation to apply only to causes of action arising after October 1,1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\"><em>The Bill required application of the cap amount to the tort victim and \u201call persons who claim injury by or through that victim,\u201d thus answering the question that was never </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>addressed by the Streidel Court. </em>The Senate Committee agreed to increase the limit in wrongful death actions to 150% of the proposed limit when two or more claimants existed, but retained a single cap for all plaintiffs in a personal injury claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">This proposed legislation was referred to a conference committee after the House re-inserted a retroactivity provision in its version of the Bill that applied to wrongful death actions still pending after October 1, 1994. The House also increased the limit for multiple claimants to 200% of the statutory ceiling and raised the damage ceiling itself to $500,000. For personal injury cases, it sought to apply the cap to each plaintiff, whereas the Senate\u2019s version imposed the limit on all claimants. In conference, the Senate conceded the $500,000 ceiling, but prevailed on all other points. The revised bill passed in both chambers by wide margins.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHUo\">54 Md. L.Rev. at 917-19 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The amended statute, as already mentioned, contains the new language in Section 11 \u2014 108(b)(3)(i), upon which appellant relies, i.e., \u201cthe limitation established under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall apply in a personal injury action to each direct victim of <em>tortious conduct </em>and all persons who claim injury by or through that victim.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">It is clear to us that the legislature added the language, upon which appellant relies, in order to answer the question that the <em>Streidel </em>Court had left unanswered, i.e., to make it clear that cap amounts are applied to the tort victim and all persons who claim injury by or through that victim in a personal injury or a wrongful death action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">We do not believe that the legislature, when it amended the cap statute, intended to expand the statute to cover wrongful death actions but at the same time intended to narrow its application so that rather than applying \u201cto all actions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>personal injuries,\u201d as it did before the amendment <em>(Kent Village, </em>104 Md.App. at 532, 657 A.2d 330), it was now to cover wrongful death actions and all actions for personal injury so long as the victims were injured as the result of common law torts. One reason for reaching this conclusion, aside from the ones already discussed, is the fact that nothing in the rather extensive legislative history surrounding the enactment in 1994 of Senate Bill 283 gives <em>any </em>indication that the General Assembly wanted to narrow the scope of the cap statute in any respect. More specifically, nothing in the legislative history suggests that the General Assembly even thought of the difference between actions claiming personal injury due to common law torts as opposed to causes of action claiming personal injury arising out of statutory or constitutional torts. And, when interpreting a statute, a court must presume that the legislature did not intend to make any alteration other than what is specified and plainly pronounced. <em>N. Cent. Ry. Co. v. Green, </em>112 Md. 487, 76 A. 90 (1910). Also, in light of the reasons for the original cap statute, and its amendment, it is impossible to believe that the legislature intended to narrow the statute in the way appellant suggests so that insurers would now have to cover non-economic damages awards that exceeded the cap so long as the personal injury action arose out of the violation of a statute or a constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">For all the above reasons, we hold that the circuit court was correct when it ruled that the cap statute applied to appellant\u2019s claim for damages that arose, in part, out of a violation of the CPA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Appellant argues that even if the statutory cap does apply to actions brought under the CPA, the statutory cap is unconstitutional because it constitutes a \u201cspecial law\u201d that is barred by Article III, section 38 of the Maryland Constitution. This same argument was considered and rejected by this Court in <em>Univ. of Maryland Med. Sys. Corp. v. Malory, </em>143 Md.App. 327, 795 A.2d 107 (2001). No useful purpose would be served by reiterating what was so well said in <em>Malory, </em>143 Md.App. at 352-54, 795 A.2d 107. <em>See also Kent Village, </em>104 Md.App. at 532, 657 A.2d 330 (\u201c[The statutory cap] is a limit that is applicable now to all personal injury actions in Maryland and thus is uniform in its application ... it applies to only one category of damage-the category least quantifiable on an objective basis and most subject to inflation through jury passion or sympathy; and it is set high enough to compensate most injured victims for the pain or disfigurement they may suffer.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Lastly, appellant argues that even if the statutory cap applies and is upheld as constitutional, \u201cthe applicable [c]ap in this case is $530,000.00, not $515,000.00 as determined by the trial court ... because [a]ppellant has a cause of action against [a]ppellees which \u2018arose\u2019 after the [c]ap was increased from $515,000.00 to $530,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Both parties agree that if Kelly\u2019s cause of action \u201carose\u201d between Oct. 1, 1995 and Oct. 1, 1996, the non-economic damages cap is $515,000.00. They also agree that if Kelly\u2019s cause of action \u201carose\u201d between Oct. 1, 1996 and Oct. 1, 1997, then the \u201ccap\u201d should be $530,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Appellees contend that the cause of action arose on November 15, 1995, when Kelly was first diagnosed with having excessive lead levels in her blood. Appellant responds in four parts: 1) appellees had a continuing duty to Kelly to keep the rented premises free from flaking, loose or peeling lead paint <em>(Brooks v. Lewin Realty III, Inc., </em>378 Md. 70, 83-84, 835 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>616 (2003); 2) because appellees breached a continuing duty, \u201ca new or separate, cause of action arises\u201d each time the plaintiff is injured; 3) although Kelly was injured by lead paint poisoning before October 1, 1996, she endured further injury between October 1, 1996 and September 13, 1997, when she vacated the leased premises; 4) therefore, because some of the breaches of duty by appellees and some of Kelly\u2019s injuries occurred after October 1, 1996, the higher cap ($530,-000. 00) should apply. At oral argument before us, appellant\u2019s counsel admitted that it was impossible to separate the injuries suffered before October 1, 1995, and those suffered after that date. Nevertheless, appellant argues that it \u201cis of no consequence that (Kelly) also has a cause of action for injuries which occurred prior (to October 1,1996).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The trial judge was correct in rejecting the above argument. Even if it is true that appellant had a \u201cnew or separate cause of action\u201d that \u201carose\u201d every time she was injured, she did not bring a series of causes of action. She brought a single cause of action for all her injuries. \u201cA cause of action arises within the meaning of C.J. \u00a7 11-108 \u2018when facts exist to support each element\u2019 of the cause of action.\u201d <em>Berg v. Byrd, </em>124 Md.App. 208, 216, 720 A.2d 1283 (1998) (quoting <em>Owens-Illinois v. Armstrong, </em>326 Md. 107, 121, 604 A.2d 47 (1992)). Appellant\u2019s claim for negligence arose within the meaning of section 11-108 once she sustained a legally cognizable injury. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The same holds true for appellant\u2019s cause of action for appellees\u2019 CPA violation; 1. e., a cause of action arose once appellant sustained injury resulting from the violation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Kelly had a legally cognizable injury on November 15, 1995-the date she was first diagnosed with an excessive lead level. The November 15, 1995, lead level was 9 mg/dl. Dr. Rosen testified that although the November 15, 1995, lead level measured at less than 10 mg/dl, Kelly was still harmed as of that date. We therefore conclude that the complaint appellant filed, and the cause of action to which the cap statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>applied, arose after October 1, 1995, but before October 1, <em>1996.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-9\">.
