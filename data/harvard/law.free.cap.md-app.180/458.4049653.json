Did the trial court err in interrupting appellant\u2019s closing argument and precluding defense counsel from arguing a competing interpretation of the evidence to the jury because the judge \u201cagreed with the State\u2019s interpretation\u201d of one item of evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">2. Did the trial judge impermissibly usurp the jury\u2019s role as sole and exclusive triers of fact when she instructed the jury that they may not consider defense counsel\u2019s proffered interpretation of the evidence in any manner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">3. Whether the trial court committed plain error in allowing the State to cross-examine appellant through a series of \u201cwere they lying\u201d questions[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">4. Whether the trial court impermissibly limited the appellant\u2019s right to cross-examine his accusers!?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by precluding appellant\u2019s closing argument. Therefore, we shall vacate the judgments of conviction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Factual And Procedural Summary<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Between 10:30 p.m., and 11:30 p.m. on November 12, 2005, Officer Earl Thompson and Detective Fabien Laronde of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Baltimore City Police Department \u201cFLEX Squad\u201d received a call from a known, confidential source informing them of a suspect in the 400 Block of Lyndhurst<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Avenue in Baltimore City who was possibly armed with a handgun. In particular, Laronde testified that the officers \u201creceived a call for discharging in the area.\u201d Accordingly, Thompson and Laronde, accompanied by Officer Lash, drove to Lyndhurst Avenue, where they saw a suspect whom they later identified as appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">At the time, the officers were in plainclothes and in an unmarked vehicle. Nevertheless, appellant spotted them as they drove into the area. According to Officer Thompson, appellant \u201clooked at [their] vehicle,\u201d started to walk away, and then began to run as they came near. Thompson explained that while the officers chased appellant in their car, appellant \u201cmade a gesture with his right arm as though he was throwing a metal object up into the air onto a roof in the block.\u201d Thompson also recalled that appellant traveled about 30 feet before the officers caught up with him. Laronde exited the car and apprehended appellant. With the aid of \u201cFoxtrot,\u201d a police helicopter with a searchlight, the police located the suspicious object on the roof of a porch of an abandoned house. Laronde entered the building and retrieved the item\u2014 a fully loaded handgun. Appellant was arrested and, in a search of his person incident to that arrest, the police recovered a ziplock bag containing cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The police submitted the handgun for ballistics and fingerprint testing, and the State introduced the test results into evidence. In particular, State\u2019s Exhibit 1A is a \u201cFirearms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Identification Unit-Firearms Report,\u201d which contains a physical description of the firearm, including its make, model, serial number. The report also notes that the weapon was \u201ctest fired,\u201d found \u201coperable,\u201d and meets the definition of a handgun. State\u2019s Exhibit IB is the report from the police \u201cLaboratory Section,\u201d titled \u201cRequest for Firearms Examination.\u201d The form contains appellant\u2019s name, as well as the make and model of the weapon and the date of processing for latent prints (11/29/05). Moreover, it indicates that the \u201cResults\u201d of the latent fingerprint test were \u201cNegative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Officer Thompson was examined about both reports. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">[PROSECUTOR:] Directing your attention back to the firearms report [i.e., Exhibit 1A]. What, if any other information is contained on that report below the comments section?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">[THOMPSON:] The last checkmark states, this weapon meets the definition of a handgun as described in Annotated Code of Maryland, Criminal Law 4-201 and is operable and was test fired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">[PROSECUTOR:] Is that the handgun that you recovered on November 12th, 2005?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">[THOMPSON:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">[PROSECUTOR:] Did you recover it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">[THOMPSON:] No, Officer Laronde recovered it off the roof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">[PROSECUTOR:] Did he wear gloves when he recovered it, if you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">[THOMPSON:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-13\">[PROSECUTOR:] When he \u2014 were you wearing gloves? [THOMPSON:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-14\">[PROSECUTOR:] Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-15\">[THOMPSON:] I didn\u2019t put my [sic] on that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-16\">I didn\u2019t put any gloves on that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>[PROSECUTOR:] State\u2019s Exhibit IB. Do you recognize that document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">[THOMPSON:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">[PROSECUTOR:] What is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">[THOMPSON:] It\u2019s a laboratory section request for firearms examination for latent prints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">[PROSECUTOR:] And is there any information with respect to latent prints? First of all, what are latent prints?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abm\">[THOMPSON:] Latent prints is [sic] fingerprints that are leftover [sic] once a handgun is held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">[PROSECUTOR:] And is there any information contained on that piece of paper with respect to latent prints?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANG\">[THOMPSON:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">[PROSECUTOR:] What, if any information is on there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADp\">[THOMPSON:] By the technician that examined the weapon <em>[it] came back for negative prints.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">[PROSECUTOR:] What does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">[THOMPSON:] <em>No prints could be lifted off the weapon.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">* <em>% </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-13\">[PROSECUTOR:] Did you handle that firearm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACyr\">[THOMPSON:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-14\">[PROSECUTOR:] Were you wearing gloves?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-15\">[THOMPSON:] No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-16\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">The State did not call an expert witness to explain the process of gathering latent fingerprint evidence or the specifics of how fingerprint testing is conducted. Nor did the State produce expert evidence to explain that certain surfaces, such as the handgun in issue, may not yield fingerprints.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">The results of the fingerprint testing became an issue during closing argument. The prosecutor\u2019s summation included the following comment with regard to the test results:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUbp\">The next form you have is State\u2019s Exhibit IB and the important thing about IB is this is basically the second page of the firearms report and down at the bottom it says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\u201cprocessed for latent prints,\u201d and then it says who it was processed by and it also says the results of the latent prints test were negative. Well, what does that mean? That means it was negative. (Inaudible) Well, you would say the next question is, \u201cWell, how could that be?\u201d We heard Officer Laronde testify that he picked up that handgun with his bare hands. We heard Officer Thompson say he picked up that handgun with his bare hands. So, if they picked it up, why wouldn\u2019t their prints be on it. <em>Well, the reason that their prints weren\u2019t on it is that the surface of the handgun is such that there can\u2019t be prints that are obtained from it, because they were incapable of getting prints off of this handgun, because, surely, if they would have gotten any prints, they would have gotten the prints of the two officers who admitted holding that handgun. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">In her closing argument, the defense attorney stated, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have a gun. We don\u2019t have a problem (inaudible). However \u2014 and we also stipulated (inaudible), which you\u2019ll receive (inaudible), that the gun was submitted. The State would have you believe that when the gun was submitted, <em>the prints came back negative. </em>Well, they did come back negative. They came back negative for the officers. Why? Because they weren\u2019t looking for the officers\u2019 prints. <em>They were looking for Mr. Washington\u2019s prints. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The prosecutor objected, and the trial court sustained the objection. The prosecutor then asked the court to tell \u201cthe jury ... to disregard that[,]\u201d and a sidebar was convened. The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">THE COURT: (Inaudible.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">[PROSECUTOR:] Yes, that it just came back as negative as to any prints, meaning there were no prints even recovered from the handgun. There was nothing. So it\u2019s not even as if there were prints that they could have even analyzed to compare to the police officers\u2019. There was nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, the report says that it was negative. We haven\u2019t had anyone come in and testify to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">THE COURT: Does the report say that they couldn\u2019t get a latent print?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It says \u201clatente.\u201d That\u2019s what it says, Your Honor, and then it says \u2014 down at the bottom, it says \u201cnegative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Meaning that there were no prints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It says up top who they were searching for; the defendant\u2019s full name, Brandon Washington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">THE COURT: The defendant\u2019s full name identifies the case..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Right. When they open up the gun, they have to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">THE COURT: (Inaudible.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-13\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think a fair interpretation (inaudible) that even if there were latents, none of them matched Brandon Washington. <em>Your argument to the jury is that there were latent prints and none of them matched against Brandon Washington. That\u2019s not a fair interpretation of this report. So the objection is sustained </em>because that is not a fair interpretation of this report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, there\u2019s nothing that indicates that it wasn\u2019t done either, that it wouldn\u2019t have been Brandon Washington. They wouldn\u2019t have looked for the officer\u2019s prints. <em>They\u2019re looking for Brandon Washington\u2019s prints on the gun, on the handgun.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-15\">THE COURT: (Inaudible) processed for latent prints and the results are negative, that is, if they didn\u2019t have any prints to even put in to compare. (Inaudible.) They didn\u2019t even compare them to the general public. So the objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: And I\u2019m asking that you instruct the jury to disregard the last statement that was made to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aez\">THE COURT: This is a motion to strike\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aio\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">THE COURT: \u2014 the statement concerning the fingerprint comparison?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Then, Your Honor, I would still make the same, just for the record, the same objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">Or not objection, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">THE COURT: The report is in evidence. If an appellate authority has to review it, they\u2019ll see that it says there\u2019s a negative result for latent prints. I believe that\u2019s what the report says. (Inaudible.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">As noted, the jury convicted appellant of two handgun offenses. Appellant filed a Motion for a New Trial, arguing that the court had impermissibly limited his closing argument. At the motion hearing, defense counsel maintained that her argument was in response to the State\u2019s argument, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATC\">And the State also hit on the point where it says there was nothing to indicate that there was a comparison to any of the prints. However, the State used that in his closing argument saying if the officer\u2019s prints had come up then there would have been something to indicate that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">And that\u2019s exactly what ... we\u2019re arguing in this particular instance, Your Honor, that we don\u2019t know if there was the officer\u2019s \u2014 that the officer\u2019s prints were tested for because <em>the document requested examination for Brandon Washington\u2019s prints. </em>So we don\u2019t know if a comparison \u2014 or if the officer\u2019s prints would have come up or if they did come up because we didn\u2019t have the Examiner Turner to come and sit in this seat to indicate that. <em>We argued the four comers of the document, Your Honor. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">In denying the motion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>As to latent prints, the report states, \u201cprocessed for latent prints November 29th, 2005 by T. Turner. Result-negative.[\u201d] Based on this single notation <em>the Defense sought to argue in closing argument that there were fingerprints recovered from the gun, that fingerprints on the gun came back negative after examination for Mr. Washington\u2019s fingerprint and that the request for examination of the fingerprints was exclusively for Mr. Washington.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">In opposition the State argued that the report simply stated that the gun had been processed for latent fingerprints with negative results, meaning that the gun had no latent fingerprints recovered from it. <em>The State argued that State\u2019s Exhibit IB failed to demonstrate any examination or fingerprints had been conducted and simply meant that the gun had been negative for latent fingerprints.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\n<em>The court agreed with the State\u2019s interpretation and held that the evidence did not warrant the argument attempted by the Defense attorney. The court affirms that holding today and hereby denies the motion for new trial.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\"><em>The court finds again that the evidence, State\u2019s Exhibit IB simply does not warrant the argument attempted by the Defense in this case, that fingerprints from Mr. Washington were compared to fingerprints recovered from the gun and found to be negative </em>and that there was a sole comparison of fingerprints from the gun to known fingerprints of Mr. Washington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">The evidence simply does not warrant this argument. <em>The plain reading of State\u2019s Exhibit IB is that the gun was processed for latent prints with negative results meaning no latent prints were found on the gun. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">In a series of related contentions, appellant claims that the trial court abridged his constitutional right to present \u201cfair and reasonable closing argument to the jury\u201d by preventing defense counsel from arguing that the test for fingerprints on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the firearm was \u201cnegative\u201d for appellant\u2019s fingerprints. He maintains that counsel\u2019s argument was a proper interpretation of the record; that it was \u201cinvited\u201d by the prosecutor\u2019s erroneous characterization of the evidence (by which the prosecutor argued that firearms seldom yield fingerprints); and that the trial judge overstepped her bounds by resolving the competing factual inferences in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">According to appellant, \u201cthe jury was deprived [of] the ability to assess appellant\u2019s guilt based on all the facts available, as key and relevant information was excluded from the jury\u2019s plenary consideration, ensuring only the State\u2019s version of events was put before the jury.\u201d He asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">Reversible error occurred when the trial judge sustained the State\u2019s objection during closing argument, interrupted defense counsel, disallowed the defense from submitting their competing, reasonable interpretation of one of the State\u2019s exhibits to the jury, and instructed the jury to disregard the defense argument. In so doing, the trial court deprived appellant of his right to unfettered, uninhibited, and robust argument before the jury, precluded appellant from fairly and directly responding to the State\u2019s interpretation of that item of evidence, and impermissibly denied the jury their exclusive ability to weigh and assess the evidence, and derive whatever inferences they deign reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In addition, appellant maintains that the \u201cdefense has the right to alert [the] jury to failings\u201d in the State\u2019s case \u201cby identifying holes in the State\u2019s evidentiary edifice.\u201d He insists that it was \u201cpatently inappropriate\u201d for the court to preclude the defense \u201cfrom submitting their interpretation of the evidence because the Court \u2018agree[s] with the State\u2019s interpretation\u2019 of that evidence.... \u201d Appellant continues: \u201cIt cannot be questioned that the defense was engaged in proper arguments when it sought to argue to the jury that the absence of a positive fingerprint match on the handgun-the \u2018negative\u2019 result of the fingerprint analysis \u2014 militated in favor of acquit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>tal. Therefore, the trial court erred in failing to permit the defense to submit the argument to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">In appellant\u2019s view, the court</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">took dead aim at the defense\u2019s interpretation of the negative latent fingerprint results in evidence-that the gun was tested for appellant\u2019s fingerprints, and the test came back \u201cnegative\u201d-and over defense objection told the jury to disregard the argument and not consider it for any purpose. (Tl. 121; App. 7) Thus, the trial judge impermissibly identified one inference to be derived from the facts, and excluded it from the jury\u2019s consideration. The judge therefore intruded upon, and denied the jury, their role to be the exclusive arbiter of the inferences derived from the evidence. This violated Article 23 of the Declaration of Rights, and compels reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Further, appellant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">A trial judge may not grant the State a monopoly in the marketplace of ideas. Experience has long taught that the truth may often lie between the two competing versions thereof offered by parties to litigation. It is the role of the jury, as neutral lay fact-finders, to assess the competing interpretations offered by the party and deign the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The State responds that the trial judge correctly determined that \u201cdefense counsel had no basis for arguing that the evidence showed that fingerprints taken from the gun did not match Washington\u2019s prints,\u201d because \u201c[n]o evidence existed to indicate that <em>any </em>fingerprints were taken off the gun.\u201d In its view, the trial court \u201cproperly exercised its discretion to bar defense counsel from arguing about \u2018facts not in evidence.\u2019 \u201d Similarly, argues the State, the court\u2019s subsequent instruction to the jury to disregard the statement by defense counsel regarding fingerprints was an appropriate exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Further, the State disputes appellant\u2019s contention that the defense argument was an \u201c \u2018invited response\u2019 to the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly impermissible argument regarding the absence of fingerprint evidence.\u201d It points out that appellant failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>object to the prosecutor\u2019s explanation that \u201cthe absence of fingerprints on the gun was due to the nature of the surface of the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The right to counsel entails the opportunity to present closing argument. <em>See Holmes v. State, </em>333 Md. 652, 658-59, 637 A.2d 113, (1994) (\u201c \u2018It is well settled that a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel guarantees, in part, an opportunity of counsel to present closing argument at the close of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>see also Cherry v. State, </em>305 Md. 631, 636, 506 A.2d 228 (1986); <em>Biglari v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 657, 673, 847 A.2d 1239, <em>cert. denied, </em>382 Md. 686, 856 A.2d 723 (2004). In <em>Yopps v. State, </em>228 Md. 204, 207, 178 A.2d 879 (1962), the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">The Constitutional right of a defendant to be heard through counsel necessarily includes his right to have his counsel make a proper argument on the evidence and the applicable law in his favor, however simple, clear, unimpeached, and conclusive the evidence may seem, unless he has waived his right to such argument, or unless the argument is not within the issues in the case, and the trial court has no discretion to deny accused such right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">To be sure, \u201cattorneys are afforded great leeway in presenting closing arguments to the jury.\u201d <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 429, 722 A.2d 887 (1999). <em>See Smith v. State, </em>388 Md. 468, 880 A.2d 288 (2005); <em>Trimble v. State, </em>300 Md. 387, 405, 478 A.2d 1143 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230, 105 S.Ct. 1231, 84 L.Ed.2d 368 (1985). In <em>Herring v. New York, </em>422 U.S. 853, 862, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593 (1975), the Supreme Court addressed the importance of closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">It can hardly be questioned that closing argument serves to sharpen and clarify the issues for resolution by the trier of fact in a criminal case. For it is only after all the evidence is in that counsel for the parties are in a position to present their respective versions of the case as a whole. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Only then can they argue the inferences to be drawn from all the testimony, and point out the weaknesses of their adversaries\u2019 positions. And for the defense, closing argument is the last clear chance to persuade the trier of fact that there may be reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 [1970].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">The very premise of our adversary system of criminal justice is that partisan advocacy on both sides of the case will best promote the ultimate objective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The Court of Appeals outlined the contours of permissible summation in the seminal case of <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412-13, 326 A.2d 707 (1974) (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">As to summation, it is, as a general rule, within the range of legitimate argument for counsel to state and discuss the evidence and all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the facts in evidence; and such comment or argument is afforded a wide range. Counsel is free to use the testimony most favorable to his side of the argument to the jury, and the evidence may be examined, collated, sifted and treated in his own way. Moreover, if counsel does not make any statement of fact not fairly deducible from the evidence his argument is not improper, although the inferences discussed are illogical and erroneous. Generally, counsel has the right to make any comment or argument that is warranted by the evidence proved or inferences therefrom; the prosecuting attorney is as free to comment legitimately and to speak fully, although harshly, on the accused\u2019s action and conduct if the evidence supports his comments, as is accused\u2019s counsel to comment on the nature of the evidence and the character of witnesses which the [prosecution] produces____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">While arguments of counsel are required to be confined to the issues in the cases on trial, the evidence and fair and reasonable deductions therefrom, and to arguments of opposing counsel, generally speaking, liberal freedom of speech should be allowed. There are no hard-and-fast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>limitations within which the argument of earnest counsel must be confined-no well-defined bounds beyond which the eloquence of an advocate shall not soar. He may discuss the facts proved or admitted in the pleadings, assess the conduct of the parties, and attack the credibility of witnesses. He may indulge in oratorical conceit or flourish and in illustrations and metaphorical allusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Nevertheless, there are limitations as to proper argument. The Court said, <em>id. </em>at 413, 326 A.2d 707:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">As a limitation upon the general scope of permissible closing argument this Court in <em>Esterline v. State, </em>105 Md. 629, 66 A. 269 (1907), cautioned that counsel should not be permitted by the court, over proper objection, to state and comment upon facts not in evidence or to state what he could have proven. Persistence in such course of conduct may furnish good grounds for a new trial. The conduct of the trial must of necessity rest largely in the control and discretion of the presiding judge and an appellate court should in no case interfere with that judgment unless there has been an <em>abuse of discretion </em>by the trial judge of a character likely to have injured the complaining party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">As we have seen, appellant maintains that his counsel\u2019s proposed summation with respect to the negative fingerprint results constituted a plausible interpretation of the report. The theory of the defense was that the latent fingerprint test was conducted to confirm or rule out the presence of <em>appellant\u2019s </em>latent fingerprints, with \u201cnegative\u201d test results for appellant\u2019s prints. In appellant\u2019s view, it was not the role of the court to interpret the report and conclude that it meant that no latent fingerprints whatsoever were recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Conversely, the State contends that the proposed argument was improper because there was no evidence of the recovery of any fingerprints from the weapon. It trumpets the testimony of Officer Thompson, who stated that \u201c[n]o prints could be lifted off the weapon.\u201d Then, in its closing argument, the State suggested that no prints could be recovered from the gun because of the nature of the surface of the weapon. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the State insists that the trial court properly determined that the test results set forth in the report necessarily meant that the weapon was completely negative for all prints; the test results were not limited to the presence or absence of <em>appellant\u2019s </em>fingerprints. Claiming that the defense\u2019s closing argument was at odds with the evidence, the State contends that the court properly limited defense counsel\u2019s summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In our view, there was no factual basis for the trial judge to declare, one way or the other, what the text of the report definitively meant, or to determine that the test yielded results that were negative for both appellant as well as the officers who also handled the firearm. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">As indicated, the report contained only appellant\u2019s name, and stated that the test results for latent fingerprints were \u201cnegative,\u201d without further explanation. Notably, the State never called the examiner to establish the exact meaning of the words used in the report. In our view, the report was ambiguous; it gave rise to conflicting inferences. By stating that the test for latent prints was \u201cnegative,\u201d the report could have meant that no prints at all were recovered, or it could have meant that the weapon was analyzed for appellant\u2019s prints, with negative results as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Moreover, Officer Thompson\u2019s testimony that \u201c[n]o prints could be lifted off the weapon\u201d was not clear. He could have meant that no prints could be lifted from the weapon, perhaps because of the nature of the surface of the gun. Yet, if the weapon could not yield fingerprints, as the State claims, the jury surely was left to wonder why the gun was even processed. Thompson also could have meant that no prints could be lifted because, for some unspecified reason, there were none to lift. Or, Thompson could have meant that the examiner looked for appellant\u2019s prints, but there were none, and thus none could be lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Nor did Thompson\u2019s testimony resolve the ambiguity in the text of the report; he did not answer the basic question whether the fingerprint analysis failed to detect appellant\u2019s prints only or, instead, prints from all sources. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Thompson was not offered as an expert, and did not explain, as the State argued in closing, that the gun surface was the kind that is not susceptible to fingerprint examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Significantly, the State does not cite any authority for the proposition that lay jurors would be in a position to determine whether latent prints were recoverable from the surface of the gun in issue. Indeed, several cases suggest that expert evidence is necessary to make the point that the State advanced. For example, in <em>Wise v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 127, 136, 751 A.2d 24, <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 276, 757 A.2d 811 (2000), the prosecution offered the testimony of an expert witness who \u201ctestified at length about fingerprinting and the difficulties of obtaining fingerprints from gel capsules and vials.\u201d In <em>United States v. Burdeau, </em>168 F.3d 352, 357 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 958, 120 S.Ct. 388, 145 L.Ed.2d 303 (1999), the government, over objection, \u201celicited testimony that identifiable fingerprints are almost never found on guns and only rarely found on other objects submitted for testing.\u201d In response to Burdeau\u2019s challenge to this testimony on direct appeal from his convictions for robbery and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, the Ninth Circuit stated that it has \u201cin the past upheld the admission of expert testimony that explained the possible reasons why fingerprints would not be found on an object.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357 (citing <em>United States v. Christophe, </em>833 F.2d 1296, 1300 (9th Cir.1987) and <em>United States v. Feldman, </em>788 F.2d 544, 554-55 (9th Cir.1986)). <em>See also United States v. Carpenter, </em>403 F.3d 9, 10 n. 1 (1st Cir.) (noting that to meet defense argument about lack of fingerprints, \u201cthe government adduced expert testimony to the effect that it is exceedingly difficult to lift viable fingerprints from the surfaces of this particular weapon.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1042, 125 S.Ct. 2284, 161 L.Ed.2d 1076 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Therefore, we agree with appellant that the court made \u201can impermissible decision of what was, and was not the ... inference to be drawn from the evidence presented.\u201d As appellant posits, \u201cThe trial judge is not the arbiter of which arguments are, and are not, logical, correct, or the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>available. It is not the role of the trial judge to assess which of two competing interpretations of a piece of evidence is the better one, and deny the defense the opportunity to submit their interpretation of the evidence.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">If the \u201cnegative\u201d result of the fingerprint test was ambiguous, the question remains as to whether defense counsel should have been allowed to argue that the fingerprint analysis yielded \u201cnegative\u201d results for <em>appellant\u2019s </em>prints. Given the failure of the prosecution to introduce foundational evidence that the test was negative in all respects, and its failure to adduce expert testimony to establish that no latent fingerprints could be recovered because of the nature of the gun\u2019s surface, the defense\u2019s theory as to the meaning of the report was just as plausible as the State\u2019s, and defense counsel should have been permitted to so argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Several cases shed light on the question of whether appellant\u2019s argument should have been permitted. We begin with <em>Eley v. State, </em>288 Md. 548, 419 A.2d 384 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In <em>Eley, </em>the defendant was convicted for assault with intent to murder and robbery with a deadly weapon. He claimed on appeal that the trial court erred by refusing to permit defense counsel to comment during summation on the lack of any fingerprint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Eley was prosecuted for shooting Gary Johnson. <em>Id. </em>at 549, 551, 419 A.2d 384. After the shooting, the assailant stole an automobile and fled the scene. Ms. Jones, the driver of the car the assailant used to escape, was a witness. But, the State \u201cneither listed nor presented any witnesses to discuss whether fingerprint tests had been performed on the Jones vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550, 419 A.2d 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">In his summation, defense counsel sought to point out the \u201cevidence that didn\u2019t exist[.]\u201d Judge Cole\u2019s opinion for the Court outlined what happened at trial, <em>id. </em>at 550-51, 419 A.2d 384:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">[MR.

The Court of Appeals agreed that the court erred by prohibiting defense counsel from commenting on the unexplained absence of fingerprints. <em>Id. </em>The Court recognized \u201c\u2018that counsel should not be permitted by the court, over proper objection, to state and comment upon facts not in evidence or to state what he could have proven.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 413, 326 A.2d 707). However, in reviewing \u201cthe purposes and application of this limitation,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Court concluded that the trial court erred \u201cin finding the limitation applicable to the case at <em>bar.[Id. </em>It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">The broad purpose of the rule is to prevent counsel for either the prosecution or the defense from attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>introduce to the jury matters which ought not to be considered in arriving at a determination of guilt or innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">* * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">The rule [prohibiting argument based on facts not in evidence] is designed also to prevent counsel from suggesting evidence which was not presented at trial thereby providing additional grounds for finding a defendant innocent or guilty. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>608 F.2d 659, 663 (5th Cir.1979). Enforcement of the rule prevents abuses such as where the prosecutor may merely intimate that he knows of additional evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt which he did not present during his case, ... or where the prosecutor expressly argues that certain events did or did not happen when there is no evidence in the record to support such statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">* * if\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">Perhaps a more cogent reason for enforcing the rule is that arguments of counsel which are outside the record are improper because they allude to sources which are not subject to cross examination and cannot be tested for reliability. Permitting such arguments denies the defendant the right to confront his accusers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 552-53, 419 A.2d 384 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">We agree that, where there is <em>unexplained </em>silence concerning a routine and reliable method of identification especially in a case where the identification testimony is at least subject to some question, it is within the scope of permissible argument to comment on this gap in the proof offered.[ ] Here, Eley sought to argue that the State had a reliable method of proving he was the assailant by introducing evidence of his fingerprints on the car. Since the State did not explain its failure to do so, he sought to establish the adverse inference, through argument of counsel, that his fingerprints were not on the car and, therefore he was not at the scene. This seems to us to be permissible argument particularly in light of the fact that Ms. Jones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>could not identify him as her assailant and that other witnesses may have been regarded as biased by the jury because of their relation to Johnson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 555-56, 419 A.2d 384 (italics in <em>Eley, </em>boldface added).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>Sample v. State, </em>314 Md. 202, 550 A.2d 661 (1988), is also instructive. Sample was convicted of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in a public place. A police officer stopped the automobile in which Sample had been riding. The officer went to the front passenger side door and ordered Sample out of the vehicle. Sample \u201cheld a three-quarter length leather coat draped over his arm\u201d and, after he took a step toward the officer, turned and fled on foot. <em>Id. </em>at 205, 550 A.2d 661. During the pursuit, officers saw Sample\u2019s right arm move upward and saw a handgun \u201chit the street.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">At trial, Sample\u2019s defense counsel took aim at \u201cthe holes in the State\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 550 A.2d 661. He told the jury in his opening statement that they \u201cwould hear evidence that the State could have taken fingerprints[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>His closing argument, in which he attempted to exploit the lack of fingerprint evidence, was foreclosed after the prosecutor objected. Sample challenged that ruling on appeal. We affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed. It rejected the State\u2019s argument that <em>Eley </em>was inapposite. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 550 A.2d 661. Declining to apply <em>Eley </em>\u201cso narrowly,\u201d the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 208-09, 550 A.2d 661:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">Even though Officer Allen\u2019s testimony was not directly contradicted by another witness, that does not mean it was unchallenged. By his cross-examination of the officer, and in his opening statement as well as his closing argument, Sample\u2019s attorney made it abundantly clear that he was challenging Officer Allen\u2019s assertion that a gun had been dropped by Sample, or that any bullets were found in a coat pocket, or that if bullets were so found, the coat was shown to have been Sample\u2019s. The jury was under no obligation to believe every fact testified to by Officer Allen, even though his testimony was not directly refuted by another witness. We may think the State\u2019s evidence was quite strong, as did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the trial judge, but it is the jury who must evaluate the officer\u2019s credibility and determine what actually occurred. Under the circumstances, <em>we conclude that Sample should have been permitted to comment upon the </em>unexplainedn <em>absence of fingerprint evidence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">* * $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\"><em>The prohibition of comment on the absence of fingerprint evidence in this case was error, and we reverse. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The Court added, <em>id. </em>at 209 n. 2, 550 A.2d 661:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">We do not suggest that the explanation [that fingerprints were not discovered on an item] must always be explicit in order to justify limitation of argument. When the surface supposedly touched is such that a trial judge may judicially notice the fact that fingerprints could not be obtained from it, and the record demonstrates the basis for the judge\u2019s decision, a defendant may be precluded from arguing that an inference of favorable fingerprint evidence may be drawn from the State\u2019s failure to introduce any fingerprint evidence. Even in such a case, however, the defendant would not be precluded, in arguing the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, from generally contrasting the quality of fingerprint evidence or other highly reliable evidence with the quality of the evidence presented in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-9\"><em>United States v. Hoffman, </em>296 U.S.App.D.C. 21, 964 F.2d 21 (D.C.Cir.1992) (per curiam), is also noteworthy. There, the two defendants were convicted of narcotics offenses. Amtrak agents had discovered and seized narcotics from their luggage, but the items were not tested for fingerprints. On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the defendants asserted that the trial court erred by preventing defense counsel from arguing to the jury that it should \u201cdraw various adverse inferences\u201d from the government\u2019s failure to introduce fingerprint evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 24. The appellate court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The court distinguished <em>Eley, </em>on which the appellants relied.

However, as Appellants point out, some of the language in <em>Eley </em>seems to go further, suggesting that the kinds of inferences urged by Hoffman\u2019s counsel in this case would be permissible even in the absence of any evidentiary foundation. <em>See Eley, </em>[288 Md. at 553, 419 A.2d 384] (suggesting that unexplained absence of fingerprint evidence \u201cpermit[s] the adverse inference that the evidence would have been unfavorable to the State\u201d). To the extent that <em>Eley </em>so holds, we part company with the Maryland Court of Appeals[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">To be sure, the D.C. Circuit recognized that defense counsel \u201cmust be permitted to argue all reasonable inferences from facts in the record[,]\u201d including \u201cnegative inferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24.

It was on that basis that the appellate court upheld the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the argument sought by the defense. The court explained, 964 F.2d at 25 (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">... Hoffman\u2019s attorney moved from arguing fair inferences from the record to arguing the existence of facts <em>not </em>in the record-wz., that the police did not look for fingerprints, that fingerprints could have been obtained from the plastic bags containing the narcotics and that standard police procedure required fingerprint analysis. Because neither defense attorney had laid any evidentiary foundation for those assertions-by, for example, asking one of the officers on cross-examination whether the plastic bags were (or could have been) tested for fingerprints, and whether standard proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>dure required such testing-Hoffman\u2019s argument was improper.11 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err, much less abuse its discretion, in refusing to permit the argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><em>United States v.

Co-defendants Day and Poindexter were convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and use of a firearm in a drug trafficking scheme. They challenged the trial court\u2019s preclusion of closing argument on the lack of fingerprint evidence. The Sixth Circuit awarded Day a new trial but affirmed Poindexter\u2019s convictions.

In our judgment, the error cannot be deemed harmless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">While it is entirely possible the jury could reach the same result if defense counsel had been permitted to make his argument without the impact of the trial court\u2019s curative instruction, we cannot conclude that the error here did not have the capacity to lead the jury \u201cto a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d ... We thus reverse defendant\u2019s convictions and remand the matter for a new trial. It is unnecessary to address defendant\u2019s remaining contentions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjQ\"><em>Loyal, </em>899 A.2d at 1016-18 (citations omitted). <em>Cf. Wheeler v. United States, </em>930 A.2d 232, 242, 245 (D.C.2007) (trial court erred by instructing the jury that the \u201cabsence of any finger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>print evidence, standing alone, does not constitute reasonable doubt as to the firearm charges,\u201d explaining that the instruction was erroneous because it \u201cwas contrary to the elemental premise that a critical assessment of that evidence [the lack of fingerprints] was for the jury ... to make[.]\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">We conclude that the trial court erred by drawing the inference from the report that the fingerprint test was negative for all latent prints. In doing so, it invaded the province of the jury to evaluate and construe the evidence. It follows that the court abused its discretion when it foreclosed appellant\u2019s closing argument with respect to the defense\u2019s interpretation of the report. As the Court said in <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 412, 326 A.2d 707:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">Counsel is free to use the testimony most favorable to his side of the argument to the jury, and the evidence may be examined, collated, sifted and treated in his own way. Moreover, if counsel does not make any statement of fact not fairly deducible from the evidence his argument is not improper, although the inferences discussed are illogical and erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Therefore, we shall vacate appellant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">In view of our disposition, we need not address whether the court erred in its instruction to the jury to disregard defense counsel\u2019s argument. Nor need we consider appellant\u2019s contention that counsel\u2019s summation was an \u201cinvited response\u201d to the prosecutor\u2019s explanation as to why no fingerprints were on the weapon. Finally, we shall not address whether the trial court plainly erred when it permitted the prosecutor to cross-examine appellant by asking three \u201cwere they lying\u201d questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">For the guidance of the trial court in the event of a new trial, we will briefly address the contention that the trial court abused its discretion by forbidding cross-examination of the State\u2019s law enforcement witnesses with respect to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>assignment to the Baltimore City Southwest District FLEX Squad.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The \u201cFLEX unit is a plain clothes squad within the Baltimore City Police Department that responds to varying locations during different time periods depending on crime trends.\u201d <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 148 n. 1, 872 A.2d 25 (2005). <em>See Ransome v. State, </em>373 Md. 99, 119, 816 A.2d 901 (2003). The Southwest District FLEX Squad was the subject of scrutiny after a woman claimed that she had been raped in the FLEX Squad office. <em>See Smith v. Danielczyk, </em>400 Md. 98, 106, 928 A.2d 795 (2007). In the process of investigating the assault, controlled dangerous substances were located in the offices of the FLEX Squad. <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On the second day of trial, the prosecutor made an oral motion <em>in limine </em>requesting an order to curtail any inquiry by the defense into the assignments of the law enforcement prosecution witnesses with the FLEX Squad. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I wanted to basically do a motion in limine to prevent any more \u2014 any further questions regarding the Southwest District FLEX Unit or any other questions that possibly could come up in cross-examination or in the closing argument of defense counsel with respect to the Southwest District FLEX Unit investigation and also with respect to any sort of initiative that Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>sioner Hamm had or anything that doesn\u2019t pertain to this particular case with respect to investigations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\">THE COURT: [Defense Counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: (inaudible) credibility of the officers as far as the directive by Commissioner Hamm. That is public \u2014 that\u2019s public record. I think this door was opened up by counsel when he mentioned about \u2014 in his questioning about the officers getting \u2014 if there was a quota or if there were bonuses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">THE COURT: He did not ask about quotas. He asked if there were any bonuses or promotions. He did not ask about any quotas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Maybe my notes are incorrect, Your Honor. I have\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">THE COURT: Did you ask about quotas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: The questions that I asked about quotas came in my redirect. The first question asked in cross-examination of Officer Thompson was whether or not he knew that the \u2014 if he was a member of the Southwest District FLEX Unit that was under investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">THE COURT: Well, there are two issues with respect to the motion in limine, the investigation of the FLEX Unit and the introduction or cross-examination with respect to any quotas set by Commissioner Hamm. Do you wish to be heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor. As far as\u2014 that\u2019s the officer\u2019s patrol there. I don\u2019t have a problem with not mentioning anything about if they\u2019re under investigation, but the officer indicated that he was a member of the Southwest FLEX Unit. That\u2019s what his assignment is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">THE COURT: All right. The fact that the Southwest FLEX Unit may be under investigation is not relevant in any way to any of the issues in this trial. There is no factual information that has been proffered to this Court that either of the officers who testified are themselves personally under investigation. Even if they were, certainly a full hearing to determine the probative value of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>information as it would pertain to <em>the </em>individual officers, which does not exist, versus the prejudicial nature of that information would be necessary. To simply ask the officers whether they are part of a unit that is under investigation by some law enforcement authority is impermissible. The motion in limine is granted with respect to that, as were any objections made by the State sustained by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Cross-examination is a \u201cright guaranteed by the common law.\u201d <em>Myer v. State, </em>403 Md. 463, 476, 943 A.2d 615 (2008). Further, the \u201cSixth Amendment right of confrontation includes the right to cross-examine about matters that affect a witness\u2019s bias, interest, or motive to lie.\u201d <em>Leeks v.

Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook </em>\u00a7 1302(E) (2d ed. 1993) (in turn quoting <em>Gates v. Kelley, </em>15 N.D. 639, 110 N.W. 770, 773 (N.D.1906))). As Judge Gilbert wrote for this Court in <em>Deinhardt v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 391, 397, 348 A.2d 286 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>277 Md. 736 (1976), \u201c[t]he opinion of the majority in <em>Davis [v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974)] makes clear that the refusal to allow the defense to demonstrate bias on the part of the prosecutor\u2019s principal witness through cross-examination is a denial of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment as well as an infringement upon [the defendant\u2019s] Sixth Amendment rights.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Although appellant does not proclaim that these particular members of the FLEX Squad were biased, the thrust of his argument is that the jury was entitled to assess their credibility in light of the \u201cinfamous\u201d reputation of the FLEX Squad. The \u201ccross-examination of a government \u2018star\u2019 witness is important, and a presumption favors free cross-examination by a defendant of possible bias[.]\u201d <em>United States v.

Abel, </em>469 U.S. 45, 52, 105 S.Ct. 465, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984). Thus, \u201cthe absolute preclusion of cross-examination pertaining to a witness\u2019s motive for testifying would be an abuse of discretion^]\u201d especially when the defense seeks to cross-examine the prosecution\u2019s key witness. <em>Leeks v. State, </em>110 Md.App. at 554, 678 A.2d 80 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The Court of Appeals instructs that \u201ctrial courts retain wide latitude in determining what evidence is material and relevant, and to that end, may limit, in their discretion, the extent to which a witness may be cross-examined for the purpose of showing bias [or other disqualifying factors].\u201d <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 413-14, 697 A.2d 432 (1997) (citations omitted). But, it is also clear that \u201ca cross-examiner must be given wide latitude in attempting to establish a witness\u2019 bias or motivation to testify falsely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We turn to the requirement that the defense establish a foundation or basis for the cross-examination. The trial court in this instance did not abuse its discretion in forbidding the \u201cFLEX Squad\u201d cross-examination because, as conceded by appellant, no proffer was tendered. We note that the \u201cConfrontation Clause guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>wish.\u201d <em>Delaware v.

The defense must also make an appropriate proffer with respect to the witness\u2019s participation in the FLEX Squad activities. In the final analysis, the defense must make a proper showing that evidence regarding a -witness\u2019s assignment to the FLEX Squad is both relevant and material.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-12\">.

Fingerprint evidence can only be introduced by an expert, and the expert would explain to you the science, the identification by fingerprints. So, it is improper to argue the absence of fingerprints proves anything. This should not be done. You certainly don't have any evidence to establish that fingerprints proved either of these defendants had anything to do with it, but [Day\u2019s counsel] is out of line when he argues that holds that up and says that you haven\u2019t proved my client guilty because there are no fingerprints.

You know that there could be no fingerprints on there, and it didn\u2019t prove that your client didn\u2019t handle them. I don\u2019t want you to get into that. That\u2019s not fair.
