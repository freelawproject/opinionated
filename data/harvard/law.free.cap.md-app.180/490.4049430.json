On October 30, 2002, appellee, the Maryland State Board of Physicians (\u201cthe Board\u201d), charged appellant, Steven A. Pickert, M.D., under the Maryland Medical Practice Act, Md.Code (1983, 2005 Repl-Vol.), \u00a7 14-401 <em>et seq. </em>of the Health Occupations Article (\u201cH.O.\u201d), for failing to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical and surgical care (H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(22)) and for failing to keep adequate medical records (H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(40)). Both charges were in regard to Dr. Pickert\u2019s evaluation and treatment of Patient A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Following an evidentiary hearing conducted by an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), a Proposed Decision issued by the ALJ, and written exceptions by the parties thereto, the Board issued a Final Opinion and Order on May 7, 2004. Concluding that Dr. Pickert violated H.O. \u00a7\u00a7 14-404(a)(22) and (40), the Board reprimanded Dr. Pickert and ordered his successful completion of two Board-approved courses, one in geriatric medicine and the other in medical record keeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">In a Memorandum Opinion and Order filed August 26, 2005, the Circuit Court for Frederick County, acting on Dr. Pickert\u2019s petition for judicial review, remanded the case to the Board, because, <em>inter alia, </em>the Board improperly excluded from evidence certain documents reflecting Dr. Pickert\u2019s defense verdict in his medical malpractice trial. No appeal was taken from the circuit court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>On February 13, 2006, in a Final Decision and Order on Remand, the Board again found that Dr. Pickert violated H.O. \u00a7\u00a7 14-404(a)(22) and (40) and imposed the same sanctions. In a Memorandum Opinion and Order filed on February 16, 2007, the circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s Final Decision and Order on Remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On appeal to this Court, Dr. Pickert presents one question for our review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">Did the Board err on remand by failing to follow the order of the circuit court to consider, as evidence, the jury verdict and judgment in favor of Dr. Pickert from a related medical malpractice action?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">For the following reasons, we shall uphold the decision of the Board and thus affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">On or about November 22, 2000, Patient A\u2019s survivors filed a claim against Dr. Pickert and others<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with the Health Claims Arbitration Office (\u201cHCAO\u201d). Arbitration by HCAO was waived, and the medical malpractice case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Frederick County. In their complaint, Patient A\u2019s survivors alleged that Dr. Pickert was negligent in the management of Patient A\u2019s medical care and failed to timely diagnose a large abdominal aortic aneurysm. The jury returned a verdict for Dr. Pickert, specifically finding that he was not negligent in the care and treatment of Patient A.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The HCAO claim was forwarded to the Board, which initiated an investigation of Dr. Pickert\u2019s treatment of Patient A. On October 30, 2002, the Board charged Dr. Pickert with violation of two provisions of the Maryland Medical Practice Act \u2014 failure to meet appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical and surgical care and failure to keep adequate medical records, H.O. \u00a7\u00a7 14-404(a)(22) and (40) respectively. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>An administrative law judge (ALJ) conducted an evidentiary hearing on these charges for five days in May, June, and July 2003. On September 29, 2003, the ALJ issued a Proposed Decision, to which the parties filed exceptions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">On May 7, 2004, the Board issued a Final Opinion and Order, modifying the ALJ\u2019s Proposed Decision. Concluding that Dr. Pickert violated Sections 14-404(a)(22) and (40), the Board ordered that Dr. Pickert be reprimanded and successfully complete two Board-approved courses. Additionally, in its opinion, the Board noted the following error of the ALJ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiaS\">[T]he ALJ admitted into evidence (as [Dr. Pickert\u2019s] Exhibits 7 and 8) the records which show that Dr. Pickert was not liable in the malpractice case involving [Patient A]. Although neither of these rulings had a substantial effect on this case, the Board disagrees with both. The ALJ clearly understood and articulated that a malpractice action is a different type of case in which a different issue is heard by a lay jury, and that therefore malpractice verdict documents are not particularly probative in a case arising under the Medical Practice Act \u2014 yet the ALJ admitted these non-probative documents into evidence. Since the Board agrees that documents reflecting the verdicts of medical malpractice cases are not probative of the issue in a Medical Practice Act case, they should not have been admitted into evidence. This ruling is intended as a prior adjudication as that term is used in Md. State Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 10-214(b). This is not intended to limit the use of any other evidence that may have been <em>used </em>in a malpractice case (transcripts of testimony, depositions, medical records, factual admissions, <em>etc.), </em>which evidence may well be probative and admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Thereafter, Dr. Pickert filed a petition for judicial review in circuit court, and oral argument was heard on August 17, 2005. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>In a Memorandum Opinion and Order filed August 26, 2005, the circuit court remanded the case to the Board. The circuit court concluded, in part,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the Board should not have excluded the documents reflecting Dr. Pickert\u2019s defense verdict in his medical malpractice trial from evidence in determining whether Dr. Pickert violated H.O. \u00a7 14-404. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">Md. State Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 10-213 states that, in an administrative agency appeal, each party in a contested case shall offer all of the evidence that the party wishes to have made part of the record. It goes on to state that the presiding officer may admit probative evidence that reasonable and prudent individuals commonly accept in the conduct of their affairs, and give probative effect to that evidence. The presiding officer may exclude evidence that is incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">While the Board is correct when it states that \u201cverdict sheets in prior malpractice actions reflect the vagaries of a different proceeding on a different issue ... in which the concepts of negligence, proximate cause, proof or monetary damages and contributory negligence are at play,\u201d we disagree that this makes the verdict sheet incompetent, irrelevant, or immaterial. [Dr. Pickert\u2019s] defense verdict in his medical malpractice case, reflecting a jury\u2019s determination that [Dr. Pickert] did not breach his duty of care, is a piece of evidence that a reasonable and prudent individual would commonly accept when deciding whether there had been a violation of the medical standard of care under \u00a7 14-404(a)(22) of the Medical Practice Act. While the AL J, and ultimately the Board, could have decided to give little weight to the verdict of the jury in its decision, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>improper to hold that the verdict was completely non-probative and not consider it as evidence. Because the verdict sheet was neither incompetent, immaterial, or irrelevant, and because a reasonable and prudent individual would consider it when determining whether Dr. Pickert violated the medical standard of care, this evidence was not subject to exclusion under \u00a7 10-213(d) of the State Government [AJrticle of the Annotated Code of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">On February 13, 2006, the Board issued a Final Decision and Order on Remand. The Board again found that Dr. Pickert violated the standard of care in his treatment of Patient A under H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(22) and failed to keep adequate medical records in violation of H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(40). As before, the Board ordered that Dr. Pickert be reprimanded and successfully complete two Board-approved courses. In reference to Dr. Pickert\u2019s defense verdict, the Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3I\">In its Memorandum Opinion and Order, the circuit court found that the Board should have considered the defense verdict in a prior medical malpractice case filed against Dr. Pickert in deciding whether he provided substandard medical care under the Medical Practice Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">On remand, the Board convened to re-consider this case and issues this Final Decision and Order on Remand after considering the directives in the circuit court\u2019s remand order, specifically, that the Board ... consider as evidence [Dr. Pickert\u2019s] Exhibit 7 (\u201cJudgment\u201d), and [Dr. Pickert\u2019s] Exhibit 8 (jury \u201cVerdict Sheet\u201d) that Dr. Pickert proffered during the evidentiary hearing before the [ALJ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">The Board agrees with the State that the malpractice jury verdict sheet and judgment in Dr. Pickert\u2019s favor does not bind the Board to a finding that Dr. Pickert violated the Medical Practice Act by providing substandard medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>care. The Board agrees with the State that the issue of the standard of quality medical care in a physician licensure disciplinary case poses a different question answered by different legal standards and different triers of fact. As the circuit court ruled, these two documents were only pieces of evidence to be considered along with the other 20 documentary exhibits and expert witness testimony admitted into evidence at the evidentiary hearing before the [ALJ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">The Board concludes that a jury\u2019s verdict, regardless of whether the verdict is \u201cnegligent\u201d or \u201cnot negligent,\u201d in a related medical malpractice case has no conclusive, binding effect on the Board\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the issue of whether Dr. Pickert violated section 14-404(a)(22) of the Medical Practice Act by providing substandard medical care to the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">The circuit court has ruled that the Board\u2019s ruling [in] its Final Opinion and Order of May 7, 2004, which flatly excluded those documents from evidence, was an error of law. The Board, not having appealed the circuit court\u2019s decision, is bound by the law of the case to admit and consider those documents. The Board had previously opined that admission or not of these documents would not have any \u201csubstantial effect\u201d on the case. In considering these documents now, on remand, the Board finds that they have no substantial effect on the case. These documents reflect the opinion of a lay jury on a related but different issue in a different context. The documents are admitted, but the Board has given them little weight. The Board\u2019s consideration of these documents has not changed in any way the Board\u2019s factual findings or legal conclusions, nor does it have any effect on the sanction imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">On March 14, 2006, Dr. Pickert filed a petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s Final Decision and Order on Remand in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>circuit court. In a Memorandum Opinion and Order filed February 16, 2007, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s Final Decision and Order on Remand. In relevant part, the court noted that the Board appropriately considered the defense verdict as evidence, and therefore, did not violate the circuit court\u2019s remand order of August 26, 2005. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axv\">On remand, the Board clearly considered the verdict sheet, but chose to give it very little weight in its consideration of all the evidence. The Board stated, \u201c[t]he documents are admitted, but the Board has given them little weight.\u201d The Board\u2019s decision to give the jury verdict little weight is not inconsistent with this Court\u2019s order. This Court merely ordered that the evidence be considered, not that the evidence be given any significant weight or conclusionary and binding effect. Thus the Board\u2019s statement that the jury verdict sheet \u201chas no conclusive, binding effect on the Board\u2019s ultimate conclusion\u201d is consistent with this Court\u2019s Order. The Board was free to attach any significance to the evidence it felt necessary, so long as the evidence was at least considered. It was the Board\u2019s prerogative to decide that the jury verdict sheet had no significant effect on its final decision. Because the Board definitively stated that it considered the jury verdict as a piece of evidence, this Court finds that the Board did not violate its Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Dr. Pickert timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In reviewing the decision of an administrative agency, \u201c \u2018we reevaluate the decision of the agency, not the decision of the lower court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Days Cove Reclamation Co. v. Queen Anne\u2019s County, </em>146 Md.App. 469, 484, 807 A.2d 156 (2002) (quoting <em>Gigeous v. Eastern Correctional Instit., </em>363 Md. 481, 495-96, 769 A.2d 912 (2001)). We examine whether the agency\u2019s decision is \u201c \u2018in accordance with the law or whether it is arbitrary, illegal, and capricious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Md. Dep\u2019t. of the Env\u2019t. v. Ives, </em>136 Md.App. 581, 585, 766 A.2d 657 (2001) (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>omitted). Thus, our role is \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">When reviewing an agency\u2019s conclusions of law, \u201cwe may substitute our judgment for that of the agency\u201d if we conclude that the agency\u2019s decision is based on \u201cerroneous conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Ives, </em>136 Md.App. at 585, 766 A.2d 657. When, however, we decide \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s conclusions were premised on an error of law, we ordinarily give \u2018considerable weight\u2019 to \u2018an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Rotwein, </em>169 Md.App. 716, 727, 906 A.2d 959 (2006) (quoting <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 68-69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Here, Dr. Pickert does not claim that the Board\u2019s decision is not based on substantial evidence. Rather, Dr. Pickert asserts that the Board erred as a matter of law when it \u201cfailed to comply with the [cjircuit [cjourt\u2019s [ojrder.\u201d Accordingly, we will review the Board\u2019s decision to determine if it is based on an erroneous conclusion of law. <em>See Ives, </em>136 Md.App. at 585, 766 A.2d 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Dr. Pickert argues that the Board, in its Final Decision and Order on Remand, \u201cfailed to comply with the [cjircuit [cjourt\u2019s order, because ... it did not consider the jury verdict as competent, relevant, or material evidence\u201d as ordered by the circuit court. According to Dr. Pickert, the Board merely \u201crepeated what it has stated in its original <em>order </em>\u2014 i.e., it gave no weight to the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d and provided no explanation for \u201cits perfunctory decision.\u201d Dr. Pickert elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">The Board gives no reason why the jury verdict was not worthy of consideration. It gives no reason why the verdict was not relevant. It gives no reason why the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>conclusion is superior to a jury verdict. The jury was bound by the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard. The ALJ and the Board were bound to the more rigorous \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Because \u201cthe Board failed to consider the jury verdict on remand,\u201d Dr. Pickert requests a reversal and remand of the Board\u2019s Final Decision and Order on Remand.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The short answer to Dr. Pickert\u2019s contention lies in the plain language of the Board\u2019s Final Decision and Order on Remand. The Board stated that it \u201cconvened to re-consider this case ... after considering the directives in the circuit court\u2019s remand order, specifically, that the Board ... consider as evidence [Dr. Pickert\u2019s] Exhibit 7 (\u201cJudgment\u201d), and [Dr. Pickert\u2019s] Exhibit 8 (jury \u201cVerdict Sheet\u201d) that Dr. Pickert proffered during the evidentiary hearing before the [ALJ].\u201d Further, the Board acknowledged the binding effect of the circuit court\u2019s order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">The circuit court has ruled that the Board\u2019s ruling [in] its Final Opinion and Order of May 7, 2004, which flatly excluded those documents from evidence, was an error of law. The Board, not having appealed the circuit court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>decision, is bound by the law of the case to admit and consider those documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The Board then wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">The Board had previously opined that admission or not of these documents would not have any \u201csubstantial effect\u201d on the case. In considering these documents now, on remand, the Board finds that they have no substantial effect on the case. These documents reflect the opinion of a lay jury on a related but different issue in a different context. The documents are admitted, but the Board has given them little weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">It is clear from the above language that the Board followed the circuit court\u2019s remand order by admitting into evidence the malpractice jury verdict sheet and judgment and considering those documents in reaching its decision. The fact that the Board decided to give those documents \u201clittle weight\u201d in determining whether Dr. Pickert violated the applicable standard of care under the Medical Practice Act is also consistent with the circuit court\u2019s remand order, in which the court explained that, had the Board admitted the defense verdict into evidence, it \u201ccould have decided to give little weight to the verdict of the jury in its decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Dr. Pickert relies on <em>Powell v. Md. Aviation Admin., </em>336 Md. 210, 647 A.2d 437 (1994). He complains that he should be entitled to the same protections as the State employee in <em>Powell. </em>In <em>Powell, </em>the employee was found guilty of criminal charges at a bench trial in circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 214, 647 A.2d 437. In a subsequent disciplinary hearing, in which the same misconduct was charged, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) decided that \u201c \u2018this forum ... will also not second guess the judge\u2019s determination of [the employee\u2019s] guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 647 A.2d 437. The Court of Appeals held that the finding of the employee\u2019s guilt may be used in the \u201cadministrative proceeding as evidence of the misconduct, but that the guilty finding may not be given conclusive effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>647 A.2d 437. In so holding, the Court determined that \u201cthe ALJ erred in giving conclusive effect to the guilty finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 647 A.2d 437. Rather, the ALJ \u201cshould have resolved the credibility dispute on all of the evidence and that, in that process the ALJ was free to substitute her judgment for that of the circuit court on whether [the employee] had engaged in the conduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The Board\u2019s Final Decision and Order on Remand is consistent with <em>Powell. </em>The Board stated that Dr. Pickert\u2019s defense verdict and judgment did not bind its ultimate decision. Instead, both documents served as \u201conly pieces of evidence to be considered along with the other 20 documentary exhibits and expert witness testimony admitted into evidence at the evidentiary hearing before the [ALJ].\u201d In line with <em>Powell, </em>the Board opined: \u201c[A] jury\u2019s verdict ... in a related medical malpractice case has no <em>conclusive, </em>binding effect on the Board\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the issue of whether Dr. Pickert violated section 14-404(a)(22) of the Medical Practice Act by providing substandard medical care to the patient.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Finally, Dr. Pickert complains that the Board, in its opinion, provided no reason why the jury verdict was \u201cnot relevant\u201d or \u201cworthy of consideration.\u201d Also, noting that the Board and ALJ \u201cwere bound to the more rigorous \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 standard\u201d than the preponderance of the evidence standard applicable in his malpractice case, Dr. Pickert asks: \u201c[I]f ... the jury found there was no violation of the standard of care, on what basis does the Board so cavalierly dismiss the jury\u2019s verdict when its standard of proof is far more rigorous?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Contrary to Dr. Pickert\u2019s assertion, the Board did explain why it was giving the jury verdict \u201clittle weight.\u201d The Board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">[T]he issue of the standard of quality medical care in a physician licensure disciplinary case poses a different question answered by different legal standards and different triers of fact. As the circuit court ruled, these two docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ments were only pieces of evidence to be considered along with the other 20 documentary exhibits and expert witness testimony admitted into evidence at the evidentiary hearing before the [ALJ],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The Board concluded that the documents evidencing the jury verdict and judgment would \u201chave no substantial effect on the case\u201d because \u201c[tjhese documents reflect the opinion of a lay jury on a related but different issue in a different context.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Notwithstanding this explanation, counsel for Dr. Pickert asserted at oral argument before this Court that the Board should have given more specific reasons why the jury verdict was rejected. We disagree. The only evidence relating to the malpractice case before the Board was (1) the jury verdict sheet, which stated that Dr. Pickert was not \u201cnegligent in the medical care and treatment of [Patient A],\u201d and (2) the judgment issued by the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Frederick County in favor of Dr. Pickert and against the plaintiffs. The Board did not have before it a transcript of any of the testimony from the malpractice trial, nor any of the trial exhibits. In short, the Board had no knowledge of what evidence was before the jury or whether that evidence was materially different from the evidence before the Board. Consequently, the Board did not have any basis on which to provide a more specific explanation for rejecting the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Furthermore, there are several distinctions between a medical malpractice case and the Board\u2019s disciplinary action. Medical malpractice actions in circuit court and administrative proceedings before the Board are entirely different proceedings. Medical malpractice actions are governed by Sections 3-2A-01 <em>et seq. </em>and 3-2C-01 and 02 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-01 <em>et seq., </em>3-2C-01 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Disciplinary proceedings before the Board, on the other hand, are governed by the Medical Practice Act and its regulations codified in COMAR 10.32.02. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Medical malpractice cases are tort actions consisting of different elements of proof in which liability is determined. Administrative actions under the MPA are intended to \u201cprovide the Board with sufficient authority to assure a high standard of medical care from physicians licensed in this State.\u201d <em>Solomon v. Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance, </em>132 Md.App. 447, 455, 752 A.2d 1217, <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 275, 757 A.2d 811 (2000).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No proof of injury or harm is required to take disciplinary actions against a physician\u2019s license. <em>See </em>H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a). Consequently, the outcome of the related, but entirely different, proceedings need not be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Most critically, Dr. Pickert\u2019s medical malpractice case and the administrative proceeding involved different triers of fact. A lay jury\u2019s finding that Dr. Pickert was not liable in the tort action does not control the Board\u2019s decision in a disciplinary proceeding under the Medical Practice Act, in which the Board makes its own independent evaluation based upon its medical expertise. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-213(i) of the State Government Article (stating that the Board may \u201cuse its experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge in the evaluation of the evidence.\u201d); <em>Solomon, </em>132 Md.App. at 455, 752 A.2d 1217 (\u201c \u2018[T]he expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999))). This distinction alone, without further explanation, can justify a decision by the Board different from a malpractice jury verdict, even taking into consideration the higher burden of proof. A trier of fact, be it the Board or a jury, can believe all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness. <em>See Fowler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>394 Md. 331, 342, 906 A.2d 347 (2006) (\u201cIt is well-settled in this State that it is the function of an administrative agency to make factual findings and to draw inferences from the facts found.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Hunter, </em>162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Md.App. 385, 398, 875 A.2d 157 (2005) (\u201cIt is ... at the very core of the common law trial by jury ... to trust in its fact finders, after full disclosure to them, to assess the credibility of the witnesses and to weigh the impact of their testimony.\u201d (quoting <em>Bailey v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 83, 93, 294 A.2d 123 (1972))).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In sum, having admitted the jury verdict sheet and judgment from Dr. Pickert\u2019s malpractice case and reconsidering all of the evidence, the Board decided, with adequate explanation, that those documents were of \u201clittle weight\u201d and did not warrant a departure from the Board\u2019s prior decision that Dr. Pickert violated H.O. \u00a7\u00a7 14-404(a)(22) and 14-404(a)(40) of the Medical Practice Act. We agree with the Board\u2019s statement in its brief that \u201c[i]t was the Board\u2019s prerogative, in light of its medical expertise, the law underlying its own disciplinary proceedings and the civil tort trial, and the record facts, to decide what effect the jury\u2019s verdict in the malpractice case should have on the Board\u2019s ultimate decision on whether Dr. Pickert violated the standard of care established under the Medical Practice Act.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that the Board did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY AFFIRMED.

The other defendants were Dr. Pickert's professional association, another physician, and Frederick Memorial Hospital, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\">. Although the hearing was held before an ALJ, the Board retained final decision-making authority. <em>See </em>H.O. \u00a7 14-405(e) (stating that, after conducting the hearing, the ALJ \u201cshall refer proposed factual findings to the Board for the Board\u2019s disposition.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b518-6\">. The court also concluded that the Board improperly found that Dr. Pickert violated the standard of quality medical care for a greater period of time than Dr. Pickert was charged. The Board\u2019s resolution of that issue on remand is not before us in the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\">. In addition, Dr. Pickert contends that the Board went well beyond the dictates of circuit court\u2019s opinion and order by ''revisit[ing] matters beyond the scope of remand.\u201d Specifically Dr. Pickert argues that the Board had no authority to revisit Findings 21, 22, 24, and 25 and the comments on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">In its Final Decision and Order on Remand, the Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">\"[I]n reconsidering this case on remand, the Board again considered the entire record in this case, including the record made before the [ALJ], the written and oral exceptions to the [ALJ\u2019s] Proposed Decision submitted to the Board by Dr. Pickert and the State; and the written argument submitted to the Board by the State and Dr. Pickert on the issues in the circuit court\u2019s remand order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">In addition, the Board expressly reconsidered Findings 21, 22, 23, and 24 in light of Dr. Pickert\u2019s defense verdict and concluded, as to each finding, that the \"malpractice jury verdict sheet and judgment, to the extent that they reach this factual issue, are of insufficient weight to change the Board\u2019s finding on this issue.\u201d In our view, it would have been error for the Board <em>not </em>to have reconsidered each finding in light of the malpractice jury verdict sheet and judgment. Finally, the Board\u2019s Finding 25 and comments thereon, which were in favor of Dr. Pickert, were identical to the Board\u2019s previous finding and comments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\">.
