Michigan Trucking Co v Public Service Comm, </em>451 Mich 906 (1996). Appellant claims that the PSC was without authority to issue the order because the act was preempted by Congress when it enacted the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (faaaa), PL 103-305. Appellant also contends that even if the PSC had authority to implement the safety rating system, its action is invalid because it failed to follow proper procedures for the promulgation of rules before issuing the order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The Motor Carrier Act was amended by the Legislature with the enactment of 1993 PA 352, effective January 13, 1994. One of the changes, codified at MCL 479.43; MSA 22.587(3), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">The public service commission, in cooperation with the department of state police, will develop and implement by rule or order a motor carrier safety rating system within 12 months after the effective date of this article. In the rating system, an unsatisfactory rating shall not be imposed without an on-site safety review being conducted by the department of state police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Following enactment of this statute, representatives of the PSC Motor Carrier Regulation Division and the Motor Carrier Division of the Michigan State Police met to develop a system of safety ratings. On December 19, 1994, they recommended that the PSC adopt a safety rating system based on the United States Department of Transportation safety ratings and supplemented by additional information from the Secretary of State\u2019s office and the state police with regard to driving records, accidents, citations, and vehicle inspections. On January 11, 1995, the PSC issued an order immediately implementing the safety rating sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>tem, finding that \u201cthe process proposed by the Motor Carrier Division and the State Police . . . meets the requirements of MCL 479.43.\u201d The PSC also found that the proposed system was in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d and that a public hearing was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Initially, we reject the psc\u2019s argument that appellant lacks standing to challenge the order because it is not an aggrieved party. \u201cA party is aggrieved by a judgment or order when it operates on the party\u2019s rights and property, or bears directly on the party\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Midland Cogeneration Venture Ltd Partnership v Public Service Comm, </em>199 Mich App 286, 304; 501 NW2d 573 (1993); see also <em>In re Quality of Service Standards for Regulated Telecommunication Services, </em>204 Mich App 607, 610; 516 NW2d 142 (1994). The safety rating system at issue bears directly on the tracks operated by appellant\u2019s members and on their right to operate those tracks in Michigan. Therefore, appellant has standing to challenge the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Appellant first argues that the psc lacked authority to issue the order because the entire Motor Carrier Act was preempted by the amendments of the FAAM, which were signed into law on August 23, 1994. Specifically, 49 USC 11501 was amended by adding subsection h (referred to as \u00a7 601), which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">(h) Preemption of State economic regulation of motor carriers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of 2 or more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... or any motor private carrier with respect to the transportation of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>(2) Matters not covered. Paragraph (1)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">(A) shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles, the authority of a State to impose highway route controls dr limitations based on the size or weight of the motor vehicle or the hazardous nature of the cargo, or the authority of a State to regulate motor carriers with regard to minimum amounts of financial responsibility relating to insurance requirements and self-insurance authorization. [Now recodified as 49 USC 14501(c).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The extent to which the amendments of the faaaa. preempted the Motor Carrier Act was expressly considered in <em>In re Federal Preemption of Provisions of the Motor Carrier Act, </em>223 Mich App 288; 566 NW2d 299 (1997). In that case, this Court rejected the argument that the amendments of the faaaa completely preempted the Motor Carrier Act. <em>Id. </em>at 301. This Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">it is clear and unambiguous from the language of \u00a7 601 that the congressional intent was not to preempt all state regulation of the trucking industry. Section 601 expressly excepts from its preemptive effect significant aspects of regulation, including safety regulation .... If the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the plain meaning of the statute reflects the legislative intent. Furthermore, the House Conference Report indicates that \u201ceconomic regulation\u201d is intended to be preempted and that states retain their authority to regulate various aspects of the transportation industry. . . . The argument that Congress intended to preempt the entire field of regulation of motor carriers fails in the face of the language of the legislation and its history. The psc\u2019s determination that \u00a7 601 was intended to preempt only economic regulation is consistent with the language and history of the legislation. <em>[Id. </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">In this case, it is difficult to conceive of an order that would fall more directly than the one at issue into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>express exemption for safety regulation from the scope of preemption. Therefore, we find that appellant has not met its burden of showing by clear and satisfactory evidence that the order was unlawful or unreasonable on this basis. MCL 462.26(8); MSA 22.45(8); <em>Federal Armored Service, Inc v Public Service Comm, </em>204 Mich App 24, 27; 514 NW2d 178 (1994). We find that the rules promulgated by the PSC pursuant to its authority from the Legislature fall squarely within the scope of the exception to federal preemption under \u00a7 601(h)(2) of the faaaa.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">Appellant next argues that, even if the PSC acted within the scope of its authority in issuing the order, the order is invalid because it is essentially a rule that was not properly promulgated pursuant to the rule-making procedures set forth in the Administrative Procedures Act (apa), MCL 24.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.560(101) <em>el seq. </em>It is undisputed that the safety rating system in this case was not promulgated pursuant to apa procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">MCL 24.207; MSA 3.560(107), a provision of the apa, sets forth the definition of a rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\u201cRule\u201d means an agency regulation, statement, standard, policy, ruling, or instruction of general applicability that implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency, or that prescribes the organization, procedure, or practice of the agency, including the amendment, suspension, or rescission thereof, but does not include any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">Q) a decision by an agency to exercise or not to exercise a permissive statutory power, although private rights or interests are affected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>In this case MCL \u00a7 479.43; MSA 22.587(3) directly and explicitly authorizes the PSC to implement, either by rule or order, a safety rating system for motor carriers. Because the safety rating system is clearly an exercise of permissive statutory power, it is exempted from formal adoption and promulgation under the APA. See <em>Pyke v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>182 Mich App 619, 630-631; 453 NW2d 274 (1990); <em>Hinderer v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>95 Mich App 716, 724-727; 291 NW2d 672 (1980); <em>Columbini v Director, Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>93 Mich App 157; 286 NW2d 77 (1979). This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the statute does not expressly require the PSC to promulgate the rating system before implementation. Cf. <em>Pyke, supra </em>at 632. In addition, it is reasonable to assume that any safety rating system would be hotly contested by the regulated carriers and that subjecting the safety rating system to the formal hearing and promulgation requirements of the apa would make it impossible for the PSC to have the system in place within twelve months, the time frame prescribed by the statute. \u201cIn construing a statute, . . . unreasonable results are to be avoided wherever possible.\u201d <em>In re Telecommunications Tariffs, </em>210 Mich App 533, 541; 534 NW2d 194 (1995). Accordingly, we conclude that the order is valid because it falls within the exception contained in MCL 24.207 (j); MSA 3.560(107)(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
