We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">This 1991 case returns to this Court after remand. The original petition concerning Brittany was filed on April 25, 1991, and was based on abuse, neglect, and abandonment by the parents. On October 11, 1991, the probate court terminated the parental rights of respondent and his wife, Kim Hamlet, pursuant to MCL 712A.19b(3)(g); MSA 27.3178(598.19b)(3)(g). On July 23, 1993, this Court reversed the probate court\u2019s decision with respect to respondent on the basis that the probate court committed error requiring reversal by not securing respondent\u2019s physical presence at the termination hearing as required by due process. (It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>appears that respondent was in the Oakland County Jail at the time of the hearing, and that his whereabouts were not \u201cunknown\u201d as had been represented to the court.) <em>In re Hamlet, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued July 23, 1993 (Docket Nos. 148996, 150137). The panel also found that the probate court clearly erred in finding that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the termination of the parents\u2019 parental rights. The mother of the children has since released her parental rights to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">On remand, the probate court primarily focused on the period since this Court reversed the original decision to terminate the parental rights to Brittany (Kevin having been bom in the interim). A brief overview of this case, as it relates to respondent, is provided by the initial service plan entered into the record at the September 1993 review hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">Brittany was removed from her parents\u2019 care in April of 1991. . . . Since Brittany has been in foster care, her father Gary Hamlet has been incarcerated during a good part of this time. Mr. Hamlet was in the Livingston County Jail at the time of the initial court involvement in June of 1991. From June 1991 until March 1992, Gary was in the Livingston County Jail, Wayne County Jail and the Oakland County Jail. Gary was in jail for writing bad checks and also under police protection because he witnessed a murder in Detroit. It is unclear whether Gary was out of jail during any of that time period. Gary was placed on work release from the Oakland County Jail in April of 1992. ... In November of 1992, Gary was [placed on probation] from jail. . . .Gary was arrested on 3-25-93 for failing to report to his parole officer. He has been incarcerated since that day. At this present time, this worker is aware of charges pending against Gary Hamlet in three counties. Gary is charged with writing a bad check in Genesee county. . . . Gary was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>arraigned in Livingston County District Court on August 11, 1993. The charge in this court was writing a check with insufficient funds in the amount of $60.00. Gary has charges of three bad checks pending in Saginaw County. He states the prosecutor in Saginaw County intends to charge him with false pretenses, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in jail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Concerning respondent\u2019s parenting skills, the report provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">The previous record shows that Gary Hamlet had very poor parenting skills during the time of Brittany\u2019s early life. The record states that Gary Hamlet provided virtually no child care. He expected others to care for his baby. At the present time, Kim states that this assessment was true. She states that Gary paid no attention to Brittany\u2019s needs, but would hold her only when he wanted to hold her, not when Brittany needed attention. Gary was out of jail on [probation] at the time of Kevin\u2019s birth. Kim states that Gary was very different during Kevin\u2019s early months. She states Gary was very attentive to Kevin\u2019s needs. He participated fully in the feeding, bathing, diapering and burping of baby Kevin. Kim could give no explanation as to how this change came about, but only that Gary had changed a great deal. Gary continued to live with his wife and infant until Kevin was 2 months old. When Kevin was 2 months old, Kim separated from him and got her own home. Gary was then arrested approximately one month later and has been incarcerated ever since. There has been no opportunity to observe Gary interacting with his children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">During the next two years, the court held several review hearings, and several updated service plans were entered into the record. On September 13, 1995, the hearing on the petition to terminate respondent\u2019s parental rights to Brittany and Kevin commenced. Respondent remained incarcerated during the entire proceeding. Brittany was just over five years old and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Kevin was approximately two and a half years old. Most notably, several persons employed by the Department of Social Services and persons called as expert witnesses testified regarding respondent\u2019s parenting potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Eunice Kallio, a foster care worker, was assigned to this case after remand. Kallio testified that during her entire tenure on the case, which spanned seventeen months, respondent was incarcerated. She believed that respondent was cooperative, but because he was incarcerated, he was unable to accomplish any of the goals of the service plans or prepare himself to care for his children. Kallio recommended termination of respondent\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Beverly Thorpe, a foster care worker, testified as an expert in the area of social work. She was assigned to this case in January 1995, shortly before respondent was transferred to a half-way house. When she assumed the case, respondent had met none of the goals set forth in the parent-agency agreement. Thorpe prepared a new parent-agency agreement in February 1995, while respondent was at the half-way house. Although respondent began a parenting class and a spouse abuse class, he did not participate in Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings as required. Respondent also failed to establish a safe and suitable residence for the children, failed to maintain a lifestyle free of criminal activities, failed to cease the use of chemicals and alcohol, failed to seek treatment for chemical dependency and counseling, failed to successfully internalize the counseling and chemical dependency treatment, failed to choose and work with a therapist for nine months, and did not demonstrate that he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>provide a sufficient income to provide for the needs of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Thorpe prepared an updated parent-agency agreement on April 6, 1995. At the time of the termination hearing, Thoipe had seen no progress by respondent toward successfully, completing the parent-agency agreement steps. Thorpe noted that it would take a completely committed parent somewhere between a year and a half to two years to complete the goals on the parent-agency agreement. Because the children cannot tolerate a wait of another two years or more, Thoipe recommended that respondent\u2019s parental rights be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Denise DeKett, a field agent for the DSS at the Flint Correction Center Half-Way Program, assumed respondent\u2019s case on January 17, 1995. DeKett indicated that, although substance abuse treatment was made available to respondent, he failed to participate in the substance abuse program or attend aa or na meetings. Respondent frequently attended a parenting class and a domestic violence program at the ywca, but did not complete either class. Respondent was eventually charged with escape and transferred from her facility on April 4, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Diane Valente, a social worker, testified as an expert in the area of children and family therapy. She was assigned to provide therapy for Brittany in September of 1993, and again in August of 1995. Valente opined that even if respondent were released from prison, the children would not have time to wait for the necessary changes before respondent could care for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Ann Marie Tabatowski-Bush, a therapist, testified as an expert in the area of family therapy regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Brittany. Tabatowski-Bush noted several problems with Brittany, including: acting out, an uncontrollable temper, screaming fits, and inappropriate sexual touching of Kevin. Tabatowski-Bush stated Brittany had not bonded with respondent. On the basis of her knowledge of Brittany and the family\u2019s dynamics, Tabatowski-Bush recommended that respondent\u2019s parental rights be terminated immediately so that Brittany could be placed in a stable household.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Jane Mildred, a clinical social worker at the University of Michigan and an expert in the area of family assessment and psychological reports, assessed respondent in 1993 and 1995. She testified that respondent required long-term therapy, probably five to seven years, to deal with his personal issues. Mildred stated that because respondent has not spent significant time in the community, he has not demonstrated whether he can remain drug free. Mildred recommended that respondent\u2019s parental rights be terminated because he is unable to deal with his issues within a reasonable time, considering the ages and needs of Brittany and Kevin.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Charlene Kushler, Ph.D., testified as an expert in the area of psychology. Dr. Kushler gave respondent a clinical interview and a series of psychological tests, including the Rorschach test. The Rorschach test results showed, among other things, that respondent had an antisocial personality disorder. Kushler opined that because of this disorder, coupled with respondent\u2019s narcissism, it is very unlikely that he will respond to any therapy. Kushler opined that, as a result of respondent\u2019s diagnosis, he will never be able to parent his children adequately.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Zhigang Wang, a limited license psychologist with the Department of Corrections, testified as an expert in the area of clinical psychology. Wang also found that respondent has an antisocial personality disorder. Wang, however, believes that respondent\u2019s behavior may change with counseling and clinical intervention. Wang indicated that respondent has learned from the substance abuse counseling and has internalized what he is learning in their therapy sessions. Wang, nevertheless, was unable to predict whether respondent will be a good parent in the future given the insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">On January 10, 1996, the probate court entered its lengthy and detailed opinion and order terminating the respondent\u2019s parental rights to the children. In terminating respondent\u2019s parental rights, the court concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that the children were at \u201cserious risk of harm due to the lack of permanency of a family or a preimary [sic] care giver.\u201d The court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">Mr. Hamlet has a very lengthy criminal history dating back to 1983 when he was twenty years old, according to his parole eligibility report, Exhibit 25. He has had approximately nine felony convictions and has been incarcerated almost continuously since 1987. Each of the three times he was out of prison during the five years of Brittany\u2019s life, he could not sustain a crime free and substance free life style and ended up being returned to the Department of Corrections. During these five years his children have desperately needed him as a care giver, however, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that he has failed to provide them with proper care and custody without regard to his stated intent to do otherwise. Furthermore, due to Mr. Hamlet\u2019s character and personality traits which are not amenable to change without long term therapy, the Court further finds based on clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Ham<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>let will not be able to provide proper care and custody within a reasonable time considering the age of these children. They need and deserve permanency now. They are at serious risk of permanent psychological damage without that stability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration and a new trial, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">On appeal, respondent first argues that the probate court\u2019s finding that the statutory ground for termination was proved by clear and convincing evidence was clearly erroneous. We disagree. A decision regarding termination is reviewed in its entirety for clear error. <em>In re Hall-Smith, </em>222 Mich App 470, 472; 564 NW2d 156 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">MCL 712A.19b(3)(g); MSA 27.3178(598.19b)(3)(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">The court may terminate the parental rights of a parent to a child if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, 1 or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">(g) The parent, <em>without regard to intent, fails to provide proper care or custody for the child and there is no reasonable expectation that the parent will be able to provide proper care and custody within a reasonable time considering the age of the child. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">We acknowledge that, viewed in a light most favorable to respondent, he attempted to cooperate and made some endeavors, given his situation, to comply with the requirements of his parent-agency agreement. There is also some support in the record for respondent\u2019s claims of lack of optimum service by the Family Independence Agency. However, the statutory standard upon which the court based its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>to terminate respondent\u2019s parental rights requires the court to evaluate the acts and abilities of the parent, <em>\u201cwithout regard to intent\u201d </em>MCL 712A.19b(3)(g); MSA 27.3178(598.19b)(3)(g) (emphasis added). The record supports the court\u2019s finding by clear and convincing evidence that during the entire pendency of this matter, respondent never provided proper care and custody for his children. As the trial court stated in its opinion and order, respondent \u201chas a very lengthy criminal history dating back to 1983 . . . and has been incarcerated almost continuously since 1987.\u201d The evidence demonstrated that when respondent had the opportunity to parent his children during the brief periods that he was not incarcerated, he resumed criminal behavior and drug use. In fact, at the time of the last hearing in this matter in mid-1996, respondent remained incarcerated with no definite date by which he would be released having been set. Given that the children were bom in 1990 and 1992, it is clear that respondent has failed to provide proper care and custody for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">There is also no reasonable expectation that respondent will be able to provide proper care and custody within a reasonable time considering the age of the children. All the witnesses, including those favorable to respondent, agreed that respondent required extensive counseling and treatment before there was any chance that he could adequately parent the children. In fact, respondent\u2019s most favorable expert witness, Wang, agreed that respondent needed to continue counseling for a long time, at least a year or two, depending on his progress. Wang could not even opine whether respondent would be able to parent until respondent was out of prison and living life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>as a free man, making his own decisions, working, staying drug and alcohol free, and maintaining a home. We find that the probate court did not clearly err in finding the statutory ground for termination was met by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Respondent also claims that the probate court gave insufficient weight to the reports and testimony of Wang and Mildred, and gave too much weight to Kushler\u2019s report and testimony. Contrary to respondent\u2019s claim, in its opinion, the court addressed the reports and conclusions of all the expert psychologists who administered tests or counseling to respondent. Even if the court considered only Wang\u2019s report or only Mildred\u2019s report and disregarded the reports and testimony of Kushler, the court still would have had clear and convincing evidence to reach the same conclusion. Both Wang and Mildred indicated that neither could predict the potential of respondent\u2019s ability to parent until respondent was out of prison and could demonstrate his parenting abilities. Both also recommended long-term counseling. In fact, Mildred recommended termination of respondent\u2019s parental rights. Given that no date had been set for the respondent\u2019s release from incarceration and that respondent required extensive counseling before he could possibly parent the children, the court could conclude, on the basis of the report and testimony of Wang <em>or </em>Mildred, that respondent would not be able to provide a proper and stable home for his children within a reasonable time, considering the ages of the children. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Respondent also argues that the trial court inappropriately relied on the Rorschach test used by Kushler because it is not a reliable determiner of narcissism. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>In assessing an appellant\u2019s nonconstitutional allegation of error, the proper inquiry is whether there is \u201ca reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial. <em>People v Hubbard, </em>209 Mich App 234, 243; 530 NW2d 130 (1995). The general consensus, even from respondent\u2019s own testimony, was that he required years of therapy before he could adequately parent the children. As discussed previously, even if Kushler\u2019s entire report and testimony were eliminated from the record, the outcome would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Respondent further argues that the court erred in relying on Kushler\u2019s report because it was speculative and impermissibly based on \u201cwhat might happen in the future.\u201d Respondent cites <em>In re Hulbert, </em>186 Mich App 600, 601; 465 NW2d 36 (1990), where this Court found that the only evidence of actual neglect was that the mother\u2019s failure to keep the child on an apnea monitor for the full time as advised by a doctor and to give the child a proper dosage of medicine. The <em>Hulbert </em>Court found the trial court\u2019s reliance on the testimony of three psychologists who opined that the respondents\u2019 \u201cborderline\u201d mental conditions \u201cmay\u201d render them unfit or \u201cineffective\u201d parents or \u201cmight\u201d cause them to possibly inflict harm on their children was clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">This case is vastly different from <em>In re Hulbert. </em>Here, there is certainly sufficient evidence of specific acts of neglect of Brittany by respondent and of respondent\u2019s failure to provide a stable home for either child. Respondent had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and criminal behavior. He was incarcerated during almost the entire pendency of this case. There also was every indication that respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>would not be able to provide a stable home and properly parent his children within a reasonable time considering the ages of his children. In sum, the witnesses in this case did not merely speculate on what could happen in the future. Rather, they had concrete evidence of respondent\u2019s actions and personality traits on which to base a prognosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Respondent also claims that the probate court erred in incorporating the statement of facts from its 1991 opinion into its 1996 opinion because res judicata bars relitigation of the same facts. In order for a prior judgment to operate as a bar to a subsequent proceeding, three requirements must be satisfied: (1) the subject matter of the second action must be the same; (2) the parties or their privies must be the same; and (3) the prior judgment must have been on the merits. <em>In re Pardee, </em>190 Mich App 243, 247-248; 475 NW2d 870 (1991); <em>In re Koernke Estate, </em>169 Mich App 397, 399-400; 425 NW2d 795 (1988). If, however, the facts change or new facts develop, res judicata does not apply. <em>Id.; </em>see, also, <em>Labor Council, Michigan Fraternal Order Police v Detroit, </em>207 Mich App 606, 608; 525 NW2d 509 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Because this Court ordered that the prior judgment be reversed, the case be retried, and the probate court make findings of fact, res judicata did not bar the subsequent proceeding. This Court also found no fault with the factual findings in the probate court\u2019s 1991 opinion. In addition, new evidence concerning events, reports, and evaluations were made a part of the record. In its opinion of January 10, 1996, the probate court set forth over ten pages of additional findings of fact. Furthermore, as the probate court concluded, the findings \u201care supported on the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>record by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d In the second hearing, the witnesses all testified regarding the same facts that led up to the original termination order. Respondent has not given one example of any finding of fact incorporated by the probate court from the finding of facts from the 1991 opinion that was not supported by the evidence entered in the 1995 hearing. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Respondent further claims that the court erred in admitting testimony that weighed his home against the advantages of another potential home for the children. We agree that it is inappropriate to weigh the advantages of a foster home against the home of the natural and legal parents. <em>In re Mathers, </em>371 Mich 516, 530; 124 NW2d 878 (1963). Rather, their fitness as parents and the question of neglect of their children must be measured by statutory standards without reference to any particular alternative home that may be offered the children. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Contrary to respondent\u2019s claim, it is clear from the court\u2019s lengthy and detailed opinion that it did not base its decision to terminate respondent\u2019s parental rights on a comparison between a foster home and a home with respondent. The court\u2019s decision was clearly based on respondent\u2019s fitness as a parent under MCL 712A.19b(3)(g); MSA 27.3178(598.19b) (3)(g). Reversal therefore is not warranted on this basis. <em>In re Atkins, </em>112 Mich App 528, 541-542; 316 NW2d 477 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Respondent also argues that the court erred in denying his motion to reopen the proofs so that he could enter evidence establishing that a date for his release from incarceration had been set and that he had taken more programs and intended to seek inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>pendent counseling. Respondent, however, has failed to cite any support for this claim of error. A party may not merely announce a position and leave it to us to discover and rationalize the basis for the claim. <em>In re Toler, </em>193 Mich App 474, 477; 484 NW2d 672 (1992). Even if the proffered evidence had been considered, it would hot have caused the court to reconsider its decision to terminate respondent\u2019s parental rights, considering the ages of the children, the numerous other dates for the respondent\u2019s release proffered to the court, the extensive therapy required, and the length of time the children had been in limbo while this matter traveled through the courts. Again, we find no error in the probate court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Respondent also claims that MCL 712A.19b(5); MSA 27.3178(598.19b)(5) is unconstitutional because it shifts the <em>burden of proof </em>from the government to the parent to show that termination is not in the child\u2019s best interests. Because this issue involves a question of law, we review it de novo. <em>Cardinal Mooney High School v Michigan High School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>437 Mich 75, 80; 467 NW2d 21 (1991). Under established rules of statutory construction, statutes are presumed constitutional, and courts have a duty to construe a statute as constitutional unless unconstitutionality is clearly apparent. <em>Mahaffey v Attorney General, </em>222 Mich App 325, 344; 564 NW2d 104 (1997). Every reasonable presumption must be made in favor of constitutionality. <em>Vargo v Sauer, </em>215 Mich App 389, 394; 547 NW2d 40 (1996). To determine whether a statute violates due process, the pertinent issue is whether the statute bears a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective. <em>Mahaffey, supra </em>at 344. The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>bears the burden of overcoming the presumption of constitutionality. <em>Michigan Soft Drink Ass\u2019n v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>206 Mich App 392, 401; 522 NW2d 643 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">MCL 712A.19b(5); MSA 27.3178(598.19b)(5)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\"><em>If the court finds that there are grounds for termination of parental rights, </em>the court <em>shall </em>order termination of parental rights and order that additional efforts for reunification of the child with the parent shall not be made, unless the court finds that termination of parental rights to the child is clearly not in the child\u2019s best interests. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In <em>In re Hall-Smith, supra, </em>this Court recently addressed MCL 712A.19b(5); MSA 27.3178(598.19b)(5) and the burden of proof in a parental termination case. This Court found that \u201cthe <em>burden of proof remains with the petitioner </em>to show that <em>a statutory ground </em>for termination has been met by clear and convincing evidence, MCR 5.974(A)(3) and (F)(3).\u201d 222 Mich App 472-473 (emphasis added). The Court further found that, once the burden of proof is sustained, <em>\u201cthe burden of going forward with evidence that termination is clearly not in the child\u2019s best interest rests with the respondent.\u201d Id. </em>at 473 (emphasis added). \u2019\u2019Absent any evidence addressing this issue by the parent, termination of parental rights is <em>mandatory.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). <em>In re Hall-Smith </em>makes it clear that MCL 712A.19b(5); MSA 27.3178(598.19b)(5) does not shift the <em>burden of proof </em>onto the parents. Rather, MCL 712A.19b(5); MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>27.3178(598.19b)(5) simply requires that a parent put forth some evidence from which the trial court could conclude that termination is clearly not in the child\u2019s best interest. Accordingly, MCL 712A.19b(5); MSA 27.3178(598.19b)(5) is not unconstitutional.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Respondent argues that the probate court \u201cabused its discretion\u201d in finding that termination of his parental rights was in the children\u2019s best interests. We initially note that, contrary to respondent\u2019s statement of the issue, the court had a nondiscretionary decision regarding termination. MCL 712A.19b(5); MSA 27.3178(598.19b)(5) creates a mandatory presumption that can be rebutted only by a showing that termination is clearly not in the child\u2019s best interest. If no such showing is made and a statutory ground for termination has been established, the probate court is without discretion and must terminate parental rights. <em>In re </em>Hall-Smith, <em>supra </em>at 472-473.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Here, there was no evidence that termination of respondent\u2019s parental rights was clearly not in the children\u2019s best interests. At the time of the motion for a new trial, Brittany was almost six years old and Kevin was almost three and a half years old. There was extensive testimony concerning the needs of the children and the psychological problems they continued to suffer because of long-term uncertainties and the lack of any long-term stability. Termination of respondent\u2019s parental rights was clearly in the children\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Respondent further argues that the probate judge should have disqualified herself after the 1991 hearing because she was biased against respondent. Absent an actual personal bias or prejudice, a judge will not be disqualified. MCR 2.003(B)(1); <em>Cain v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>451 Mich 470, 495; 548 NW2d 210 (1996). Opinions formed by a judge on the basis of facts introduced or events that occur during the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible. <em>Id. </em>at 496. Likewise, judicial remarks during the course of a trial that are \u201c \u2018critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, n 30, quoting <em>Liteky v United States, </em>510 US 540, 555; 114 S Ct 1147; 127 L Ed 2d 474 (1994). Moreover, a party who challenges a judge on the basis of bias must overcome a heavy presumption of judicial impartiality. <em>Cain, supra </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We have reviewed respondent\u2019s claims of error and conclude that he has failed to overcome the heavy presumption of judicial impartiality. The majority of the excerpts on which respondent relies do not even hint of a personal bias or prejudice. There is no evidence that the probate judge harbored a deep-seated antagonism toward respondent. In fact, as respondent testified, the court personally helped him to participate in counseling and learning sessions in the prison when it wrote a note or called the prison on his behalf after he had so requested of the court. Respondent stated the court\u2019s participation in this matter \u201copened doors\u201d that never would have been opened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>otherwise. The fact that the court terminated respondent\u2019s parental rights is insufficient as a valid basis for bias or partiality. Moreover, there is overwhelming evidence that the opinions of the court were formed on the basis of facts introduced at the hearings, trial, and events that occurred during the course of this and prior proceedings. We therefore conclude that the probate judge did not err in denying respondent\u2019s motion to recuse herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In conclusion, we find that ample evidence of respondent\u2019s unfitness as a parent was presented at the termination hearing such that we find no error in the probate court\u2019s termination of respondent\u2019s parental rights pursuant to MCL 712A.19b(3)(g); MSA 27.3178(598.19b)(3)(g). We further find that respondent failed to put forth evidence that termination of his parental rights was clearly not in the children\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\"> This provision was added to the statute by 1994 PA 264, \u00a7 1, which was effective January 1, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\"> We note that the probate court incorrectly ruled that the statute was constitutional because it \u201cdid not consider the burden shifted to the respondent to prove that it was not in the children\u2019s best interest for parental rights to be terminated.\u201d This Court, however, will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision if the right result is reached for the wrong reason. <em>In re Powers, </em>208 Mich App 582, 591; 528 NW2d 799 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
