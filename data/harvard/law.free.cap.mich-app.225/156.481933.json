We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">As we stated in our earlier opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-16\">Plaintiff worked as a part-time floor detective for defendant Meijer, Incorporated. When she was hired by Meijer, plaintiff signed an employment form agreeing to abide [by] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>defendant\u2019s policies and procedures. Plaintiff acknowledged receipt of an associate handbook which included defendant\u2019s termination appeal procedure. This document unambiguously provided that terminated employees were required to exhaust the alternate dispute resolution (adr) procedure. A separate document which plaintiff received indicated that exhaustion of the adr procedure is a condition precedent to litigation, regardless of whether the arbitrator\u2019s final decision is upheld by a trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">When defendant terminated plaintiff\u2019s employment, she [plaintiff] invoked the adr procedure. She indicated that she believed she had been discharged without just cause, that she was the victim of gender discrimination, and that she had been retaliated against for complaining about not being given a full-time job. Following an investigation, plaintiff\u2019s discharge was upheld at step one of the adr procedure. Plaintiff chose not to pursue the next step in the procedure, binding arbitration, and instead filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful discharge, gender discrimination, and retaliation. Defendant moved for summary or partial disposition, or for an order enforcing the adr award or procedure. At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, plaintiff withdrew her retaliation claim. The court then denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition of the wrongful discharge and gender discrimination claims. <em>[Rushton v Meijer, Inc, </em>unpublished memorandum opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued March 1, 1995 (Docket No. 164272).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In our original opinion, we reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of a defense motion for summary disposition of plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge and gender discrimination claims because plaintiff had failed to exhaust the remedies available to her pursuant to the ADR procedure that defendant had established to resolve such claims. In reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition of plaintiff\u2019s gender discrimination claim, we relied on <em>Heurtebise v Reliable Business Computers, Inc, </em>207 Mich App 308; 523 NW2d 904 (1994), as controlling precedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>for the proposition that private agreements to arbitrate civil rights claims are enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The Michigan Supreme Court reversed this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heurtebise, </em>because the employee handbook contained language demonstrating that the employer did not intend to be bound by its provisions. 452 Mich 414. As the Supreme Court noted, the handbook in <em>Heurtebise </em>contained clauses stating: (1) the policies in the handbook do not create any employment or personal contract, express or implied; (2) the employer had the right to terminate employees\u2019 employment at any time, without notice, for any reason; and (3) the employer reserved the right to make modifications to any or all of the policies in the handbook. Thus, the instrument in <em>Heurtebise </em>expressly disclaiming contract status, yielding the employee no benefit above the minimal required status even to be an employee \u2014 namely, at-will status\u2014 and having provisions that could be changed unilaterally by the employer was, as might be expected, determined not to be a contract by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">It is in light of this holding that we are directed to reexamine the Meijer employee handbook. The dissimilarities are marked. Unlike the <em>Heurtebise </em>handbook, the Meijer handbook does not contain language stating that Meijer does not intend to be bound by its provisions. Further, it does not indicate that Meijer considers the policies not to create a contract and, finally, rather than an at-will termination policy, this instrument has consideration running to the employee in the form of an express promise of termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>from employment only for just cause. Were this the extent of the provisions of the Meijer handbook, we could easily discern its determinative distinctions from the <em>Heurtebise </em>booklet and find it to be a contract binding on both parties. There is, however, reservation language in the Meijer handbook stating that the existing policies may be \u201cmodified or deleted\u201d by the employer. This reservation clause, plaintiff argues, would allow all or part of the contractual provisions to be deleted and means that the instrument here at issue, just as the one in <em>Heurtebise, </em>is no contract at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">This argument has some allure, but on serious scrutiny, the problem plaintiff points to is illusory in the factual circumstances found here. It must be recalled that this instrument is an agreement to control an ongoing course of conduct between the employer and its employees. By its clear terms, they are both bound by it unless and until the employer chooses to change it. Even then, the employer cannot retroactively escape from its requirements. Any change can only take effect prospectively. See <em>In re Certified Question, </em>432 Mich 438, 441; 443 NW2d 112 (1989). Accordingly, because the alleged improper acts by the employer at issue here came before any change was made in the agreement by the employer (in fact, as far as we know, even <em>now </em>no changes have been instituted by the employer), both parties are bound. In particular, the parties are bound to utilize the exclusive ADR procedure for handling their contract dispute. While the reservation language in the handbook will allow Meijer, for example, to change its policy of being a just-cause employer to become an at-will employer, the change would be effective only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>from the time of the implementation of the change (and after reasonable employee notification). Until such a change is made (which might cause the new arrangement to run afoul of the <em>Heurtebise </em>holding), Meijer is bound by the handbook in its dealing with its employees. Indeed, any other conclusion would mean that an employer could never change its employment agreements with its employees. Once a just-cause employer would mean always a just-cause employer. No employer would be likely to choose voluntarily to be so bound, and, thus, plaintiffs position, if adopted, would have the unfortunate and surely undesirable consequence of discouraging the practice of granting employees just-cause termination protection. Moreover, if an employer should cavalierly eliminate provisions that restrict its options in dealing with its employees, arbitrability could be jeopardized under <em>Heurtebise, </em>and valued employees, the retention of whom no doubt prompted the adoption of the just-cause policy in the first place, might choose to leave the employer. <em>Rood v General Dynamics Corp, </em>444 Mich 107, 137-141; 507 NW2d 591 (1993). This economic regulation of the employment marketplace will undoubtedly cause an employer to exercise caution before making any change in the employment relationship, just as conditions of the employment market no doubt were factors considered in the granting of just-cause termination status in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Therefore, because the Meijer and <em>Heurtebise </em>handbooks are distinguishable, this plaintiff was bound by the handbook with regard to any contractual claim. The fact that Meijer could later change the agreement does not vitiate the fact that, as things currently stand, these parties are contractually bound. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ingly, Meijer can, consistent with prior case law, require employees to arbitrate contract disputes regarding adverse employment decisions. See, e.g., <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579, 624; 292 NW2d 880 (1989). Because plaintiff failed to pursue her breach of contract claim utilizing the required ADR procedure, she is barred from pursuing such a claim in the circuit court. <em>Renny v Port Huron Hosp, </em>427 Mich 415, 429-430; 398 NW2d 327 (1986); <em>Zeniuk v RKA, Inc, </em>189 Mich App 33, 35, 37-38; 472 NW2d 23 (1991). Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">With regard to plaintiff\u2019s gender discrimination claim, we conclude, in light of <em>Heurtebise, </em>that summary disposition was properly denied by the trial court. To this end, we agree with and adopt as our own the reasoning of Justice Cavanagh in parts m through VI of his opinion in <em>Heurtebise, </em>which addressed, albeit in dicta, the issue \u201cwhether private employers <em>can </em>require employees, as a condition of employment, to waive prospectively their right to pursue civil rights claims in a judicial forum.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 452 Mich 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">As noted by Justice Cavanagh in <em>Heurtebise, </em>\u201c[u]nlike federal law, Michigan has an unwavering history of faithfully defending an aggrieved individual\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>right to a judicial forum to remedy unlawful discrimination.\u201d 452 Mich 414. This unwavering history is currently reflected in the judicial remedies clause of Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29, as well as its legislative counterpart, MCL 37.2803; MSA 3.548(803). Article 5, \u00a7 29 of our state constitution establishes a civil rights commission with certain powers and responsibilities, and incorporates a judicial remedies clause: \u201cNothing contained in this section shall be construed to diminish the right of any party to direct and immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.\u201d Similarly, our Legislature in \u00a7 803 of the Civil Rights Act has reinforced and broadened the constitutional right of Michigan\u2019s citizens to immediate and direct judicial review of a civil rights claim: \u201cThis [civil rights] act shall not be construed to diminish the right of a person to direct or immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.\u201d Justice Cavanagh aptly concluded that \u00a7 803 \u201cexpressly prohibits an exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement.\u201d 452 Mich 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Michigan\u2019s declared public policy entitling a state civil rights plaintiff to direct and immediate review of such claims in the circuit court cannot be abrogated by contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">A contract which is contrary to public policy is illegal and void. <em>Federoff v Ewing, </em>386 Mich 474, 481; 192 NW2d 242 (1971). Public policy has been described as \u201cthe community common sense and common conscience, extended and applied throughout the State to matters of public morals, public health, public safety, public welfare, and the like.\u201d <em>Skutt v Grand Rapids, </em>275 Mich 258, 264; 266 NW 344 (1936). It is expressed in the constitution, statutes, judicial decisions, or customs and conventions of the people, and it concerns the primary principles of equity and justice. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>[Badon v General Motors Corp, </em>188 Mich App 430, 439; 470 NW2d 436 (1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Contrary to defendant Meijer\u2019s argument, we do not find the parties\u2019 employment contract to be governed by the federal arbitration act (faa), 9 USC 1 <em>et </em>seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Bernhardt v Polygraphic Co of America, Inc, </em>350 US 198, 200-201; 76 S Ct 273; 100 L Ed 199 (1956), Bernhardt, a New York resident, was hired by Polygraphic, a New York corporation, to be the superintendent of its lithographic plant in Vermont. Under the terms of the parties\u2019 employment contract (which contained an arbitration clause), Bernhardt \u201cwas to perform\u201d the contract after he \u201clater became a resident of Vermont.\u201d The Court held that the contract did not evidence \u201c \u2018a transaction involving commerce,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>at 200, and that the faa did not apply because there was no showing that Bernhardt, in performing the contract, \u201cwas working \u2018in\u2019 commerce, was producing goods for commerce, or was engaging in activity that affected commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. See also <em>Allied-Bruce </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>Terminix Cos, Inc v Dobson, </em>513 US 265; 115 S Ct 834; 130 L Ed 2d 753 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The facts of the present case are considerably less compelling than those in <em>Bernhardt. </em>Plaintiff Rushton was employed by Meijer as a floor detective. Her contractual duties did not facilitate, affect, or arise out of interstate or foreign commerce. Thus, even the broadest construction of the statutory phrase \u201cinvolving commerce\u201d cannot encompass plaintiffs employment contract with Meijer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, it is not enough that one party\u2019s business in general involves interstate activity. <em>Becker v Amoco Pipeline Co, </em>1989 US Dist LEXIS 11309 (ND Ill, 1989). Therefore, the fact that Meijer\u2019s general business activities may involve interstate commerce does not change the analysis because the proper focus under the FAA is on the particular contract at issue. Accordingly, we conclude that the FAA is inapplicable to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Only two of the dissent\u2019s arguments warrant a response. First, the dissent chides us for neglecting this state\u2019s statutory arbitration act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>sent argues overrides \u00a7 803 of the Civil Rights Act. A basic rule of statutory construction is that a statute specific in language and enacted contemporaneously with or after a general statute covering the same subject matter constitutes an exception to the general statute if there appears to be conflict between them. <em>State Hwy Comm\u2019r v Detroit City Controller, </em>331 Mich 337, 363-364; 49 NW2d 318 (1951). Here, \u00a7 803 of the Civil Rights Act \u2014 which was enacted in 1976 and took effect in 1977 \u2014 must be viewed as an exception to the generally applicable arbitration statute \u2014 which was enacted in 1963. Our courts have never held out the proposition suggested by the dissent that the Legislature, when enacting legislation that indirectly affects extant legislation, must expressly repeal or amend the affected statute. Thus, the fact that the arbitration statute does not expressly exempt civil rights claims in the context of employment disputes is of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Second, the dissent asserts that our decision will force \u201csophisticated employers,\u201d like defendant Meijer, either to abandon its policy of just-cause employment or to simply leave the state for a business-friendly environment. The dissent \u201ccannot help but sense\u201d that we, along with three members of the Supreme Court, have attempted to \u201cstr[ike] a blow for the working people of this state.\u201d As members of the judiciary, however, our mandate is to enforce the laws as written by the Legislature. We acknowledge our surprise at our dissenting colleague\u2019s willingness, in this case, to abandon his long-held support for the unambiguous written word of the Legislature. Indeed, it was our dissenting colleague who stated that, \u201c[c]learly, it is for the Legislature, and not the courts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>to change substantive laws affecting public policy,\u201d <em>McDougall v Eliuk, </em>218 Mich App 501, 518-519; 554 NW2d 56 (1996) (Taylor, RJ., dissenting), and that \u201cjudicial misgivings regarding the wisdom of a legislative . . . policy do not provide, absent a violation of the constitution, a legal foundation for overriding legislative intent,\u201d but rather that \u201c[t]he wisdom of this policy is a political question to be resolved in the political forum,\u201d <em>People v Poole, </em>218 Mich App 702, 714; 555 NW2d 485 (1996). Section 803 plainly and forcefully provides that the Civil Rights Act <em>\u201cshall not </em>be construed to diminish the right of a person <em>to direct or immediate </em>legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state\u201d (emphasis added). The dissent\u2019s ambitious attempt to create an ambiguity where none exists is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">After examining federal and Michigan civil rights jurisprudence, Justice Cavanagh stated, and we agree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">In conclusion, with respect to equal opportunity in the pursuit of civil liberties, such as employment, I believe that the right to be free from unlawful discrimination is of highest priority and too important to jeopardize. I further believe that the constitutionally guaranteed direct access to a judicial forum is so interwoven with the enforcement of civil rights in Michigan that we cannot separate them without potentially harming substantive civil rights. Accordingly, I would hold that the Michigan Constitution and our longstanding public policy preclude the enforcement of prospective arbitration agreements in employment contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">Finally, I would assert that I am not backing away from the public policy favoring alternative means of dispute resolution. For aggrieved individuals seeking to pursue remedies for claims that have already accrued, arbitration may present a quicker and cheaper means of receiving relief, and I fully support the parties\u2019 voluntary intent in those cases. I would limit this opinion to the arbitration agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ments in employment contracts entered into before any claim for unlawful discrimination has accrued. <em>[Heurtebise, </em>452 Mich 437-438.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Accordingly, we hold that Meijer cannot require its employees, as a condition of employment, to waive prospectively their right to pursue direct and immediate review of civil rights claims in a judicial forum. The provision of the parties\u2019 private employment contract requiring plaintiff, a nonunion employee, to exhaust the termination appeal procedure, including binding arbitration, before filing a lawsuit in the circuit court, is void as it relates to her gender discrimination claim under Michigan law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s order denying defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition of plaintiff\u2019s gender discrimination claim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Reversed in part and affirmed in part.

Thus, the agreement to arbitrate, as it pertains to civil rights, has been found to violate public policy, and the court has rewritten the parties\u2019 agreement by striking that provision. Accordingly, the current state of the law is that the freedom to contract prospectively with regard to arbitration of civil rights claims is not available to our citizens on the asserted ground that such freedom offends public policy. I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In our jurisprudence, contractual freedom is the axiomatic norm, and to deviate from that norm requires justification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority asserts that there is such justification and that it is found in a constitutional provision, a statute, and a nonmajority opinion of the Supreme Court. Yet, as I explain below, the authority cited by the majority does not compel, or even allow, the conclusions that it has drawn from them. As a result, the majority has, without authority, but undoubtedly with good intentions, rewritten the parties\u2019 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In our original opinion in this case, we held that defendant was entitled to summary disposition of plaintiff\u2019s gender discrimination claim because she failed to exhaust the remedies available to her pursuant to defendant\u2019s alternative dispute resolution (ADR) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We held that plaintiff\u2019s sole remedy for her gender discrimination claim was the ADR procedure. <em>Rushton v Meijer, Inc, </em>unpublished memorandum opinion, issued March 1, 1995 (Docket No. 164272). The Supreme Court, 453 Mich 943 (1996), remanded this case to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Heurtebise v Reliable Business Computers, Inc, </em>452 Mich 405; 550 NW2d 243 (1996). First, there is nothing in the majority holding of <em>Heurtebise </em>that suggests our prior reversal of the trial court\u2019s holding was not the correct resolution of this issue. Indeed, a majority of the justices of the Supreme Court specifically declined to reach this issue. <em>Id. </em>at 438-439. Nevertheless, a minority opinion signed by two current and one former members of the Supreme Court stated in dicta that it is contrary to Michigan public policy to require an employee to waive resolution of a civil rights claim in a judicial forum as a condition of employment. That dicta has now been adopted, embellished, and made the law of this state as a result of part n of the majority opinion herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The conclusion of the minority opinion in <em>Heurtebise </em>is premised primarily upon Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29, which provides: \u201cNothing contained in this section [establishing the civil rights commission] shall be construed to diminish the right of any party to direct and immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state,\u201d and its statutory counterpart, MCL 37.2803; MSA 3.548(803), which provides: \u201cThis [civil rights] act shall not be construed to diminish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the right of a person to direct or immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.\u201d As explained below, the conclusion of the minority opinion in <em>Heurtebise </em>and the majority here is not established by the cited constitutional provision or the cited statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Indeed, the Supreme Court has definitively construed these provisions in a controlling opinion in a way that is not harmonious with the minority dicta opinion in <em>Heurtebise </em>or the majority opinion herein. In <em>Nummer v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>448 Mich 534, 550; 533 NW2d 250 (1995), the Supreme Court said that the above-cited constitutional provision and statute mean that \u201cthe Civil Rights Commission does not have exclusive jurisdiction over discrimination claims, but instead has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the cited constitutional language simply means that a person is not required to exhaust whatever remedies he may have with the Civil Rights Commission before filing a circuit court lawsuit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In no event can it be said, as the minority opinion in <em>Heurtebise </em>claims and the majority herein adopts, that this constitutional provision provides a nonwaivable right to a judicial forum or precludes the enforcement of prospective arbitration agreements in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>employment contracts. 452 Mich 436, 438. The cited constitutional provision simply does not address the propriety of prospective agreements to arbitrate civil rights disputes in employment contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The cited statutory language is similarly straightforward. Section 803 states that the Michigan Civil Rights Act itself is not to be construed to diminish the right of a person to direct or immediate legal or equitable remedies in Michigan courts. That is, the Legislature wished to make it clear that the remedies in the Civil Rights Act are cumulative to preexisting common-law and statutory rights. This was necessary because, before passage of the Civil Rights Act, certain civil rights were already guaranteed by the common-law and by statute, and the Legislature wanted to make clear that its broad entry into the field had not abrogated the previously existing common-law and statutory rights. See <em>Marsh v Dep\u2019t of Civil Service, </em>142 Mich App 557, 563, n 2, 567, n 6; 370 NW2d 613 (1985). See also <em>Heurtebise, supra </em>at 423. Thus, as with the constitutional provision, \u00a7 803 simply does not address the issue of the propriety of prospective agreements to arbitrate civil rights claims. Accord <em>Prudential Ins Co v Shammas, </em>865 F Supp 429, 433 (WD Mich, 1993) (the court rejected the argument that MCL 37.2803; MSA 3.548[803] precluded arbitration under the federal arbitration act of a Michigan civil rights claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">A statute that does address the issue is Michigan\u2019s statutory arbitration act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This act allows predispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>contracts to arbitrate<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and only excepts collective bargaining and certain real estate disputes from its purview. MCL 600.5001(3); MSA 27A.5001(3); MCL 600.5005; MSA 27A.5005. Because the act allows predispute agreements to arbitrate civil rights claims, it establishes Michigan\u2019s public policy concerning this issue. Obviously, if the Legislature wanted to preclude predispute agreements to arbitrate civil rights claims, it would have excluded such claims by name, just as it excluded collective bargaining agreements and certain real estate claims. The express exclusion of some claims implies inclusion of those not mentioned. <em>People v Jahner, </em>433 Mich 490, 500, n 3; 446 NW2d 151 (1989). Therefore, for this reason also, there is no jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>tification for this Court to substitute its judgment for that of the contracting parties in declaring the parties\u2019 predispute agreement to arbitrate invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Moreover, reading \u00a7 803 to produce the result that the majority reaches here requires one to ignore how explicitly our Legislature speaks when it wants to bar prospective contractual waivers of important rights. For example, in the Employment Security Act, the Legislature provided that no agreement by an individual to waive his right to benefits or any other rights under the act is valid. MCL 421.31; MSA 17.533. Similarly, when enacting the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, the Legislature provided that no agreement by an employee to waive his rights to compensation under the worker\u2019s compensation act before an injury shall be valid. MCL 418.815; MSA 17.237(815). In contrast, there is no waiver-bar language in either the constitution or \u00a7 803 vis-\u00e1-vis predispute agreements to arbitrate civil rights claims. This lack of language barring a waiver is inappropriately given no weight by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In addition, the majority misunderstands, and thus mischaracterizes, the import of the proper construction of the constitution and \u00a7 803. Defendant is not asserting that, because of the existence of the Civil Rights Commission section of the constitution or of the Civil Rights Act, plaintiff is precluded from going to the circuit court. Rather, defendant argues that these provisions do not mean one <em>must </em>go to the circuit court, and in no way preclude contracting parties from agreeing to a different forum than a court, to adjudicate their civil rights disputes. I agree with defendant\u2019s argument because this construction leaves the constitution and \u00a7 803 with the meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>their language clearly implies and also because it does not obliterate freedom of contract with regard to the matter here under consideration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Finally, the whole notion of prospective waivers of important rights is not, as the majority seems to believe, inherently repugnant to our constitutional order. Indeed, it is well established that rights of a higher standing than that of forum selection, i.e., constitutional rights themselves, may be prospectively waived.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Snepp v United States, </em>444 US 507; 100 S Ct 763; 62 L Ed 2d 704 (1980) (First Amendment right to speak or right about information gained in course of employment with government may be waived by contract); <em>Whispering Pines AFC, Home, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>212 Mich App 545, 550; 538 NW2d 452 (1995) (due process right to an evidentiary hearing to resolve a dispute may be waived by signing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>a contract with the government).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Given that these highly valued constitutional rights may be prospectively waived without offending public policy, how can it be seriously suggested that, without a statute or provision of the constitution prohibiting it, and, in fact, our state arbitration act allowing it, the right to have a circuit court to resolve a civil rights dispute may not be prospectively waived in favor of having such a claim adjudicated in an arbitral forum?</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The majority also adopts Justice Cavanagh\u2019s statement that \u00a7 803 expressly prohibits an exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement. I agree with this proposition of law, but note that it has no relevance to the question whether parties may enter into predispute agreements to arbitrate civil rights claims.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>proposition of law is irrelevant to the question before us because a contractual remedy is not an administrative remedy. It is important to remember what an administrative remedy is and what it is not. An administrative remedy is a remedy that is available from an administrative agency, such as the Civil Rights Commission. It is not, as the majority seems to suggest, any remedy other than a court remedy. To put a finer point on it, an administrative remedy is not one from an arbitration forum established through a privately established method of alternative dispute resolution. Thus, because we are dealing with an arbitration available through a valid contract, the doctrine that holds that a civil rights claimant need not exhaust administrative remedies is simply inapplicable. It is disingenuous for the majority to ignore the difference between an administrative remedy and a private contractual remedy, and there is no principled basis for treating a private contractual remedy as if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>were identical to a remedy available from an administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">At this point, then, at least to my satisfaction, the flaws in the majority\u2019s position have been demonstrated. This draws me to the conclusion that the real objection the majority has can be found at the end of the minority opinion in <em>Heurtebise. Id. </em>at 438. There, Justice Cavanagh states that he believes that the right to be free of unlawful discrimination is just <em>\u201ctoo important\u201d </em>to be left to any dispute resolution process, prospectively agreed upon, other than that available in a court. <em>Id. </em>at 438 (emphasis supplied). While a jurist can, of course, hold this view as a personal matter, I do not know how this gets converted into a rule of law given that any legal basis for this view has been demonstrated to be lacking. In a situation like the case at bar, it is for the Legislature (which as we have seen has spoken concerning this and allowed that which Justice Cavanagh and the majority opinion herein disallows), or for the people directly, through referendum or constitutional amendment, to establish as the public policy. Because the Legislature has acted to establish this public policy in this area, it is inappropriate for the majority to disregard that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Further, I respectfully point out that, in my view, Justice Cavanagh\u2019s position also is ill-advised because it can only be reached if one, notwithstanding protests to the contrary, <em>id. </em>at 438, holds the notion that arbitration is a second-rate type of fact-finding and remedy-producing vehicle that is to be discouraged in favor of traditional litigation. That, however, is inconsistent with how the courts view arbitration. Both the Michigan and the federal courts have enunciated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>strong public-policy positions that favor the utilization of arbitration to resolve disputes. Such statements are premised, in part, upon Congress\u2019 enactment of the federal arbitration act, 9 USC 1 to 15, and Michigan\u2019s enactment of the previously discussed statutory arbitration act, MCL 600.5001 <em>et </em>seq.; MSA 27A.5001, and clearly show that arbitration is favored as a means of resolving disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Gilmer v Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp, </em>500 US 20, 34, n 5; 111 S Ct 1647; 114 L Ed 2d 26 (1991), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">The Court in <em>Alexander v Gardner-Denver Co </em>[415 US 36; 94 S Ct 1011; 39 L Ed 2d 147 (1974)] also expressed the view that arbitration was inferior to the judicial process for resolving statutory claims. 415 US, at 57-58. That \u201cmistrust of the arbitral process,\u201d however, has been undermined by our recent arbitration decisions. <em>[Shearson American Express, Inc v McMahon, </em>482 US 220, 231-232; 107 S Ct 2332; 96 L Ed 2d 185 (1987)]. \u201c[W]e are well past the time when judicial suspicion of the desirability of arbitration and of the competence of arbitral tribunals inhibited the development of arbitration as an alternative means of dispute resolution.\u201d <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc, </em>473 US 614, 626-627 [87 L Ed 2d 444; 105 S Ct 3346] (1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Our Michigan courts have said no less. In <em>Huntington Woods v Ajax Paving Industries, Inc, </em>177 Mich App 351, 356; 441 NW2d 99 (1989), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds on rehearing 179 Mich App 600 (1989), Judge (now Justice) Marilyn Kelly said: \u201cOur courts have long been supportive of arbitration agreements and have discouraged efforts to circumvent their objectives.\u201d Also, in <em>Whispering Pines, supra </em>at 550, the Court stated: \u201c[T]he law favors contractual terms providing for alternate dispute resolution mechanisms.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Most recently, in <em>Brucker v McKinlay Transport, Inc, </em>454 Mich 8, 17; 557 NW2d 536 (1997), the Michigan Supreme Court stated: \u201c[P]arties who can locate an alternative method of dispute resolution are encouraged to bypass the courts and use other appropriate means.\u201d Indeed, Justice Cavanagh himself acknowledges this virtually uniform view by conceding that there is a public policy favoring alternative dispute resolution, while puzzlingly asserting that the import of this view does not adversely affect his position. <em>Heurtebise, supra </em>at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">One cannot help sensing that the members of the Supreme Court who joined in the <em>Heurtebise </em>minority opinion, as well as the majority here, feel that they have struck a blow for the working people of this state. After all, no arbitration of civil rights claims, and only full dress litigation with all of its protections, sounds at first blush to be protective of civil rights principles. Yet, the cost may well be that just-cause employers, such as Meijer, having had much of the value of their bargain (just-cause employment given in return for a promise to eliminate lengthy, costly civil rights litigation in court) stripped from them by this decision, will simply terminate the whole just-cause regime, as they have reserved the right to do, and return to at-will employment. Moreover, might it not be that, in practice, even just-cause disputes (that would still be subject to arbitration under part I of the majority opinion) will opportunistically be coupled with or pleaded as a civil rights claim,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in order to avoid arbitration? Whether this maneuvering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>will actually take place is less important than that it will be anticipated by sophisticated employers, thus providing an additional disincentive for an employer to enter into any agreement offering just-cause employment in return for an agreement to utilize arbitration to resolve employment-related disputes and thereby leaving employees in the less desirable status of at-will employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In short, can it be said with certainty that the majority\u2019s opinion has really advanced the cause of this state\u2019s employees? It can be doubted. The reason is that every worker cares about freedom from arbitrary termination while fewer, fortunately, have any need to worry about, or avail themselves of, civil rights remedies. While this calculus may not be every person\u2019s, it is for that reason it would be wise, especially given the legislative allowance of predispute agreements to arbitrate civil rights claims and no constitutional bar against it, not to impose our preferences on the parties and to allow them instead, as free men and women, to enter or not to enter into employment with these conditions. Were we to have ruled that just-cause employers may prospectively agree with their employees to arbitrate civil rights claims, one could reasonably assume that more at-will employers would seriously consider, and have incentive to become, just-cause employers. It is fortunate that ours may not be the final word on this question and that our Supreme Court, should it grant leave in this case (which I urge), will see this issue, as the <em>Heurtebise </em>majority\u2019s refusal to join the minority opinion may suggest, more clearly than the majority in this Court does.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>In my opinion, defendant was entitled to summary disposition of plaintiffs civil rights claim because the contract she had with Meijer required utilization of arbitration as the \u201cexclusive, final and binding method to resolve all claims arising out of termination from employment.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s civil rights have not been diminished one iota by the agreement to arbitrate, and the only waiver involved is the forum for deciding if her civil rights had been violated. <em>McKinstry v Valley Obstetrics-Gynecology Clinic, PC, </em>428 Mich 167; 405 NW2d 88 (1987). There is no valid reason not to enforce this contractual provision. Thus, I would hold that a just-cause employer that agrees to pay the costs of arbitration and authorizes the arbitration pan\u00e9l to grant any relief a court of law could grant, as Meijer\u2019s policy provides, may require a nonunion employee to arbitrate all employment-related disputes, including civil rights claims, as a condition of employment. Accord <em>Cole v Burns Int\u2019l Security Services, </em>323 US App DC 133; 105 F3d 1465 (1997) (employer may require arbitration of civil rights claims by employees if employer assumes responsibility for the payment of the arbitrator\u2019s compensation and arbitrators are authorized to grant all of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>As a final matter, one of the reasons cited by the trial court for refusing to summarily dismiss plaintiffs gender discrimination claim was the fact that the Meijer\u2019s termination appeal procedure requires a person whose employment has been terminated to invoke the procedure within fourteen days of discharge by filing a form. This issue was not ripe for the trial court\u2019s handling because, whether it is permissible or not to allow only fourteen days to file a claim, this plaintiff managed to meet the standard and cannot claim prejudice. The propriety of this short period simply was not relevant to defendant\u2019s motion because defendant was not claiming that plaintiff had failed to invoke the procedure within fourteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Because I would find the prospective agreement to arbitrate civil rights claims enforceable under Michigan law, I find it unnecessary to address defendant\u2019s claim that the federal arbitration act preempts a ruling to the contrary. See, e.g., <em>Great Western Mortgage Corp v Peacock, </em>110 F3d 222 (CA 3, 1997) (in enacting the federal arbitration act, Congress withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims that the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration), <em>Patterson v Tenet Healthcare, Inc, </em>113 F3d 832 (CA 8, 1997) (federal arbitration act required the plaintiff to arbitrate a state [Missouri] civil rights claim), <em>O\u2019Neil v Hilton Head Hosp, </em>115 F3d 272 (CA 4, 1997), and <em>Burns v Olde Discount Corp, </em>212 Mich App 576, 580; 538 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>NW2d 686 (1995) (state courts are bound under the Supremacy Clause, US Const, art VI, \u00a7 2, to enforce the substantive provisions of the federal arbitration act).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">For these reasons I would reverse and remand for entry of a judgment in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"> See, e.g., <em>Dep\u2019t of Navy v Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>295 US App DC 239, 248; 962 F 2d 48 (1992) (cited with approval in <em>Port Huron Ed Ass\u2019n v Port Huron Area School Dist, </em>452 Mich 309, 319; 550 NW2d 228 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">Because of the fundamental policy of freedom of contract, the parties are generally free to agree to whatever specific rules they like, and in most circumstances it is beyond the competence of the Authority, the National Labor Relations Board or the courts to interfere with the parties\u2019 choice.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\"> Plaintiff failed to exhaust a contractual remedy available to her under the termination appeal procedure when she failed to demand arbitration (step two) after the termination of her employment was upheld under step one of the termination appeal procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-5\"> I note that the majority does not respond to this argument. Indeed, the majority states that only two of my arguments warrant a response. I am unsure what that means but incline to the view that it means that they have no credible response to the positions they have declined to answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b187-6\"> This is in contrast to the federal system wherein a party must obtain a right to sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (eeoc) before asserting a federal civil rights claim in federal court. See <em>Nummer v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, supra </em>at 548, n 13 (exhaustion rules apply in the federal system); <em>Heurtebise, supra </em>at 419 (title vn requires claimants to exhaust administrative remedies with the eeoc before pursuing judicial relief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\"> The majority claims that I believe the state arbitration act \u201coverrides\u201d \u00a7 803. I do not believe it, nor have I said it. As set forth in my dissent, \u00a7 803 and the state arbitration act are not incompatible in any way. Thus I do not contend that either statute overrides the other. The majority\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>clusion that \u00a7 803 must be viewed as an exception to the state arbitration act is in error for the simple reason that the two statutes do not conflict. Because \u00a7 803 does not expressly forbid predispute agreements to arbitrate civil rights claims, something the state arbitration act allows, it is the majority\u2019s position that this authorization of the state arbitration act has been repealed by implication. The repeal by implication doctrine is inapplicable because the statutes can be read harmoniously. Our Supreme Court has addressed this situation and said: \u201c \u2018 \u201cRepeals by implication are not favored and will not be indulged in if there is any other reasonable construction.\u201d \u2019 \u201c <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>451 Mich 569, 576; 548 NW2d 900 (1996), quoting <em>House Speaker v State Administrative Bd, </em>441 Mich 547, 562; 495 NW2d 539 (1993), which in turn quoted <em>Attorney General ex rel Owen v Joyce, </em>233 Mich 619, 621; 207 NW2d 863 (1926). The majority has chosen to ignore this admonition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b189-10\"> MCL 600.5001(2); MSA 27A.5001(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-11\">A provision in a written contract to settle arbitration under this chapter, a controversy thereafter arising between the parties to the contract, with relation thereto, and in which it is agreed that a judgment of any circuit court may be rendered upon the award made pursuant to such agreement, shall be valid, enforceable and irrevocable save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the rescission or revocation of any contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Mejjer\u2019s adr procedure contains the necessary language that the decision of the arbitrator is intended to be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b191-5\"> The majority asserts that my construction of \u00a7 803 is inconsistent with my published admonitions encouraging all judges to exercise judicial restraint in deferring to the unambiguous word of the Legislature. It is pleasant, albeit a bit surprising, to see my two colleagues concerned about insufficient deference to the Legislature. But alas, as with most fresh converts, they are having trouble with the application of the doctrine. The problem here is that it is their position, not mine, that requires one to rewrite the statute. To reach the conclusion the majority reaches, one has to rewrite \u00a7 803 to state: <em>\u201cNeither </em>this act, <em>nor a private contract, nor the state arbitration act </em>shall be construed to diminish the right of a person to direct or immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.\u201d (Added language italicized.) This is not what I counseled in my dissent in <em>McDougall v Eliuk, </em>218 Mich App 501, 516 ff; 554 NW2d 56 (1996), lv pending. The proper thing to do in the case at bar is not to rewrite the statute as the majority has effectively done. Perhaps in future cases my brothers will better grasp the application of the principle, but for now I must take solace in the fact we at least agree with the principle of deferring to the Legislature absent constitutional concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\"> The adr procedure does not waive any of a plaintiff\u2019s civil rights \u2014 it only affects the forum that will determine if those rights have been violated. <em>McKinstry v Valley Obstetrics-Gynecology Clinic, PC, </em>428 Mich 167, 184; 405 NW2d 88 (1987); <em>Campbell v St John Hosp, </em>434 Mich 608, 615; 455 NW2d 695 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\"> Indeed, constitutional rights are also waived when a person fails to assert them.

In <em>MPES, </em>a labor union filed a civil rights complaint in the circuit court on behalf of three of its members. The trial court granted accelerated judgment because the collective bargaining agreement required all contract disputes to be submitted to arbitration. This Court reversed, stating that a classified civil servant (union member) may directly, and in the first instance, file a discrimination lawsuit in the circuit court without the necessity of exhausting rights under a collective bargaining agreement. Little rationale for this holding was given, but we are fortunate to have a parallel case to <em>MPES, Pryner v Tractor Supply Co, </em>109 F3d 354 (CA 7, 1997), authored by Judge Richard Posner. In <em>Pryner, </em>the court fully considered the virtually identical issue whether a collective bargaining agreement can compel the arbitration of a federal antidiscrimination claim. The <em>Pryner </em>court concluded it could not, and based its analysis on three main points: (1) the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the collective bargaining agreements were not as extensive as their statutory rights; (2) the arbitration procedure could only be invoked by the union and not the worker; and (3) collective bargaining agreements bind all members of a bargaining unit even if an individual employee opposed the agreement. Obviously, had these factors not been present, the agreement would have been enforceable. To understand this is important because in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>our case, unlike in <em>Pryner </em>or <em>MPES, </em>we have the situation where the invalidating factors eliminating employee freedom to trigger the arbitration are not present. First, plaintiffs rights herein are exactly coextensive with available statutory rights because the Meijer adr procedure states that arbitrators are specifically authorized to award any relief that a court of law could award. Second, plaintiff had the absolute right to force the matter to arbitration and was not required to convince a union to pursue the matter. Third, there is no concern that a union negotiated something plaintiff may not have agreed with because plaintiff, under the majority\u2019s own analysis, agreed to just-cause employment subject to arbitration of all employment disputes when she accepted an offer of employment from defendant. Thus, <em>MPES, </em>even as <em>Pryner, </em>must be seen as not standing for blanket unenforceability of predispute arbitration agreements, but only the illegalizing of such agreements when the invalidating factors <em>Pryner </em>points out are present. The implicit holding of <em>MPES, </em>as seen through the lens of <em>Pryner\u2019s </em>analysis, is that, absent the difficulties seen in <em>Pryner, </em>a predispute agreement to arbitrate a civil rights claim will be enforced. Because we are in such a situation, we should enforce the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\"> As the saying goes, when all you have to work with is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b198-5\"> Moreover, even if I were persuaded, wMch I am not, that it would violate public policy to require just-cause employees to arbitrate civil rights claims, I would still find that defendant was entitled to summary disposition because lawful conditions precedent to the initiating of a circuit court action were not met by plaintiff. Section n of the Meijer termination appeal procedure states that if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the termination appeal procedure is not the sole and exclusive remedy and forum for some or all of an employee\u2019s claims, exhaustion of the termination appeal procedure is a condition precedent to institution of a legal proceeding. Therefore, even assuming for the sake of the argument that plaintiff could not forever be deprived of litigating her gender discrimination claim in the circuit court through a contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>agreement with her employer, she still was required to utilize the termination appeal procedure before she could file a lawsuit in the circuit court. Plaintiff failed to do this, and as a consequence she should be barred from pursuing a gender discrimination claim in the circuit court. This is fatal to plaintiff\u2019s desire to pursue a civil rights claim in the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
