The other petition for review is filed by the board of selectmen of Natick concerning a commission decision with respect to collective bargaining with Natick fire fighters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b448-7\">Wilkins, J.</author>\n<p id=\"azm-dedup-0\">These four cases concern the obligations of representatives of the town of Natick to bargain collectively with representatives of its police officers and fire fighters on subjects which, apart from the provisions of the collective bargaining statute (G. L. c. 150E), are within the authority of the chiefs of those departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Questions concerning the obligation of a town to bargain with representatives of its police officers have been before us recently in <em>Chief of Police of Dracut </em>v. <em>Dracut, </em>357 Mass. 492 (1970), involving G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A (the so called \u201cstrong\u201d chief law), and in <em>Chief of Police of Westford </em>v. <em>Westford, </em>365 Mass. 526 (1974), involving G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97 (the so called \u201cweak\u201d chief law). Subsequent legislation, which we must now interpret, may affect the conclusions expressed in those opinions. The effect of the statutory authority granted to a \u201cstrong\u201d fire chief by G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 42, in relation to the collective bargaining rights of fire fighters has not been passed on by this court previously. See, however, <em>Page </em>v. <em>Chief of the Fire Dep\u2019t of Gardner, </em>361 Mass. 849 (1972), where the issue of the fire chief\u2019s powers under G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 42, was raised but not decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The parties agree, for the purposes of this case, that the town of Natick has accepted the \u201cstrong\u201d police chief law (G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A) and comparable statutory provisions concerning its fire chief (G. L. c. 48, \u00a7\u00a7 42, 43, 44). Acceptance of those statutes raises the initial question whether matters thus assigned to the respective chiefs can be the subject of collective bargaining. We conclude that under present law the town must bargain with its police officers and fire fighters concerning those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>subjects. The next question is who must bargain on behalf of the town concerning subjects which are both within the area of a chief\u2019s responsibility and within the scope of permissible municipal collective bargaining. We reject the contention of the Labor Relations Commission (commission) that (1) the respective chiefs should bargain concerning employment conditions assigned to them by their respective \u201cstrong\u201d chief statutes and (2) the selectmen should bargain only concerning other permissible bargaining subjects. We conclude that the selectmen of Natick are its chief executive officers for the purpose of collective bargaining with its police officers and fire fighters and that the selectmen are permitted to and must bargain concerning subjects which otherwise would be within the authority of the respective chiefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\n<em>The Police Department Cases.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Three of these cases involve a decision of the commission concerning the obligations of the selectmen and the chief of police with respect to collective bargaining with a union representing certain police officers of the town.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The union as exclusive representative complained to the commission in February and April, 1972, that the town had engaged in a \u201cprohibited practice\u201d described in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178L.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In August, 1972, the commission issued its own complaint alleging that the selectmen had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>failed to appoint the police chief as their representative for the purpose of collective bargaining and that, therefore, the town was not bargaining in good faith as required by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178J and 178L. The town answered that it had no obligation to appoint the chief of police as its designated representative for collective bargaining; that the chief of police was not a \u201cmunicipal employer\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178G; that the board of selectmen had the sole right and duty to bargain as the chief executive officer of the town; and that the complaining union had refused to bargain with the board of selectmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Hearings were held by the commission in the latter half of 1972. The parties agreed that there had been negotiations between the selectmen .and the union and that the chief of police had attended the collective bargaining meetings but declined to participate as a party, \u201cstating that according to law he could not do so.\u201d The selectmen said that they were willing to come to terms concerning matters falling within \u00a7 97A but that any agreement would have to be subject to the exclusive control and discretion of the chief \u201cand could not be subject to grievance-arbitration provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">On October 4, 1973, the commission issued a decision and order, which we discuss more fully later in this opinion. The commission ruled that the town had two chief executive officers, within the meaning of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178J, for the purposes of bargaining with the union. \u201c [W]ages, hours, benefits, tenure of employment, and the like\u201d were the collective bargaining responsibility of the selectmen. Collective bargaining as to \u201cduty assignments, vacation and leave matters\u201d were the exclusive responsibility of the chief of police, who, the commission said, had been designated as a \u201cmunicipal employer\u201d for bargaining purposes by the town\u2019s acceptance of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A. The commission found that the chiefs refusal to bargain would constitute a violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178L, and that the selectmen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>failure to appoint the chief \u201cas a co-representative\u201d on the town\u2019s bargaining team was a failure to bargain collectively in good faith and a violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178L. The commission ordered the selectmen to appoint the chief of police as a member of the municipal employer\u2019s collective bargaining committee and ordered the selectmen and the chief to resume collective bargaining concerning wages, hours, and other conditions of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The selectmen and the chief of police each filed separate petitions for review of the commission\u2019s decision. The day prior to the filing of those petitions for review the commission had filed a petition for enforcement of its order. These three cases were consolidated for hearing with the case involving the Natick fire fighters\u2019 collective bargaining rights. We turn next to a consideration of the origin and development of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\n<em>The Fire Department Case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The fourth case before us concerns the collective bargaining rights of the Natick fire fighters in light of the town\u2019s acceptance of G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 42, granting certain authority to the chief of the town\u2019s fire department. The proceedings before the commission followed much the same pattern as the proceedings involving the bargaining obligations of the selectmen and the police chief, although the agency proceeding involving the fire fighters\u2019 collective bargaining was commenced later and concluded earlier than the agency proceeding involving the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">In December, 1972, the union representing the Natick fire fighters (Local 1707, International Association of Fire Fighters, AFL-CIO) complained to the commission that the town and its selectmen were not bargaining in good faith as required by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178L. The commission issued its own complaint alleging that the board of selectmen were the \u201cChief Executives of the Town of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Natick\u201d and that they had refused to bargain in good faith with respect to rules and regulations promulgated by the fire chief. The town answered that it had not been asked to bargain concerning the fire chief\u2019s rules and regulations and that, in any event, the town had no duty to bargain over such matters because they were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the fire chief. The chief of the Natick fire department, who was permitted to intervene, took a different view of his status than the town\u2019s chief of police. He answered the complaint by stating that he, not the selectmen, had the authority to deal for the \u201cmunicipal employer\u201d under G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 42, and that the board of selectmen is not the chief executive officer for the purposes of collective bargaining with employees of the fire department.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The proceeding was presented to the commission on a stipulation of facts. The parties agreed that the selectmen had refused to bargain concerning \u201cthe matter of tours and shifts of duty, the work schedule and other matters relating to the assignment of personnel\u201d because they contended that these subjects were under the exclusive control of the fire chief and were not required subjects of negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In its decision of August 20, 1973, the commission ruled, although it called its conclusion a finding, that the town\u2019s adoption of G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 42, constituted a designation by the town of the fire chief to deal with municipal employees and that, therefore, the fire chief was a \u201cmunicipal employer\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178G. The commission further ruled that rules and regulations of the fire chief concerning \u201ctours and shifts of duty, work schedules and other patterns relating to the assignment of personnel\u201d are \u201cconditions of employment\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178H. The commission ruled that the selectmen should have appointed the fire chief to the municipal employer\u2019s collective bargaining committee, ordered them to do so, and directed that the selectmen and the fire chief resume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>collective bargaining with the bargaining representative of the town\u2019s fire fighters.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The selectmen, but not the fire chief, filed a petition for review of the commission\u2019s decision. After the three police chief cases and the fire chief case were consolidated for hearing in the Superior Court, the cases were reserved and reported, at the request of the parties, without decision on the pleadings and an \u201cagreed statement of facts.\u201d We granted the parties\u2019 joint application for direct appellate review of all four cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Because the orders of the commission which are involved in these cases direct municipal officials only with respect to their future conduct, we are considering these cases in terms of the legislation which is now in effect. Thus, for example, we do not pass on the question whether prior to July 1, 1974 (the effective date of St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 2, inserting G. L. c. 150E), the regulations of the chief of the Natick fire department concerned subjects which were within the scope of collective bargaining by the selectmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\n<em>The Scope of Bargaining.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">We have no hesitancy in concluding that subjects which are within the authority of the respective chiefs are proper subjects for collective bargaining. General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 7, inserted by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 2 (effective July 1, 1974 [see St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 7]), provides expressly that \u201c[i]f a collective bargaining agreement reached by the employer and the exclusive representative contains a conflict between matters which are within the scope of negotiations pursuant to section six of this chapter and . . . the regulations of a police chief pursuant to . . . [G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A, or] the regulations of a fire chief . . . pursuant to . . . [G. L. c. 48], . . . the terms of the collective bargaining agreement shall prevail.\u201d See St. 1969, c. 341, and St. 1970, c. 340, amending G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 1781, for prior law concerning the over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>riding of the regulations of a \u201cstrong\u201d police or fire chief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We think the legislative intent is clear. If rules and regulations of the respective chiefs may be overridden in the bargaining process, plainly there is a right to bargain on topics covered by those regulations which involve \u201cterms and conditions of employment\u201d (G. L. c. 150E, \u00a76).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\n<em>The Town\u2019s Bargaining Representative.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We believe that the Legislature intended that the board of selectmen be the sole representative of the town in bargaining with police officers and fire fighters under G. L. c. 150E. Section 6 of G. L. c. 150E requires the \u201cemployer\u201d to meet with the appropriate exclusive representative to negotiate on subjects within the scope of collective bargaining. Section 1 of G. L. c. 150E defines an \u201cemployer\u201d for municipal purposes as a city or town \u201cacting through its chief executive officer, and any individual who is designated to represent [the town] and act in its interest in dealing with public employees . . . .\u201d We reject the suggestion of the commission that Natick has multiple \u201cchief executive officers\u201d \u2014 the chief of the police or fire department, as the case may be, as to his statutory area of authority and the selectmen as to the balance of the matters within the scope of collective bargaining. The definition of an employer speaks of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>single \u201cchief executive officer.\u201d There is no explicit recognition that there may be more than one locus of a municipality\u2019s bargaining authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The bifurcated negotiations contemplated by the commission do not present an obvious, desirable format for collective bargaining. Even assuming that the areas of respective responsibility can be assigned easily between the selectmen and the particular chief, there remains the fact that bargaining often involves \u201cgive and take\u201d on various matters in negotiation. The selectmen and a chief may disagree on which of them should make concessions in order to come to an agreement, and, if they do disagree, the negotiation process is complicated. Moreover, chiefs as negotiators might have a conflict of interest because their own salaries may be affected by the salaries negotiated in the bargaining process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The commission argues that, on occasion, dual public employers have been found to exist under the laws of other States, and that we should not be reluctant to accept such a solution here. See <em>County of Ulster </em>v. <em>CSEA Unit of the Ulster County Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t, Ulster County CSEA Chapter, </em>37 App. Div. 2d 437, 439 (N.Y. 1971); <em>Wayne County Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Wayne County Bd. of Supervisors, </em>22 Mich. App. 287, 298-299 (1970), rev\u2019d on this point in 384 Mich. 363 (1971); <em>Costigan </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Fin. Dep\u2019t Employees Local 696, AFSC&amp;M Employees, AFL-CIO, </em>462 Pa. 425, 434-437 (1975). We believe, however, that the Legislature did not intend that there be dual chief executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>officers in a town such as Natick. Surely by tradition and in practice the selectmen of a town are regarded as its chief executive officers as to all nonschool matters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We are reluctant to interpret G. L. c. 150E as compelling dual management representation where a reasonable solution can be found which is consistent with the statutory reference to a \u201cchief executive officer.\u201d Indeed, the commission itself has not maintained a consistent position on this subject. In its complaints involved here, the commission alleged that the selectmen were the chief executives of the town \u201cwithin the meaning of [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178G-178N].\u201d In the fire fighters\u2019 proceeding, the commission made no reference to the fire chief and simply charged the selectmen with a failure to bargain. In the police officers\u2019 proceeding, the commission contended that the selectmen \u201cfailed to appoint\u201d the police chief \u201cas their designated representative for the purposes of collective bargaining.\u201d The complaints make no suggestion of multiple employers, and the commission\u2019s brief makes no attempt to distinguish the result under the former statute (G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178G-178N) from the result under G. L. c. 150E.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We find no support for the commission\u2019s position that by acceptance of \u00a7 97A and G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 42, the town designated the respective chiefs to represent it and to act in the town\u2019s interest in dealing with public employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>(but only as to certain matters). Apparently, the town accepted these acts long before municipal collective bargaining was provided for in the General Laws. In any event, these acts have nothing to do with (and indeed tend to run counter to the idea of) bargaining concerning employees\u2019 \u201cworking conditions.\u201d Assuming that the designation of a bargaining representative of a town may be made by a town meeting, and not exclusively by the town\u2019s chief executive officer, the short but complete answer is that the Natick town meeting has never made such a designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The commission\u2019s position seems to be dictated by a sense that the Legislature must have intended to preserve the independent authority of the \u201cstrong\u201d chiefs. We disagree. The fact that the Legislature has provided expressly that the negotiated agreement prevails over conflicting by-laws, regulations, and statutes (see G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7) indicates that the statutory goal of achieving entirely open, conclusive negotiations between the chief executive officer (or a selected representative) and the employees\u2019 representative is preeminent. Section 7 of G. L. c. 150E lists numerous provisions of the General Laws which will be overridden by a bargaining agreement. Some of these are statutes, like G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A, and G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 42, which are effective in a municipality only when accepted. See, e.g., G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 111, 111A, 111D, 111G, 111K, and 111L, all dealing with vacations. Some of the statutes which may be overridden in the bargaining process involve considerable protection to employees. See, e.g., G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 108D, 108E, 108F, and 108G, concerning minimum annual salaries for fire fighters and police officers, respectively, and G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, concerning leave without loss of pay for a police officer or fire fighter because of incapacity due to injury sustained in the performance of his duty without his own fault. Others involve matters of local choice which can be as fully important as a locally accepted \u201cstrong\u201d chief statute. See, e.g., G. L. c. 40, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u00a7 21A, concerning municipal by-laws with respect to hours, days, and weeks of work and holiday, vacation, and sick leave, and G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21B, permitting the establishment of a personnel relations review board which may adjust grievances. We believe that, by enacting G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7, the Legislature intended to change the result in circumstances similar to those existing in the <em>Dracut </em>case, not just providing the \u201cstrong\u201d chief regulations may be overridden in the bargaining process but also providing that the selectmen may negotiate conclusively on subjects otherwise assigned to the respective chiefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">There may be situations in governmental employment where a single chief executive officer cannot be discerned. The commission points to uncertainties, particularly as to certain county employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fact, however, that dual or multiple \u201cchief executive officers\u201d may be the only solution for certain government employees does not require such a result in the case of the Natick police officers and fire fighters.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We see no basis for the commission\u2019s order directing the selectmen to appoint the respective chiefs to the town\u2019s collective bargaining committee. The record does not show what authority and function that town committee has. It is not a committee required by statute. In its brief, the town states that the committee is an advisory one. The commission has no authority to direct the town in this way concerning membership on such a committee. Nor does it have authority to direct a town or its selectmen to designate a particular person as its bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The commission\u2019s petition for enforcement of its order as to collective bargaining with the Natick policemen must be dismissed. The orders entered by the commission in the police and fire fighter proceedings must be set aside as in excess of the commission\u2019s authority, and new orders should be entered directing the selectmen to bargain on all matters within the scope of collective bargaining under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6. Appropriate judgments are to be entered in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> The union (Local 311, International Brotherhood of Police Officers) was not the bargaining agent for the chief, lieutenants, sergeants, special and reserve officers, and certain other employees of the police department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\"> General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 178L, and associated sections (\u00a7\u00a7 178G-178N), concerning collective bargaining by municipal employees, were inserted in the General Laws by St. 1965, c. 763, \u00a7 2, and repealed, effective July 1, 1974, by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7. Statute 1973, c. 1078, was enacted after the commission decisions which are involved in these cases. Statute 1973, c. 1078, by \u00a7 2, also inserted G. L. c. 150E, which deals with the collective bargaining rights of municipal and other governmental employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\"> It was suggested in argument that the 1969 statute was passed to reverse the lower court decision, which we affirmed in this respect in <em>Chief of Police of Dracut </em>v. <em>Dracut, </em>357 Mass. 492 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\"> No question is presented here whether there are certain matters still within the exclusive control of the police and fire chiefs because they are subjects which are beyond the scope of negotiations under the collective bargaining statute (see now G.

App. Ct. 151, 157-158 (325 N.E.2d 282, 286-287), further appellate review granted, 367 Mass. 913 (1975), dealing with an area held to be within the exclusive prerogative of the school committee and thus not subject to arbitration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"> For example, under G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 57G, as amended by St. 1974, c. 415, \u00a7 1, if that section is accepted by the municipality, a police or fire chief\u2019s salary must be established at a proportion in excess of that of permanent, full time fire fighters or police officers, as the case may be. Even if no mandated proportion exists, the salary of police officers and fire fighters will have some effect on their chiefs\u2019 salaries as a practical matter. The fact that the chiefs would not negotiate on matters of salary does not mean that they could not have a significant, indirect influence on salaries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\"> We express no view on who the chief executive officer is in a municipality which has a city or town manager. The issue will never be important if there is an agreement as to the municipality\u2019s representative for bargaining purposes among all persons who might be regarded as a \u201cchief executive officer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\"> The brief filed as a friend of the court by the International Brotherhood of Police Officers \u201cregretfully\u201d supports the conclusion that authority is divided between the police chief and the selectmen.
