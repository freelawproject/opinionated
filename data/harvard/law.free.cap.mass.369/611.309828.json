(PoGM), was entitled to the tax treatment accorded by G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B, as appearing in St. 1966, c. 698, \u00a7 60, to a corporation (herein called a security corporation) \u201cwhich is engaged exclusively in buying, selling, dealing in, or holding securities on its own behalf and not as a broker,\u201d provided that the corporation (as here) meets the other conditions of \u00a7 38B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question is whether PoGM, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>once engaged in the production and sale of jams, jellies, and preserves, qualifies as a security corporation under \u00a7 38B for its 1971 tax year because it retained a note, secured by a mortgage, representing the balance due from the sale of its real estate. We conclude that PoGM did not qualify during its 1971 tax year as a security corporation under \u00a7 38B.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In 1967, PoGM sold its plant, equipment, and other assets and ceased its manufacturing activities. The Board found that \u201c[bjecause of zoning questions and the possibility of adverse changes then under consideration by the municipal authorities, only $1,000 of the total sales price of $60,000 was obtainable for the real estate\u201d and that PoGM was compelled to accept a promissory note from the buyer in the amount of $59,000 as part payment for its real estate. The note was secured by a mortgage on the property sold and was \u201cpayable on a direct reduction basis over a fifteen year period with interest on the unpaid balance payable at the rate of 7% per annum.\u201d Since 1967, PoGM has \u201coperated as a security company\u201d and \u201cis considered a personal holding company under federal income tax law.\u201d In July, 1970, PoGM applied for classification under \u00a7 38B as a security corporation, and its application was denied. PoGM \u201cduly filed its Domestic Business or Manufacturing Corporation Excise Tax Return for its fiscal year ending April 30, 1971, on the basis of a security corporation classification.\u201d In its fiscal year ended April 30, 1968, PoGM elected to report profit realized on the sale of its real estate on an instalment basis. During the tax year here involved, PoGM\u2019s gross income was approximately $14,800, of which interest on the mortgage note and gain from the sale of its real estate represented approximately $5,450.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">PoGM was not \u201cengaged exclusively in buying, selling, dealing in, or holding securities on its own behalf\u201d during its 1971 tax year. The fact that a major portion of PoGM\u2019s activities may have fit the statutory definition does not satisfy the statutory requirement. <em>Chatham </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>362 Mass. 216, 219-220 (1972). If PoGM\u2019s retention of a mortgage note from the sale of its real estate used in its manufacturing activities does not constitute \u201cholding securities on its own behalf,\u201d PoGM does not meet the statutory requirement. Recently, we noted that the statutory purpose of \u00a7 38B must be considered in determining whether a corporation qualifies as a security corporation. <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360 (1975). In that case, we concluded that a taxpayer whose business was lending money (and holding secured obligations of its debtors) did not qualify under \u00a7 38B. We said that a corporation may qualify under \u00a7 38B only if it is buying, selling, dealing in, or holding securities for the purpose of investment. <em>Id. </em>at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Although the mortgage note representing the unpaid portion of the purchase price of PoGM\u2019s real estate may be a \u201csecurity,\u201d we do not regard such a note as the type of security which the Legislature had in mind in \u00a7 38B. PoGM did not acquire the mortgage note in the normal course of investment but rather acquired it as the apparently unavoidable consequence of the circumstances under which it had to sell its real estate. Thus the mortgage note was not acquired for investment but was taken as a means of financing the sale of PoGM\u2019s real estate. It lacks the characteristics of a security bought and held for investment purposes, just as did the evidences of indebtedness held by the taxpayer in the <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">This case concerns an issue of law on undisputed facts and does not involve any finding of fact that PoGM was a \u201csecurity corporation.\u201d We hold that, as matter of law, PoGM was not a security corporation within the intent of \u00a7 38B.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-13\"> General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 38B, has been amended since St. 1966, c. 698, \u00a7 60, but those amendments are applicable to tax years after the tax year involved here.
