As the assessors did not approve any of these applications, the owner lodged appeals under the formal procedure with the Appellate Tax Board. The Board heard the appeals together in October, 1974, received the evidence offered on. behalf of the owner and the assessors, and decided for the owner. It held that the assessed valuations, which had ranged from $250,700 for 1970 to $264,300 for 1973, exceeded fair market value by amounts from $35,700 for 1970 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>$49,300 for 1973, and abatements were allowed accordingly, reducing the aggregate of taxes assessed for the four years, $30,782.40, by an amount of $5,154.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In reaching this result, which it supported by findings of fact and a report pursuant to G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, the Appellate Tax Board relied on a \u201ccapitalization of income\u201d approach. This had been stressed by the owner\u2019s expert; the Board, however, did not accept this expert\u2019s testimony uncritically: it found his evidence inadequate in some respects and finally adopted values considerably higher than those he had proposed. With regard to a \u201creproduction less depreciation\u201d method used by a witness for the assessors, the Board expressed doubt that the hotel, 144 years old, could be effectively rebuilt; and it thought a \u201ccomparable sales\u201d formula would be unsatisfactory because of the absence of truly comparable sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The assessors appeal to this court under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. They do not contend that the decision of the Appellate Tax Board is erroneous in substance; they would be in an awkward position to attempt to do so since the evidence was not reported. See <em>New Bedford Gas &amp; Edison Light Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Dartmouth, </em>368 Mass. 745, 750 (1975). Rather the assessors seek reversal on the ground that they were unfairly handicapped in meeting the capitalization of income theory because of the owner\u2019s failure (as they claim) to supply them with facts and figures as to receipts, expenses, and other matters. But the assessors are hard put to make this argument because the record is sketchy in this respect also. It appears that the assessors made requests for information under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 61A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and applied to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Appellate Tax Board to dismiss the appeals for alleged failure of the owner to comply. But the Board\u2019s omission to take such action is not shown to have been improper: the record indicates, indeed, that the owner did supply some information to the assessors,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> although what that information consisted of is not made clear. Again, the assessors served interrogatories on the owner (see Rule 25 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Appellate Tax Board) which they say the owner did not answer, but the Board\u2019s denial of a motion by the assessors to enter a \u201cdecree pro confessa\u201d may be explained, for aught that the record shows, by the assessors\u2019 having received enough information in other ways during the long period before the appeals were heard; for failure of the interrogated party to give answers, the Board is to enter such order \u201cas justice requires,\u201d not necessarily an order of dismissal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In the matter of \u201cdiscovery\u201d much must be left to the judgment and discretion of the Appellate Tax Board. The Board pointed out in its findings and opinion that if the assessors had need to elicit more data to meet the \u201ccapitalization of earnings\u201d theory, they could have availed themselves of the devices of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 38B<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>38C* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> besides \u00a7 61 A. At the actual hearing of the appeals the assessors presumably had all the usual methods open to them to force production of data and to analyze them; if justifiable claim could be made that time was needed for analysis, continuances could be given within reason. What we have said is not intended to derogate in any way from the importance of pre-trial access. Rather we would underline and emphasize the value of these procedures as means of reaching the facts. In the present ease, however, the assessors have simply failed to establish material error on the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> Section 61A, as amended by St. 1968, c. 292, provides: \"The person applying for an abatement of a tax on real estate or personal property shall, upon request, exhibit to the assessors the property to which the application for abatement relates and if required by them point out and identify such property and furnish them with accurate and complete information as to the rents received from, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>expenses of maintaining, such property.
