L. c. 233, \u00a7 20H, from the adjudication of contempt. We transferred the appeal here on our own motion. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">On April 1, 1974, the defendant was charged in the District Court of Springfield with being \u201cconcerned in setting up, managing and drawing a certain lottery\u201d not authorized by law. He filed a motion to suppress certain evidence and for return of property. In May and June, the defendant refused on constitutional grounds to answer questions put to him before the grand jury. In July, before the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress had been acted on, the Commonwealth filed a \u201cnolle prosequi\u201d on the complaint against the defendant, stating that an application for witness immunity had been made to this court under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 20C-20I. On July 26, 1974, an order was entered by a single justice of this court in which he found that the defendant had validly refused to answer questions before the grand jury on the ground that such evidence might tend to incriminate him concerning certain listed offenses. The order directed the defendant to answer the questions propounded to him and granted him immunity with respect to the listed offenses concerning which he was ordered to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">On July 30, 1974, the defendant again refused to answer questions before the grand jury, and a petition for contempt against the defendant was filed in the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20H. At the conclusion of a hearing on August 2, 1974, the adjudication of contempt was made from which the defendant now appeals to this court, and execution of the sentence was stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The defendant\u2019s sole argument of any significance is based on his claim that the questions asked him were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>product of a search conducted in violation of his constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. Assuming (but not deciding) that there had been an unlawful search which produced evidence which prompted the grand jury\u2019s investigation and the defendant\u2019s appearance before it, the Superior Court judge ruled that the immunized defendant was obliged to answer the questions put to him. This ruling was correct. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338 (1974). In the <em>Calan-dra </em>case, the Court said \u201cwe believe that allowing a grand jury witness to invoke the exclusionary rule would unduly interfere with the effective and expeditious discharge of the grand jury\u2019s duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350. The result is the same under the Constitution of this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
