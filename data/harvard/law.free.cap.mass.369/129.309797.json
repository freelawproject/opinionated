Bagge (deceased) the lump sum of $57,375.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The lump sum was awarded to the deceased s parents as the uncollected balance remaining from compensation to which the deceased had become entitled under \u00a7 36 of c. 152 of the General Laws. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the appeal was entered in the Appeals Court, we transferred the case here for direct review, on our own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The deceased was fatally injured on August 28, 1970, when the raised bed of a dump truck he had been working with collapsed, pinning him between the bed and the truck frame. Within minutes of the accident, two coworkers extricated him from beneath the truck bed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>deceased was conscious and spoke a few words to one of his fellow workers, who rendered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while awaiting further aid. The deceased was then taken to the Goddard Memorial Hospital in Stough-ton, Massachusetts, but was dead on arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The parents of the decedent received death benefits from the insurer pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, and made a further claim for compensation under \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 36A. A hearing was held by a single member of the Industrial Accident Board (board), who found that the deceased, had he lived, would have been entitled to compensation for total loss of vision in both eyes (\u00a7 36 [a]), total loss of hearing in both ears (\u00a7 36 [/]}, total loss of function in both arms and both legs (\u00a7 36 [t] and <em>[q]; </em>[n] and [q]), loss of \u201call other bodily functions\u201d (\u00a7 36 [i]),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and disfigurement resulting from the cumulative loss of these functions and senses (\u00a736 <em>[h]).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The insurer filed a claim for review with a three member reviewing board, which affirmed and adopted the single member\u2019s findings and decision. The insurer\u2019s exceptions and motion to strike certain testimony given at the hearing before the single member were saved. On further hearing in the Superior Court these exceptions were overruled and the motion to strike was denied; the judgment sustained the reviewing board\u2019s order in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In urging reversal of the judgment, the insurer cites insufficiencies in the evidence on which the claimants\u2019 expert medical witness relied in responding to a hypothetical question regarding the losses the deceased would have suffered had he survived. Specifically, the insurer claims that there was no evidence as to when death actually occurred, and no evidence that there was a deprivation of oxygen to the brain for more than four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>minutes. Deprivation for at least that length of time was crucial to the medical opinion favorable to the claimants\u2019 contentions. These evidentiary deficiencies, the insurer argues, resulted in impermissible speculation on the part of the claimants\u2019 expert as to the losses of function which the deceased would have experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The insurer also presses reversal by contending that this case is distinguishable from a line of cases, all of which at least partially sustained awards under \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 36A, where the injured employee expired shortly after the accident. See <em>Papanastassiou\u2019s Case, </em>362 Mass. 91 (1972); <em>Chin's Case, </em>357 Mass. 772 (1970); <em>Taylor\u2019s Case, </em>355 Mass. 797 (1969); <em>Bosenquet\u2019s Case, </em>353 Mass. 364 (1967) ; <em>Lauble\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 520 (1960); <em>Henderson\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. 491 (1956). But see <em>Muchado\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 720 (1969); <em>Morris\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 420 (1968) . The insurer argues that all of these cases involved either direct injuries to the brain or to specific body members for which awards were made, and that in each case the injured employee lived long enough for a medical examination and evaluation. Here, it is advanced, the award was made following expert medical testimony concerning the operation of a \u201csecondary mechanism,\u201d i.e., deprivation of the blood supply to the brain for a critical period of time (four minutes) resulting in irreversible brain damage before death. We affirm the award in all respects.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">1. At the hearing before the single member there was somewhat conflicting testimony by the experts concerning the mechanism of death. Dr. Pierce H. Leavitt, medical examiner for Plymouth County at the time of the deceased\u2019s accident, stated that his examination of the body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>shortly after death revealed \u201cmultiple fractured ribs, probable tear of the great vessels around the heart, and hemothorax; that is blood in the chest.\u201d He also testified to the existence of certain marks or scars across the chest where the truck bed impacted against the deceased, and, based on a post mortem chest X-ray, to a bilateral pneu-mothoraces or injury to the lung body which allows air in the lung to escape into the chest cavity. Based on his observations, Dr. Leavitt did not believe that, had the deceased survived, there would be any loss of use or disturbance to his arms, legs or sensory functions. Dr. Elliot L. Sagall, called by the insurer, testified that, in his opinion, the cause of death was simply a crushing injury to the chest with accompanying hemorrhage from the great blood vessels. He expressed \u201cconsiderable doubt\u201d that the injury here caused significant deprivation of oxygen to the brain for a critical period of time because there was evidence of consciousness on the part of the deceased after the injury. Dr. Sagall believed that it would be speculating to express an opinion in this case regarding the effect of the injury on the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Dr. John P. Rattigan, called by the claimants, opined that the mechanism of death probably was cerebral anoxia resulting from severe hemorrhage of the great blood vessels and the collapse of both lungs. In his view, had the deceased survived the primary trauma, he would have suffered extensive loss of cerebral and voluntary motor function and lack of sensory perception and ability to communicate; in short, the deceased would have been reduced to a vegetative state, with only the lower centers of the brain remaining operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Of necessity, our function in passing on the admissibility of expert opinion testimony involves answering two questions: (1) Was the expert warranted in his conclusion on the basis of direct evidence or inferences reasonably drawn therefrom or from the evidence as a whole? and (2) Was the trier of fact warranted in its conclusion on the basis of the expert testimony and permissible in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ferences drawn therefrom? See <em>Cormier\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 714, 716 (1958), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In answering the first of these questions, it is not for us to say whether an expert\u2019s testimony was technically sound as long as the proffered opinion is consistent with common sense and free from conjecture. <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 301, 304 (1952). <em>Ruschetti\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 426, 430-431 (1938). <em>Coddaire </em>v. <em>Sibley, </em>270 Mass. 41, 47-48 (1930). In responding to a hypothetical question, an expert cannot properly rely on misstatements of material fact. <em>Buck\u2019s Case, </em>342 Mass. 766, 770-771 (1961). If this is the case, an expert\u2019s opinion is entitled to no weight. <em>Cormier\u2019s Case, supra. </em>In answering the second question, <em>supra, </em>we are guided by the well established principle that we must accept the board\u2019s decision as final if it is supported by the evidence and not wrong as matter of law. <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 680 (1970), and cases cited. <em>Brigham\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 140, 141 (1964), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In this instance we must answer both queries affirmatively. We recognize that the claimants\u2019 expert was not testifying from personal knowledge of the events of August 28, 1970, nor did he examine the body of the deceased. Neither of these facts, however, is relevant on the issue of the admissibility of his opinion, and the insurer properly does not rely on them. We are convinced that Dr. Rattigan\u2019s testimony was correctly received because he had examined the post mortem X-ray report taken shortly after the accident, had heard the testimony of Dr. Leavitt who examined the deceased approximately thirty-five minutes after his admission to the hospital, and had also heard the testimony of the deceased\u2019s fellow employee and the policeman who transported the deceased to the hospital concerning immediate post-trauma events. There was direct testimony that the crushing injury caused internal hemorrhaging and collapse of both lungs. There was further direct testimony that the entire episode, from the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>until the deceased was pronounced dead, consumed between seventeen and twenty-four minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">From the evidence as a whole, Dr. Rattigan was warranted in concluding, as he did, that the injuries in this case interfered with the blood circulation and oxygenation system, impaired the blood supply to the deceased\u2019s brain for a critical length of time, and led to permanent and near total function and sense losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">On other occasions we have stated that the board\u2019s function in cases such as this is to find \u201cas a fact for present award the future state of health and bodily function of living claimants.\u201d <em>Lauble\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass, at 522. This fact-finding is accomplished despite conflicting medical testimony, and intervening occurrence of the employee\u2019s death provides \u201cno basis for a different rule of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523. Accordingly, we hold that, although the board might have been justified, based on all the evidence, in denying or partially denying some of the claims presented here, we cannot say it was required to do so as matter of law. See <em>Machado\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 720 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">2. Justice R. S. Wilkins, later Chief Justice, writing of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A, once noted: \u201cIt is unfortunate that a statute of such vital importance has not been phrased in unmistakably clear language.\u201d <em>Henderson\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass, at 494. Almost twenty years later we find ourselves still faced with the dilemma of giving \u201ca reasonable and intelligent purpose to \u00a7 36A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">An examination of the briefs and records of the cases involving awards pursuant to \u00a7 36A, where death fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>lowed shortly after the injury, bears out the insurer\u2019s contention that the case at bar is distinguishable in some particulars. In those instances where certain limbs or sense organs were not themselves irreparably damaged, there was discernible, direct trauma to the brain, brain stem, spine or central nervous system. See, e.g., <em>Papana-stassiou\u2019s Case, </em>362 Mass. 91 (1972); <em>Bosenquet\u2019s Case, </em>353 Mass. 364 (1967). The result of this trauma was inexorable: spastic quadriplegia, with speech or vision seriously impaired or lost altogether. These direct injuries and the medical end result fit, even if somewhat uncomfortably, within the purview of \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 36A.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">However, were we to hold, as the insurer urges, that the line must be drawn on \u00a7 36A awards in this case because here there was an indirect and secondary mechanism of death, we would be ignoring sound judicial precedent. This court in <em>Henderson </em>construed the language of \u00a7 36A in such a way that the possibility of an incongruous result was revealed: large sums of money could be awarded under the section \u201cfor a group of miscellaneous injuries resulting in death.\u201d This court pointed out that an amendment to the statute might be in order. <em>Henderson\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 495-496. We observe that \u00a7 36A has not been altered in any way since it was rewritten, prior to the <em>Henderson </em>opinion, by St. 1951, c. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The trend of the cases since the <em>Henderson </em>decision has been to affirm awards made under \u00a7 36A on the ground, inter alla, that there is no distinction between the board\u2019s function in determining future health where an injured employee happens to survive with his injuries and those seemingly rare instances, such as in this case, where he does not survive. See <em>Lauble\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 522-523.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Furthermore, to hold as the insurer urges would be reading words into the statute which, express or implied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>simply are not there. The Legislature has said nothing about the cause of death or the manner in which the specified injuries compensated for under \u00a7 36 are received. It has been argued that the Legislature did not contemplate the result we reach in this case, but we are not willing to speculate as to their intention since the language of the statute is silent. Nor are we willing, in construing the statute, to establish a line of demarcation between cases in which the mechanism of injury and death is direct and cases where that mechanism is indirect; such a demarcation would amount to judicial legislating.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">3. We have concluded that the sound precedent of the <em>Henderson </em>case requires us to affirm the award in this case. However, the questions raised in the <em>Henderson </em>case are presented even more acutely in the instant case. We agree with the insurer\u2019s assertion that recovery in a given situation may depend on arbitrary and illogical factors as much as or more than on presumably more rational considerations (e.g., the needs of the surviving dependents). The same injury may result in a substantial recovery in one case and no recovery whatsoever in another. Compare, for example, the injuries received by the young employee in <em>Morris\u2019s Case, supra </em>(multiple traumatic injuries from fall down elevator shaft, including crushed chest and skull fracture), where recovery was denied, with the injuries received by the deceased in the instant case. These, however, are reasons for possible legislative revision,* **<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rather than for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"AJa\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\"> We use the terminology of Mass.
