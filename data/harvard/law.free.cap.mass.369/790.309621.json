He was sentenced thereafter to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole on the second indictment for a term of nine to fifteen years. The case, transferred from the Appeals Court on our own motion, is here on assignments of error based on the defendant\u2019s, allegations that having applied for a prompt trial on October 22, 1974, under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 72A, he did not receive it. He alleges also denial of his constitutional right to a speedy trial in that he was not tried until over seventeen months after indictment despite his demand for a speedy trial and his repeated objections to continuances. The defendant raises also the question whether his constitutional and statutory rights to a grand jury drawn from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>cross section of the community were violated by purposeful discrimination against women which resulted in their underinclusion on the grand jury which indicted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">We consider first whether in fact he was denied his right to a prompt trial under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 72A, which provides that after application is received by the court a defendant shall within six months \u201cbe brought into court for trial or other disposition of. any such indictment, information or complaint, unless the court shall otherwise order.\u201d The short answer to the defendant\u2019s claim is that as he was brought to trial within six months of the filing of his application the statutory requirements were satisfied. The defendant\u2019s application for a prompt trial was filed and docketed on October 22, 1974. Precisely six months later, on April 22, 1975, the trial on the two indictments commenced. On that day there was a motion for trial by the Commonwealth; the jury were empanelled and the indictments and pleas were read to them. We hold that the statutory six-month period extended to April 22, 1975 (and did not expire on April 21, 1975), and that as of th\u00e1t date the. defendant had been \u201cbrought into court for trial\u201d in compliance with G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 72A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">We further note that even had the statutory period lapsed the defendant well may not have been entitled to relief under the statute. First, the statute does not compel dismissal in all cases in which the six-month requirement is not met. As cited above, G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 72A, provides that the defendant be brought to court within six months of application by the defendant \u201cunless the court shall otherwise order.\u201d As was made clear in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loftis, </em>361 Mass. 545, 549 (1972), a judge is not required in all circumstances to dismiss an indictment \u201cif the case is not tried or otherwise disposed of within six months after an application for a speedy trial is \u2018received by the court.\u2019\u201d Secondly, a review of the two continuances after the defendant filed his application for a prompt trial indicates that while he objected to the first on January 16, 1975, he agreed to the second on March 12, 1975. This in effect would have removed from the defendant the benefits he now claims under the statute. A defendant, having agreed to a continuance, is not in a position to insist upon strict adherence to the exact six-month period. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loftis, supra </em>at 549-550. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>367 Mass. 169, 178-179 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Nor has he been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. While he was indicted on November 12, 1973, he appeared in court on January 30, 1974, to seek a postponement in order to retain private counsel and was granted a continuance. On May 7, 1974, he answered \u201cready\u201d for trial while the Commonwealth sought a continuance for \u201ca good amount of time\u201d in order to locate the complaining witness. The trial was continued until June 18, 1974, when the Commonwealth again requested a continuance on the ground that the complaining witness, a teenaged Indian girl, \u201cis visiting with her family in Canada and won\u2019t be back until fall. . . . She suffered a trauma as a result of this rape and she has gone away to try and recuperate.\u201d The case then was continued until September 9, 1974. Until September 11, 1974, the defendant was out on bail. On that date he was convicted of an unrelated charge (armed robbery) in the Superior Court in Suffolk County and sentenced to six years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Concord. While in prison the defendant filed his application for prompt trial on October 22, 1974. Thereafter, on January 16, 1975, the Commonwealth requested a further continuance, stating its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>current inability to locate the witness, then believed to be on an Indian reservation in Canada, and stating further that every effort was being made to locate her. The Commonwealth further suggested that if the continuance ran to the first part of March and the witness was not then present \u201cthe commonwealth would not oppose a motion to dismiss at that time.\u201d On March 12, 1975, the case was continued by agreement and trial commenced on April 22, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The delay in trial until May, 1974, was clearly at the request of the defendant but he complains of the subsequent continuances granted at the Commonwealth\u2019s request and the delay in trial until April, 1975. It would appear that there was a valid reason for the Commonwealth\u2019s requests in that the key witness to this very serious offense was missing and that the Commonwealth was taking reasonable steps to locate her. The standards in <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530 (1972), set out certain factors to be assessed by the court in determining whether the defendant has been deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. They are stated to be \u201c [l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d At 531, the Court stated that \u201ca valid reason, such as a missing witness, should serve to justify appropriate delay.\u201d Furthermore, we see no resultant prejudice to the defendant in such delay as occurred in this case. He produced no witnesses at the trial. He was out on bail until he was incarcerated on other charges which were unrelated, and the Commonwealth in the meantime was exerting effort to bring him to trial. What occurred in this case was not in derogation of the <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>standards. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 361-365 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>366 Mass. 18, 20-23 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Furthermore, there was no error in the refusal of the judge to dismiss indictments brought on November 12, 1973, against the defendant on the ground that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>discrimination against women in the manner in which the grand jury were chosen. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522 (1975), to which the defendant refers, was promulgated on January 21, 1975, and on January 27, 1975, <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>420 U.S. 31 (1975), was decided. The <em>Daniel </em>case made it clear that the <em>Taylor </em>case was not to be applied retroactively \u201cas a matter of federal law, to convictions obtained by juries empaneled prior to the date of that decision.\u201d At 32. We had occasion to make reference to this fact in <em>Brunson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante, </em>106, 117 (1975), and we also declined to apply the rule of the <em>Taylor </em>case retroactively. We follow the same course here. We conclude that no error is shown in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\"> The six-month period is to be measured from, but excluding, the date of receipt of the defendant\u2019s application for prompt trial by the court. Hence the six-month anniversary date of the court\u2019s receipt of the application is included within the statutory period. See <em>Berkshire Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Williamstown, </em>361 Mass. 873 (1972); <em>Tempter </em>v. <em>Tempter, </em>347 Mass. 270 (1964); <em>Boston Penny Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>314 Mass. 599 (1943).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
