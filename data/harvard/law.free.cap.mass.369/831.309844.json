Section 5 (a) of the ordinance requires that any application for a permit thereunder shall be accompanied by detailed plans of the proposed work and installation, and \u00a7 5 (f) provides that \u201c[pjlans must be stamped and signed by a Registered Land Surveyor and/or Registered Professional Engineer.\u201d Section 6 provides that \u201c [i]f deemed necessary by the Commissioner of Public Works or his representative, a baseline or centerline of construction for both vertical and horizontal control of the work will be established prior to the construction by a Registered Land Surveyor\u201d while \u00a7 7 goes on to provide that \u201c [w]hen proposed location of installation is in the sidewalk area or in any other location where accuracy of bounds, bound points, property markers, etc. may be jeopardized, the Commissioner of Public Works shall require that a Registered Land Surveyor locate and properly reference to all such points prior to construction.\u201d The company challenges the validity of these latter three sections of the ordinance, requiring that plans be stamped and signed by a registered land surveyor or registered professional engineer (\u00a7 5 [f]), and that base<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>lines, centerlines and bounds be established prior to construction by a registered land surveyor (\u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The company employs a staff of approximately twenty-five engineers in the Lowell district but employs no registered professional engineers or land surveyors therein. Since adoption of the ordinance the company has been under the necessity of employing independent registered professional engineers and land surveyors to do the work at a cost over almost two years of between $25,000 and $30,000. The company asserts that this work is essentially duplicative of the work already performed by its own engineers.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">A Superior Court judge ruled that, as applied to the company, <em>\u00a7 </em>5 (f) of the ordinance is void in its entirety and that \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7 are void \u201cin that part thereof which requires the employment of a registered land surveyor.\u201d The city appealed from a final judgment to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">There was no error. The case brings before the court an issue which was exhaustively dealt with in <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 147-157 (1973), and more recently in <em>Del Duca </em>v. <em>Town Adm\u2019r of Methuen, </em>368 Mass. 1, 10-13 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">We refer to the judge\u2019s analysis in his findings and rulings wherein he alluded to G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 25, as appearing in St. 1951, c. 476, \u00a7 2, which in general enables cities to \u201cestablish reasonable regulations for the erection and maintenance of all lines for the transmission of intelligence by telegraph, telephone or television,\u201d and G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21, permitting cities to adopt ordinances \u201cnot repugnant to law, as they may judge most conducive to their welfare . . . .\u201d He made reference also to G. L. c. 112, which governs the registration of a number of professions and occupations including, in \u00a7\u00a7 81D-81T, professional engineers and land surveyors. Penalties are provided in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 81T, for those practicing engineering and land surveying without being registered. However, as he noted, G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 81R <em>(l), </em>exempts from such requirements \u201cthe performance of engineering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>work and services by a person, firm or corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Utilities which work and services are performed as part of their employment and for the benefit of such person, firm or corporation.\u201d Since the company is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Utilities and the work in question is performed for the company\u2019s benefit, it would appear that the questioned sections of the ordinance confront directly the above cited provisions of G. L. c. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">We have had occasion to mention the desirability of uniformity of standards applicable to utilities regulated by the Department of Public Utilities. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Sudbury, </em>356 Mass. 406, 420 (1969). See also <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>New England LNG Co., </em>364 Mass. 109 (1973); <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>347 Mass. 586, 591-592 (1964). While the city argues that the disputed sections of the code require no more of the company than burdens already placed upon it by the Commonwealth, we are inclined to disagree. The company has been forced to expend in the district in which the city lies sums not required of it in other areas in which it operates. This is because the ordinance has created in Lowell a burden for the company additional to those which it carries elsewhere. To the extent that this is so, there is a variation from the uniformity desirable in the regulation of utilities throughout the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">It is within this context that we consider the effect of the <em>Bloom </em>and <em>Del Duca </em>cases in particular upon the claim of the company. The <em>Bloom </em>case made reference to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baronas, </em>285 Mass. 321, 322 (1934), which held that \u201cwhere by legislation a subject matter has been fully dealt with, a by-law of a town or city dealing further and otherwise with that subject matter is repugnant to law\u2019 within the meaning of this statute [G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21].\u201d The <em>Bloom </em>case makes it clear that legislation dealing with a subject comprehensively \u201cmay reasonably be inferred as intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>preclude the exercise of any local power or function on the same subject because otherwise the legislative purpose of that statute would be frustrated.\u201d <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at 155. See <em>Del Duca </em>v. <em>Town Adm\u2019r of Methuen, supra </em>at 10-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">The regulatory program detailed in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 81D-81T, is quite comprehensive. The statute establishes the qualifications for practicing engineering and land surveying in the Commonwealth, sets out the procedures governing examinations and the issuance and revocation of certificates of registration, and provides criminal sanctions to enforce its requirements. The exemption provided in \u00a7 81R <em>(l) </em>is an integral part of this comprehensive scheme. Section 81R <em>(l) </em>reflects a legislative determination that engineering work performed by a person, firm or corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Utilities need not be performed by registered engineers or land surveyors. Those portions of the Lowell ordinance held invalid by the judge cut across and frustrate that legislative determination. We conclude that in compelling the employment of registered engineers and land surveyors under the ordinance the city is engaged in impermissible interference with a statutory plan which is quite clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
