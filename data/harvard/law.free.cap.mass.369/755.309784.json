The plaintiff does not challenge the allowance of that motion in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b772-13\">Wilkins, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apj\">The plaintiff appeals from the allowance of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). On June 7, 1974, he brought a petition for a writ of certiorari challenging his discharge from his position as a policeman for the town of Carlisle. He alleged that the selectmen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>action in discharging him was arbitrary and capricious because it was not based on any substantial evidence and that he was denied his constitutional rights because he was discharged without an adequate hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Before considering the question whether summary judgment should have been entered against the plaintiff, we must address a procedural question, not discussed by the parties, which arises in part because the plaintiff\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari was filed before the new rules of civil procedure became effective on July 1, 1974, while the balance of the significant procedural events in this case occurred after July 1, 1974. Under our prior practice, when a writ of certiorari was sought, the judge\u2019s function was to look at the facts disclosed in the defendant\u2019s return and determine whether an error of law was apparent on that record <em>(Bennett </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Chelsea, </em>361 Mass. 802, 807 [1972]; <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Duxbury, </em>358 Mass. 64, 66 [1970], and cases cited; <em>Mor-rissey </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Comm\u2019n, </em>312 Mass. 121, 124-125 [1942]), unless there was an extension of the return (see <em>DiRado </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>352 Mass. 130, 132-133 [1967]), a challenge to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction (see <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Comm\u2019n, </em>312 Mass. 121, 124-125 [1942]), or a challenge to statements of facts extrinsic to the return which bore on the court\u2019s exercise of discretion (see <em>Loranger </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Regional High School Dist. School Comm., </em>338 Mass. 450, 453 [1959]). When the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was presented in this case in the Superior Court, however, affidavits were filed in support of and in opposition to the allowance of that motion. The plaintiff filed an affidavit asserting facts not specifically alleged in his petition, which, if true, might support his claim that he had a constitutional right to notice of the reason or reasons for his discharge and to a hearing before the selectmen. Under our prior practice, such extraneous material would not have been considered in passing on a petition for a writ of certiorari because generally there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>could be no contested issue of fact. The question for this court is how we should treat the record before us in passing on the propriety of the allowance of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The petition for certiorari was properly filed and does not lose its effect because the writ of certiorari was abolished by the new rules. Mass. E. Civ. P. 8l (b), 365 Mass. 841 (1974). Since July 1, 1974, relief in the nature of certiorari has been available pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 289. See St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 351. If today a plaintiff files a complaint seeking relief in the nature of certiorari and, as a substantive matter, the case should be decided on the record developed before the governmental agency, the defendant\u2019s answer will constitute, in effect, a return, and a judge will decide the case on the basis of facts appearing in the answer. If, however, a plaintiff commences an action stated to be in the nature of certiorari when, in fact, the relief sought could not formerly have been obtained in a certiorari proceeding, but is substantively available, as for instance on a complaint for a declaratory judgment, the court should disregard the label and deal with the substance of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">If we were to consider this case solely on the basis of the defendants\u2019 answer and return, we might well conclude that there is no error on the face of the proceedings reported in that answer and return. However, the plaintiff\u2019s petition has been treated by the parties as seeking a determination of his rights on the basis of facts not appearing in the defendants\u2019 answer and return. We decline, therefore, to hold the plaintiff to the technicalities of a petition for a writ of certiorari and will, discuss the plaintiff\u2019s right to the relief which he seeks in the context of the facts appearing in the pleadings and in the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">For reasons which appear later in this opinion, we believe that the plaintiff has shown that there are disputed facts which, if resolved in his favor, would entitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>him to a hearing before the selectmen concerning his discharge from the town\u2019s police force. We suggest that, in light of the views expressed in this opinion, the plaintiff should seek to amend his complaint to allege more precisely the facts on which he relies, to include a prayer for a declaratory judgment, and to set forth the precise relief which he seels.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The plaintiff was dismissed as one of the two full time police officers of the town after two meetings between the plaintiff and the selectmen at which allegations against the plaintiff were discussed. No specific charge was made against the plaintiff. The reason given for his dismissal in a letter written on behalf of the selectmen was \u201cunprofessional conduct and lack of candor with the Chief and the Selectmen.\u201d The plaintiff asserts that his dismissal was the result of false, retracted charges that he had committed adultery with a married woman living in the town. He was not confronted with any witness concerning that accusation. His affidavit implies that his reputation was damaged because the allegations against him, known to other residents of the town, were confirmed by his dismissal. He states further that he has been \u201cdeprived of continuing employment\u201d as a police officer and \u201cprevented from seeking employment\u201d because \u201c[i]n fact the Defendants are using retracted allegations as grounds for bad references.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In his petition, the plaintiff acknowledged that the town\u2019s police department was governed by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97, which provides that, in towns which have adopted it, police officers serve \u201cat pleasure.\u201d He alleged that \u00a7 97 was unconstitutional because it denied him procedural due process and equal protection of the laws in violation of arts. 1, 10, 11, and 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The plaintiff has no property interest in employment as a police officer by the town. Section 97 permits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>town\u2019s selectmen to discharge a police officer at their pleasure.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no statutory requirement that a police officer in the town be advised of the reason for his discharge or that he be granted a hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">As so construed, \u00a7 97 does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guaranty of equal protection of the laws. While police officers in municipalities governed by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A, may be discharged only for cause after a hearing, different treatment under \u00a7 97 is acceptable constitutionally, because there is a basis for that different treatment reasonably related to the purposes which the statute seeks to accomplish. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry\u2019s Drywall Co., </em>366 Mass. 539, 545 (1974). <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>339 Mass. 209, 213 (1959). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leis, </em>355 Mass. 189, 197 (1969). The provisions for hiring, firing, and supervision of police officers in a municipality with a large police force may be unwieldy and inappropriate in a small town such as Car-lisle, which has only two full time officers. The choice allowed by \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 97A is a reasonable way to facilitate the proper functioning of quite different police departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Our conclusion that the plaintiff has no property interest in continued employment by the town does not end the consideration of whether the plaintiff was entitled to notice and a hearing before the selectmen. The plaintiff relies on the statements in the opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>573 (1972), that an untenured government employee is entitled to a hearing where the government makes a charge against him \u201cthat might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community,\u201d or where the goverment has \u201cimposed on him a stigma or other disability that foreclosed his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The fact of discharge, standing alone, \u201cis seldom serious enough to warrant a hearing.\u201d <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>484 F.2d 678, 680 (7th Cir. 1973). Accord, <em>Buhr </em>v. <em>Buffalo Pub. School Dist. No. 38, </em>509 F.2d 1196, 1199 (8th Cir. 1974). While dismissal for \u201cany reason other than reduction in force is likely to be to some extent a reflection on . . . ability, temperament, or character\u201d <em>(Medoff </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>362 F.2d 472, 476 [1st Cir. 1966]), \u201cnot every dismissal attains constitutional proportions.\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>United States Post Office, </em>475 F.2d 1256, 1257 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 866 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In order to constitute a deprivation of liberty based on serious damage to one\u2019s standing in the community, more must be shown than mere allegations of incompetence or inefficiency at a particular job. <em>LaBorde </em>v. <em>Franklin Parish School Bd., </em>510 F.2d 590, 593 (5th Cir. 1975). <em>Abeyta </em>v. <em>Taos, </em>499 F.2d 323, 327 (10th Cir. 1974). <em>Jablon </em>v. <em>Trustees of Cal. State Colleges, </em>482 F.2d 997, 1000 (9th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1163 (1974). <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>470 F.2d 212, 217 (2d Cir. 1972). <em>Harnett </em>v. <em>Ulett, </em>466 F.2d 113, 117-118 (8th Cir. 1972). Statements that continued employment is not in the best interests of the employer,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or that the employee is \u201canti-establishment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> lacks mature and professional judgment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>or is uncooperative or uncommunicative<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are not enough. Even an accusation that a person has violated a particular statute is not necessarily enough. <em>Lake Michigan College Fed\u2019n of Teachers </em>v. <em>Lake Michigan Community College, </em>518 F.2d 1091, 1097 (6th Cir. 1975). Courts have found \u201ca person\u2019s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity [to be] at stake . . . .\u201d <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Constantineau, </em>400 U.S. 433, 437 (1971), in cases charging racial prejudice,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> dishonesty or fraud,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> unprofessional prescription of narcotics by a doctor,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and mental illness.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The question before us then is whether facts properly asserted by the plaintiff, if true, support his claim that the principles expressed in the <em>Roth </em>opinion grant him the right to notice and a hearing. We think dismissal because of immoral, illegal conduct, such as adultery, entitles the employee to notice of the reasons for his discharge and a hearing on them, if those charges have been or are likely to be disseminated either to members of the public or to prospective employers. See <em>Buhr </em>v. <em>Buffalo Pub. School Dist. No. 38, </em>509 F.2d 1196, 1199 (8th Cir. 1974); <em>Wellner </em>v. <em>Minnesota State Junior College Bd., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>487 F.2d 153, 155, 156 n.3 (8th Cir. 1973). The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit states that the chief of police and some selectmen were told that the plaintiff was having an illicit relationship with a citizen of the town; that the chief prepared a report which he gave to the selectmen; that members of the board of selectmen received telephone calls concerning the plaintiff\u2019s actions; that the allegations against him were known by other residents of the town; that after his discharge some residents of the town circulated a petition on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf; that his reputation was greatly damaged when he was fired; that he obtained another police job \u201csubject to references\u201d but did not get the job because of poor references from a person of the town; that he believes that his prospective employer was informed by the chief of police of the town that he had lost his job because of his alleged conduct;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that the defendants are using retracted allegations as grounds for bad references.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Viewing the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit and inferences which may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the plaintiff <em>(Hub Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>357 Mass. 449, 451 [1970]), and considering the facts set forth in the defendants\u2019 answer and return, we believe that there is a dispute concerning facts which are material to the issue whether the plaintiff was entitled to notice of the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>for his discharge and to a hearing on those charges so as to have \u201can opportunity to clear his name.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff has asserted sufficient facts which, if true, support his claim that he may be foreclosed from a \u201crange of opportunities\u201d for employment. <em>Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, supra </em>at 574. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>492 F.2d 1003, 1009 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>McNeill </em>v. <em>Butz, </em>480 F.2d 314, 320 (4th Cir. 1973); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm'n, </em>66 N.J. 152, 157 (1974).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The judgment for the defendants should be vacated, and there should be further proceedings in the Superior Court. If, in those further proceedings, the plaintiff establishes that he was entitled constitutionally to notice of any charges against him and to a hearing on them before the board of selectmen, consideration will have to be given to whether the proceedings already held before the board of selectmen were sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and whether, as the defendants claim, he waived any right to a hearing of a char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>acter different from that of the conferences which were held with the selectmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The order granting summary judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\"> The town has accepted \u00a7 97, and G.

Nor do the facts recited by the plaintiff in his affidavit show that he was discharged because of his alleged adulterous conduct.

If the plaintiff establishes that he has a constitutional right to a hearing, he should have notice of the specific charges, an opportunity to present witnesses, and, barring special considerations, an opportunity to cross-examine those who charge him with any wrongdoing on which the selectmen relied in discharging him. <em>Hostrop </em>v. <em>Junior College Dist.
