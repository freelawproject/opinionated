The taxpayer was engaged in investing in stocks, bonds, and real estate for the benefit of its shareholders. The board found that the taxpayer was not \u201ca. broker or trader for the public.\u201d In its operations during 1971, it incurred expenses for officers\u2019 salaries, auditing and legal services, custodian and investment advisor fees and general expenses, and foreign taxes with respect to dividend income (hereinafter called collectively the investment expenses). The Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation disallowed the investment expenses as a deduction on the taxpayer\u2019s 1971 return, and the board agreed. We affirm that decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The taxpayer, as a trust with transferable shares, was subject to the taxes imposed by G. L. c. 62 and was considered an individual, not a corporation, \u201c [i]n determining the [Internal Revenue Code] deductions allowable\u201d to it under G. L. c. 62. G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 8 (a), as appearing in St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 5. The taxpayer\u2019s income subject to taxation was its Federal gross income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>(modified in certain respects not relevant here) \u201cless the deductions allowed under [\u00a7 62 and \u00a7 404] of the [Internal Revenue] Code\u201d (and further modified by certain variations also not relevant here). G. L. c. 62, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. Because \u00a7 404 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code) (dealing with employer contributions to an employee pension fund) has no bearing in this case, the general question is whether the taxpayer\u2019s investment expenses are deductible in calculating its adjusted gross income under \u00a7 62 of the Code, treating the taxpayer as an individual and not as a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Section 62 of the Code refers to certain deductions from gross income, including the deduction allowed by \u00a7 162(a) of the Code for \u201call the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.\u201d Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7\u00a7 62, 162(a). The board found that, \u201c[i]nsofar as it is a question of fact,\u201d the taxpayer \u201cwas not actively engaged in a trade or business during the taxable year 1971.\u201d However, from the board\u2019s decision, we think it is clear that the board regarded the question, as we do, as one of law to be decided on undisputed facts. The issue becomes whether the taxpayer was engaged in a \u201ctrade or business\u201d within the meaning of those words in \u00a7\u00a7 62(1) and 162(a) of the Code when its sole activity was the investing of its assets on its own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">We conclude that the taxpayer was not engaged in a \u201ctrade or business.\u201d Expenses incurred in managing one\u2019s investments are not expenses incurred in a \u201ctrade or business,\u201d as those words are used in the Code. This principle was established in <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>312 U.S. 212 (1941), and has been adhered to since. <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>373 U.S. 193, 200 (1963). <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>376 F.2d 280, 293 (Ct. Cl. 1967). <em>Mirro-Dynamics Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>374 F.2d 14, 16 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 896 (1967). Although Congress has reversed the result of the <em>Higgins </em>case by the enactment of \u00a7 212 of the Code, it did so by</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>establishing a new and separate deduction and not by enlarging the definition of a \u201ctrade or business.\u201d <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>323 U.S. 57, 61 (1944). We express no opinion on the result in a situation where the taxpayer makes short term investments designed to profit from fluctuations in a securities or commodities market as opposed to making investments for the purpose of profiting from the success of the enterprises in which the taxpayer has invested. See <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>373 U.S. 193, 202 (1963). Cf. <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Nubar, </em>185 F.2d 584, 588-589 (4th Cir. 1950), cert. denied, 341 U.S. 925 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">We reject the taxpayer\u2019s argument that our opinions interpreting the words \u201cincome subject to taxation\u201d under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 3, indicate that all expenses incurred by an individual in producing income are deductible. In <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>363 Mass. 589 (1973), we said that a small loans business was entitled to deduct its expenses of operation. There we were considering the deductability of expenses incurred by a business trust in carrying on its business. In <em>Wheatland </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>368 Mass. 250 (1975), we recognized that expenses incurred by an individual trust in earning income from and in maintaining timber producing property were allowable deductions. However, that view was based on the fact that these items of expense were deductible in calculating adjusted gross income under \u00a7 62 of the Code, and was not based on any independent judicial view of what deductions should be allowed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>The taxpayer concedes that by its terms G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 2 (b), does not grant an individual the deduction allowed under \u00a7 212(1) of the Code for \u201cordinary and necessary expenses paid ... for the production or collection of income.\u201d That.is so because, in the calculation of adjusted gross income, \u00a7 62(1) of the Code expressly excludes as a business deduction those expenses which are deductible by an individual under \u00a7 212 of the Code. We decline the taxpayer\u2019s invitation to import \u00a7 212 of the Code into the deductions allowable under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 2 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\"> The taxpayer filed its notice of appeal within sixty days of the filing of the board\u2019s findings of fact and report but not within sixty days of the board\u2019s decision. The Commission alludes to this fact in its brief and concurs with the taxpayer\u2019s treatment of the date of the filing of the board\u2019s findings and report as the date of \"the entry of judgment\u201d for the purposes of Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure 4, 365 Mass. 846 (1974). The Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure are made applicable to appeals from the board by G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 5. Where the Commonwealth or an officer or agency of the Commonwealth is a party, \u201cthe notice of appeal may be filed by any party within sixty days\u201d of \u201centry of the judgment appealed from.\u201d Mass. R. A. P. 4, <em>supra. </em>We believe that Rule 4 as applied to appeals from the board should be read to equate the filing of the board\u2019s findings of fact and report to \u201cthe entry of judgment,\u201d when such findings and report are requested. The board would be well advised if it adverted to this procedural circumstance in its rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b805-6\"> In the <em>Wheatland </em>opinion (at 252-253) we referred to expenses for the production of income, deductible under \u00a7 212 of the Code, as an appropriate deduction for a personal trust. That statement is appropriate as to such expenses if they are \u201cattributable to property held for the production of rents or royalties\u201d (Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 62 [5]), and has no apparent application to the expenses of the taxpayer in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
