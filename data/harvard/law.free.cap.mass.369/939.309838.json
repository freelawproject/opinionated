The matter was reserved and reported for our determination by a single justice of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">The plaintiffs are general partners of Roberts Fall River Associates, a limited partnership organized under G. L. c. 109. On or about July 13, 1971, the plaintiffs, on behalf of the limited partnership, submitted an application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>to the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) seeking authorization and approval for construction of a low and moderate income housing project in Fall River, Massachusetts, under G. L. c. 121A. The application contained \u201cminimum standards\u201d which the plaintiffs proposed would govern the financial operation of the project. These \u201cminimum standards\u201d contained, inter alla, this provision: \u201cThe gross income (which words shall have the same meaning as the words \u2018gross receipts\u2019 appearing in Section 15 of . . . Chapter 121A) in any calendar year shall be the gross rental income from the occupants of the project . . . actually received in cash by the Limited Partnership in any particular calendar year.\u201d The application and the \u201cminimum standards\u201d eventually were approved by the DCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">The plaintiffs then entered .into a contract with the city of Fall River (city) pursuant to G. L. c. 121 A, \u00a7 6A. This contract provided that the limited partnership would construct, maintain and manage the \u201cproject\u201d in accordance with the \u201cminimum standards\u201d set forth in the application as approved by the DCA and the provisions of c. 121A as then in effect. The contract further contained this provision: \u201c[Wjithout mutual consent, any amendment subsequent to the delivery of this Contract, of any of the provisions of . . . Chapter 121A ... or of the Minimum Standards now applicable to the Project, shall not affect the Project.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">On or about October 13, 1971, a mortgage insurance agreement was entered into by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (acting by and through the Federal Housing Commissioner), the Massachusetts Housing and Finance Agency (the mortgagee) and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>plaintiffs. This contract provided in essence that HUD would make \u201cinterest reduction payments\u201d on behalf of the plaintiffs directly to the mortgagee so that the plaintiffs as mortgagors would be obligated to pay interest on the mortgage at the rate of only one per cent a year. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-l(a), (c) (1970). 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 236.501 et seq. (1972). By the terms of this agreement the plaintiffs were to establish a \u201cbasic rental charge\u201d for each unit in the \u201cproject\u201d (subject to HUD approval) based on the operating cost of the \u201cproject\u201d less the \u201cinterest reduction payments,\u201d and to return to HUD each month any rents collected in excess of the \u201cbasic rental charge.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"atr-dedup-0\">Thereafter, the limited partnership constructed the \u201cproject,\u201d and HUD made (and is making) \u201cinterest reduction payments\u201d to the mortgagee according to the last mentioned contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs have filed income tax returns with the Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation (Commissioner) but, since (and including) 1972, never have included the \u201cinterest reduction payments\u201d within the reported gross income from all sources. The Commissioner contends that, under c. 121A, \u00a7 10, the plaintiffs must include the \u201cinterest reduction payments\u201d as an element of their gross income,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and has assessed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>tax deficiency against the plaintiffs for the years 1972 and 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">In opposition to the Commissioner\u2019s assertion, the plaintiffs proffer two arguments. They contend that \u201cgross income . . . from all sources,\u201d as used in c. 121A, \u00a7 10, does not include the HUD \u201cinterest reduction payments,\u201d and, alternatively, that the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of what constitutes gross income violates their contract with the city and c. 121 A, \u00a7 6A.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">1. We this day have decided the case of <em>Morville House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps, ir Taxation, ante, </em>928 (1976), a case which squarely presents the same issue of law controlling in this dispute. The reasoning of and the result we reached in <em>Morville House </em>are fully applicable to the instant case. From all we have said in <em>Mor-ville House </em>it is clear that we need not, and do not, treat the alternative contention of the plaintiffs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">2. The case is remanded to the county court with instructions that a judgment be entered declaring the Federal \u201cinterest reduction payments\u201d not taxable as gross income to the plaintiffs under G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b956-7\"> General Laws c. 121A, \u00a7 6A, inserted by St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 5, expressly approves this type of provision: \u201cSuch contract may provide that, without mutual consent, any subsequent amendment of any such provisions, rules, regulations and standards shall not affect the project.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b957-5\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 part in this mortgage insurance agreement was limited to covenanting to give up certain incidents of ownership of the \u201cproject,\u201d especially with regard to tenant selection and right of sale of the project to a prospective purchaser.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b957-6\"> Since 1972 HUD has paid the mortgagee a total of $647,442 in \u201cinterest reduction payments.\u201d The parties expect that the payments will continue for the life of the mortgage at a rate of $334,034 a year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b957-7\"> General Laws c. 121A, \u00a7 10, as appearing in St. 1956, c. 640, \u00a7 4, levies an excise of five per cent on the \u201cgross income . . . from all sources\u201d of an entity operating a c. 121A \u201cproject.\u201d The version of \u00a7 10 which governs this case does not define gross income, however. The Legislature has remedied the situation by inserting a definition of gross income into the section by St. 1975, c. 827, \u00a7 7 (approved December 23, 1975), and it is clear from a reading of this new definition that \u201cinterest reduction payments\u201d are not intended to be taxable to persons in the position of the plaintiffs here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
