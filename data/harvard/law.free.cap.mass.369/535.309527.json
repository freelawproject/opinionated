L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, inserted by St. 1972, c. 614, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ages and injunctive relief, charging unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, and Regulation XV of the Attorney General promulgated under c. 93A. They also claim that some of the acts or practices violated G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 9, and G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 18, 25 and 25A. Judges of the Superior Court, following our decisions in <em>Holyoke Water Power Co. </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>349 Mass. 442 (1965), and <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Hardware Mut. Cas. Co., </em>361 Mass. 582 (1972), dismissed the actions because the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, and the plaintiffs appeal. We hold that, while it might have been appropriate to stay the actions, they should not have been dismissed. Cf. G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (6)-(8), inserted by St. 1973, c. 939. We therefore reverse the judgments of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The four complaints were filed in June, 1974, by the same plaintiffs against four different groups of defendants. We summarize their allegations, which are substantially similar. The individual defendants in each case control the stores of the defendants. The defendants have contracted, combined and conspired in unreasonable restraint of trade and commerce in the sale of bottled liquor at retail, in violation of G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 9. In particular, each group of defendants (a) owns or controls more than three retail package store licenses, in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15; (b) has transferred liquor between retail licensees without a wholesaler\u2019s license, in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 18; (c) has lent alcoholic beverages to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>members of the group which were on the \u201cposted\u201d list, in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25; (d) has lent money to members of the group in further violation of \u00a7 25; and (e) has coerced wholesalers to give discounts in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25A. The defendants\u2019 advertising deceives the public as to the true ownership of their stores; their stores have lost their independent identity; and the defendants have achieved monopolistic buying power, monopolized trade in various relevant markets, forced independent retail liquor stores in competition with them out of business, and used artificially high prices in markets they have monopolized to destroy competition in new markets. The result is to require the plaintiffs to pay artificially high prices for wholesale liquor, and to force the public to pay higher prices for bottled liquor. There is no allegation that the plaintiffs have initiated any proceedings before the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (ABCC).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">1. <em>The powers of the ABCC. </em>Most of the acts or practices of which the plaintiffs complain are alleged violations of G. L. c. 138, regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages. Under that chapter and G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 44, the ABCC has broad regulatory authority over the liquor industry in the Commonwealth. <em>Universal Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>301 Mass. 40, 43-44 (1938). The powers of the licensing authorities are not limited \u201cto the preservation of public safety and good order.\u201d <em>Boston Licensing Bd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 788, 795-796 (1975), and cases cited. Under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 67, the ABCC has authority to investigate the conduct of licensees, to hold hearings on possible violations of c. 138, and to modify, suspend, revoke or cancel licenses. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>340 Mass. 33, 35 (1959). We were informed at argument that the ABCC now has under way an investigation and hearing concerning the very activities which form the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. Cf. Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 94 (1966) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>(opinion of the Attorney General issued Aug. 19, 1965); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>368 Mass. 857, 864-865 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The power of the ABCC to enforce the provisions of c. 138 is not exclusive. Violations of those provisions are punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both. \u00a7 62. Criminal prosecutions are conducted by others as well as by the ABCC, and its regulations are enforceable only against licensees. Cf. <em>Revere </em>v. <em>Aucella, ante, </em>138, 145 (1975). Moreover, a suit to enjoin the illegal sale of alcoholic beverages as a common nuisance may be brought by the Attorney General, the district attorney, the board or officer having control of the police, or not less than ten voters of a town or city. G. L. c. 139, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 16A. <em>Jasper </em>v. <em>Michael A. Dolan, Inc., </em>355 Mass. 17, 18 (1968). <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 351 (1964). The ABCC has no power to prosecute civil actions to recover damages on behalf of persons aggrieved by violations of c. 138, or to seek injunctive relief on their behalf. Nor does it have power to institute civil or criminal proceedings- under G. L. c. 93 or 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">2. <em>The exhaustion doctrine. </em>We have often recognized the doctrine that administrative remedies should be exhausted before resort to the courts. See <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Hardware Mut. Cas. Co., </em>361 Mass. 582, 587-588 (1972), and cases cited; cf. <em>McKart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 193-195 (1969). That doctrine is commonly applied to prevent premature interference with a pending administrative proceeding. See <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 447-451 (1973). In such cases it is proper to dismiss an action for injunctive or declaratory relief, and to await judicial review if and when the administrative process results in an order affecting substantial rights. The policy is similar to that precluding premature interference with a pending criminal proceeding. See <em>Norcisa </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Provincetown, </em>368 Mass. 161, 172-173 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">We have also applied the exhaustion doctrine to cases where no administrative proceeding was pending. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>such cases the doctrine is often referred to as the doctrine of \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d or \u201cprior resort.\u201d See 3 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 19.01 (1958); 2 F. Cooper, State Administrative Law 572 (1965); Comment, 7 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 124, 136 (1972). \u201cWhile the requirement of exhausting administrative remedies has a somewhat different historical background than the rule of prior resort, yet the two doctrines have developed into complementary parts of a general principle which ordinarily serves to preclude judicial consideration of a question while there remains any possibility of further administrative action.\u201d 2 F. Cooper, <em>supra </em>at 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Where the entire controversy is within the exclusive jurisdiction of an administrative agency, the doctrine ordinarily results in dismissal of judicial proceedings begun without prior resort to the agency. Cf. <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 296, 313 n.19 (1963). Where there are overlapping jurisdictions and the agency has jurisdiction of only part of the matter in controversy, it may be proper to dismiss judicial proceedings which seek only prospective relief, since the action can be reinstituted after administrative remedies have been exhausted. <em>Holyoke Water Power Co. </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>349 Mass. 442, 443 n.l (1965). See 3 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 19.07 (1958). But where damages for past conduct are sought which cannot be awarded by the agency, dismissal may give rise to serious problems in the application of the statute of limitations. In such cases the proper course may be to stay the action instead of dismissing it. <em>Carnation Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific Westbound Conference, </em>383 U.S. 213, 222-223 (1966). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Michigan Nat'l Corp., </em>419 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1974); <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Chicago Mercantile Exch., </em>409 U.S. 289, 302-306 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Hardware Mut. Cas. Co., </em>361 Mass. 582 (1972), damages were claimed, but the action was dismissed in the Superior Court, and we affirmed. We left open the question whether the agency could require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>defendant to make a rebate in the amount of damages claimed. <em>Id. </em>at 586-587. No one suggested the propriety of a stay instead of dismissal, and we did not consider that possibility. Since that decision the statute there applied, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, has been amended to insert paragraphs (6)-(8), providing that actions under \u00a7 9 are to be suspended rather than dismissed in cases where judicial action should await administrative action. St. 1973, c. 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that judicial action in the present cases should await further administrative action, we think dismissal of the actions was not the proper remedy, since a stay would accomplish the purposes of the doctrine of prior resort and would avoid possible unfair prejudice to the plaintiffs\u2019 rights. Cf. <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Car-dullos, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 344-345 (1964). If the defendants should seek stays, the provisions of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (6)-(8), though not applicable to an action under \u00a7 11, provide a useful analogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The judgments are reversed and the cases remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\"> <em>\u201cSection 11. </em>Any person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce and who suffers any loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person who engages in any trade or commerce of an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice declared unlawful by section two or by any rule or regulation issued under paragraph (c) of section two may, as hereinafter provided, bring an action in the superior court in equity for damages and such equitable relief, including an injunction, as the court deems to be necessary and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">\u201cSuch person, if he has not suffered any loss of money or property, may obtain such an injunction if it can be shown that the aforementioned unfair method of competition, act or practice may have the effect of causing such loss of money or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">\u201cAny persons entitled to bring such action may, if the use or employment of the unfair method of competition or the unfair or deceptive act or practice has caused similar injury to numerous other persons similarly situated and if the court finds in a preliminary hearing that he adequately and fairly represents such other persons, bring the action on behalf of himself and such other similarly injured and situated persons; the court shall require that notice of such action be given to unnamed petitioners in the most effective, practicable manner.
