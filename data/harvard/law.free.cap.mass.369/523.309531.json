R. A. P. 27, 365 Mass. 874 (1974). We also received briefs in support of that petition from several friends of the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We now deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><em>MacGibbon III, </em>like <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>347 Mass. 690 (1964) <em>(MacGibbon I), </em>and <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>356 Mass. 635 (1970) <em>(MacGibbon II), </em>was based on the zoning by-law of the town as it existed before it was amended in 1971 and on G. L. c. 40A before its amendment in 1975. In <em>MacGibbon I </em>the board denied the permit to excavate and fill because of sewage problems, and we reversed because no building permit was in issue. In <em>MacGib-bon II </em>the board denied the permit because it interpreted the by-law as inapplicable to coastal wetlands. We upheld the validity of the by-law, but reversed because the board had misinterpreted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In <em>MacGibbon III </em>we adhered to our decisions in <em>MacGibbon I </em>and <em>MacGibbon II. </em>We also held that the uses of the plaintiffs\u2019 land, as testified to by the board\u2019s expert, were not \u201cpractical\u201d in the sense used in <em>Mac-Gibbon II, </em>in defining the power of a town under The Zoning Enabling Act, and that outright denial of the permit because of flooding and erosion problems was improper where the problems could be met by conditions and safeguards. We pointed out that the plaintiffs will still have the burden of convincing other appropriate authorities that subsequent permits should be issued, but we did not pass on any issue with respect to such permits. Nor did we discuss or decide any constitutional issue whatever. So far as the board\u2019s petition relates to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>issues decided in <em>MacGibbon </em>III, it brings to us nothing that was not considered in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The main concern expressed by the friends of the court is with the possible impact of the decision on a variety of State and Federal conservation programs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus one friend of the court asserts that <em>MacGibbon III </em>may directly affect by-laws adopted under the recently amended Zoning Enabling Act, G. L. c. 40A, as amended by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3. Another suggests that our decision questions the legality and wisdom of the statutes governing protection of coastal and inland wetlands, G. L: c. 130, \u00a7 105; c. 131, \u00a7 40A. The Attorney General expresses the fear that language in the decision \u201cnot necessary to the result\u201d raises serious questions about the validity of several State statutes \u201cnot considered by the Court.\u201d We did not discuss or decide any such issue in <em>MacGib-bon III. </em>We do not decide issues not before us, and we ordinarily try to resolve a case without reaching constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\n<em>Rehearing denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\"> The Attorney General, the Boston Bar Association, the Massachusetts Audubon Society, the Conservation Law Foundation of New England, Incorporated, the Massachusetts Association of Conservation Commissions, and Mr. Stuart DeBard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\"> The State and Federal programs and statutes are: G.

I dissent from the denial of the petition for rehearing for the same reasons I gave in the dissent to the opinion as first issued. While I welcome the attempt to narrow the scope of that opinion I believe that the concerns expressed in the briefs filed by the board, the Attorney General, and the friends of the court on the petition should be heard in argument before us since they have not been put to rest by the court\u2019s supplementary opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
