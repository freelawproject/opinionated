L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, but that he had been sentenced for \u201cforcible rape,\u201d a violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, notwithstanding an implied finding by the jury that he was not guilty of forcible rape. We therefore set aside the sentence and remanded the case \u201cfor the sentencing of the defendant for his violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>365 Mass. 74, 78, 82 (1974). On remand the same judge resentenced the defendant to the same sentence, saying, \u201cMy assessment of the gravity of the crime and the circumstances is precisely now what it was then.\u201d We now hold that the resent-encing did not comply with our rescript, and again vacate the sentence. We remand the case for the resentencing of the defendant by a different Superior Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The indictment charged that the defendant \u201cdid ravish and carnally know ... a female child under the age of sixteen years, by force and against her will.\u201d The evidence is sufficiently summarized in our prior opinion. It would have permitted the jury to find that the defendant had committed the crime of forcible rape in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A; it therefore permitted a finding that he had committed the lesser included crime of statutory rape in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23. But the jury could not be required to believe the testimony presented by the Commonwealth, and the judge charged the jury that the victim\u2019s consent was \u201cof no consequence.\u201d We held that the resulting doubt as to consent must be resolved in favor of the defendant, and that the verdict therefore must be treated \u201cimpliedly as a finding that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>was not guilty of forcible rape under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, supra </em>at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In resentencing the defendant after remand, the same judge said he had \u201cgreat difficulty in following the reasoning\u201d of our opinion. He could not, he said, \u201cgo through the mental gymnastics of this situation.\u201d He then imposed the same sentence he had imposed before, not less than forty nor more than fifty years, to be served from and after the sentence then being served.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We do not think the record fairly justifies apprehension of \u201cvindictiveness\u201d or \u201cretaliatory motivation\u201d in the re-sentencing, in violation of the principles laid down in <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 723-726 (1969). Nor do we consider whether there was a violation of some broader constitutional principle. Compare <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>334 U.S. 736, 740 (1948) (\u201cfacetiousness\u201d in sentencing), and <em>McHoul </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>365 Mass. 465, 470-472 (1974), with <em>Gavin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>367 Mass. 331, 339-343 (1975). It is apparent that the judge is unable to comply with our rescript, and we think justice will best be served if the defendant is sentenced again. Cf. <em>Gilchrest </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>364 Mass. 278, 281 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The sentence appealed from is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for the resentencing of the defendant by a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
