The defendant answered with a general denial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The action was tried to an auditor (\u201cfacts not final\u201d), and then, as to certain issues, was heard by a judge of the Superior Court sitting without a jury. The judge, on the basis of the auditor\u2019s findings of fact, which he accepted, and other evidence before him, made findings, rulings, and order for judgment, and finally entered judgment for the plaintiff for $4,600.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">1. <em>Contract terms. </em>The gist of the written contract of August 26, 1969, between plaintiff and defendant, as far as now relevant, was as follows. The plaintiff was to buy from the defendant a machine for the manufacture of plastic display signs for a price of $4,995. This was its outlay for a nonexclusive license during the term of the agreement \u2014 five years with possible yearly renewals \u2014 \u201cto operate a \u2018Signman\u2019 business\u201d in five counties in Massachusetts, using the defendant\u2019s trade designation \u201cSignman\u201d and the good will and merchandising system associated with it. By \u00a7 5C of the contract the defendant \u201cagrees ... [t]o make available to Franchise Holder a central purchasing program for materials, forms and supplies used in the sign business.\u201d By \u00a7 6E the plaintiff \u201cagrees\u201d as follows: \u201cIn order to achieve uniformity and quality merchandising, Franchise Holder agrees to purchase plastic materials necessary for the operation of the sign manufacturing machine from [the defendant], or, in the alternative, agrees to submit to [the defendant] for approval as to quality, plastic of any other supplier. If material other than plastic furnished by [the defendant] is used the Franchise Holder agrees not to use the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>name \u2018Signman\u2019 to identify such product. Franchise Holder\u2019s failure to procure [the defendant\u2019s] approval of the quality of plastic used shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, since quality of material and performance is essential to the good will and reputation of the Signman System, and this Franchise shall thereupon terminate upon 30 days notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">2. <em>Performance under the contract. </em>Operations under the contract to the time of the events in suit ran thus. The plaintiff purchased the machine (including some material) from the defendant at the price stated. It advertised for salesmen to solicit orders for signs; eventually it had about 200 such salesmen, who were independent contractors working on commission. All of the plaintiff\u2019s signs were manufactured by means of the machine; most of its signs were fabricated of white acetate, a plastic. The plaintiff purchased the bulk of this plastic and other materials used from the defendant; only occasionally did it buy from others. Its business was only of modest size with annual gross sales running between $13,000 and $16,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">On November 13, 1972, the plaintiff sent an order to the defendant for white acetate. Under date of November 28 the defendant informed the plaintiff that as \u201cwe can no longer obtain a good quality of white acetate from our supplier, we are not going to carry this in stock any longer. Therefore, we will no longer be able to fill your orders for SA4220 White Acetate.\u201d The plaintiff through its manager Richard P. Trieff protested in reply that \u201cyou don\u2019t even let me know names of other suppliers. That\u2019s bad business and must be a violation of our contract.\u201d There was evidence that Trieff called the defendant\u2019s franchise director Fred J. Applebaum on December 4 and was then told, in substance, that the plaintiff could check around locally and consult the \u201cyellow pages\u201d to find suppliers of acetate. On December 19 the plaintiff cancelled some sixteen outstanding orders for signs and went out of business. It promptly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>commenced the present action. On December 28 the defendant wrote its franchise holders that it had secured a new supplier of acetate and would fill orders after January 15, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">From the evidence before the auditor and the judge it appeared that about November 1, 1972, the defendant knew or should have known that its one supplier of acetate \u2014 it had not taken the precaution of locating a backup supplier \u2014 was unreliable as a source for the future. It did not make a serious effort to find another supplier until after November 27 when the failure of the regular supplier was confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">There was, indeed, some general shortage of plastics including acetate at the time. Yet when the plaintiff tried by telephone to locate a supply of acetate in New England, it did find the material available in rolls (though not in sheets accommodated to its use). Presumptively the ability of the defendant, the larger buyer, to find sources, was greater than the plaintiffs (a reason for entering a franchise contract in the first place). When the defendant exerted itself it did find a substitute supplier, but the materials would not have reached the plaintiff until more than two months after it had submitted its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">3. <em>Breach. </em>On findings generalized from the evidence, the judge held the defendant in breach of the contract. The defendant in its requests for rulings protested that there had been a misconstruction of the nature of the defendant\u2019s duty. It said that its agreement under \u00a7 5C to \u201cmake available ... a central purchasing program\u201d amounted to no more than an undertaking as an \u201cagent\u201d to use good faith and reasonable diligence to find a supplier for material which the franchise holder might order through the defendant; when the defendant had no relevant supplier, the franchise holder was free under \u00a7 6E to turn to an alternative source, the defendant, presumably, being bound not to withhold its assent to outside purchases unreasonably. The plaintiff, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>other hand, stressed the franchise holder\u2019s agreement under \u00a7 6E \u201cto purchase plastic materials . . . from [the defendant],\u201d which implied a reciprocal obligation on the defendant\u2019s side to meet the franchise holder\u2019s requirements; it pointed to the fact that in practice it bought from the defendant, not through it; the alternative of \u00a7 6E was not, it said, an escape for the defendant but rather a franchise holder\u2019s option or privilege which in all events entailed the disadvantage that the product would be barred the benefits of association with \u201cSignman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The judge (and the auditor as well<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) favored the plaintiff\u2019s construction of the contract as one for the sale of the plastic on a \u201crequirements\u201d basis. He proceeded to the question of the possible bearing of Uniform Commercial Code (G. L. c. 106) \u00a7 2-615, \u201cExcuse by Failure of Presupposed Conditions,\u201d and then held, contrary to the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings, that the defendant was not excused. On the assumed construction of the contract, the judge was right. For the key question under \u00a7 2-615 is whether \u201cperformance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made\u201d (\u00a7 2-615 [a]), and the failure of the defendant\u2019s supplier to perform was not such a contingency. See <em>Mishara Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Transit-Mixed Concrete Corp., </em>365 Mass. 122 (1974); <em>Canadian Indus. Alcohol Co. </em>v. <em>Dunbar Molasses Co., </em>258 N.Y. 194 (1932); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 281 (Tent. Draft No. 9, 1974). It seems to us, however, that even if the defendant\u2019s duty was simply to use good faith and reasonable diligence to furnish the plaintiff with a source, and even if the \u201calternative\u201d of \u00a7 6E of the contract is read in a most indulgent way, the defendant stood in breach when, in effect, it dismissed the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>and told it to forage on its own for a supplier. This subverted the franchise relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">It was a closer question \u2014 but not made the subject of any distinct objection by the defendant \u2014 whether the defendant\u2019s breach entitled the plaintiff merely to recover for that breach while continuing to abide by the contract, or was so material in all the circumstances as to justify the plaintiff in throwing the contract over and suing for total breach. See Restatement of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 275-276 (1932); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 268 (Tent. Draft No. 8, 1973). Implicit in the judge\u2019s decision is the view that on the facts the breach was such as to entitle the plaintiff to the more drastic response, and we. should not disturb such an assessment by the trier.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record suggests that the plaintiff may have seized the chance for terminating the contract with some enthusiasm, as it had been considering disposing of the business;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but if the facts justified the termination in law, we are not at liberty to analyze possible ulterior motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">4. <em>Damages. </em>The auditor found that net profits lost through the cancellation of the sixteen orders amounted to $350. He added $3,900, the value, as he estimated it, of the machine and various materials as left on the plaintiff\u2019s hands. This is to be understood as a use of a \u201creliance\u201d formula of recovery instead of the more familiar \u201cexpectancy\u201d formula where \u2014 as the auditor indicated \u2014 there was not enough evidence on which to apply the latter measure. The value of the machine at the time of breach may be taken here, very roughly, to correspond to so much of the initial investment the plaintiff was willing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>to make in reliance on the contract as was lost through the defeat of that reliance: it was, very roughly, the unamortized part of the investment. Other materials bought against the contract were also taken into account. The sum of $3,900 was awarded in lieu of an estimate of the net profits the plaintiff would have earned during the unexpired term of the contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We dealt with the \u201creliance\u201d measure, although in a different context, in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>363 Mass. 579 (1973), and need not repeat the groundwork here. See L. <em>Albert &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Armstrong Rubber Co., </em>178 F.2d 182, 189-191 (2d Cir. 1949); <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill-Adams Co., </em>185 F. 231, 239-240 (2d Cir. 1911); <em>C.C. Hauff Hardware, Inc. </em>v. <em>Long Mfg. Co., </em>260 Iowa 30 (1967); Fuller &amp; Perdue, The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages, 46 Yale L.J. 52 (1936), 373-377 (1937) 5 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1031 (1964); Annot., 17 A.L.R.2d 1300 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The defendant does not intimate a preference for the \u201cexpectancy\u201d calculation, which might have resulted in heavier damages,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, indeed, did not object in the course of the action to the calculation that was made. In its brief the defendant seeks to quarrel with the judgment that it pay the value of the machine despite the fact that the plaintiff still retained it. The auditor, however, considered that with the closing of the business the machine and other material lacked any function and could not be sold, and the record as we have it does not gainsay this. In any event, the attempt was really to find a figure fairly if not precisely representing the plaintiff\u2019s loss in reliance, and we could not say there was material error even if the defendant had sought to point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>it out by due objection. In one small particular, however, the judgment contains a miscalculation which should be corrected. The judge without basis allowed $700 instead of the $350 found by the auditor. To the extent of the difference, there would be an excessive or \u201cdouble\u201d recovery as the judge allowed as much as the auditor for the reliance. The judgment is modified by reducing its amount from $4,600 to $4,250, and, as modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\"> The defendant also pleaded excuse by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s breach, but this defense was untenable. The plaintiff\u2019s nonpayment of certain charges (used as a set-off, see n.2 below) did not furnish such an excuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\"> The defendant as plaintiff in set-off pleaded and established a set-off of $327 which need not be further considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\"> The auditor after finding facts left to the judge the legal question whether the defendant could be excused under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-615.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\"> The judge remarked on possible mitigation of damages by the plaintiff after January 15 but in awarding damages he evidently went on a theory of total breach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> A sales of the business would require the cooperation of the defendant because of a provision of the franchise contract forbidding assignment by the franchise holder. It is indicated on the record that the defendant was inclined to cooperate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\"> The auditor said he was finding the amount a willing buyer would pay for the machine and other things, if there were such a buyer, but he thought there was none.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\"> The auditor took the net profits for 1970, 1971, and 1972 to be, respectively, $4,735, $3,199, and $4,386.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
