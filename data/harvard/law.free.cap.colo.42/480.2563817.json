By the information filed, the particulars in which he has violated the above statute is charged, in substance, as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-6\">That he caused his name to be published in the city directory of the city of Denver for the year 1905 as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-7\">\u201cErbaugh, Charles 0., Attorney, Solicitor of American and Foreign Patents. * * # 419-420 Commonwealth Building\u201d;' that by reason of this publication his name appears in the above directory in the list of attorneys-at-law; that respondent has offices at the rooms above designated, and upon the door and entrance to his office he has caused his name, \u201cCharles 0.

In response to this rule the respondent answered, the substance of which, so far as material, is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-9\">He denies that he has ever represented, advertised, or held himself out as an attorney, or attorney-at-law, or counselor-at-law, authorized to practice in the courts of record in this state; but admits that he has used the word \u00a3\u00a3 attorney \u2019 \u2019 in connection with his name, but only in a qualified or restricted sense by using it in connection with the word \u201cpatents,\u201d or some, phrase pertaining to patents, claims, or pensions, whereby he seeks to deduce the conclusion that employing the word \u201cattorney\u201d in connection with the other subjects referred to clearly indicates that he was an attorney appearing exclusively in matters pertaining to patents, claims or pensions. He avers that to advise the public that his practice was so limited, he published, issued and distributed a large number of letters, a copy of which is attached to his answer, in which he expressly states that he confines himself and his practice to patents, pensions and claims against the government. He admits that he caused his name to be published in the city directory as stated in the information, but avers that he intended thereby to show that he practiced as an attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ney exclusively in matters pertaining to patents. He avers that he did not authorize or request his name to be inserted in the list of attorneys-at-law published in the directory above mentioned. He admits that he has offices in the Commonwealth Building, and that upon the entrance door-t\u00f3 his office he caused his name to be placed and also a sign to be displayed upon the window of his offices, as stated in the information, but that in addition thereto, and immediately under the sign on his door, were also the words \u201cSolicitor of American and Foreign Patents,\u201d and under the sign on his window the word \u201cPatents.\u201d He admits having caused the cards first mentioned in the information to be printed, issued and distributed, and also' admits that cards were published bearing his name as next stated.therein, but denies that he ordered them, and avers that they were \u2019printed through a mistake of the printer, and that he has refrained from using or distributing them because of such mistake, and has destroyed them as far as possible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">He admits receiving the letter mentioned in the information, and writing the reply thereto, as therein stated, upon a letter-head containing the words set out in the information. He further says that \u2018 \u2018 Soon after the filing of the petition herein he destroyed all stationery, cards, signs, or parts of signs, which were objectionable to, and which were complained of by, the petitioner herein, for the reason that he had no desire to do things which did not meet with the approval of the Colorado Bar Association. \u201d He further states \u201cthat whether or not this Honorable Court finds that this respondent has been guilty of contempt, respondent has, and will forever refrain from doing the acts complained of, which this court shall deem constitutes such contempt.\u201d He does not deny the charge that he is not a licensed attorney.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>As a further defense, he challenges the validity of the act in question, for the reason that the title of such act pertains only to the punishment of- one guilty of practicing law without a license, while the information charges him with representing, advertising, and holding himself out as an attorney, and hence the part of the act pertaining to one representing, advertising, and holding himself out as an attorney without having a license is unconstitutional, for the reason that this subject is not clearly expressed in the title, or is not germane to such title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\">\u2018 Upon filing this answer, petitioner filed a motion for judgment upon the pleadings based upon the ground that by his answer the respondent has admitted the acts charged in the information. This motion is resisted by respondent upon two grounds:</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-6\">(1) That the acts charged which he admits by his answer do not, under the explanations offered,\u2019 constitute a violation of the statute in question, for the reason that the use of the word \u201cattorney\u201d after his name in the city directory and upon the cards first mentioned in the information, and upon his letter-heads and signs upon the door to his offices and window thereof, in connection with the other words, clearly indicate, and only convey, the information that he is an attorney in matters pertaining to patents; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-7\">(2) That the act which he is charged with having violated is unconstitutional, in that it violates \u00a7 21, article 5, of the constitution of the state, which provides: \u201cNo bill, except general appropriation bills, shall he passed containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title; * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-10\">No other questions are raised by the respondent than those we have indicated, and we shall confine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>onr discussion and determination of the motion of petitioner to these questions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b519-5\">Mr. Justice Gabbebt</author>\n<p id=\"ABL\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Respondent, by his answer, does not claim to be a licensed attorney, and admits that he caused his name to be published in the directory of the city of Denver as follows: \u201cErbaugh, Charles O., Attor-, ney, Solicitor of American and Foreign Patents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">He also admits that he caused his name to be placed upon the door of his office and upon a window of his office followed by the word \u201cAttorney,\u201d but avers that on the door there further appears, following the word \u201cAttorney,\u201d \u201cSolicitor of American and Foreign Patents,\u201d and under the sign on his window the word \u201cPatents.\u201d He further admits the issuance and distribution of the cards bearing his name, under which appears the word \u201cAttorney,\u201d followed by \u201cPatent Law and Counsel for Patent Causes,\u201d and the use of letter-heads containing; the words as set out in the preceding statement. His counsel contend that from these admissions it appears he has employed the word \u201cattorney\u201d in a qualified and restricted sense, in that thereby he has only held himself out to the world as an attorney in matters pertaining to patents or pensions; and hence, it is argued, it thus appears that he has not sought, by the use of the word \u201cattorney,\u201d to convey the information that he was a person authorized by license of this court to practice before the courts of record of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The word \u201cattorney,\u201d following the name of a person, when not qualified, is ordinarily understood to mean a member of the legal profession, and one who, as an attorney-at-law, is legally authorized to appear for and represent clients who are parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>to causes in courts of <em>record. </em>\u2014 People <em>ex rel. Hughes v. May, </em>3 Mich. 598; <em>Clark v. Morse, </em>16 La. Rep. 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Webster\u2019s definition of \u201cattorney\u201d is \u201cA legal agent qualified to act for suitors and defendants in legal proceedings; an attorney-at-law. \u2019 \u2019 Such is the understanding of people generally. The publishers of the directory appear to have so understood it when they published respondent\u2019s name in the list of attorneys of their own motion. The word \u201cattorney,\u201d as employed by respondent upon his signs, cards and letter-heads, and in the city directory in the manner we have indicated, would not convey to any person the information that he restricted his practice to cases before the patent and pension departments of the government; but, on the contrary, that he was a practicing lawyer in the ordinary acceptation of that term, by which members of that profession are designated, and that in addition to practicing law before the courts of record of this state, he gave attention to patent and pension cases. There is nothing in the arrangement of the words following his name upon his signs, cards and letterheads, or in the directory, or in the punctuation, to suggest that he was not an attorney-at-law. And so we must conclude, from respondent\u2019s own admissions, that h\u00a9 has violated tlie statute in question by advertising and holding himself out to the world as an attorney-at-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The fact that respondent has written and circulated letters wherein he states that he confines his practice exclusively .to patents, pensions and claims against the government, is no defense to the charge here made. As to persons receiving such letters, it might be said they would understand that he was not engaged in the practice of the law, but we are dealing with the information which respondent intended to, and, in fact, did, convey, to the general.public by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the language employed on his cards, letter-heads, signs, and following his name in the directory \u2014 that he was an attorney-at-law, and not with respect to the information that his practice was limited to1 certain matters, as stated in his letters, which would only reach those who happened to receive them. And here it is not amiss to add that in his reply to the letter addressed to him, set out in the statement, he did not state that he was not engaged in the practice of law, and the person receiving it would naturally infer from its contents that he was, and would, if employed, institute an action for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"AJO\">The validity of the statute is attacked solely upon the ground that it violates \u00a7 21, article 5, of our state constitution, in that the part of the statute which respondent is charged with violating relates to a subject not expressed in its title, or that the statute embraces two subjects, or that by its title it is restricted to one class of offenders. In other words, it is contended that the body of the hill relates to persons practicing law without license, and also to those advertising or representing themselves to be lawyers when, in fact, they are not licensed, although the title only embraces persons practicing law who are not licensed, or that, by the terms of its title, it is restricted to the first class.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The provision of the constitution in question has been before this court many times for consideration, with the result that it has often been declared that it is mandatory, and legislation falling within its inhibition is ineffectual; that its purpose was to convey, by the title to a bill, information relating to proposed legislation, and to prevent the passing of laws alien to the subject as thus expressed; hut it has also been declared that this provision must he given a reasonable construction, and that legislation ger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>mane 'to the subject as expressed in the title of an act is not obnoxious to its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">That which is appropriate or relevant to the subject of a bill as expressed by its title, or is a necessary incident to the object of a bill, as thus expressed, is <em>germane. </em>\u2014 Golden <em>Canal Co. v. Bright, </em>8 Colo. 144; <em>Frost v. Pfeiffer, </em>26 Colo. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In this respect one test is, whether the legislation in the body of a bill is upon matters properly connected with its subject as expressed by its title, or proper to the more full accomplishment of the object so <em>indicated. </em>\u2014 Bd. <em>Co. </em>Comrs.. <em>El Paso Co. v. Bd. Co. Comrs. Teller Co., </em>32 Colo. 310; <em>Stewart v. Kinsella, </em>14 Minn. 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Our legislature has wisely provided that only those duly licensed and enrolled as attorneys shall engage in the general practice of the law in this state. This provision is for the protection of the public, and as a further means to this end, the act in question was passed. Its purpose, as expressed in its title, was to prevent persons not licensed from engaging in the practice of law. To accomplish this purpose to the full extent, it was not only appropriate and relevant to the subject of the bill as expressed in its title, but, also, a necessary incident to its object as thus indicated, to inhibit persons from representing themselves as attorneys-at-law when, in fact, they were not. We, therefore, conclude that the statute is not obnoxious to the provision of the constitution invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">From the admissions of the answer of respondent, he is guilty as charged in the information, and the motion for judgment on the pleadings is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">This is the first case that has been brought under the act of 1905. Respondent says in his answer that he has ceased to advertise as an attorney, and will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>obey the law in the fntnre. For this reason we will not impose any penalty at this time, hut will continue the proceeding for thirty days for the purpose of allowing respondent to fully state, under oath, the extent to which he intends to obey the provisions of the act of 1905, and has obeyed it since this proceeding was instituted, and also for the purpose of permitting the petitioner, on sufficient notice to respondent, to submit for our consideration testimony touching the claim of respondent, that since filing this petition he has ceased to violate the law in question. Respondent will submit his proofs within ten days; petitioner within ten days Thereafter; respondent to reply within the ten days next succeeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\n<em>Motion for judgment on pleadings sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Decision <em>en banc.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
