Immediately following the verdict, a sentencing hearing was held pursuant to the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711, and the jury unanimously sentenced appellant to death for each first degree murder conviction. On June 12, 1987, post-trial motions were heard and denied by the trial judge, who formally sentenced appellant to death for each of the two murders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">On June 14, 1987, two days after sentencing, appellant escaped from custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On August 11, 1987, while still a fugitive, appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal from the death sentence judgments. Appellant is presently incarcerated in British Columbia, Canada, where he is serving two ten-year prison terms for robberies. Pursuant to Article 6 of the extradition agreement between the United States and Canada, appellant cannot be extradited to Pennsylvania, because first degree murder is not punishable by death in Canada.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Treaty on Extradition, Dec. 3, 1971; amended June 28, 1974, July 29, 1974, United States-Canada, 27 U.S.T. 983, T.I.A.S. No. 8237; <em>Criminal Code, </em>R.S.C., c. C-46, s. 235(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>On December 22, 1989 this Court, <em>sua sponte, </em>entered a <em>per curiam </em>order limiting review of the case to sufficiency of the evidence, and propriety of the sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In derogation of this Court\u2019s order, appellant\u2019s attorney raised several claims of error for our review. Although this Court has the authority to correct errors at trial which the appellant raises<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, this Court\u2019s rules expressly provide for the quashing of an appeal when the appellant is a fugitive. Pa.R.A.P. 1972(6)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, and it is within the discretion of this Court to take such action <em>sua sponte. Commonwealth v. Tomlinson, </em>467 Pa. 22, 354 A.2d 254 (1976). Additionally, this Court has held that \u201ca defendant who elects to escape from custody <em>forfeits </em>his right to appellate review.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Passaro, </em>504 Pa. 611, 616, 476 A.2d 346, 349 (1984) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In <em>Passaro, </em>we noted that \u201c[disposition by dismissal of pending appeals of escaped prisoners is a longstanding and established principle of American law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>504 Pa. at 614-15, 476 A.2d at 348 (quoting <em>Estelle v. Dorrough, </em>420 U.S. 534, 537, 95 S.Ct. 1173, 1175, 43 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975)). In Pennsylvania we have consistently followed this practice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>E.g., Commonwealth v. Craddock, </em>522 Pa. 491, 564 A.2d 151 (1989); <em>Commonwealth v. Ciotti, </em>318 Pa.Super. 549, 465 A.2d 690 (1983) (en banc), <em>vacated, </em>506 Pa. 10, 483 A.2d 852 (1984); <em>Commonwealth v. Luckenbaugh, </em>356 Pa.Super. 355, 514 A.2d 896 (1986), <em>vacated, </em>520 Pa. 75, 550 A.2d 1317 (1988). Moreover, we have held that once the defendant has fled, his subsequent return or recapture does not provide a basis for reinstating his appeal. <em>Commonwealth v. Passaro, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Although <em>Passaro </em>was not a capital case, there is nothing in the broad language of the opinion that limits its holding to non-capital defendants. Dismissal of pending appeals of defendants escaped from death row is not a novel concept. <em>E.g., Allen v. Georgia, </em>166 U.S. 138, 17 S.Ct. 525, 41 L.Ed. 949 (1897); <em>Mosley v. State, </em>189 Ga. 71, 5 S.E.2d 47 (1939); <em>State v. Jugger, </em>217 La. 687, 47 So.2d 46 (1950); <em>see, Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 427, 323 S.E.2d 554 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>472 U.S. 1012, 105 S.Ct. 2713, 86 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985) (denying motion to dismiss only because the defendant surrendered within period set by court).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">However, because of the severity and finality of the sentence of death, we are statutorily mandated to review all death sentences pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(h).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>capital cases, we must also review the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction for murder of the first degree. <em>Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, </em>500 Pa. 16, 454 A.2d 987 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>463 U.S. 1236, 104 S.Ct. 31, 77 L.Ed.2d 1452 (1983). We will discharge this duty regardless of whether appellant has challenged his conviction on that ground. <em>Id., </em>500 Pa. at 26 n. 3, 454 A.2d at 942 n. 3. In <em>Commonwealth v. Heidnik, </em>526 Pa. 458, 587 A.2d 687 (1991), this Court held that notwithstanding appellant\u2019s desire not to pursue his appeal in order to expedite his execution, we will discharge our duty under the foregoing standard. <em>See also, Commonwealth v. Appel, </em>517 Pa. 529, 539 A.2d 780 (1988) (automatic review mandatory, regardless of appellant\u2019s desire to waive appeal). Consequently, appellant\u2019s election to flee does not allow him to subvert our goal of insuring that the death sentence comports with the Commonwealth\u2019s death penalty statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Therefore, even though appellant has forfeited his right to raise any claims of error, we will nonetheless review the sufficiency of the evidence to convict, and appellant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 9711(h), where appellant has become a fugitive from justice, and cannot be made subject to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Were we to decide to delay review pending appellant\u2019s return to this jurisdiction, which in this case may be twenty years, we run the risk that, should appellant be entitled to a new trial, the Commonwealth would have a difficult time retrying him, due to the common problems associated with the passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner, and must determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>there is sufficient evidence to enable the jury to find every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Bryant, </em>524 Pa. 564, 574 A.2d 590 (1990). Applying this standard, we find the evidence sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain the jury\u2019s verdicts of murder of the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The evidence adduced at trial discloses the following. On the evening of September 13, 1984, Christopher Outterbridge was engaged in a conversation with his girlfriend across the street from his house at 110 West Wyoming Avenue in Philadelphia. Appellant, Roger Judge, approached the couple and began taunting Christopher. Christopher informed appellant that he did not want to fight, and as he turned to walk away, appellant struck him in the face. In response, Christopher punched appellant, knocking him to the ground; Christopher then retreated to his home. Appellant chased Christopher into his home, where appellant was confronted by Christopher\u2019s older brother, Kenneth Outterbridge. After a brief scuffle with Kenneth, appellant left.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Several times that evening, appellant returned to the Outterbridge home. On one occasion appellant told Kia Outterbridge, Christopher\u2019s younger sister, that he would be back to kill Christopher. On another occasion, appellant returned to the Outterbridge home with a friend and both appeared to be concealing weapons. Afraid of a confrontation, Christopher sought assistance from his mother, who went out on the porch to confront the men. Appellant repeatedly ordered Ms. Outterbridge to send her son outside, but Ms. Outterbridge refused, and threatened to telephone the police. Appellant left, but informed Ms. Outterbridge that he intended to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">On September 14, 1984, the following evening, at approximately 11:45 p.m., Christopher and his friends were returning home from a nearby sandwich shop, when one of his friends briefly saw the appellant near the Outterbridge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>home.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When the group arrived at the Outterbridge home, they joined Christopher\u2019s sister Kia on the front porch. Moments later, appellant jumped out of the bushes, aimed his gun at Christopher, and fired five shots at the teenagers gathered on the porch. Christopher Outterbridge was shot in the back, and a friend of Christopher\u2019s sister, fifteen year old Tabatha Mitchell, was shot in the chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">After emptying his handgun of ammunition, appellant fled on foot in the direction of Marvine Street, but reversed direction when he realized that police vehicles were arriving from that direction. As he passed back in front of the Outterbridge house, one of Christopher\u2019s friends, Calvin Whitaker, unsuccessfully attempted to apprehend appellant. Appellant fled down a back alley as Calvin repeatedly called out appellant\u2019s street name, \u201cDobe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">A police officer arrived on the scene moments later, after hearing gunshots from the direction of the Outterbridge house. Christopher ran down the steps bleeding profusely from his neck and mouth and begged to be taken to the hospital; Calvin stood on the porch waving his arms and shouting \u201cIt was Dobe\u201d; and Tabatha lay on her back on the porch with a bullet hole in her chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The officer immediately called for police assistance and Christopher and Tabatha were transported to the hospital. While enroute to the hospital, Christopher, though barely alive, managed to tell police that \u201cDobe\u201d had shot him. Soon after arriving at the hospital, both victims were pronounced dead. Christopher died from a single gunshot wound; the bullet entered the right side of his back, traveled through his right lung, through a large blood vessel, and then lodged in the soft tissue of the right side of his neck. Tabatha Mitchell\u2019s life was also ended by a single gunshot wound; the bullet entered her abdomen, traveled through her liver and pancreas, grazed her backbone, and damaged two major blood vessels. The bullet finally lodged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>in the soft tissue of her back. According to the Medical Examiner, the manner of both deaths was homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Shortly after the shooting, officers established a crime scene and began an investigation. Two .32 caliber projectiles were recovered; one from the porch of the Outterbridge home, the other from a neighbor\u2019s property. The following day, several of Christopher\u2019s friends conducted an informal search of the back alley down which appellant had fled, and recovered the hooded jacket and sweat pants which appellant had discarded during his flight the night of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">An intensive search for appellant was conducted by the police, based upon the teenagers\u2019 eye-witness identifications of the assailant. Police apprehended appellant two and one-half weeks later with the help of Angela Smith. She had been with appellant the night of the shooting. She testified that sometime between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. appellant left stating that he had something to do. (N.T. 4/9/87, pp. 96, 115, 128). When appellant returned approximately one hour later he was out of breath, wet and wearing different clothes. She overheard appellant discussing the incident with his friend. Later, while driving with some others to East Falls, Ms. Smith asked appellant why he had killed \u201cthose two people,\u201d and he responded that he would tell her after he finished smoking a joint. (N.T. 4/9/97, p. 98). Although appellant never provided her with the requested information, he did tell her that he had disposed of the gun at the house next door to where the murders took place. (N.T. 4/9/87, pp. 98-99).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Approximately two weeks later, Ms. Smith received a telephone call from appellant. He informed her that he was in New Jersey waiting for his friends to bring him some money so that he could purchase a car and a bullet-proof vest. She asked him if he planned on turning himself in and he told her that that would be a \u201cdumb move.\u201d (N.T. 4/9/87, p. 102). Subsequent to this conversation, Ms. Smith was interviewed by the police. The homicide detectives instructed her to call them if she heard from appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>again. On October 2, 1984, Ms. Smith received three telephone calls from appellant informing her that he was on his way to see her and requested directions. She immediately contacted the police, enabling them to apprehend appellant as soon as he entered Ms. Smith\u2019s residence. Appellant was arrested, given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and then made an inculpatory statement to the investigating officer, that it \u201c[d]on\u2019t matter if I tell you why I did it or not, I know I\u2019m done.\u201d (N.T. 4/10/87, p. 48).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">On November 23, 1984, detectives recovered a rusted .32 caliber Smith and Wesson five-shot revolver from deep in the bushes in front of a basement window at 1114 West Wyoming Avenue. A microscopic comparison of the markings on the revolver and the bullets previously recovered,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> led a firearms expert to positively conclude, that three of the four bullet specimens came from the revolver found in the neighbor\u2019s yard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">At trial, appellant testified that he was with Angela Smith and five other people at the time the murders took place, and therefore could not have committed the murders which occurred at 11:49 p.m. However, appellant failed to produce any alibi witnesses, claiming that the District Attorney\u2019s office had intimidated them. (N.T. 4/13/87, pp. 49-51, 60, 70).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant admitted that he knew he was wanted by the police, even before the arrest and search warrants were issued, but hid from them in order to conduct his own investigation of the crime. His investigation failed to produce any exculpatory evidence and/or another suspect for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The foregoing evidence establishes that appellant, enraged by the confrontation he had had with Christopher the previous day, made good on his threats of retaliation, by stalking his victim, lying in wait at his home in order to ambush him, aiming his gun at him, and then firing five shots, striking his intended victim and an innocent bystander. The nature of this attack evinces behavior consistent with a premeditated, specific intent to cause death.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Based upon the evidence, a jury convicted appellant on April 15, 1987 of two counts of murder of the first degree and possession of an instrument of crime. Our review of the record compels us to conclude that the evidence was sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt to support the first degree murder convictions. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Our review is not complete until we fulfill our statutory obligation to assess the following: (1) whether the sentences of death were the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; (2) whether the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one specified aggravating circumstance; and (3) whether the sentences are excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">At the penalty hearing, immediately following the verdict, the jury found the existence of the following aggravating circumstances with regard to Christopher Outterbridge\u2019s death: \u201cIn the commission of the offense the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(7); \u201cThe defendant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(9); and \u201cThe defendant has been convicted of another Federal or State offense, committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue, for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable or the defendant was undergoing a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>of life imprisonment for any reason at the time of the commission of the offense.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">With regard to Tabatha Mitchell\u2019s death, the jury found the existence of the following aggravating circumstances: \u201cIn the commission of the offense the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(7); and \u201cThe defendant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The fact that appellant repeatedly fired his weapon at a group of children gathered in a confined porch area, in his attempt to kill Christopher Outterbridge, supports the finding of the jury that appellant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense. Any one of these children was at risk of being struck by an errant bullet; and, in fact, Tabatha Mitchell, an innocent bystander, was struck and killed by a bullet intended for Christopher Outterbridge. Additionally, stray bullets were recovered from the porch of the Outterbridge home and from a neighbor\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Appellant\u2019s significant history of violent felony convictions was sufficiently established by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of two prior convictions for robbery, and one prior conviction for aggravated assault. In light of appellant\u2019s violent tendencies, the jury\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstance (d)(9) was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Lastly, appellant\u2019s conviction of murder of the first degree for the killing of Tabatha Mitchell, justified the jury\u2019s finding regarding the murder of Christopher Outterbridge, that appellant had been convicted of another capital offense either before or at the time of the offense at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">The only mitigating circumstance the sentencing jury found with regard to both murders was that \u201cThe defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(e)(2). The jury then unanimously found that the aggravating circumstances out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>weighed the sole mitigating circumstance, and pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. 9711(c)(l)(iv), sentenced appellant to death for each of the two murders.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The circumstances of this crime and the record of this appellant justify our conclusion that the sentences of death imposed upon appellant are neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Commonwealth v. Frey, </em>504 Pa. 428, 475 A.2d 700 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 963, 105 S.Ct. 360, 83 L.Ed.2d 296 (1984) (and Appendix attached thereto). Additionally, we find, after a review of the record, that the sentences of death were a product of the evidence and not a product of \u201cpassion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we sustain the convictions of murder of the first degree and affirm the sentences of death.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b505-7\">ZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion in which CAPPY, J., joins.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">.
