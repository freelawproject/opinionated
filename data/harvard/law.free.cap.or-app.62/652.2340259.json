ORS 144.110(1), however, authorizes a trial court to impose a minimum term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\"><em>\u201cIn any felony case, </em>the court may impose a minimum term of imprisonment of up to one-half of the sentence <em>it imposes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The length of the minimum term is limited by the sentence imposed and <em>not </em>by the maximum indeterminate term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>provided for the underlying felony. Here, defendant was convicted of three Class A felonies. By the application of ORS 161.725, the trial court was authorized to impose a maximum 30-year sentence on each conviction, and it did so. ORS 144.110(1), by its plain language, allows the imposition of a minimum sentence of one-half of any term of years <em>imposed </em>as a maximum sentence. The 15-year minimum terms are expressly authorized by ORS 144.110(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">CONSTITUTIONALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Defendant also contends that the 15-year minimum terms are \u201cdisproportionate to the ten-year minimum term allowable for the completed act of murder,\u201d <em>see State v. Davis, </em>44 Or App 549, 606 P2d 671, <em>rev den </em>289 Or 45 (1980), and for that reason offend Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution and the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The argument is based on the premise that the courts have no authority to impose a minimum sentence greater than ten years <em>(i.e. </em>15 years) for murder. We hold that they have such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In <em>State v. Segner, </em>42 Or App 397, 600 P2d 916, <em>rev den </em>288 Or 253 (1979), we held that the court was within its authority in imposing a minimum ten-year sentence for murder under ORS 144.110, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">\u201cAlthough the statutes did not formerly expressly provide for a minimum term of imprisonment for a defendant sentenced to life imprisonment, <em>Class A Felonies allow a minimum term of imprisonment up to ten years. ORS 161.505. </em>For aggravated murder, ORS 163.105 authorizes 20 and 30 year mandatory minimum sentences. Therefore, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>follows from the statutory scheme of penalties that a minimum sentence imposed for a lesser crime is permissible [for murder] within the limitations prescribed by ORS 144.110(1). * * *\u201d 42 Or App at 400-01. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">In <em>State v. Davis, supra, </em>the trial court, having taken judicial notice that the defendant had a life expectancy of at least 46 years, sentenced him to a 20-year minimum term for murder. We agreed with the defendant\u2019s contention that under <em>Segner </em>the minimum term for murder could not exceed ten years and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">\u201c* * * \\ye also noted [in <em>Segner </em>that] the minimum term for a Class A felony could not exceed ten years [under ORS 144.110] because the maximum penalty for a class A felony was 20 years.* * *\u201d 44 Or App at 555.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\"> In both <em>Segner </em>and <em>Davis, </em>we assumed that the maximum indeterminate sentence that could be imposed following a conviction for a Class A felony was 20 years. <em>See </em>ORS 161.605. We neglected to consider that such a sentence could be enhanced<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that the enhanced sentence imposed, rather than the sentence provided for the underlying felony, would be the base for sentencing under ORS 144.110. Accordingly, we disapprove of <em>State v. Davis, supra, </em>to the extent that that decision suggests that a minimum sentence for murder imposed under ORS 144.110 in excess of ten years is unauthorized and hold that a sentence of up to 15 years for murder is permissible under that provision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The 15-year minimum terms imposed in this case do not exceed the maximum minimum sentence authorized for murder under ORS 144.110; therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>reject defendant\u2019s argument that the sentences are disproportionate. The trial court did not err in sentencing defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">We emphasize that this decision does no more than fill in a gap with respect to minimum sentencing for murder. The responsibility for resolving that dilemma ultimately rests with the legislature, which has not provided a specific minimum term for that offense. <em>See, generally, State v. Segner, supra </em>(Schwab, C.J., dissenting.)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-9\"> The cases are consolidated for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\"> A trial court has authority to impose consecutive sentences. <em>State u. Jones, </em>250 Or 59, 440 P2d 371 (1968). The court also imposed minimum terms of five years under ORS 161.610 to run concurrently with the 15-year minimum terms. ORS 161.610 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-11\">\u201c(5) The minimum terms of imprisonment for felony convictions in which the court finds that the defendant used or threatened to use a firearm shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-12\">\u201c(a) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, upon the first conviction for such felony, five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b700-13\"> Attempted murder and robbery in the first degree are Class A felonies. ORS 161.405(2)(a), 164.415(2). The maximum indeterminate sentence for a Class A felony is 20 years. ORS 161.605(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\"> Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 16 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">\u201c* * * Cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted, but all penalties shall be proportioned to the offense. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">US Const, Amend VIII, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">\u201cExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">Under the rule in <em>Cannon v. Gladden, </em>203 Or 629, 281 P2d 233 (1955), a greater sentence for an attempt than the penalty provided for the crime attempted violates Article I, section 16. In <em>State v. Shumway, </em>291 Or 153, 630 P2d 796 (1981), the court held unconstitutional the provision in ORS 163.115(5) requiring a person convicted of unaggravated murder to serve 25 years before becoming eligible for parole, because under the statutory scheme a person received a lesser minimum sentence for aggravated murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\"> The dangerous offender statute, ORS 161.725, does not provide for a separate penalty, but instead authorizes a sentence <em>in lieu, of </em>the sentence authorized for a particular crime. <em>State v. David, </em>28 Or App 775, 777, 561 P2d 189, <em>rev den </em>278 Or 393 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b702-8\"> As we stated in <em>State v. Segner, </em>42 Or App 397, 401, 600 P2d 916, <em>rev den </em>288 Or 253 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">\u201c* * * Any other interpretation of ORS 144.110(1) would lead to the incongruous result that a felon who stops short of killing his victim would potentially be subject to more lengthy imprisonment than one who actually kills the victim. Moreover, the ten-year minimum sentence imposed herein is significantly less than the 20-and 30-year minimum sentences provided for aggravated murder under ORS 163.105. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
