He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure to state reasons on the record for the sentences imposed, as required by ORS 137.120(2). The state concedes that the trial court erred but argues that the error is not reviewable, because defendant did not raise the issue at trial and that the error was harmless. We reject the state\u2019s arguments, because the trial court had no authority to impose sentences without complying with the mandatory terms of ORS 137.120(2); therefore, remand is necessary. <em>State v.
