Secretary of the Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>No. 90-1094 V (Ct.Fed.Cl. Aug. 5, 1993). We affirm-in-part, vaeate-in-part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">On September 20,1990, a petition was filed by the Pattons under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-660, \u00a7 311(a), 100 Stat. 3758 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-l to 300aa-34 (1988 &amp; Supp. II 1990)) (\u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cVaccine Act\u201d) seeking compensation for injuries allegedly sustained by their son after he received a diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccination on December 24,1959. The petition also contained claims requesting compensation for loss of earnings and pain and suffering pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(3), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">The case was assigned to a special master who conducted proceedings to determine whether the Pattons were entitled to an award, and if so, the amount of such award. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(d); Vaccine Rule 3. On April 20, 1992, the special master issued her decision, finding in favor of the Pattons on the issue of entitlement and determining the amount of compensation due. Pursuant to Vaccine Rule 10(b), the special master deferred ruling on the claims for pain and suffering and loss of earnings until she issued her decision regarding attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs. Both parties declined to seek review of the special master\u2019s decision and the Court of Federal Claims entered judgment in accordance with that decision on May 22, 1992. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(3); Vaccine Rule 11(a). On June 15, 1992, the Pattons elected to accept the court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-21(a); Vaccine R. 12(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">In an application filed on July 6, 1992, and later amended on July 20, 1992, petitioners requested attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in the proceeding before the special master pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(e) and Vaccine Rule 13. On August 28, 1992, the special master awarded petitioners $16,-157.01 for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Review of the special master\u2019s decision was not sought by either party and judgment was entered by the Court of Federal Claims in accordance with that decision on September 29,1992. The special master\u2019s decision, however, did not address the Pattons\u2019 claims for compensation for pain and suffering and loss of earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">On November 11, 1992, the Pattons filed a \u201cmotion for relief\u2019 under Vaccine Rule 1 requesting that the special master amend her August 28, 1992 decision to award an additional $13,842.99<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as compensation for pain and suffering and future earnings. The government opposed the Pattons\u2019 motion, arguing that the special master lacked jurisdiction under the Act to modify her decision once the Court of Federal Claims entered final judgment in accordance with that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">The special master rejected the government\u2019s jurisdictional challenge, concluding that jurisdiction does \u201cnot shift[ ] away from the Office of the Special Masters\u201d absent a motion for review filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(l). In addition, the special master concluded that she possessed \u201cinherent authority\u201d to correct her own mistakes, similar to that of the Court of Federal Claims under Rule 60 of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because \u201cthe power of the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>master to do so can be assumed\u201d and because such power is consistent with the mandate under Vaccine Rule 1 to \u201cdecide cases promptly and efficiently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">On the merits, the special master acknowledged that she had \u201cinadvertently omitted an award for pain and suffering\u201d in her August 28, 1992 decision awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and issued an \u201cOrder to Amend\u201d correcting that mistake on January 11, 1993. Accordingly, she awarded the Pattons $13,-842.99 for pain and suffering and emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">The government moved for review of the Order by the Court of Federal Claims. The government reasserted its contention that the special master was without jurisdiction under the Vaccine Act to modify her decision after it was reduced to a final judgment, notwithstanding that she had mistakenly omitted an award for pain and suffering. The Court of Federal Claims agreed, holding as a matter of law that a special master lacks authority to amend her decision once judgment is entered thereon by the court. <em>Patton, </em>28 Fed.Cl. at 535-37. The court further rejected the special master\u2019s conclusion that she possessed inherent authority to grant Rule 60-type relief to correct her decision. The court found that Rule 60 is not incorporated into the Vaccine Rules and that those rules are devoid of any provision upon which such inherent authority can be based. <em>Id. </em>at 537-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Accordingly, on June 7, 1993, judgment was entered by the court vacating the special master\u2019s Order to Amend and reinstating the court\u2019s original judgment of September 29, 1992. On July 20, 1993, the Pattons moved for relief under Rule 60 from the court\u2019s judgment, requesting that the court amend the judgment to award damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress in the amount of $13,842.99. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">The Pattons now appeal from both the court\u2019s judgment reinstating the terms of the special master\u2019s original decision and the court\u2019s denial of their motion for relief under Rule 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">I. Special Master\u2019s Authority to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"AFo\">\u201c[I]n a case arising under the 1989 amendments to the Vaccine Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we review <em>de novo </em>the [Court of Federal Claims\u2019] determination as to whether or not the special master\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. In effect, then, we review the underlying decision of the special master under the ... standard[s] of \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(B).\u201d <em>Hines v. Secretary of the Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>940 F.2d 1518, 1524 (Fed.Cir.1991). <em>See also Edgar v. Secretary of the Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>989 F.2d 473, 475 (Fed.Cir.1993); <em>Bradley v. Secretary of the Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>991 F.2d 1570, 1574 (Fed.Cir.1993); <em>Grant v. Secretary of the Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>956 F.2d 1144, 1146 (Fed.Cir.1992). Whether the special master has jurisdiction to amend her decision after the Court of Federal Claims has entered judgment thereon is a legal question which we review <em>de novo. See Widdoss v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>989 F.2d 1170, 1174 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 114 S.Ct. 381, 126 L.Ed.2d 331 (1993); <em>Whitecotton v. Secretary of the Dep\u2019t Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>17 F.3d 374, 376 (Fed.Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-17\">In granting the government\u2019s motion to vacate the special master\u2019s Order to Amend, the trial court found that there was no legal basis to support the special master\u2019s conclusion that she retained jurisdiction to correct her decision after a judgment was entered by the court. The court identified two events by which the special master is divested of jurisdiction under the Vaccine Act. First, if a motion for review is filed by either party within 30 days of the issuance of a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>master\u2019s decision, the Court of Federal Claims assumes exclusive jurisdiction over the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2). Once such a motion is properly filed, jurisdiction passes to the court and the special master\u2019s jurisdiction reattaches only if the case is subsequently remanded for further action. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(C). Second, if the parties fail to seek review of the special master\u2019s decision within the 30-day period, then jurisdiction is lost once the clerk of the Court of Federal Claims enters judgment in accordance with that decision. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(3). It is the latter situation that exists here.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The Pattons maintain that the trial court erred in concluding that the special master did not retain jurisdiction to amend her decision after the court entered final judgment in accordance with that decision. The Pattons assert that authority for the special master\u2019s continuing jurisdiction can be found in Rule 60 of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims, the Vaccine Rules, and the \u201cinherent\u201d powers of the special master. We will consider each of these alleged bases of authority in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">First, the Pattons argue that a special master possesses authority equivalent to that of the Court of Federal Claims under Rule 60 to amend or correct her decision after a judgment has been entered. The Pattons argue that although their failure to file a timely motion for review under section 300aa-12(e)(l) prohibits the court from reviewing the merits of the special master\u2019s decision, the special master nevertheless retains Rule 60-type authority to amend her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">In asserting that the power of the Court of Federal Claims to grant relief from judgment under Rule 60 is also available to a special master, the Pattons ignore the distinction between the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims and the Vaccine Rules, which govern practice and procedure for the proceedings of the court and the special masters, respectively. Unlike the court, which has express authority under its Rule 60 to afford relief from a final judgment, a special master is without such power under the Vaccine Rules.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">The RCFC apply to special masters \u201conly to the extent referenced\u201d in the Vaccine Rules, Vaccine R. 1, and the Pattons concede that the provisions of Rule 60 have not been so referenced.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the tribunal charged with setting out the rules governing proceedings before the special masters, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(2), the Court of Federal Claims apparently chose to reserve the power to grant Rule 60-type relief for itself, withholding such power from the special masters. <em>See Donovan v. Secretary of the Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>28 Fed.Cl. 459, 461, 462 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>17 F.3d 1442 (Fed.Cir.1994) (table). Thus, a special master may not avail herself of the authority conferred by Rule 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">Alternatively, the Pattons argue that the ability of the special master to grant relief from a decision after judgment has been entered is authorized by Vaccine Rule 1, which entitles the special masters to \u201cregulate the applicable practice, consistent with these rules and with the purpose of the Vaccine Act, to decide cases promptly and efficiently.\u201d We reject the Pattons\u2019 overly broad reading of Vaccine Rule 1. The rule expresses the Vaccine Act\u2019s underlying objective to provide expeditious and conclusive resolution of vaccine-injury claims. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 908, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 17 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6287, 6358. That general mandate, however, cannot be interpreted as endowing special masters with powers contemplated neither by Congress in enacting the Vaccine Act nor by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>the Court of Federal Claims in promulgating the Vaccine Rules. The discretion afforded special masters under Vaccine Rule 1 may not be exercised in a manner that would disturb or exceed the framework laid out by the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to its authority under the Act. <em>Cf. United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 589-90, 61 S.Ct. 767, 771, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941) (\u201cAn authority conferred upon a court to make rules of procedure for the exercise of its jurisdiction is not an authority to enlarge that jurisdiction!;.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Notwithstanding the absence of any express provision authorizing a special master to amend her decision after a judgment has been entered, the Pattons argue that special masters have \u201cinherent\u201d power, independent of any statute or rule, to grant relief from their decisions. The Pattons point to the \u201chistorical\u201d authority of federal courts to correct or amend their judgments, now codified at Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a), and insist that special masters possess a similar capability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The Pattons fail to recognize that special masters are not provided with the same powers as federal courts. Established under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, federal courts have \u201cplenary power ... to modify [a] judgment for error of fact or law or even revoke it altogether.\u201d <em>Zimmern v. United States, </em>298 U.S. 167, 169-70, 56 S.Ct. 706, 706-07, 80 L.Ed. 1118 (1936). The 1938 promulgation of Rule 60(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which permits a federal court to correct clerical mistakes and errors arising from oversight or omission, expressly recognized \u201ca power that the courts always have had.\u201d 11 Charles A. Wright <em>&amp; </em>Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2854 (1973 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">In contrast, the Office of Special Masters owes its existence to and derives its powers from the Vaccine Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(c), (d). As a \u201ccreature of statute ... [a]ny and all authority pursuant to which [a special master] may act ultimately must be grounded in an express grant from Congress.\u201d <em>Killip v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>991 F.2d 1564, 1569 (Fed.Cir.1993). Thus, any authority held by the special masters to correct decisions must flow from the Vaccine Act or its implementing Vaccine Rules, and not from any \u201cinherent\u201d source of power. In the absence of any express provision allowing the special master to grant Rule 60-type relief, the special master\u2019s involvement in the case ends, as a matter of law, once the period for seeking review of her decision expires and judgment is entered by the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See Grimes v. Secretary of the Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>988 F.2d 1196, 1198 (Fed.Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Finally, the Pattons contend that because the special master did not dispose of their claims for compensation for pain and suffering in her August 28, 1992 decision awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, that decision constituted an interlocutory decision on which a final judgment could not be entered. That argument, however, disregards the decisional scheme established under the Vaccine Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Under Vaccine Rule 13, a special master\u2019s decision on compensation for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs is separate from her decision on compensation for vaccine-related injury for purposes of seeking review by the Court of Federal Claims under Vaccine Rule 11. Additionally, for certain \u201cretrospective cases,\u201d such as the instant case, in which the vaccine recipient is not deceased and the vaccine was administered prior to October 1, 1988, Vaccine Rule 10(b) provides that the special master shall postpone deciding compensation for pain and suffering until she issues her decision on attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Upon expiration of the 30-day time limit or upon notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>that the parties waive their review rights, the clerk of the Court of Federal Claims is mandated to enter judgment \u201cimmediately\u201d in accordance with the special master\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(3); Vaccine Rule 11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">In the instant case, the special master issued two separate decisions: one awarding compensation for injury and one awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. That she failed to rule on the claims for pain and suffering when she awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and costs does not render that decision \u201cinterlocutory.\u201d The 30-day filing period runs from \u201cissuance of the special master\u2019s decision,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(l), and the mandate to enter judgment after the filing period expires does not require that the decision must have expressly addressed all the issues. Thus, the special master\u2019s decision was properly reduced to a final judgment after the parties failed to seek review within the 30-day time limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">II. Relief from Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">The Pattons also appeal from the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims denying their motion under Rule 60 requesting that the court amend its judgment of September 29,1992 and award compensation for pain and suffering. However, before we review the trial court\u2019s ruling, we must first address the question whether the court had jurisdiction to rule on the Pattons\u2019 Rule 60 motion in the absence of a timely motion for review. We have plenary authority to consider whether the lower tribunal\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction was correct, <em>see Galloway Farms, Inc. v. United States, </em>834 F.2d 998, 1000 (Fed.Cir.1987), and we may address this issue <em>sua sponte, see Lake County Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>440 U.S. 391, 398, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 1175, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">We considered the jurisdictional implications of the failure to comply with the 30-day time limit to file a motion for review under section 300aa-12(e)(1) in <em>Widdoss v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>989 F.2d 1170 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 114 S.Ct. 381, 126 L.Ed.2d 331 (1993). In <em>Widdoss, </em>the petitioner filed her petition for review 31 days after issuance of the special master\u2019s decision denying compensation. Because the petition was untimely under section 300aa-12(e)(l), final judgment was entered in accordance with the special master\u2019s decision pursuant to section 300aa-12(e)(3). The petitioner moved for relief under Rule 60(b), \u201curging that the Claims Court vacate the judgment and review the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1174. The trial court granted the motion and reversed the special master\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">On appeal, we held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain and rule on the merits of the petitioner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. In so holding, we concluded that \u201cthe 30-day time period in which to file a motion for review under section 300aa-12(e)(l) is jurisdictional,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1177, and that the trial court erred in \u201cemploying [Rule] 60(b) to create jurisdiction to review the merits of the petition,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">In the instant case, the trial court did not consider <em>Widdoss </em>as barring it from considering the Pattons\u2019 Rule 60 motion, despite the fact that neither party filed a motion for review within the 30-day time limit. It concluded that \u201c[w]hile the court recognizes that it cannot invoke RCFC 60(b) to review the merits of a special master\u2019s decision in the absence of a timely motion for review, <em>Wid-doss v. Secretary DHHS, </em>[989 F.2d 1170 (Fed.Cir.1993) ], the court does not interpret the <em>Widdoss </em>decision or the Vaccine Act as precluding the court from invoking RCFC 60(b) to relieve a party from a judgment for the limited purposes listed in this rule.\u201d 28 Fed.Cl. at 539-40 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">Our holding in <em>Widdoss </em>that Rule 60(b) cannot be used to circumvent the Vaccine Act\u2019s express procedure for seeking review of the merits of a special master\u2019s decision is consistent with the settled principle that the rule is not to be used as a substitute for an appeal. <em>See Ackermann v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 193, 198-99, 71 S.Ct. 209, 211-12, 95 L.Ed. 207 (1950). A petitioner may not attempt to do indirectly through Rule 60(b) that which it is prohibited from doing directly under the appeals process prescribed by the Act. However, we agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>the trial court that the 30-day time limit of section 300aa-12(e)(1) presents no jurisdictional bar to the court\u2019s consideration of a Rule 60 motion where the movant does not seek review of the merits of the special master\u2019s decision, but rather requests correction of an error of the court. Although the failure to file a timely motion seeking review of a special master\u2019s decision deprives the Court of Federal Claims of jurisdiction to review the merits of that decision, it does not prohibit the court from granting relief from the judgment where the relief sought does not involve consideration of the merits of the case, but comes within the requirements of Rule 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Unlike the petitioner in <em>Widdoss, </em>the Pattons do not challenge the findings or conclusions underlying the special master\u2019s decision to award compensation for a vaccine-related injury and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Instead, they request that the court amend the final judgment to reflect the special master\u2019s actual stated intent to award compensation for pain and suffering, which was not realized due to the special master\u2019s acknowledged inadvertence and error. Thus, the error from which the Pattons seek relief is not one regarding the merits of the special master\u2019s decision, but simply the failure of the special master to effectuate her intent to award compensation for pain and suffering. Because the Pattons did not attempt to appeal the merits of the special master\u2019s decision in a manner inconsistent with the \u201ccarefully circumscribed appellate process under the Vaccine Act,\u201d <em>Widdoss, </em>989 F.2d at 1178, we conclude that the court did not impermissibly extend its jurisdiction beyond that prescribed by Congress in considering the Rule 60 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Having concluded that the trial court had jurisdiction over the Rule 60 motion, we now address the propriety of the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion. As a preliminary matter, the parties dispute the appropriate standard of review applicable to this issue. The Pattons argue that we should review the court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, see Dehne v. United States, </em>970 F.2d 890, 892 (Fed.Cir.1992), because it was \u201capparently based upon a finding of a lack of jurisdiction.\u201d The government, on the other hand, contends that the decision whether to grant or deny Rule 60 relief is within the discretion of the trial court, which we should review for abuse of discretion. <em>See Information Sys., </em>994 F.2d at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">We agree with the government that the trial court\u2019s ruling should be reviewed on an abuse of discretion basis. As discussed above, it is clear from the court\u2019s reasoning that the denial of the Pattons\u2019 motion for relief from judgment was based not on a lack of jurisdiction but on the court\u2019s conclusion that the Pattons were not entitled to such relief for failure to pursue pre-judgment remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">\u201cAn abuse of discretion exists when, <em>inter alia, </em>the lower court\u2019s decision was based on an erroneous conclusion of law or on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>Broyhill Furniture Indus., Inc. v. Craftmaster Furniture Corp., </em>12 F.3d 1080, 1083 (Fed.Cir.1993). A court\u2019s misinterpretation or misapplication of its own rules is an error of law. <em>See id. </em>at 1087; <em>Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. at 589-90, 61 S.Ct. at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">Rule 60(a) affords relief from minor clerical mistakes or errors arising from simple oversight or omission. <em>See </em>6A James W. Moore and Jo Desha Lucas, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 60.06[1] (2d ed. 1993); <em>see also United States v. Bealey, </em>978 F.2d 696, 699 (Fed.Cir.1992). It is intended to allow the judgment to \u201cspeak the truth,\u201d but not to substantially alter the rights of the parties thereto. <em>See Wright &amp; Miller, supra, </em>\u00a7 2854. Errors of a more substantial nature are more appropriately correctable under subdivision (b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Moore, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 60.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>06[4]. The failure of the special master to rule on the Pattons\u2019 claims for compensation for pain and suffering was more than a mere clerical error or oversight. Awarding compensation for pain and suffering is a discretionary matter and does not follow as of right when an award of compensation for vaccine- \" related injuries is made. Nor does an award for pain and suffering necessarily follow when the special master allows an award for attorneys\u2019 fees in a deferred ruling pursuant ..to Vaccine Rule 10(b). Thus, if relief from judgment is to be had in this case, it must be obtained under Rule 60(b). <em>See Scola v. Boat Frances, R., Inc., </em>618 F.2d 147, 153 (1st Cir.1980) (subdivision (a) covers those omissions or mistakes resulting from a court\u2019s failure to perform a ministerial duty, as opposed to a deliberative or discretionary act addressable by subdivision (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">In denying the motion, the trial court concluded that \u201c[r]elief from judgment is not merited in the instant case ... where the error that petitioners allege as a legal basis for relief that they requested was capable of being raised before judgment was entered.\u201d 28 Fed.Cl. at 540 n. 13. Thus, despite acknowledging that the absence of a timely motion for review did not divest it of authority to grant Rule 60 relief, the trial court nevertheless concluded that the Pat-tons were not entitled to such relief because a timely motion for review was not filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">The practical effect of the trial court\u2019s circular reasoning is to preclude access to the post-judgment remedies of Rule 60(b) whenever pre-judgment remedies are not pursued. Consequently, according to the trial court, the only means available to correct a mistake by the special master is to file a timely motion for review under section 300aa-12(e)(1). That restrictive view of the availability of Rule 60(b) relief renders the rule a legal nullity and is inconsistent with its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">As a remedial provision, Rule 60(b) is to be \u201cliberally construed for the purpose of doing substantial justice.\u201d 7 Moore, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 60.18[8], 60.19; <em>see also Klapprott v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 601, 609, 69 S.Ct. 384, 387, 93 L.Ed. 266, <em>modified, </em>336 U.S. 942, 69 S.Ct. 384, 93 L.Ed. 1099 (1949). Under Rule 60(b)(1), relief may be granted from \u201cjudicial error\u201d when inadvertence is shown and the motion is made within a reasonable time. <em>See CRI, Inc. v. Watson, </em>608 F.2d 1137, 1143 (8th Cir.1979). That the problems encountered by the Pattons may have been avoided had they sought correction before judgment was entered is not itself a sufficient basis to preclude relief under Rule 60(b). The exhaustion of pre-judgment remedies is not a mandatory condition precedent for obtaining post-judgment relief under Rule 60(b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The rule, by its very nature, affords relief within a reasonable time <em>after </em>a final judgment is entered and cannot be invoked before the entry of judgment on the special master\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60 advisory committee\u2019s note to 1946 amendment (60(b) applies only to final judgments).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">It is undisputed, and the special master\u2019s Order to Amend makes abundantly clear, that it was the intention of the special master to award compensation for pain and suffering and that \u201c[t]he omission of such award was inadvertently and mistakenly overlooked.\u201d Congress has specifically provided that pain and suffering associated with a vaccine-relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>ed injury should be adequately compensated for by means of a monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Nonetheless, while we hold that the court erred in concluding that the exhaustion of pre-judgment remedies is a prerequisite to seeking relief under Rule 60(b), and while it is not apparent to us that reasons otherwise exist here for denying such relief in view of the admission by the special master that an award of compensation for pain and suffering was inadvertently omitted, we are reluctant to decide a matter which has not been fully developed by the trial court and which is committed to its discretion. The trial court\u2019s order denying the motion for relief provides no findings of fact or conclusions of law other than that contained in footnote 13 of its June 4, 1993 opinion, which we hold inadequate as a matter of law to sustain denial of Rule 60(b) relief. Where no adequate basis exists upon which to review the appealed judgment due to insufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law, the judgment should be vacated and the action remanded for further consideration. <em>See ACS Hosp. Sys., Inc. v. Montefiore Hosp., </em>732 F.2d 1572, 1578 (Fed.Cir.1984). Accordingly, we vacate the court\u2019s judgment of August 5,1993 denying the Pat-tons\u2019 Rule 60 motion and remand the case to the trial court to reconsider whether the Pattons are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">The trial court correctly held that the special master was without authority to amend her decision once final judgment was entered thereon pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(3). The court also correctly concluded that failure to file a motion for review within the 30-day time limit of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(1) did not divest the court of jurisdiction to entertain a Rule 60 motion for relief from judgment when that motion does not seek review of the merits of the special master\u2019s decision. However, because the court\u2019s judgment denying post-judgment relief was based on incorrect reasoning and was not otherwise supported by sufficient findings of fact or conclusions of law, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for reconsideration of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">Costs to the Pattons.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED-IN-PART, VACATED-IN-PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-16\">.

In making this argument, the Pattons seem to suggest that the Court of Federal Claims possesses the same powers as the Article III courts. That court was established by Congress under its Article I powers, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 171(a) (1988), and it is not entitled to exercise the \u201cjudicial Power of the United States\" bestowed exclusively by the Constitution on Article III courts. <em>See Northern Pipeline Co. v.

Whether the Court of Federal Claims has \"inherent\" power to correct its judgments apart from that expressly conferred under Rule 60(a) need not be addressed here.
