In January 2001, the State suspended her license for six months, as authorized under \u00a7 61-5-208, MCA, after she was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI). At the conclusion of the six-month suspension, the State notified Bessette that her license would remain suspended until she paid the license reinstatement fee. Bessette did not pay the fee. In August 2005, the State purported to \u201csuspend\u201d her license again for failing to pay costs or appear in Justice Court on an unrelated matter. In November 2006, Bessette was ticketed for driving while her license was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">\u00b64 Appearing in Missoula County Justice Court, she moved to dismiss the charge based on <em>City of Billings v. Gonzales, </em>2006 MT 24, 331 Mont. 71, 128 P.3d 1014, arguing that she could not be convicted of driving on a suspended license because her license had expired in April 2006 and she did not have a license at the time of the charge. The Justice Court denied her motion. Following the denial, she entered a conditional guilty plea and appealed to the Fourth Judicial District Court where she filed another motion to dismiss. The District Court denied her motion. She appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">\u00b65 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal proceeding is a question of law which we review de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion of law is correct. <em>State v. Walker, </em>2008 MT 244, \u00b6 9, 344 Mont. 477, \u00b6 9, 188 P.3d 1069, \u00b6 9 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b66 Relying on <em>Gonzales, </em>Bessette argues that she cannot be convicted of driving under a suspended license because at the time she was charged with the offense she had no valid license. She maintains that <em>Gonzales\u2019 </em>holding-\u201ca person who does not have a privilege to drive ... cannot be charged with driving while their privilege has been suspended or revoked under \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA\u201d-mandates that the District Court should have granted her motion to dismiss. <em>Gonzales, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b67 The State counters that <em>Gonzales </em>is distinguishable in that four of the five defendants in <em>Gonzales </em>had never had Montana driver\u2019s licenses and the other defendant had not had a license in Montana in over twenty years. Conversely, Bessette applied for and obtained a driver\u2019s license in 1998. Under \u00a7 61-2-107, MCA, her license was indefinitely suspended in 2001 to be reinstated upon payment of the reinstatement fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b68 The District Court concluded that \u00a7 61-2-107, MCA, applied and that under this statute Bessette\u2019s license suspension continued indefinitely, even after the expiration date imprinted on her license. As a result, she could be charged with and convicted of driving on a suspended license.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b69 The \u201cdriving while suspended\u201d statute in effect at the time of Bessette\u2019s offense, \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA (2005), provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asn\">(1) (a) A person commits the offense of driving a motor vehicle during a suspension or revocation period if the person drives:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">(i) a motor vehicle on any public highway of this state at a time when the person\u2019s privilege to do so is suspended or revoked in this state or any other state;...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">\u00b610 The statute relied upon by the State and the District Court, \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA (2005), provides: \u201c[njotwithstanding the provisions of any other law of the state, a driver\u2019s license that has been suspended or revoked under 61-5-205 or 61-8-402 must remain suspended or revoked until the driver has paid to the department a fee of $200 in addition to any other fines, forfeitures, and penalties assessed as a result of conviction for a violation of the traffic laws of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">\u00b611 While the State correctly identifies facts that distinguish <em>Gonzales </em>from the case before us, it fails to note the more significant legal distinction-the applicability and interpretation of \u00a7 61-2-107, MCA, was not before the Court in <em>Gonzales. </em>In other words, in <em>Gonzales </em>the City of Billings did not argue that the defendants had valid licenses that were suspended or revoked and remained that way under \u00a7 61-2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>107, MCA. For this reason, both Bessette\u2019s and the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Gonzales </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b612 We addressed the application of this statute in the context of a charge of \u201cdriving while suspended\u201d in <em>State v. Cooney, </em>284 Mont. 500, 945 P.2d 891 (1997). In December 1995, Cooney was arrested for DUI. His driving record revealed that he had been convicted of three previous DUIs-October 1984, September 1986, and July 1989. In February 1996, he was charged with felony DUI, fourth offense, and misdemeanor driving with a suspended or revoked license. In April 1996, he moved to dismiss both charges on grounds of ex post facto application of the pertinent statutes. The District Court denied the motions and Cooney appealed. His argument relative to his felony dismissal is not relevant; however, his argument vis-\u00e1-vis his misdemeanor charge is apposite. <em>Cooney, </em>284 Mont. at 502, 945 P.2d at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b613 Cooney argued that his misdemeanor charge of driving while suspended/revoked should have been dismissed based on the legislative change to \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA, that occurred between the 1987 statute and the 1989 statute. The 1987 version of the statute stated that a suspended or revoked license \u201cmay not be restored\u201d until the driver paid the reinstatement fee and any other applicable fines and penalties. The 1989 statute stated that a suspended or revoked license \u201cmust remain suspended or revoked\u201d until the driver paid the required fees, fines and penalties. Cooney argued that the 1989 version of the statute, as it applied to his 1989 DUI, was \u201cmore onerous.\u201d He expressly argued that under the 1987 statute, despite his failure to pay the required reinstatement fee, his license would have expired on its own terms by 1993. He opined that under the 1989 statute his license would remain revoked. While the Court resolved Cooney\u2019s claim on an ex post facto analysis, its language, nonetheless, is relevant to the case at bar.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">Furthermore, looking to the plain language of both the 1987 and 1989 versions of \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA, we conclude that the 1989 amendments to \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA (1987), merely clarified that a period of suspension or revocation continues until a defendant pays the required fee. Here, because Cooney had not paid this fee prior to December 16,1995, the date of his arrest, the revocation of his license was still in effect, and, therefore, he was properly charged with violating \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA (1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\"><em>Cooney, </em>284 Mont. at 510, 945 P.2d at 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u00b614  The circumstances in <em>Gonzales </em>dictated the holding of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>case-absent a license or privilege to drive without a license, the State cannot convict a person for driving on a suspended or revoked license. However, under the unequivocal language of \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA, a valid driver\u2019s license that has been suspended or revoked \u201cmust remain suspended or revoked\u201d until the driver pays the required fees, fines and penalties. This statute serves to allow the State to charge a driver with \u201cdriving while suspended or revoked\u201d even after the license would have expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b615 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
