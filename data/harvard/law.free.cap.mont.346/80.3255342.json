We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u00b62 On July 7, 2005, Clark was cited by a City of Bozeman police officer with operating a motor vehicle without proof of insurance, second offense, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 61-6-302, MCA. He pleaded not guilty at his initial appearance in Municipal Court on July 21, 2005. Following four continuances, three of which were requested by Clark, the court set a bench trial for June 12, 2006. Clark failed to appear for trial on this date, and the court tried and convicted him in absentia.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\u00b63 After finding Clark guilty, the court solicited a sentencing recommendation from the prosecutor. Thereupon, the court stated that \u201cthe sentence of the court\u201d was 6 months in the Gallatin County Detention Center, all suspended, a $450 fine, and $120 in costs. In addition, the court listed a number of conditions on \u201cthe sentence imposed this afternoon.\u201d Finally, the court required Clark to surrender to the Department of Motor Vehicles, for a period of 90 days, the license plates and registration of the vehicle he had been driving. The court\u2019s written sentencing order, dated June 12, 2006, is identical to the court\u2019s oral sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\u00b64 Also on June 12, 2006, the Municipal Court issued a bench warrant due to Clark\u2019s failure to appear. The bench warrant was served in Missoula on or about July 11, 2006, and Clark appeared before the Municipal Court on July 14, 2006. At this time, the court informed Clark of \u201cthe sentence that <em>was imposed\u201d </em>on June 12 (emphasis added). However, in explaining the 90-day suspension of the license plates and registration, the court stated that the vehicle Clark had been driving \u201ccannot be operated for 90 days once this sentence is imposed, which is now, today, even though this occurred on June 12th.... You didn\u2019t know about it, so <em>it\u2019s imposed today\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Furthermore, the court informed Clark that \u201cany period of appeal that might exist begins to run from today.\u201d In this regard, we note that the Uniform Municipal Court Rules of Appeal to District Court (\u201cU.M.C.R.App.\u201d; <em>see </em>Title 25, Chapter 30, MCA) provide that an appeal from a judgment in a criminal case shall be taken by filing a timely notice of appeal in the municipal court \u201cwithin 10 days\u201d (not including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>U.M.C.R.App. 4(a), 5(b)(3), 20(a); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b65 Clark, proceeding pro se, filed a combined Notice of Appeal and Request for Public Defender on July 28, 2006-46 days after the Municipal Court found him guilty and first announced his sentence, and 10 business days after he appeared on the bench warrant and was informed of the sentence. The Municipal Court transferred the file to District Court on August 15, 2006. That same day, the District Court gave notice that it had received the file and that, pursuant to U.M.C.R.App. 14(a), Clark had 15 days in which to file a brief. Notwithstanding, on August 21, 2006, the District Court sua sponte issued an order dismissing Clark\u2019s appeal on the ground that his appeal from the Municipal Court was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b66 Clark, now represented by counsel, appeals from the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u00b67 The sole issue raised by Clark is whether the District Court erred in its determination that Clark\u2019s appeal from the Municipal Court was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\u00b68 To determine whether Clark\u2019s appeal was untimely, it is necessary to determine when Clark\u2019s sentence was imposed by the Municipal Court. This latter determination involves the application of controlling legal principles to undisputed factual circumstances. As such, it is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review de novo. <em>See State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23, 327 Mont. 352, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23, 114 P.3d 254, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23. Similarly, the interpretation and construction of a rule of procedure is a matter of law, which we review de novo, determining whether the court\u2019s interpretation and construction of the rule is correct. <em>Miller v. District Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 22, 337 Mont. 488, \u00b6 22, 162 P.3d 121, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err in its determination that Clark\u2019s appeal from the Municipal Court was untimely?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Abc\">\u00b610  An appeal from a municipal court in a criminal case may be taken only from a final judgment of conviction and orders after judgment. U.M.C.RApp. 5(b)(2); \u00a7 46-20-104(1), MCA. A judgment is not \u201cfinal\u201d until the sentence is pronounced by the court. Section 46-1-202(11), MCA; <em>see also State v. Bonamarte, </em>2006 MT 291, \u00b6 6, 334 Mont. 376, \u00b6 6, 147 P.3d 220, \u00b6 6. The oral pronouncement of sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>is the legally effective sentence. <em>State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6 40, 288 Mont. 286, \u00b6 40, 957 P.2d 9, \u00b6 40. However, the period for filing the notice of appeal runs from the date on which the court enters the written judgment and sentence following oral pronouncement. <em>See Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lastly, as noted above, an appeal from a municipal court judgment in a criminal case must be taken within 10 days (not including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the judgment and sentence are entered. U.M.C.R.App. 4(a), 5(b)(3), 20(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b611 The parties do not dispute these rules, nor do they dispute that Clark\u2019s notice of appeal was filed within 10 business days after July 14, 2006. Rather, they disagree as to what date the period for filing Clark\u2019s notice of appeal began to run. More specifically, they disagree as to when the Municipal Court\u2019s final judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b612 Clark contends that his sentence was orally pronounced on July 14,2006, when he appeared on the bench warrant. He points out that the Municipal Court explicitly stated that it was imposing sentence that day. He acknowledges that the court, at one point, referred to the sentence previously announced on June 12 as \u201cthe sentence that was imposed,\u201d but he maintains that what the court meant was that it had \u201cdetermined\u201d the terms of his sentence on June 12 and that it was \u201cimposing\u201d that sentence as of July 14. Moreover, he points out that the Municipal Court specifically told him that \u201cany period of appeal that might exist begins to run from today\u201d-i.e., from July 14, 2006. Thus, Clark maintains that his sentence was not entered until July 14 and, thus, that his time for filing his notice of appeal began to run on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b613 In response, the State insists that oral pronouncement of sentence occurred on June 12, 2006. The State points out that the Municipal Court did not issue an order following Clark\u2019s conviction \u201csetting a sentencing hearing or otherwise reserving sentence for the personal appearance of Clark.\u201d The State also points out that \u201c \u00a3[i]n all misdemeanor cases, the verdict may be returned <em>and the sentence imposed </em>without the defendant being present\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added; quoting \u00a7 46-16-123(1), MCA). Thus, the State maintains that Clark\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>sentence was pronounced in open court on June 12 \u201cregardless of whether Clark was informed of the sentence at the time.\u201d As for Clark\u2019s July 14, 2006 appearance in the Municipal Court, the State contends that this hearing was \u201cas a result of a bench warrant\u201d and was \u201cnot, in name, form, or substance, a \u2018sentencing hearing.\u2019 \u201d In addition, the State asserts that the Municipal Court \u201cwas without authority to extend the rules of procedure and allow additional time for Clark to appeal his sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b614 A critical issue is readily apparent from the parties\u2019 arguments and the facts of this case. Clark contends that his sentence was not imposed until he appeared in court on July 14,2006, whereas the State contends that his sentence was imposed in his absence on June 12, 2006. Thus, in determining the legally effective date of Clark\u2019s sentence, the question arises as to whether a defendant can lawfully be sentenced in absentia on a misdemeanor offense. In this regard, we note that this Court held in <em>Lane </em>that \u201cthe sentence orally pronounced from the bench <em>in the presence of the defendant </em>is the legally effective sentence and valid, final judgment.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 40 (emphasis added). This holding rested on a number of considerations. We noted that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be present in the courtroom when his sentence is pronounced. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6 31. Furthermore, we observed that a number of Montana statutes-namely, \u00a7\u00a7 46-16-121(1), 46-16-123(2), and 46-18-115, MCA-implement this constitutional right by requiring the defendant\u2019s presence at sentencing and by giving him an opportunity to respond before the trial court imposes the sentence. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-33. Yet, \u00a7\u00a7 46-16-121(1) and -123(2), MCA, are specific to felonies; and in contrast to these two statutes, \u00a7 46-16-123(1), MCA, authorizes the sentencing of a defendant in absentia on a misdemeanor offense. Clark has not challenged \u00a7 46-16-123(1), MCA, in light of Lane; therefore, we will assume, for purposes of this case, that Clark could lawfully be sentenced in absentia. Our holding herein should not be construed as expressing an opinion either way on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"AqV\">\u00b615 Given this assumption, we agree with the State that the Municipal Court pronounced a legally effective sentence immediately following Clark\u2019s conviction on June 12, 2006. The court did not set a sentencing hearing or otherwise suggest that it would impose sentence once Clark appeared on the bench warrant. Rather, the audio recording of the June 12 proceeding establishes that the court solicited a sentencing recommendation from the prosecutor and, immediately thereafter, announced the specifics of Clark\u2019s sentence. Among other things, the court ordered that Clark comply with \u201cthe conditions of the sentence <em>imposed this afternoon\u201d </em>(emphasis added). That same day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the court entered a written sentencing order which contained terms identical to the court\u2019s oral sentence. There is no indication anywhere in the record of the events of June 12 that the court was postponing pronouncement of Clark\u2019s sentence until he appeared on the bench warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b616 Indeed, even at the outset of the July 14 hearing, the court informed Clark of \u201cthe sentence that <em>was imposed\u201d </em>on June 12 (emphasis added). It was not until the court explained the 90-day suspension of the license plates and registration that the court stated it was imposing Clark\u2019s sentence \u201cnow, today, even though this occurred on June 12th.\u201d The court reasoned that Clark \u201cdidn\u2019t know about it, so it\u2019s imposed today\u201d; however, this attempt to vacate and reimpose the sentence pronounced on June 12 was legally ineffective. As the State points out, once a valid sentence has been pronounced, the court imposing that sentence has no authority to modify or change it, except as provided by statute. <em>See State v. Megard, </em>2006 MT 84, \u00b6 17, 332 Mont. 27, \u00b6 17, 134 P.3d 90, \u00b6 17 (citing <em>State v. Fertterer, </em>260 Mont. 397, 400, 860 P.2d 151, 154 (1993)). Section 46-18-116, MCA, sets forth grounds for modifying or correcting a sentence or judgment, but none of them applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"Asu\">\u00b617  Given these facts, we hold that Clark\u2019s sentence was pronounced and entered on June 12, 2006. Accordingly, pursuant to U.M.C.R.App. 4(a), 5(b)(3), and 20(a), Clark had until June 26, 2006, to file his notice of appeal. He filed his notice of appeal on July 28, 2006. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err in its determination that Clark\u2019s appeal from the Municipal Court was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\"> Clark and the State both rely on <em>State v. Mortenson, </em>175 Mont. 403, 574 P.2d 581 (1978), for the proposition that the period for filing a notice of appeal runs from the date on which the court orally renders judgment in open court. <em>See Mortenson, </em>175 Mont. at 405, 574 P.2d at 582; <em>see also State v. Tweedy, 277 </em>Mont. 313, 316-17, 922 P.2d 1134, 1135-36 (1996). While this may have been true at the time <em>Mortenson </em>and <em>Tweedy </em>were decided, it is no longer a correct statement of the law. <em>See Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b121-8\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\u00b619 I believe that the Court\u2019s Opinion correctly and fully resolves the specific issue presented by Clark-namely, whether the District Court erred in its determination that his appeal from the Municipal Court was untimely. However, the obvious question left unanswered by our Opinion-because Clark failed to raise it-is whether it was appropriate for the District Court to dismiss Clark\u2019s untimely appeal sua sponte. In view of recent decisions of this Court and the United States Supreme Court, I write separately to explain why, in my view, the ground provided by the District Court for dismissing Clark\u2019s appeal was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">\u00b620 The District Court dismissed Clark\u2019s appeal in light of the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>prescription contained in U.M.C.R.App. 5(b)(3). The court reasoned that by virtue of this rule and the untimely filing of Clark\u2019s notice of appeal, it did not have \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over his appeal. In other words, the District Corut assumed that its jurisdiction over appeals from municipal court judgments is circumscribed by U.M.C.R.App. 5(b)(3). There is support for this reasoning in our caselaw, as we have, not infrequently, described the filing deadlines for notices of appeal as \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b621 In more recent cases, however, we have acknowledged that \u201c^Jurisdiction is a word of many, too many, meanings\u201d and that we, along with other courts, sometimes have been \u201cprofligate\u201d in our use of the term. <em>DeShields v. State, </em>2006 MT 58, \u00b6 10, 331 Mont. 329, \u00b6 10, 132 P.3d 540, \u00b6 10 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 300, \u00b6 23, 187 P.3d 654, \u00b6 23 (noting cases in which we have been \u201cless than meticulous\u201d in this regard); <em>Ballas v. Missoula City Bd. of Adjustment, </em>2007 MT 299, \u00b6 15, 340 Mont. 56, \u00b6 15, 172 P.3d 1232, \u00b6 15 (noting that the broad nature of the term has led to \u201cconfusion\u201d as to its meaning). Accordingly, in an effort to promote clarity in the actual meaning of \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d we have been more thoughtful and cautious in our use of this term and have disapproved or overruled prior misusages. <em>See e.g. Davis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-23; <em>State v. Garrymore, </em>2006 MT 245, \u00b6 10 n. 1, 334 Mont. 1, \u00b6 10 n. 1, 145 P.3d 946, \u00b6 10 n. 1; <em>Miller v. District Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6\u00b6 42-44, 337 Mont. 488, \u00b6\u00b6 42-44, 162 P.3d 121, \u00b6\u00b6 42-44. Correspondingly, it is necessary that we reconsider whether the filing deadline on a notice of appeal is truly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>\u201cjurisdictional\u201d or merely a categorical claim-processing rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b622 In <em>Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 124 S. Ct. 906 (2004), the Supreme Court observed that classifying time prescriptions, even rigid ones, as \u201cjurisdictional\u201d can be \u201cconfounding.\u201d <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 455, 124 S. Ct. at 915. The Court suggested that \u201c[cjlarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 not for claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u201d <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 455, 124 S. Ct. at 915; <em>accord Eberhart v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 12, 16, 126 S. Ct. 403, 405 (2005) (per curiam). Similarly, we emphasized in <em>Miller </em>that \u201c[i]t is important not to confuse categorical time prescriptions with jurisdictional provisions.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 43. Jurisdiction involves the fundamental power and authority of a court to hear and decide an issue; as such, it cannot be forfeited, waived, or conferred by the consent of the parties. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43,44 (citing <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 30, 334 Mont. 489, \u00b6 30, 148 P.3d 643, \u00b6 30, <em>In re Marriage of Miller, </em>259 Mont. 424, 427, 856 P.2d 1378, 1380 (1993), and <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 1244 (2006)). By contrast, categorical time prescriptions are inflexible or rigid-but nonjurisdictional-claim-processing rules, which are unalterable if timely asserted by a party but can be forfeited if the party waits too long to raise the point. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 44 <em>(citing Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 454-55, 456, 124 S. Ct. at 915, 916, and <em>Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 19, 126 S. Ct. at 407).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b623 Of particular relevance to the case at hand, the Supreme Court stated in <em>Kontrick </em>that time limitations contained in rules of court are <em>not </em>jurisdictional. <em>See Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 453-54, 124 S. Ct. at 914; <em>see also Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 15-19, 126 S. Ct. at 404-07; <em>United States v. Sadler, </em>480 F.3d 932, 936-37 (9th Cir. 2007). Indeed, \u201cit is axiomatic,\u201d the Court observed, that court-prescribed rules of practice and procedure \u201cdo not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 453, 124 S. Ct. at 914 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). Along these same lines, we stated in <em>Miller </em>that a rule adopted pursuant to this Court\u2019s constitutional rulemaking authority is not jurisdictional. At issue in that case was a rule applicable to proceedings in the district courts. We noted that the subject-matter jurisdiction of the district courts is established by Article VII, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution and that this Court\u2019s authority under Article VII, Section 2(3) to \u201cmake rules governing ... practice and procedure\u201d in the district courts does not enable us to withdraw the jurisdiction of the district courts as defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>in the Montana Constitution. <em>See Miller, </em>\u00b6 45.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXz\">\u00b624 Given these clarifications in this Court\u2019s and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent jurisprudence concerning the meaning of jurisdiction, the District Court\u2019s reasoning that it did not have \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over Clark\u2019s appeal because his notice of appeal was untimely under U.M.C.R.App. 5(b)(3) was incorrect. Jurisdiction is conferred on courts only by the Constitution or statutes adopted pursuant to the Constitution. <em>Pinnow v. Montana State Fund, </em>2007 MT 332, \u00b6 20, 340 Mont. 217, \u00b6 20, 172 P.3d 1273, \u00b6 20. U.M.C.R.App. 5(b)(3), however, was adopted by order of this Court on March 19, 1998. Court-prescribed rules of practice and procedure simply cannot create or withdraw jurisdiction. <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 453, 124 S. Ct. at 914; <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 45. Thus, U.M.C.R.App. 5(b)(3) is not a jurisdictional limitation. <em>Cf. Sadler, </em>480 F.3d at 938-40 (holding, in light <em>o\u00ed Kontrick </em>and <em>Eberhart, </em>that the time limitation under Fed. R. App. P. 4(b) for filing a notice of appeal in a criminal case is not jurisdictional).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APO\">\u00b625 The State points out that the Montana Code contains a statutory time prescription for appeals from courts of limited jurisdiction. Specifically, \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA, states that \u201c[t]he defendant may appeal to the district court by filing written notice of intention to appeal within 10 days after a judgment is rendered following trial or the denial of the motion to withdraw a plea as provided in 46-17-203(2)(b).\u201d However, statutory time limitations are not necessarily jurisdictional. For instance, the Supreme Court held in <em>Scarborough v. Principi, </em>541 U.S. 401, 124 S. Ct. 1856 (2004), that a statutory provision prescribing the timing and content of an application for legal fees is not jurisdictional. <em>See Scarborough, </em>541 U.S. at 413-14, 124 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>S. Ct. at 1864-65. The Court noted that the provision \u201cdoes not describe what \u2018classes of cases\u2019 the [Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims] is competent to adjudicate; instead, the section relates only to postjudgment proceedings auxiliary to cases already within that court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u201d <em>Scarborough, </em>541 U.S. at 414, 124 S. Ct. at 1865 (citation omitted). Likewise, as a general rule, a statute of limitations is not jurisdictional but, rather, is an affirmative defense that is subject to forfeiture and waiver. <em>See John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States, </em>_ U.S. _, 128 S. Ct. 750, 753 (2008); <em>Day v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 198, 205, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 1681 (2006); <em>Marias Healthcare Services, Inc. v. Turenne, </em>2001 MT 127, \u00b6 9, 305 Mont. 419, \u00b6 9, 28 P.3d 491, \u00b6 9; <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15. Time prescriptions that are subject to equitable exceptions are similarly not jurisdictional. <em>See e.g. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 392-98, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 1132-35 (1982); <em>Diaz v. Kelly, </em>515 F.3d 149, 153 (2nd Cir. 2008); <em>Pe\u00f1a v. State, </em>2004 MT 293, \u00b6 41, 323 Mont. 347, \u00b6 41, 100 P.3d 154, \u00b6 41 (Leaphart, J., concurring and dissenting). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Kontrick, </em>\u201c[c]haracteristically, a court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded to account for the parties\u2019 litigation conduct.\u201d <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 456, 124 S. Ct. at 916; <em>see also Miller, </em>\u00b6 44 (observing that subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be forfeited, waived, or conferred by the consent of the parties). The Court noted that this is a \u201ccritical difference\u201d between a rule governing subject-matter jurisdiction and an inflexible claim-processing rule. <em>See Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 456, 124 S. Ct. at 916.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b626 Here, \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA, does not proscribe a class of cases that the district courts are incompetent to adjudicate. Indeed, it \u201c \u2018does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S. at 515, 126 S. Ct. at 1245 (quoting <em>Zipes, </em>455 U.S. at 394, 102 S. Ct. at 1133); <em>cf. State v. Osborne, </em>2005 MT 264, 329 Mont. 95, 102B, 124 P.3d 1085, 1091 (Leaphart, Nelson &amp; Cotter, JJ., dissenting from denial of rehearing) (observing that the statutory provision at issue did not proscribe a class of cases \u201cin a substantive jurisdictional sense\u201d but, rather, barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>claims based on their timing). Moreover, the time prescription contained in \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA, is subject to a good-cause exception. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-17-311(3), MCA (\u201cThe defendant may petition the district court to order the record transmitted upon a showing of good cause for failure to timely file the notice of appeal.\u201d). Thus, \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA, appears to be a claim-processing rule, not a jurisdictional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"A6n\">\u00b627 But even if \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA, could be read as setting forth a limitation on the appellate jurisdiction of the district courts, the Legislature lacks the power and authority to impose such a limitation. Article VII, Section 4(2) of the Montana Constitution specifically recognizes the appellate jurisdiction of the district courts. It states, in pertinent part: \u201cThe district court shall hear appeals from inferior courts as trials anew unless otherwise provided by law.\u201d When Delegate John M. Sch\u00fctz presented the proposed language of this section, it read simply: \u201cThe District Court shall hear appeals from inferior courts as trials anew.\u201d <em>See </em>Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, February 29, 1972, p. 1074. Speaking on behalf of the ad hoc committee, which had worked out a compromise with respect to the language of Article VII, Section 4, he explained: \u201cWe provided that the District Court should have the absolute duty to hear appeals from inferior courts and that those would be tried anew.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, February 29, 1972, p. 1074. The clause \u201cunless otherwise provided by law\u201d was added later, by amendment, to provide the Legislature with the authority to eliminate the \u201canew\u201d aspect of appeals from inferior courts; in other words, the delegates contemplated that the Legislature might limit such appeals to the record. <em>See </em>Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, February 29, 1972, pp. 1075-78. But there is no indication in the debate or in the language ultimately adopted that the delegates sought to limit the appellate jurisdiction of the district courts in any other way or to authorize the Legislature to do so by statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u00b628 For these reasons, I conclude that the 10-day limit on filing a notice of appeal in municipal court is a categorical time prescription that \u201c \u2018assure[s] relief \u201d when properly raised but does not compel the same result if the party \u201c \u2018waits too long to raise the point.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. District Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 46, 337 Mont. 488, \u00b6 46, 162 P.3d 121, \u00b6 46 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 15, 19, 126 S. Ct. at 404, 407). But that does not end the analysis. The State never raised this time prescription in the District Court. Rather, six days after receiving the file from the Municipal Court, the District Court raised the filing deadline on its own initiative and dismissed Clark\u2019s appeal. On the ground provided by the District Court-namely, that it lacked \u201cjurisdiction\u201d-this action was not improper. <em>See Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 32, 334 Mont. 489, \u00b6 32, 148 P.3d 643, \u00b6 32 (noting that courts have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party). However, the notion of raising <em>a claim-processing rule </em>sua sponte and then summarily dismissing the case based on noncompliance with that rule is troubling.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b629 In Day <em>v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 198, 126 S. Ct. 1675 (2006), the Supreme Court held that federal district courts are permitted, but not obliged, to consider, sua sponte, the timeliness of a state prisoner\u2019s habeas petition. <em>See Day, </em>547 U.S. at 202, 209, 126 S. Ct. at 1679-80, 1684; <em>accord Davis, </em>\u00b6 24. However, the Court emphasized that \u201cbefore acting on its own initiative, a court must accord the parties fair notice and an opportunity to present their positions\u201d and must \u201cdetermine whether the interests of justice would be better served by addressing the merits or by dismissing the petition as time barred.\u201d <em>Day, 547 </em>U.S. at 210, 126 S. Ct. at 1684 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 24. The Court also noted that it would be an abuse of discretion to override a State\u2019s deliberate waiver of a limitations defense. <em>Day, </em>547 U.S. at 202, 126 S. Ct. at 1679.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b630 Such considerations are equally applicable here. Indeed, as noted above, \u00a7 46-17-311(3), MCA, contemplates that failure to timely file the notice of appeal may be excused upon a showing of good cause. Clark, however, was never afforded the opportunity to make such a showing. For that matter, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the District Court provided notice that it was raising the 10-day filing deadline on its own motion; nor is there anything to suggest that the court, having raised the issue sua sponte, considered whether the interests of justice would be better served by allowing Clark\u2019s appeal to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b631 Again, these omissions by the District Court are not surprising, given the court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d rationale for dismissing Clark\u2019s appeal. Be that as it may, I find Justice Souter\u2019s comments in <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>127 S. Ct. 2360 (2007), to be apt here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">The District Court told petitioner Keith Bowles that his notice of appeal was due on February 27, 2004. He filed a notice of appeal on February 26, only to be told that he was too late because his deadline had actually been February 24. It is intolerable for the judicial system to treat people this way, and there is not even a technical justification for condoning this bait and switch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\"><em>Bowles, </em>127 S. Ct. at 2367 (Souter, Stevens, Ginsburg, &amp; Breyer, JJ., dissenting). Likewise, in the case at hand, the Municipal Court told Clark that his notice of appeal was due on July 28, 2006. He filed his notice of appeal on that date, only to be told by the District Court that he was too late. His appeal was then dismissed by the District Court-sua sponte and based on a claim-processing rule-without fair notice and without an opportunity to make a showing of good cause to excuse his belated filing. I find these circumstances to be of serious concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">\u00b632 That said, Clark has not challenged the propriety of the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss his untimely appeal sua sponte. For this reason, I concur in our decision to affirm the District Court. However, I do not believe that our Opinion should be read as condoning sua sponte, without-notice dismissals of untimely appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-9\">JUSTICE MORRIS joins the Special Concurrence of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-5\"> <em>See e.g. Colmore v.

Ct. 2360 (2007), the Supreme Court concluded that the time limitation in Fed. R. App. P. 4(a) for filing a notice of appeal in a <em>civil </em>case is jurisdictional. However, in reaching this conclusion, the Court observed that Rule 4(a) implements a statutory provision (in particular, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107), <em>see Bowles, </em>127 S. Ct. at 2363-65, and that the United States Constitution gives Congress the power to determine the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts, <em>see Bowles, </em>127 S. Ct. at 2365-66. This latter point is a critical distinction between time prescriptions contained in federal statutes and time prescriptions contained in state statutes, since the jurisdiction of Montana\u2019s district courts is established by the Montana Constitution, not by the Legislature. <em>See Miller, </em>\u00b6 45; Mont.

Province, </em>226 Mont. 425, 735 P.2d 1128 (1987), in the context of addressing an appeal by the State from justice court to district court and then to this Court, we observed-without citation to any authority-that \u201c[rjegardless of which party is appealing, this Court has consistently held that compliance with the statute is required to perfect an appeal <em>because it is exclusively a statutory right.\u201d Province, </em>226 Mont. at 426, 735 P.2d at 1129 (emphasis added). This notion that the right to appeal to a district court exists only as provided by statute was carried forward into numerous cases. <em>See e.g. State v.

Indeed, the premise that \u201cthe right to appeal a criminal conviction from a [court of limited jurisdiction] is purely statutory\u201d was the underpinning of our decisions in <em>State v.
