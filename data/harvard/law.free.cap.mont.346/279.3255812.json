We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b62 The following uncontested facts are taken from the District Court\u2019s order denying postconviction relief and the parties\u2019 briefs. On February 13,2002, Denise Olsen, now known as Denise Hammer, was charged with one felony count of arson in violation of \u00a7 45-6-103, MCA, and with making a false report to law enforcement authorities, a misdemeanor in violation of \u00a7 45-7-205(b), MCA. These charges arose from a fire that occurred in Hammer\u2019s residence. Hammer was tried by a jury of her peers in a five day trial, and was convicted of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b63 The central dispute in Hammer\u2019s trial was whether the fire was deliberately caused. The defense theory was that the fire originated in an electrical junction box, and thus was accidental; while the State charged that the fire was deliberately set with candles. Hammer\u2019s defense counsel, with the court\u2019s permission, retained fire investigation expert Brian Hattem, who determined that an electrical short in the junction box caused the fire. The junction box was sent to Richard Schefsky, owner of Northwest Laboratories, who concurred with this conclusion, and wrote a report to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b64 During trial, a scheduling conflict arose with the State\u2019s expert. A discussion was held in chambers, where the State asked the court to allow its expert to rebut Schefsky\u2019s report during the State\u2019s case in chief, essentially giving his rebuttal testimony out of sequence. Diming this discussion, Hammer\u2019s counsel confirmed that, consistent with the witness and exhibits list, he did not intend to call Schefsky to testify as an expert, rather he planned to introduce Schefsky\u2019s report as an exhibit. This was presumably because, in defense counsel\u2019s words, the report merely \u201cverifies\u201d the conclusion of fire investigation expert Brian Hattem. This discussion resulted in the court, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, allowing the State\u2019s expert to rebut Schefsky\u2019s report before the defense introduced the report as an exhibit. Because of this non-sequential rebuttal, the court and jury were made aware of both the substance and conclusion of Schefsky\u2019s report during the prosecution\u2019s case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b65 During the defense\u2019s case, after the testimony of Brian Hattem, defense counsel called Schefsky as an expert witness. Counsel questioned him in a manner designed to elicit responses that would qualify him as an expert, which resulted in a lengthy recitation of his work experience and education. However, his testimony failed to produce any information that would tend to establish his expertise in forensic electrical engineering. After a \u201clong, rambling account\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>covering \u201cseven pages of trial transcript,\u201d the court interrupted, stating \u201c[t]his is all completely useless information.\u201d Defense counsel did not object to the court\u2019s statement, and continued in his attempt to elicit relevant qualifications from Schefsky. Voir dire by the State established that Schefsky lacked formal training or experience in electrical engineering, and had only very general experience with electrical work. Another attempt by defense counsel to qualify Schefsky was similarly unsuccessful, and the court did not allow Schefsky to testify as an expert witness. Defense counsel did not make an offer of proof as to either Schefsky\u2019s qualifications or the substance of his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b66 Hammer filed a direct appeal to this Court alleging that: 1) the District Court abused its discretion by not allowing one of her expert witnesses to testify; 2) the District Court committed reversible error by commenting on the qualifications of her expert witness; and 3) she received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. We affirmed Hammer\u2019s conviction. <em>State v. Olsen, </em>2004 MT 158, \u00b6 1, 322 Mont. 1, \u00b6 1, 92 P.3d 1204, \u00b6 1. In so affirming, we declined to address Hammer\u2019s first two claims on the basis that she failed to lodge a contemporaneous objection during trial, therefore those claims were waived and not subject to appellate review. <em>Olsen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10,12. We dismissed her claims for ineffective assistance of counsel without prejudice, holding that such claims were more appropriately raised in a petition for postconviction relief. <em>Olsen, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b67 Hammer filed a petition for postconviction relief in the District Court, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel on five grounds, two of which are relevant to this appeal: 1) defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the District Court\u2019s allegedly improper comment on the qualifications of Hammer\u2019s expert witness Richard Schefsky; and 2) defense counsel\u2019s failure to make an offer of proof after the court disqualified Schefsky as an expert. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing in which Hammer\u2019s defense counsel testified as to his reasoning for not lodging an objection or making an offer of proof. In a lengthy and thorough discussion, the court determined that Hammer\u2019s claims for ineffective assistance of counsel were without merit, and denied her petition for postconviction relief. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b68 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">1. Did Hammer\u2019s defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Court\u2019s comment on Schefsky\u2019s qualifications constitute ineffective assistance of counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">2. Did Hammer\u2019s defense counsel\u2019s failure to make an offer of proof after Schefsky was disqualified as an expert constitute ineffective assistance of counsel?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, \u00b6 9, 183 P.3d 861, \u00b6 9. However, ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of law and fact for which our review is de novo. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u00b610 A defendant\u2019s right to assistance of counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article II \u00a7 24 of the Montana Constitution. We analyze ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the two part test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). A defendant bears the burden of proving that: 1) the performance of defendant\u2019s counsel was deficient; and 2) that counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687). To prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, a defendant must satisfy both prongs of this test. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11. Where the defendant makes an insufficient showing as to one prong of the test, it is unnecessary to address the other prong. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11. A court reviewing an ineffective assistance claim may approach the inquiry in any order. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11. We have held that \u201c[wjhen it is possible to dispose of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on the claim\u2019s failure to establish that the defendant was sufficiently prejudiced, it is best to follow that course.\u201d <em>State v. Morgan, </em>2003 MT 193, \u00b6 10, 316 Mont. 509, \u00b6 10, 74 P.3d 1047, \u00b6 10. Because we hold that Hammer failed to demonstrate that her defense was prejudiced by her counsel\u2019s alleged errors, we need not inquire into whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u00b611 To show prejudice sufficient to satisfy the second prong of <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant must demonstrate that a reasonable possibility exists that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional error, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Morgan, </em>\u00b6 9. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>probability must be such that it undermines confidence in the outcome. <em>Morgan, </em>\u00b6 9. The defendant bears the burden of identifying all facts supporting the grounds for relief in the petition for postconviction relief, and must attach affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts. Section 46-21-104(1)(c) MCA; <em>State v. Peck, </em>263 Mont. 1, 3, 865 P.2d 304, 305 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b612 In the instant case, Hammer does not directly identify how her defense was prejudiced. Rather she asserted in her petition for postconviction relief, and presumably argues here, that defense counsel\u2019s performance was presumptively deficient, thus she need not make a showing of prejudice. She cites for this proposition <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>where the Court held that a presumption of ineffectiveness arises where \u201ccounsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d 466 U.S. 648, 659, 104 S. Ct. 2039, 2047 (1984). However, the <em>Cronic </em>Court gave specific examples of the limited circumstances in which this situation would arise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">No specific showing of prejudice was required in <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>because the petitioner had been \u201cdenied the right of effective cross-examination\u201d which \u2018\u201cwould be constitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of showing of want of prejudice would cure it.\u2019\u201d Apart from circumstances of that magnitude, however, there is generally no basis for finding a Sixth Amendment violation unless the accused can show how specific errors of counsel undermined the reliability of the finding of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-T\"><em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 659 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b613 Circumstances of the magnitude described in <em>Cronic </em>are not present in the instant case. Nothing in the record indicates that Hammer\u2019s counsel \u201cfailed entirely to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 659. Nor does the record indicate that any of counsel\u2019s alleged errors were sufficient to \u201cundermine the reliability of the finding of guilt.\u201d <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 659. Aside from relying on <em>Cronic, </em>Hammer does not identify how her counsel\u2019s performance was deficient enough to make the adversary process and the result of the trial presumptively unreliable. Rather, she appears to suggest that any failure to preserve an issue for appellate review amounts to a presumptively deficient performance sufficient to make a showing of prejudice unnecessary. Hammer fails to cite any authority in support of her assertion, and we decline to adopt that proposition here.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b6 14 While Hammer makes only conclusory assertions that her defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>was prejudiced by her counsel\u2019s alleged errors, we nevertheless endeavor a review of the limited record before us to determine whether the alleged errors were potentially sufficient to prejudice Hammer\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b615 Our review indicates that Hammer did not suffer prejudice sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the case by virtue of Schefsky\u2019s disqualification as an expert witness. First and most notably, Hammer had not originally planned to call Schefsky as an expert witness, because his report merely confirmed the conclusions of the primary defense expert, Brian Hattem. Second, an offer of proof of the substance and conclusion of Schefsky\u2019s report or as to his expert qualifications was unnecessary. The District Court (and the jury) were made aware of both the substance and conclusion of Schefsky\u2019s report during the State\u2019s case in chief as a result of the out of sequence rebuttal of the report by the State\u2019s expert. An offer of proof as to Schefsky\u2019s qualifications as an expert in forensic electrical engineering would have been similarly unavailing. Despite diligent questioning both by defense counsel and the State that elicited testimony covering more than seven pages of trial transcript which thoroughly describes his entire education and work history in detail, Schefsky was unable to provide any testimony that would tend to establish his expertise in forensic electrical engineering. Any relevant educational, professional, or practical expertise was already in the record. As defense counsel noted during the postconviction hearing, there would have been nothing to put in an offer of proof that was not already before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b616 Similarly, Hammer was not prejudiced by her counsel\u2019s failure to object to the court\u2019s statement that Schefsky\u2019s recitation of his professional and business history was \u201ccompletely useless.\u201d Counsel\u2019s attempt to elicit testimony that would qualify Schefsky as an expert in forensic electrical engineering had produced significant irrelevant testimony and consumed considerable time. The District Court\u2019s attempt to focus Schefsky\u2019s testimony was properly within the bounds of Rule 611, which provides that \u201cthe Court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to ... avoid needless consumption of time.\u201d (Mont. R. Evid. 611(a)(2).) Any objection to the court\u2019s attempt to avoid needless consumption of time exploring irrelevant professional history would have been without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b617 A District Court is \u201cvested with great latitude in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony.\u201d <em>State v. Crawford, </em>2003 MT 118, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>30, 315 Mont. 480, \u00b6 30, 68 P.3d 848, \u00b6 30 (emphasis omitted). Further, \u201c[t]he party presenting a witness as an expert must establish, to the satisfaction of the trial court, that the witness possesses the requisite knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education to testify as to the issue in question.\u201d <em>State v. Russette, </em>2002 MT 200, \u00b6 14, 311 Mont. 188, \u00b6 14, 53 P.3d 1256, \u00b6 14. As noted above, Schefsky was unable to establish any expertise, professional or otherwise, in the field of forensic electrical engineering. Neither an offer of proof nor an objection to the court\u2019s comment on Schefsky\u2019s qualifications would have cured this want of qualification. There is no reasonable possibility that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object ultimately had any bearing on the admissibility of Schefsky\u2019s expert testimony, and hence could not be sufficiently prejudicial to undermine our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b618  In sum, Hammer has failed to demonstrate that her defense counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance was sufficiently prejudicial to undermine confidence in the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. Accordingly, she has failed to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, thus her ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails.</p>\n<judges id=\"b321-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, RICE and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
