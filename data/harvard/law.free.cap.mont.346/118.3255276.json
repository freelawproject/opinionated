We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it granted Billman\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his speedy trial right?</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\u00b64 On January 27, 2006, Bernard Richard Billman (Billman) was arrested and jailed for driving under the influen ce of alcohol, a felony; driving while his driving privileges were suspended or revoked, a misdemeanor; and operating a motor vehicle without proof of liability insurance, a misdemeanor. The District Court set Billman\u2019s bond at $7,000 and set Billman\u2019s trial for June 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">\u00b65 The District Court signed an order on June 29, 2006, continuing Billman\u2019s trial date to August 21,2006, based on conflicts in the court\u2019s docket. On August 25, 2006, the State moved to reset the trial for a date after October 1, 2006, because the State\u2019s primary witness, the arresting officer, was unavailable due to training. The District Court then set a trial date for October 30, 2006, but later changed the date to November 1, 2006, due to docket control.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">\u00b66 On October 30,2006, the prosecutor, defense counsel, and Billman appeared in court for a hearing on pretrial motions. Defense counsel orally moved to dismiss the case based on a violation of Billman\u2019s speedy trial right. The District Court set a hearing on the motion for November 1, 2006, and rescheduled the trial date for December 4, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">\u00b67 On November 1,2006, the District Court orally granted Billman\u2019s speedy trial motion and released Billman from incarceration. The State subsequently appealed. While the State\u2019s appeal was pending, we established a new framework for evaluating speedy trial claims in <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815. In light of the <em>Ariegwe </em>decision, we remanded this case to the District Court to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to the <em>Ariegwe </em>analysis. The District Court conducted a speedy trial analysis and again granted Billman\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his right to speedy trial. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u00b68 Whether a defendant has been denied the right to a speedy trial presents a question of constitutional law. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119. We review de novo a district court\u2019s legal conclusions to determine whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the law. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119. We will not disturb the factual findings underlying a speedy trial ruling unless the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court committed a mistake. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it granted Billman\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his speedy trial right?</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\u00b610 The State maintains that the District Court erred in granting Billman\u2019s motion to dismiss under speedy trial grounds. The State acknowledges that the underlying facts are \u201cstraightforward and mostly undisputed,\u201d but argues that the District Court failed to engage in the balancing process that <em>Ariegwe </em>and <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182 (1972) require.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">\u00b611 The United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution guarantee criminal defendants the right to a speedy trial. U.S. Const, amend. VI; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24. Our test to determine whether an accused has been denied the right to speedy trial rests on the Montana Constitution. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 35. We consider four factors when presented with a speedy trial claim: the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, and prejudice to the accused. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 106-111. We then balance the four speedy trial factors to determine whether the accused has been denied the speedy trial right. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 112. Each factor\u2019s significance varies based on the particular case\u2019s unique facts and circumstances. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">\u00b612 A. The speedy trial factors</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">\n<em>1. The length of the delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">\u00b613 The State argues that the District Court incorrectly analyzed the first speedy trial factor. The State maintains that the short delay between the speedy trial triggering date and the trial date did not weigh in favor of Billman\u2019s speedy trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">\u00b614 A court addressing a speedy trial claim must first determine whether 200 days have elapsed between the accusation and the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>date. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 41. If this 200-day threshold passes, a presumption of prejudice arises that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 56. A court must then consider the delay extending beyond the 200-day trigger date. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 62. As the pretrial delay increases, the presumption increases that the delay has prejudiced the accused and the State\u2019s burden to justify the delay under the second speedy trial factor increases. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u00b615 The District Court determined that the delay exceeded 200 days and that the first factor thus weighed in favor of granting Billman\u2019s speedy trial motion. The court relied on two calculations to determine the amount of delay: (1) the interval between the triggering date and the date that the court granted Billman\u2019s motion to dismiss, which the District Court calculated to be seventy-seven days, and, alternatively, (2) the interval between the accusation and the date of the court\u2019s second order dismissing Billman\u2019s case, which the District Court calculated to be 711 days. Regarding the court\u2019s second calculation, any delay associated with the State\u2019s initial appeal bears no relevance to Billman\u2019s speedy trial claim. Following the court\u2019s order, no criminal charges were pending against Billman, nor was he subjected to actual restrictions on his liberty, and thus, the speedy trial guarantee no longer applied. <em>U.S. v. MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 8, 102 S. Ct. 1497, 1502 (1982); <em>U.S. v. Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. 302, 310-11, 106 S. Ct. 648, 653-54 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u00b616 Though the District Court correctly determined that further speedy trial analysis had been triggered, the court failed to examine the intensifying effect of the delay beyond the triggering date. To examine the intensifying effect, a court must first determine the proper speedy trial timeframe; courts generally consider the interval between accusation and the scheduled trial date or the date on which an accused pleads guilty, whichever date reflects the case\u2019s disposition. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 43; <em>State v. Ellenburg, </em>2000 MT 232, \u00b6 16, 301 Mont. 289, \u00b6 16, 8 P.3d 801, \u00b6 16. In this case, the District Court\u2019s order granting Billman\u2019s speedy trial motion disposed of the case, and thus, the date that the court ruled on Billman\u2019s speedy trial motion reflects the case\u2019s disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"AK2K\">\u00b617  We acknowledge our statement in <em>Ariegwe </em>that, \u201cthe interval between accusation and trial runs not to the date on which the accused\u2019s speedy trial motion is considered by the court but, rather, to the scheduled trial date\u201d or the date on which an accused pleads guilty, whichever date represents the case\u2019s disposition. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 43 (citations omitted). This statement remains true when a court denies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>a speedy trial motion because the denial does not dispose of the case. <em>See State v. Kipp, </em>1999 MT 197, \u00b6 9, 295 Mont. 399, \u00b6 9, 984 P.2d 733, \u00b6 9. When a court grants a speedy trial motion, however, that date becomes the date of the case\u2019s disposition. Thus, the date that a district court grants a motion to dismiss based on speedy trial properly becomes the end date of the speedy trial interval. In this case, the District Court correctly used the date of Billman\u2019s arrest to start the speedy trial clock and the date of its dismissal order as the end date. Officers arrested Billman on January 27,2006, and the District Court granted Billman\u2019s motion to dismiss on November 1,2006. The length of the delay in this case amounts to 278 days, seventy-eight days beyond the speedy trial trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b618 We presume that the accused has experienced some prejudice once the 200-day threshold passes. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 56. That prejudice intensifies as the delay extends beyond the 200-day trigger date, and the State\u2019s burden to justify the delay increases. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 62. In <em>Ariegwe, </em>the delay amounted to 208 days beyond the trigger date. Thus, we required the State to \u201cprovide particularly compelling justifications for the delay\u201d under the second speedy trial factor and to \u201cmake a highly persuasive showing\u201d that the delay did not prejudice Ariegwe under the fourth speedy trial factor. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 123. We also recognized that the quantum of proof expected from Ariegwe under the fourth factor correspondingly decreased. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 123. The delay in this case amounts to less than that in <em>Ariegwe; </em>however, 278 days of delay presents a considerable amount of delay, and we conclude that the State\u2019s justifications for the delay must be compelling and that it must make a persuasive showing that the delay did not prejudice Billman. Further, the quantum of proof required from Billman under the fourth factor is correspondingly lower. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\n<em>2. The reasons for the delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b619 The State concedes that it bears responsibility for the delay in this case. The State maintains, however, that the majority of the delay constitutes institutional delay and that valid reasons exist to justify the remaining delay. The State asserts that the District Court failed to assign culpability to the periods of delay, and the State argues that the court would have accorded little weight to this speedy trial factor if it properly had weighed the delay periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u00b620 Under the second speedy trial factor, a court must identify each period of delay, attribute the delay to the appropriate party, and assign weight to the periods of delay based on the reasons for the delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 108. Delay is charged to the State unless the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>caused the delay or affirmatively waived the speedy trial right for that period. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 108. Institutional delay and delay associated with valid reasons weighs less heavily against the State than delay resulting from the State\u2019s lack of diligence or bad faith. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 108. Institutional delays are those that are inherent in the criminal justice system and due to circumstances beyond the control of the accused or the State; crowded court dockets and difficulties in setting trial dates often cause institutional delays. <em>State v. Blair, </em>2004 MT 356, \u00b6 19, 324 Mont. 444, \u00b6 19, 103 P.3d 538, \u00b6 19. Valid reasons for delay include the unavailability of a key prosecution witness or additional time to prepare for a particularly complex trial. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 70 (citations omitted). The \u201cspecific cause and culpability for each period of delay\u201d bears significance when the factors are balanced. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b621 The District Court concluded that the second speedy trial factor favored Billman\u2019s motion to dismiss because the State bore responsibility for the entirety of the pretrial delay. The court cited \u201ccalendar clog\u201d and the unavailability of the State\u2019s witness as reasons for the delay. The court charged the delay to the State as institutional delay and noted that the delay associated with the State\u2019s unavailable witness was also attributable to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\n<em>First Trial Setting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b622 The delay between Billman\u2019s arrest on January 27,2006, and his first trial date on June 19, 2006, amounts to 143 days of delay. This delay is attributable to the State. The delay associated with the initial trial setting constitutes delay that is inherent in the criminal justice system and beyond Billman\u2019s or the State\u2019s control; thus, the 143-day delay constitutes institutional delay. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\n<em>Second Trial Setting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\u00b623 The delay between Billman\u2019s first trial date on June 19,2006, and Billman\u2019s second trial date on August 21,2006, amounts to sixty-three days of delay. The District Court found that this delay was \u201cbased on docket control and other matters proceeding to trial.\u201d Thus, the additional sixty-three days of delay are attributable to the State as institutional delay. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">\n<em>Third Trial Setting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">\u00b624 The delay between Billman\u2019s second trial date on August 21,2006, and Billman\u2019s third trial date on October 30,2006, amounts to seventy days. The District Court found that this delay was caused by the unavailability of the State\u2019s primary witness, the arresting officer. The State concedes that the District Court correctly attributed the delay to the State, but asserts that the delay should weigh less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>institutional delay because the officer\u2019s absence constituted a \u201cvalid reason\u201d for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b625 Billman points out that the State filed its motion to continue after the trial date had passed. The arresting officer apparently was available to testify after October 1, 2006, and Billman argues that an earlier trial date may have been available if the State had moved for a continuance sooner. Billman contends that the time during which the State\u2019s witness was available to testify-October 1,2006 to October 30, 2006-should weigh more heavily against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b626 Delays caused by the unavailability of prosecution witnesses on scheduled trial dates constitute valid reasons for delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 70 (citations omitted). For example, in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>the State moved for two continuances because key witnesses were unavailable for scheduled trial dates. 2000 MT 180, \u00b6 9, 300 Mont. 367, \u00b6 9, 4 P.3d 654, \u00b6 9. We determined that the State\u2019s culpability was minimal because the State engaged in no \u201cintentional or purposeful foot-dragging\u201d and harbored no motive to cause undue delay. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 20. In <em>Johnson, </em>the State moved for continuances before the scheduled trial dates. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b627 In this case, the State\u2019s primary witness was unavailable for the August 21, 2006 trial date because of training. The record reveals no bad faith motives on the part of the State and, generally, the officer\u2019s unavailability would constitute a valid reason for delay. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 20. Unlike <em>Johnson, </em>however, the State moved for a continuance four days <em>after </em>the scheduled trial date passed. The State offers no explanation for its late motion. The State bears the burden to explain pretrial delays. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 64. In light of the State\u2019s failure to provide any explanation, we agree with Billman that the thirty-day portion of the delay when the officer was available to testify should weigh more heavily against the State. Although the record does not indicate that the State engaged in bad faith or \u201cpurposeful foot-dragging,\u201d nor does it reveal the reasons that the State failed to move for a continuance until after the trial date had passed. The timing of the motion is within the control of the prosecutor, and thus, the delay is not institutional. We conclude that the thirty-day delay should be accorded the weight associated with negligence or lack of diligence on the part of the prosecutor. Accordingly, forty days of the delay associated with the third trial setting weigh minimally against the State because valid reasons existed for the delay, and thirty days of the delay weigh more heavily against the State due to its apparent lack of diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\n<em>Fourth Trial Setting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b628 The delay between. Billman\u2019s third trial date on October 30,2006, and Billman\u2019s fourth trial date on November 1, 2006, amounts to two days of delay. The District Court found that this delay was based on docket control. Thus, the additional two days of delay are attributable to the State as institutional delay. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\n<em>Fifth Trial Setting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b629 The delay between Billman\u2019s fourth trial date on November 1, 2006, and Billman\u2019s fifth trial date on December 4, 2006, amounts to thirty-three days of delay. This delay resulted from Billman\u2019s speedy trial motion. Delay resulting from a speedy trial motion is attributable to the accused if the motion is filed less than thirty days prior to a scheduled trial date. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 116. Billman moved for dismissal two days before his scheduled trial date; thus, the delay generally would be attributable to Billman. In this case, however, the District Court granted Billman\u2019s speedy trial motion on November 1, 2006, which disposed of the case, and the District Court released Billman from incarceration the same day. As discussed in \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, the proper timeframe in a speedy trial analysis is the interval between accusation and a case\u2019s disposition. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 43, <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 16. Further, as Billman no longer faced pending criminal charges or actual restrictions on his liberty, the speedy trial guarantee no longer applied. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8, 102 S. Ct. at 1502; <em>Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. at 310-11, 106 S. Ct. at 653-54. Accordingly, the thirty-three-day delay associated with Billman\u2019s motion does not factor into our speedy trial analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b630 In summary, the interval between Billman\u2019s accusation and the final disposition of his case amounted to 278 days. The entire 278-day delay is attributable to the State: 208 days of institutional delay, 40 days of delay caused by valid reasons, and 30 days of delay resulting from the State\u2019s lack of diligence. Billman bears no responsibility for any of the pretrial delay. The State burden to explain pretrial delays increases as the pretrial delay lengthens. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 107. The majority of delay in this case amounts to institutional delay. Nonetheless, the State and the courts bear the burden to promptly try cases. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 529, 92 S. Ct. at 2191. Further, the delay that courts will tolerate for simple cases is considerably less than for complex cases. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S. Ct. at 2192. Thus, we conclude that the second speedy trial factor weighs in Billman\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\n<em>3. The accused\u2019s responses to the delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AVu\">\u00b631 Under the third speedy trial factor, a court must evaluate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>totality of the accused\u2019s responses to the pretrial delay to determine whether the accused actually wanted a speedy trial, a key consideration in determining whether the accused\u2019s speedy trial right has been violated. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 110. This evaluation also guides courts in determining the weight to accord the other speedy trial factors. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b632 The District Court found that Billman never waived his speedy trial right. The court also found that Billman asserted his speedy trial right, expressed concerns regarding continuances that were beyond his control, and expressed his desire for a trial. The court concluded that Billman did not acquiesce to any pretrial delay and that Billman sincerely wanted a speedy trial. The District Court accorded this significant weight in considering the other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b633 The totality of Billman\u2019s various responses to the pretrial delay indicate that Billman wanted a speedy trial. Following the second trial continuance, Billman wrote a letter to the District Court complaining that his trial had been rescheduled twice after the trial dates already had passed. Billman\u2019s letter expressed his frustration with not receiving notice of the continued trials until after the trial dates had passed and with spending over seven months incarcerated while \u201ctrying to get this matter resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b634 Additionally, Billman\u2019s communications with his attorneys indicate that Billman sincerely wanted a speedy trial. In June, Billman rejected a plea agreement from the prosecutor and informed his attorney that he wanted a jury trial. In September or October of 2006, Billman asked his attorney to file a motion to dismiss based on the speedy trial right. Billman\u2019s attorney advised him that the decisions regarding a speedy trial motion fell within the attorney\u2019s discretion; the speedy trial motion was not filed until October 30, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u00b635 We accord no significant weight to the timing of Billman\u2019s speedy trial motion. At the time of Billman\u2019s motion, counsel and the courts were operating under the speedy trial test and the presumptions set forth in <em>City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, 290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866. Billman\u2019s motion was filed on Monday, October 30,2006,276 days after Billman\u2019s arrest, the first business-day following the burden-shift to the State to demonstrate that pretrial delay had not prejudiced Billman. We accord significant weight, however, to Billman\u2019s communications to the District Court and counsel. These communications indicate that Billman sincerely wanted a speedy trial. Additionally, as discussed under the second speedy trial factor, Billman bore no responsibility for any of the pretrial delay, nor did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Billman waive his speedy trial right. We conclude that the third speedy trial factor weighs heavily in favor of the conclusion that Billman was denied his speedy trial right, and we accord this factor significant weight in the overall balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\n<em>4. Prejudice to the accused</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b636 Under the fourth speedy trial factor, a court must examine whether the pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused in light of the interests that the speedy trial right protects: (1) preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration; (2) minimizing the accused\u2019s anxiety and concern; and (3) limiting the possibility that pretrial delay will impair the accused\u2019s defense. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 111. A presumption arises that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused when the speedy trial analysis is triggered, and this presumption increases as the delay increases. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 56. We require the accused to present evidence establishing prejudice and the State to present evidence showing a lack of prejudice. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 56. As discussed in \u00b6 18, based on the 278-day delay, the State must make a persuasive showing that the pretrial delay did not prejudice Billman, and the quantum of proof required from Billman is correspondingly lower.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b637 <em>1. Oppressive pretrial incarceration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u00b638 We determine whether pretrial incarceration is oppressive by considering the duration of incarceration, the complexity of the charged offenses, whether the accused engaged in any misconduct related to the incarceration, and the conditions of the incarceration. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\u00b639 The likelihood that incarceration has been oppressive and prejudiced the accused increases as the duration of pretrial incarceration increases. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 90. The State acknowledges that Billman was incarcerated from his arrest on January 27, 2006, until the District Court granted his speedy trial motion on November 1, 2006, a total of 278 days. Billman\u2019s incarceration stemmed entirely from the charges and his inability to post bond, not from any subsequent misconduct on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">\u00b640 We tolerate considerably less delay for a simple offense than for a complex charge. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 91. The State acknowledges that the charges against Billman constituted relatively simple charges. The State\u2019s argument at the speedy trial hearing underscores this point. According to the prosecutor, the State had responded to Billman\u2019s discovery requests by February 14, 2006, approximately two weeks after Billman\u2019s arrest, and the State intended to call only one witness at trial. Thus, Billman remained jailed for 260 days after the discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>was completed in a straightforward Felony DUI prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b641 Billman also specifically points to his age, his indigence, and his anxiety and depression to illustrate the oppressive conditions of his incarceration. Although these considerations are relevant in a speedy trial analysis, they are more properly considered under the second interest that the speedy trial right protects. When analyzing the conditions of the incarceration to assess oppressiveness, we focus on the condition of the facilities and how they impact the accused, rather than solely on the condition of the accused. For example, courts determining whether an accused\u2019s incarceration was oppressive might focus on whether a facility lacks recreational opportunity, appropriate medical care, adequate food, and legal research capabilities. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 93. Billman raises no challenges to the conditions of his incarceration. In this case, however, the lengthy incarceration coupled with the relatively simple charges establishes that pretrial delay prejudiced Billman.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b642 <em>2. Anxiety and concern</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b643 Criminal charges engender a certain amount of inherent anxiety and concern; thus, we focus on the extent that the pretrial delay has unduly prolonged the disruption of the accused\u2019s life or aggravated the accused\u2019s anxiety and concern. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 97. Our considerations include employment loss, financial and economic loss, and whether the accused\u2019s associations were curtailed. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b644 The District Court found that Billman experienced substantial anxiety and concern due to the pretrial delay in his case. The court considered significant Billman\u2019s testimony that he began taking medication for depression and anxiety following his incarceration. The court also concluded that Billman suffered economic hardship by being unable to work during his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b645 The State asserted at the speedy trial hearing that Billman\u2019s testimony was not credible; on appeal, the State maintains that Billman\u2019s testimony was \u201cbrief and uncertain\u201d on this issue. We defer to the District Court\u2019s judgment on issues of witness credibility. <em>In re T.L. </em>2005 MT 256, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 58, \u00b6 18, 122 P.3d 453, \u00b6 18. Our review of the record convinces us that the District Court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous. Billman testified that he worked at the sugar beet factory at the time of his arrest and that he would have worked as a welder at Agri-Systems following his employment with the sugar beet factory. Billman testified that he started taking antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication as a result of his incarceration. Billman further testified that since being jailed he could no longer see his boys. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Moreover, Billman\u2019s letter to the court indicated that his anxiety and concern were not due to the nature of the charges, but due to the length of the pretrial delay. In his letter, Billman complained about the repeated continuances and stated, \u201cI have lost my job, so I sit in jail until \u2018god knows when\u2019 or until they break me and [force] me to \u2018plead guilty* although I am a innocent man.... The 18 hours of lock down day after day has taken a severe toll on me mentally and physically.\u201d (Paragraph break omitted.) We agree with the District Court that Billman\u2019s pretrial incarceration unduly prolonged the disruption to his life and aggravated Billman\u2019s anxiety and concern.</p>\n<p id=\"AA3\">\u00b646 <em>3. Impairment of the defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b647 Limiting the possibility that pretrial delay will impair the accused\u2019s defense arguably is the most important interest that the speedy trial right protects because an accused\u2019s inability to present an effective defense undermines the fairness of the system. Ariegwe, \u00b6 98. The accused\u2019s failure to submit affirmative proof of prejudice is not fatal to a speedy trial claim, and, in the absence of affirmative proof of impairment, we focus on the other speedy trial factors to assess whether the pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused\u2019s defense. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 99-100. Pretrial delay prejudices an accused if defense witnesses are unable to accurately recall past events. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S. Ct. at 2193.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b648 The State maintains that the pretrial delay did not prejudice Billman\u2019s defense. According to the State, the charges against Billman \u201cwere relatively simple\u201d and the pretrial delay would not have threatened the fairness of Billman\u2019s trial. The District Court concluded that the pretrial delay moderately impaired Billman\u2019s ability to present a defense. The District Court determined that Billman\u2019s incarceration impeded his ability to adequately prepare a defense and also noted that Billman\u2019s memory faded during his incarceration, which hindered his ability to testify effectively. Billman\u2019s testimony at the speedy trial hearing supports the court\u2019s conclusion that Billman\u2019s memory faded regarding the events surrounding his arrest. Additionally, the other speedy trial factors-the length of delay, Billman\u2019s responses to the delay, and Billman\u2019s incarceration for the entirety of the lower proceedings-indicate that the pretrial delay impaired Billman\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b649 B. Balancing the speedy trial factors</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u00b650 We balance the four speedy trial factors to determine whether an accused has been denied the speedy trial right. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 112. The State concedes that the first three speedy trial factors \u201carguably weigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>in Billman\u2019s favor,\u201d but argues that it \u201cmade a persuasive showing\u201d that the pretrial delay did not unduly prejudice Billman. We accord no single factor dispositive weight; rather, we consider the factors together with other relevant circumstances. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b651 The first speedy trial factor, the length of the delay, establishes a pretrial delay of 278 days and weighs in Billman\u2019s favor. The second factor, the reasons for the delay, also weighs in Billman\u2019s favor because the State bears responsibility for the entire pretrial delay; though institutional delay constitutes the majority of pretrial delay, it nonetheless weighs against the State. The third speedy trial factor, the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, indicates that Billman sincerely wanted a speedy trial; this factor weighs heavily in Billman\u2019s favor. Finally, the fourth factor, prejudice to the accused, weighs in Billman\u2019s favor. Though the State questioned the source of Billman\u2019s anxiety and concern, the State failed to persuasively show that Billman\u2019s anxiety and concern were not due to the pretrial delay. Billman, on the other hand, produced evidence that supported the District Court\u2019s finding that Billman\u2019s anxiety and concern were due to the pretrial delay. Further, Billman\u2019s testimony showed his inability to accurately recall the events surrounding his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"AGv\">\u00b652  We conclude that the State failed to persuasively show that the pretrial delay did not prejudice Billman. We agree with the District Court that all of the speedy trial factors weigh in Billman\u2019s favor, and thus, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Billman was denied his right to speedy trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b166-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Abz\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b653 I concur in the Court\u2019s conclusion that Billman was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. Moreover, except for the two points discussed in \u00b6\u00b6 58-71 below, I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis in reaching this conclusion. I write separately, however, to clarify my position on certain facets of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Balance of the Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">\u00b654 I consider the speedy trial issue in this case to be closer than the Corut\u2019s Opinion reflects. On one hand, while all of the 278-day delay was attributable to the State, there is no evidence that the prosecutor engaged in purposeful foot-dragging or bad-faith delay. Rather, almost all of the delay (roughly 90 percent of it) was due either to congestion in the District Court\u2019s docket or to the legitimate unavailability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>State\u2019s witness (the arresting officer was unavailable to testify from late August through the end of September 2006 because he had been called away for military training), both of which are weighed less heavily against the State. <em>See State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6\u00b6 67-71, 338 Mont. 442, \u00b6\u00b6 67-71, 167 P.3d 815, \u00b6\u00b6 67-71. Furthermore, I cannot agree with the significance the District Court attributed to Billman\u2019s testimony at the speedy trial hearing that he was feeling nervous and had begun taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety pills during his incarceration. Billman produced no evidence whatsoever-not even an affidavit from the prescribing physician-tying his use of these medications to the delay (as opposed to the fact of being incarcerated). It is necessary, in this respect, to recall that a certain amount of anxiety and concern is inherent in being accused of a crime and that the speedy trial guarantee is designed to shorten-not eliminate-the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 97, 147-150. Consequently, the issue is not simply whether the accused feels nervous or has started taking medication to alleviate anxiety or depression while incarcerated. Rather, the key question is whether <em>the delay </em>in bringing the accused to trial <em>unduly prolonged </em>the disruption of his life or <em>aggravated </em>the anxiety and concern that are inherent in being accused of a crime. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 97. Accordingly, testimony by an accused that he is nervous, anxious, and taking medications is, by itself, and even if credible, inconclusive on the anxiety-and-concern issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b655 On the other hand, I agree with the Court that Billman\u2019s responses to-or, more specifically, his concerns and complaints about-the pretrial delay in this case weigh heavily in favor of the conclusion that he was denied his right to a speedy trial. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 33-35. Furthermore, it is well-established that both the prosecutor and the court have an affirmative constitutional obligation to try the accused in a timely manner and that this duty requires a good-faith, diligent effort to bring the accused to trial quickly. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 65; <em>State v. Blair, </em>2004 MT 356, \u00b6 23, 324 Mont. 444, \u00b6 23, 103 P.3d 538, \u00b6 23; <em>In re A.G., </em>2002 MT 111, \u00b6 26, 309 Mont. 491, \u00b6 26, 47 P.3d 831, \u00b6 26. Thus, it is the prosecution\u2019s duty, when it becomes aware that one of its witnesses is going to be unavailable to testify at trial, to notify the court and the accused of this fact promptly so that the trial can be reset for the earliest possible date. Here, however, the prosecutor\u2019s motion to reset the trial due to the arresting officer\u2019s absence for military training was filed on August 25, 2006, four days <em>after </em>the previous trial date of August 21 had passed. According to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>motion, the officer was \u201canticipated to return by October 1, 2006\u201d; and the new October 30 trial setting presumably was the next available date on the District Court\u2019s calendar. Yet, as Billman and the Court point out, a date closer to October 1 may have been available had the prosecutor moved for a continuance in a timelier manner. In light of the prosecutor\u2019s failure to do so and the fact that the State bears the burden of explaining the pretrial delays, <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 64-65, the resulting delay is properly accorded the weight associated with negligence or lack of diligence on the part of the State. Opinion, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"ATh\">\u00b656 Lastly, Billman was incarcerated for 278 days awaiting trial on relatively simple charges (driving under the influence of alcohol, driving while suspended or revoked, and driving without proof of liability insurance) which did not require much time to prepare. Indeed, it appears that the State planned to call only one witness (the arresting officer) and that discovery was completed about two weeks after Billman\u2019s arrest. Under these circumstances, the duration of Billman\u2019s pretrial incarceration was oppressive. In this regard, I cannot agree with the State\u2019s argument that Billman was not subjected to oppressive pretrial incarceration because, at the time of his arrest, he \u201cwas essentially unemployed and homeless\u201d and, thus, \u201cdid not lose a job or a home as a result of being incarcerated.\u201d Setting aside the fact that Billman testified to the contrary at the speedy trial hearing that he, in fact, was employed and resided at a motel at the time of his arrest, the suggestion that pretrial incarceration is not oppressive if the accused \u201cwas essentially unemployed and homeless\u201d at the time of arrest is inappropriate. Granted, this Court has recognized that adverse impact on employment status due to incarceration or the presence of unresolved criminal charges is a pertinent consideration under Factor Four. <em>See e.g. State v. Bailey, </em>201 Mont. 473, 480-81, 655 P.2d 494, 498-99 (1982); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2000 MT 180, \u00b6 30, 300 Mont. 367, \u00b6 30, 4 P.3d 654, \u00b6 30; <em>State v. Kipp, </em>1999 MT 197, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 399, \u00b6 21, 984 P.2d 733, \u00b6 21. Thus, for example, if the accused was forced to give up a preexisting job while incarcerated, he or she might argue that the impact of this loss increased the oppressiveness of the incarceration or added to his or her anxiety and concern; and the same would be true if the accused lost his or her home while incarcerated due to an inability to make payments. However, we have never said that loss of preexisting employment or housing is a <em>prerequisite </em>to a determination of oppressive pretrial incarceration or aggravated anxiety and concern. Such an approach, which would disadvantage individuals who are without a stable job and home at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>time of arrest, would be incompatible with the constitutional right to fair and equal treatment under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b657 For the foregoing reasons, while I believe this case is close, I concur in the Court\u2019s conclusion that the balance weighs in Billman\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Measuring the Length of the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b658 In measuring the length of the delay, the Court excludes the 33 days between the fourth trial setting (November 1,2006) and the fifth trial setting (December 4, 2006). That 33-day postponement was necessitated by Billman\u2019s October 30 speedy trial motion. The Court explains that this period is not counted because the speedy trial timeframe ends on the date of the case\u2019s disposition, and here the District Court granted Billman\u2019s motion on November 1, which the Court states stopped the speedy trial clock. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"ATK\">\u00b659 I agree with the Court that because Billman\u2019s right to a speedy trial was violated as of Day 278, it is unnecessary to consider the additional 33 days leading up to the fifth trial setting. However, I disagree with the Court\u2019s categorical statement that \u201cthe date that a district court grants a motion to dismiss based on speedy trial properly becomes the end date of the speedy trial interval.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 17. It is entirely possible that under different circumstances, Billman\u2019s right to a speedy trial would not have been violated as of Day 278, but would have been violated as of Day 311 (the fifth trial setting). In other words, under this scenario, those 33 days of delay would have tipped the scales in his favor. Yet, contrary to the Court\u2019s intimation, he is not required to wait until Day 311 to file his speedy trial motion. Indeed, we have provided a strong incentive for defendants to file such motions at least 30 days in advance of trial. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 116 (\u201c[A]ny delay directly attributable to the filing of a speedy trial motion less than <em>thirty </em>days prior to the scheduled trial date should be charged to the accused. Conversely, any delay directly attributable to the filing of such a motion <em>thirty or more </em>days prior to the scheduled trial date should be charged to the State (as institutional delay).\u201d). Accordingly, a defendant may argue in his motion that while his right to a speedy trial has not yet been violated, it will be by the time the current trial setting comes around.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b660 A hypothetical may assist in making this point. On Day 200, as the result of the prosecutor\u2019s motion to continue, the trial judge resets the trial for the earliest opening on the court\u2019s calendar. That date is Day 300. The defendant, on Day 201, files a motion to dismiss, arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>that the additional delay of 100 days violates his right to a speedy trial. On Day 210, the trial judge considers the motion, agrees with it, and dismisses the charges. The judge reasons that the speedy trial right is violated not by virtue of the existing 210-day delay, but by virtue of the unavoidable 300-day delay that will have occurred by the time the defendant actually is brought to trial. The State then appeals the decision to this Court. In this situation, we do not evaluate the speedy trial claim based on the delay of 210 days between arrest and the date of disposition. Rather, we consider the delay of 300 days between arrest and the last trial setting, as did the trial judge. For this reason, the Court\u2019s statement in \u00b6 17 to the effect that the length of the delay always terminates on the date the district court grants the speedy trial motion is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b661 The statement in \u00b6 17 also would create an untenable possibility. Say that in the case at hand we had <em>disagreed </em>with the District Court that Billman\u2019s right to a speedy trial was violated by Day 278 when the court considered his motion. Could we not then consider whether the right would have been violated on the last trial setting (Day 311)? Surely, we could. Indeed, it makes no sense to reverse the court\u2019s decision and remand for a trial if Day 311 would have been constitutionally excessive delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b662 The point here is that we should not be announcing an imprecise and overbroad rule that seemingly precludes consideration of pretrial delay all the way up to the final trial setting in cases where the district court has granted the speedy trial motion. In some of those cases, the period of delay between the date of disposition and the final trial setting may factor into the parties\u2019 and the district court\u2019s decision, in which case we too must consider that delay. In the case at hand, it is sufficient to hold that Billman\u2019s right to a speedy trial was violated as of Day 278. Contrary to the Court\u2019s analysis in \u00b6\u00b6 17 and 29, we are not precluded from considering the 33 days between the fourth and fifth trial settings; we just need not consider those days because the 278-day delay is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Counting the Delay Occasioned by the State\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b663 Given the District Court\u2019s and this Court\u2019s determinations that Billman\u2019s right to a speedy trial was violated as of Day 278, it also is unnecessary to consider the delay that has accumulated during the State\u2019s appeal of the District Court\u2019s ruling. Nevertheless, the Court points out that any such delay \u201cbears no relevance to Billman\u2019s speedy trial claim.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15. The Court explains that following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>District Court\u2019s order granting Billman\u2019s speedy trial motion, \u201cno criminal charges were pending against Billman, nor was he subjected to actual restrictions on his liberty, and thus, the speedy trial guarantee no longer applied.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15 (citing <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 8, 102 S. Ct. 1497, 1502 (1982), and <em>United States v. Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. 302, 310-11, 106 S. Ct. 648, 653-54 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b664 The Court\u2019s reasoning is correct as far as federal law goes. <em>See Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. at 310-12, 106 S. Ct. at 653-54. However, I question whether the <em>Loud Hawk </em>rule is appropriate for purposes of speedy trial analysis under the Montana Constitution. For that matter, I question whether we should be offering any view on this matter within the context of this case, given that it is totally unnecessary for us to consider what transpired after Day 278. In any event, because the Court cites the <em>Loud Hawk </em>rule, I shall discuss why I believe that categorical exclusion of the time which passes after the dismissal of charges on speedy trial grounds is ill-advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b665 For one thing, a criminal case is not necessarily over just because a district court grants a speedy trial motion. In the case at hand, for instance, the State has continued \u201cto align its full resources against [Billman] in judicial proceedings\u201d by appealing the dismissal of the charges against him. <em>Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. at 320, 106 S. Ct. at 659 (Marshall, Brennan, Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ., dissenting). Moreover, in so doing, the State has subjected the District Court\u2019s decision to appellate review and, correspondingly, to the possibility of reversal, which would reinstate the charges. Consequently, until today, there has not been a final disposition of the charges against Billman. To the contrary, there has been a pending, docketed case captioned <em>\u201cState v. Billman\u201d </em>\u2014 a clear indication that Billman, throughout this period, has stood accused of a crime or crimes. One purpose of the speedy trial guarantee is \u201cto minimize anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation.\u201d <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 320, 92 S. Ct. 455, 463 (1971) (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet, a defendant may suffer severe anxiety, economic hardship, and damage to his reputation in the community while awaiting final disposition of the criminal accusations against him. <em>SeeAriegwe, </em>\u00b6 96; <em>State v. Haskins, </em>220 Mont. 199, 203, 714 P.2d 119, 121-22 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"Avb\">\u00b666 Aside from the continued pendency of the criminal case, there is the matter of impairment of the defense. Prejudice under Factor Four of the balancing test is assessed in the light of the interests of defendants which the right to a speedy trial was designed to protect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 86. One such interest is limiting the possibility that the defense will be impaired by dimming memories and loss of exculpatory evidence. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 87-88. The Supreme Court has characterized this interest as \u201cthe most serious\u201d of the interests protected by the speedy trial right \u201cbecause the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.\u201d <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 532, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2193 (1972). The Supreme Court pointed out that \u201c[i]f witnesses die or disappear during a delay, the prejudice is obvious\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere is also prejudice if defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately events of the distant past.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S. Ct. at 2193.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b667 Likewise, this Court has recognized that \u201ctime may erode the accuracy of witness testimony and exculpatory evidence,\u201d <em>State v.

Kipp, </em>1999 MT 197, \u00b6 23, 295 Mont. 399, \u00b6 23, 984 P.2d 733, \u00b6 23. Thus, we stated in <em>Jefferson </em>that impairment of the defense \u201coften carries more weight than the other bases for concluding a defendant has been prejudiced by a pretrial delay.\u201d <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 36. Similarly, the Court observes that \u201c[Limiting the possibility that pretrial delay will impair the accused\u2019s defense arguably is the most important interest that the speedy trial right protects because an accused\u2019s inability to present an effective defense undermines the fairness of the system.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 47; <em>accord State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 29, 309 Mont. 113, \u00b6 29, 43 P.3d 948, \u00b6 29; <em>State v. Price, </em>2001 MT 212, \u00b6 28, 306 Mont. 381, \u00b6 28, 34 P.3d 112, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"AID\">\u00b668 It is not clear that impairment of the defense should carry the significance that <em>Barker </em>and many of our past decisions suggest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Indeed, the Supreme Court has given conflicting statements concerning the relative importance of this consideration. On one hand, as noted above, the Supreme Court has characterized the possibility that the defense will be impaired as \u201cthe most serious\u201d of the interests that the speedy trial right was designed to protect. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S. Ct. at 2193; <em>accord Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 654, 112 S. Ct. 2686, 2692 (1992). Yet, on the other hand, the Supreme Court has stated that the right to a speedy trial is \u201cnot primarily intended to prevent prejudice to the defense caused by passage of time,\u201d <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8, 102 S. Ct. at 1502; that \u201cthe major evils protected against by the speedy trial guarantee exist quite apart from actual or possible prejudice to an accused\u2019s defense,\u201d <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 320, 92 S. Ct. at 463; and that \u201cthe Speedy Trial Clause\u2019s core concern is impairment of <em>liberty,\u201d Loud </em>Hawk, 474 U.S. at 312, 106 S. Ct. at 654 (emphasis added), as opposed to impairment of the <em>defense. See also Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 660-66, 112 S. Ct. at 2695-98 (Thomas, J., Rehnquist, C.J., &amp; Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b669 But assuming that impairment of the defense is \u201cthe most serious\u201d or \u201cthe most important\u201d of the interests protected by the speedy trial right, it would defy logic to adopt a categorical rule excluding from our analysis the time which passes while the State appeals a district court\u2019s grant of a speedy trial motion. Obviously, memories and evidence may degrade during this period. Indeed, degradation of memories and evidence does not magically stop on the date a speedy trial motion is granted. Moreover, if an exculpatory witness dies, if a crucial witness goes missing, or if exculpatory evidence is lost or destroyed <em>during </em>the course of the State\u2019s appeal, the defense is impaired no less than if one or more of these events occurs <em>before </em>the speedy trial motion is granted or <em>after </em>this Court reverses the district court\u2019s decision, reinstates the charges, and remands the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"ApL\">\u00b670 In the case at hand, the District Court found (and this Court agrees) that Billman\u2019s memory regarding the events surrounding his arrest faded during his 278-day incarceration and that this, in turn, impeded his ability to testify effectively and to prepare his defense adequately. Opinion, \u00b6 48. Now, over 970 days have passed since Billman\u2019s arrest on January 27,2006. It is implausible to suggest that his ability to present an effective defense is as strong now as it was 700 days ago. Thus, if impairment of the defense is to play such a prominent role in the Factor Four analysis, we cannot categorically exclude from the speedy trial equation the time which passes after the district court grants a speedy trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u00b671 Indeed, had we decided that the District Court erred in granting Billman\u2019s speedy trial motion, we could not then simply disregard the additional 700 days of delay occasioned by the State\u2019s initial appeal, by this Court\u2019s decision last November to remand this case to the District Court for the entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law based on <em>Ariegwe, </em>and by the State\u2019s subsequent appeal following the District Court\u2019s January 4,2008 order. Billman is in no way responsible for any of that delay, and we would render his constitutional right to a speedy trial utterly meaningless if we were to remand this case for a trial (which likely would not occur until well over 1,000 days had passed since his arrest) without first considering that delay. Accordingly, the Court should not so cavalierly dismiss the time that has passed since Day 278. Opinion, \u00b6 15. If Billman\u2019s right to a speedy trial was violated by 278 days of delay, can it logically be maintained that his right would not be violated by 1,000 days of delay?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The District Court\u2019s <em>Post-Ariegwe </em>Order</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b672 Lastly, as just noted, this Court remanded this case to the District Court last November for the entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law based on <em>Ariegwe. </em>In <em>Ariegwe, </em>we set out our revised speedy trial test. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-112. We consciously adopted and explained the new test in substantial detail so as to provide a logical and chronological structure to be used by counsel and the trial courts in resolving speedy trial claims. While the analytical model has been described as the \u201cmother of all balancing tests,\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 184 (Rice, Morris, Leaphart &amp; Warner, JJ., specially concurring), the <em>Ariegwe </em>framework, if followed, ensures that all of the relevant circumstances are considered and balanced. We demonstrated this in <em>Ariegwe </em>by applying the new test to Ariegwe\u2019s speedy trial claim. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 121-155.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b673 Since <em>Ariegwe </em>was issued, appellate counsel in numerous cases have been diligent in following and analyzing the relevant factual circumstances pursuant to the new test. The Court\u2019s Opinion in the case at hand likewise tracks the <em>Ariegwe </em>framework and provides a useful and well-reasoned application of the test to the facts of this case. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. It appears that the court simply took the outline provided in \u00b6 113 of <em>Ariegwe </em>and plugged facts into it with little or no corresponding analysis. While that outline was provided as a summary or checklist of the various considerations that should be considered when applying the revised test, it was not meant as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>substitute for an actual detailed explanation of why the speedy trial motion should or should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b674 As noted, the Court\u2019s Opinion lays out the analysis that the District Court should have provided under <em>Ariegwe. </em>But it is not this Court\u2019s responsibility to provide the flesh to the trial court\u2019s skeletal decision. That is not how the revised test was intended to operate; indeed, it turns the process on its head. In fact, the reason we remanded this case to the District Court following our decision in <em>Ariegwe </em>and the reason we have continued to follow this procedure in subsequent appeals involving speedy trial claims is to allow the trial courts to analyze the four factors and do the balancing in the first instance. In order to determine if a speedy trial motion should be granted and to enable this Court expeditiously to review that determination, it is necessary that the parties and the trial courts apply the test in the first instance comprehensively.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b675 In conclusion, with the foregoing points in mind, I concur in the Court\u2019s holding that Billman was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-5\"> <em>See e.g. State v.

In <em>Ariegwe, </em>the delay was 208 days beyond the 200-day trigger date. We noted that this was \u201cmore than twice the amount of delay that is considered sufficiently prejudicial to trigger the speedy trial test,\u201d and thus required the State to provide \u201ccompelling justifications\u201d for the delay. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 123. Here, the delay is only 78 days beyond the trigger date, and yet the Court imposes the same \u201ccompelling justification\u201d quantum of proof upon the State. Opinion, \u00b6 18. Thus, the \u201csliding scale burden\u201d is not being honored as designed in <em>Ariegwe </em>(\u201c[T]he court must consider the extent to which the delay (again, irrespective of fault for the delay) stretches beyond the 200-day trigger date.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 62.).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\u00b678 Under factor two, reasons for the delay, I agree with Justice Nelson\u2019s comments that there was no evidence of foot-dragging or bad faith by the prosecutor and that this factor should weigh less heavily against the State. In <em>Ariegwe, </em>we noted that \u201c[significantly, more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>half of the State\u2019s delay was institutional in nature.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 135. Here, as Justice Nelson notes, virtually all of the delay is institutional. The Court finds fault in the timing of the prosecutor\u2019s motion, but even so, that resulted in only 30 days of delay. To the extent this factor weighs in Billman\u2019s favor, it is very minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b679 Under factor four, part 2, anxiety and concern of the accused, I agree with Justice Nelson that the testimony offered in support of Billman\u2019s anxiety and concern was insignificant for its failure to link aggravation of any anxiety to the delay itself. Under part 4, impairment of the accused\u2019s defense, the Court acknowledges that this factor is most important. <em>See also Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 654, 112 S. Ct. 2686, 2692 (1992) (\u201cOf these forms of prejudice, \u2018the most serious is the last, because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.\u2019\u201d). Although the District Court entered a conclusion of law that Billman\u2019s \u201cability to gather evidence, contact witnesses who may have testified on his behalf, otherwise prepare for his own defense\u201d was hindered, Billman did not offer evidence in this regard, and thus the conclusion is not supported by the evidence. Billman offered only his own memory, asserting that, though admittedly an alcoholic who drinks frequently and who is charged with a drinking-related crime, that his inability to recall was due to the passage of time. Given the relative simplicity of the charge, and the importance of this factor in a speedy trial determination, I do not believe Billman demonstrated that his defense had been significantly impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b680 Consequently, after giving these factors the weight which, in my view, is appropriate, I believe the factors balance against the motion. Thus, I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
