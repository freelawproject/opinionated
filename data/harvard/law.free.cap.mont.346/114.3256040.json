We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-22\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-23\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by concluding that Shelton failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the search warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>contained false information?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by considering information not contained in the search warrant application when deciding Shelton\u2019s motion to suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u00b65 The facts of this case were discussed in an opinion we recently issued in another appeal, from Custer County, Montana, in which Shelton was found guilty of operating a clandestine drug laboratory. <em>State v. Shelton, </em>2008 MT 282, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, 345 Mont. 330, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, 191 P.3d 420, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7 <em>(Shelton I). </em>Briefly, Agent Faycosh, of the Eastern Montana Drug Task Force, discovered a clandestine methamphetamine laboratory at an old rendering plant in Miles City. Based on tips from two informants, Faycosh suspected that Shelton produced meth at this clandestine lab. Faycosh went to Terry to interview Shelton and learned that Shelton had spent the evening of April 11, 2005, at the apartment of his friend, David Johnson. Faycosh visited Johnson\u2019s apartment, and was greeted by Tiny Mae Wood. Wood, seventeen years old, lived in the apartment with Johnson. <em>Shelton I, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u00b66 Faycosh requested permission to search the apartment. Wood hesitated, and then confessed that she had cigarettes in her apartment, even though she was under eighteen. Faycosh assured her that he was not concerned with the cigarettes, but asked her if there were any illegal drugs in the apartment. Wood said, \u201cNo, go ahead and search.\u201d Faycosh searched the apartment, and found several items bearing Shelton\u2019s name in the garbage can. Faycosh asked Wood if the garbage belonged to Shelton, and she stated that it did. Faycosh asked if it came from Shelton\u2019s car, and Wood replied that she thought so. Wood granted Faycosh permission to remove the bag of garbage from the apartment. <em>Shelton I, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u00b67 A subsequent search of Shelton\u2019s garbage revealed a small plastic baggie that contained marijuana residue and a marijuana seed. Based in part on this evidence, Agent Stratton applied for and received a search warrant to look for evidence in Shelton\u2019s car which might connect him to the clandestine meth lab. The search of Shelton\u2019s car yielded multiple bags of meth, a digital scale, and a recipe for manufacturing meth. <em>Shelton I, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">\u00b68 In <em>Shelton I, </em>Shelton was charged in Custer County with operating a clandestine laboratory. In the present case, Shelton was charged in Prairie County with criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute, a felony, and criminal possession of drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>paraphernalia, a misdemeanor. Shelton moved to suppress the evidence gathered from his car and Wood\u2019s apartment, arguing that the warrant application contained false information because it allegedly misrepresented the certainty with which Wood had identified the trash as belonging to him. The District Court held a suppression hearing on January 23,2007, after which it denied Shelton\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b69 Pursuant to a plea agreement, Shelton pled guilty to criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute and reserved his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. The District Court sentenced Shelton to the Department of Corrections for five years. Shelton appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b610 We review a District Court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court applied the law correctly. <em>State v. </em>Morse, 2006 MT 54, \u00b6 12, 331 Mont. 300, \u00b6 12, 132 P.3d 528, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err by concluding that Shelton failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the search warrant contained false information?</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">\u00b612 Shelton argues that the warrant application contained false information because it mischaracterized Wood\u2019s response to one of Faycosh\u2019s questions. Whereas the search warrant application stated that \u201cWood ... identified the trash as being from Shelton\u2019s vehicle,\u201d the report authored by Faycosh stated that \u2018Wood said she <em>thought so.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) According to Shelton, if that \u201cfalse information\u201d was excised from the application, it would not have contained probable cause to search Shelton\u2019s vehicle. In his prior appeal, Shelton also argued that the warrant application contained false information by mischaracterizing Wood\u2019s response to Agent Faycosh\u2019s question about the origin of the trash. <em>Shelton I, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">\u00b613 \u201cGenerally, res judicata dictates that an appellant may not raise issues that we have decided in a prior appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Southwick, </em>2007 MT 257, \u00b6 15, 339 Mont. 281, \u00b6 15, 169 P.3d 698, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted); <em>State v. Ditton, </em>2006 MT 235, \u00b6 38, 333 Mont. 483, \u00b6 38, 144 P.3d 783, \u00b6 38. \u201cThe policy rationales underlying res judicata are judicial economy and the need for finality of judgments.\u201d <em>Southwick, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u00b6 15 (citation omitted). We will only review a previously decided issue in limited circumstances, and only to correct a \u201cmanifest error.\u201d <em>Southwick, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b614 The doctrine of res judicata directs us to decline review of Shelton\u2019s argument that the application contained false information. Shelton made the same argument here that he made in his prior appeal. Under the doctrine of res judicata, our holding from <em>Shelton I </em>applies, and we must simply reiterate that Shelton \u201cfailed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the application for the search warrant contained false information.\u201d <em>Shelton I, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b615 Did the District Court err by considering information not contained in the search warrant application when deciding Shelton\u2019s motion to suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u00b616 Shelton also argues that the District Court improperly considered testimony presented at Shelton\u2019s suppression hearing that the trash Agent Faycosh found in Wood\u2019s apartment looked like the type of trash that would have come from the inside of a vehicle. According to Shelton, that assertion was not made in the warrant application, and without it, nothing in the application tied Shelton\u2019s vehicle to Faycosh\u2019s investigation of a clandestine lab and drug possession.</p>\n<p id=\"AsD\">\u00b617  In concluding that Faycosh\u2019s statement regarding Wood\u2019s identification of the trash was not false, the District Court briefly observed that \u201cFaycosh also testified that the nature of the trash was what one would expect to find as coming from a vehicle.\u201d However, this statement simply buttressed the court\u2019s observation that, whether the warrant application said Wood \u201cthought\u201d the trash was from Shelton\u2019s vehicle or conclusively stated that it was, the application would have still contained probable cause to issue a search warrant for Shelton\u2019s vehicle. In view of this conclusion, the reference to Faycosh\u2019s testimony was not improper. Further, the District Court explicitly stated it was not considering information not contained in the warrant application, and there is no other indication that it did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\u00b618 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Shelton\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
