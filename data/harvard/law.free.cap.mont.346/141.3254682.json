We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b62 Fleming raised the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b63 1. Whether the WCC erred when it failed to apply the statute in effect on Fleming\u2019s last day of employment for IPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b64 2. Whether retroactive application of \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA (2003), violates the contract clause of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u00b65 3. Whether more than one claim for compensation must be filed when there is only one occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b66 Because we find Issue 1 to be dispositive of this case, we do not address Fleming\u2019s other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">\u00b67 Fleming worked at the lumber mill in Libby, Montana from 1960 until May 1998. During that time, he had three different employers: St. Regis Lumber Company (St. Regis), from 1960 to 1985; Champion International Paper Co. (Champion), from 1985 to November 1993; and Stimson Lumber Company (Stimson), from November 1993 to May 1998. Fleming was diagnosed with asbestos-related lung disease on April 2, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">\u00b68 On November 29, 2001, Fleming filed a claim for occupational disease benefits against Stimson identifying the date of the \u201caccident\u201d as \u201c1960-5/1998.\u201d On March 22, 2004, Fleming filed a \u201cClaim for Compensation\u201d listing Champion as the employer and identifying the date of the \u201caccident\u201d as \u201c1961-1993.\u201d The insurers for both Stimson and Champion denied Fleming\u2019s claims for occupational disease benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">\u00b69 Fleming underwent a medical evaluation on September 21,2004, at the request of the Department of Labor and Industry and pursuant to the occupational disease panel evaluation procedure set out in \u00a7 39-72-601, MCA. Based on his evaluation, Dr. Richard Sellman opined that Fleming was suffering from \u201cminimal asbestos-related pleural thickening\u201d that could be traced to Fleming\u2019s employment. However, Dr. Sellman further opined that based on the minimal amount of pleural disease, Fleming was \u201cable to work in any type of work, based on his asbestos-related disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">\u00b610 Fleming filed a Petition for Hearing with the WCC on April 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>2005, naming as Respondents both IPC, as successor-in-interest to Champion (hereafter collectively referred to as IPC), and Liberty Northwest Insurance Corp. (Liberty), Stimson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer. In his petition, Fleming sought acceptance of liability by one or both of the Respondents and payment of applicable workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b611 IPC filed a Motion to Dismiss Fleming\u2019s Petition for Hearing on May 6, 2005,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming that Fleming \u201cfailed to file his occupational disease claim within two years as required by \u00a7 39-72-403(1), MCA (1993).\u201d Fleming responded to IPC\u2019s motion by pointing out that \u00a7 39-72-403(1), MCA (1993), required filing a claim within two years of \u201ctotal disability.\u201d Fleming contended that the medical evidence did not yet establish that he was totally disabled, thus his March 22, 2004 claim was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b612 The WCC, in an Order dated July 8, 2005, agreed that Fleming\u2019s claim against IPC was timely filed pursuant to \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA (1993). However, the court then queried whether the claim was timely filed pursuant to \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA (2003), the statute in effect when Fleming filed his claim for occupational disease benefits against IPC. The court determined that since \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA, is a statute of limitations provision and is procedural, it could be applied retroactively. Thus, based on the 2003 version of the statute, the court concluded that Fleming\u2019s claim was not timely because it was filed more than one year after Fleming knew or should have known that his condition resulted from an occupational disease. Consequently, the WCC granted IPC\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Fleming\u2019s claim against IPC.</p>\n<p id=\"AWI\">\u00b613 IPC also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on May 20, 2005, arguing that, based on Dr. Sellman\u2019s evaluation, because Fleming has no physical restriction caused by his occupational disease that would impair his ability to work, he is not entitled to benefits. The WCC deemed that this motion was moot in light of the court\u2019s decision to grant IPC\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b614 On August 2,2005, Fleming filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the WCC\u2019s Order granting IPC\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. In his motion, Fleming argued that the WCC erred in dismissing his claim against IPC because: (1) Fleming\u2019s original claim against Stimson was timely and he was not required to file a second claim against IPC; (2) even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>he was required to file a separate claim against IPC, that claim was also timely because the occupational disease statutes in effect on Fleming\u2019s last day of employment control regardless of subsequent amendments to those statutes; and (3) retroactive application of the 2003 version of \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA, violates the Contract Clause of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b615 Because Fleming raised a constitutional challenge in his Motion for Reconsideration, he served a notice on the Attorney General on August 2, 2005, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 24(d). Two days later, the WCC also served the Attorney General with a Notice of Constitutional Challenge. However, on August 17, 2005, without affording the Attorney General the 20 days provided by M. R. Civ. P. 24(d) to respond to the Notice of Constitutional Challenge, the WCC issued its Order denying Fleming\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b616 Fleming then filed a second Motion for Reconsideration arguing that the WCC lacked jurisdiction to enter its August 17, 2005 Order because the Attorney General had not been given sufficient time to respond to the constitutional challenge pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 24(d). The WCC denied Fleming\u2019s second Motion for Reconsideration on December 20,2005, maintaining that it had never formally adopted M. R. Civ. P. 24(d), thus it was not bound by that Rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fleming appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b617 In reviewing decisions of the WCC, we employ two standards of review. We review the WCC\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial credible evidence, and we review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Kruzich v. Old Republic Ins. </em>Co., 2008 MT 205, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18, 344 Mont. 126, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18, 188 P.3d 983, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18 (citing <em>Harrison v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2008 MT 102, \u00b6 11, 342 Mont. 326, \u00b6 11, 181 P.3d 590, \u00b6 11; <em>Flynn v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2005 MT 269, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 122, \u00b6 11, 122 P.3d 1216, \u00b6 11). The WCC\u2019s determination of which statute of limitations applies is a conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u00b618 <em>Whether the WCC erred when it failed to apply the statute in effect </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>on Fleming\u2019s last day of employment for IPC.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b619 The WCC determined that because statutes of limitation are procedural, the limitations period in effect at the time the petition is filed applies. Thus, the court held that since Fleming filed his occupational disease claim against IPC in 2004, the limitations period for filing his claim in this case is governed by 2003 law. The statute of limitation for filing a written claim for compensation under the Occupational Disease Act (ODA) is found at \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA. The 2003 version of this statute provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">[w]hen a claimant seeks benefits under this chapter, the claimant\u2019s claims for benefits must be presented in writing to the employer, the employer\u2019s insurer, or the department within 1 year from the date the claimant knew or should have known that the claimant\u2019s condition resulted from an occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abr\">Section 39-72-403, MCA (2003). Consequently, because Fleming did not file his claim against IPC until three years after he learned he was suffering from asbestos-related lung disease, the WCC dismissed his claim as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b620 Fleming asserts that retroactive application of the amended \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA, would cut off his claim without any prior notice. He maintains that the WCC should have applied the 1993 version of \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA, because his last day of work for IPC was in November 1993 and this Court has repeatedly held that the statutes in effect on an employee\u2019s last day of work govern the resolution of an occupational disease claim. <em>Grenz v. Fire and Cas. of Connecticut, </em>278 Mont. 268, 271, 924 P.2d 264, 266 (1996) <em>(citing Lockwood v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>272 Mont. 202, 205, 900 P.2d 314, 316 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b621 The 1993 and 2003 versions of \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA, are different and lead to different results. Section 39-72-403, MCA (1993), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">Time when claims must be presented. (1) When a claimant seeks benefits under this chapter, his claims for benefits must be presented in writing to the employer, the employer\u2019s insurer, or the department <em>within 2 years </em>from the date the claimant knew or should have known that his <em>total disability </em>condition resulted from an occupational disease....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">(2) The department may, upon a reasonable showing by the claimant or a decedent\u2019s beneficiaries that the claimant or the beneficiaries could not have known that the claimant\u2019s condition or the employee\u2019s death was related to an occupational disease, waive the claim time requirement up to an additional 2 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Thus, under this version of the statute, the event triggering the commencement of the limitations period is the claimant\u2019s knowledge that his total disability condition resulted from an occupational disease. Consequently, until the claimant becomes totally disabled <em>and </em>is aware that his total disability resulted from an occupational disease, the limitations period does not commence running.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b622 The Legislature amended \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA, in 1995, deleting any reference to \u201ctotal disability\u201d and shortening the time for filing a claim to one year. The Legislature again amended this section in 1999 changing the waiver procedure of subsection (2) and substituting the insurer for the Department of Labor and Industry as the party responsible for granting a waiver. In addition, the Legislature added a provision giving the WCC jurisdiction over disputes regarding claim filing time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 39-72-403, MCA, was not amended again until 2005, when the Legislature repealed the ODA (Title 39, chapter 72) and merged it within the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA) (Title 39, chapter 71). Thus, the 2003 version of \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA, that the WCC attempts to apply in this case contains the same time limitation for filing an occupational disease claim as the 1995 version of the statute-i.e., \u201c1 year from the date the claimant knew or should have known that the claimant\u2019s condition resulted from an occupational disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b623 Unlike the 1993 version of \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA, under the statute in effect in 2003, a claimant\u2019s knowledge that he suffered from an occupational disease commenced the running of the one-year limitations period irrespective of whether the condition was disabling. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Fleming asserts that he was diagnosed with asbestos-related lung disease in April 2001. Thus, under the 2003 statute, Fleming\u2019s 2004 claim against IPC would be barred because the limitations period under that statute commenced to run in April 2001 and expired one year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b624 Although the WCC determined that Fleming\u2019s last day of work with IPC was in 1993, it applied the later version of the statute of limitations to Fleming\u2019s claim against IPC and concluded that Fleming\u2019s claim was time barred. The WCC did so based on this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Fisher v. First Citizens </em>Bank, 2000 MT 314, 302 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Mont. 473, 14 P.3d 1228, wherein we held that unless the Legislature expressly provides otherwise, a statute of limitations applies to all actions brought after the effective date of the statute irrespective of when the actions arose. We stated in <em>Fisher:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">Statutes of limitations are generally considered laws of procedure. If the legislature passes a new statute of limitations, all rights of action are to be enforced under the new procedure regardless of when the cause of action accrued unless there is an explicit savings clause set forth in the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><em>Fisher, </em>\u00b6 14. In <em>Fisher, </em>we were asked to determine whether the 1991 amendments to \u00a7 30-3-122, MCA, which reduced the statute of limitations on demand note actions from eight years to six years applied to collection proceedings. <em>Fisher, </em>\u00b6 8. The collection proceedings were not initiated until 1997, but the underlying financial obligations matured in March 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b625 In the instant case, because there are no savings clauses in the 1995 and 1999 amendments to \u00a7 39-72-403, MCA, the WCC determined that, based on <em>Fisher, </em>those amendments apply retroactively to Fleming\u2019s claim against IPC. Fleming argues that the WCC erred in retroactively applying these later versions of the statute to his claim because \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA, provides: \u201cNo law contained in any of the statutes of Montana is retroactive unless expressly so declared.\u201d Fleming points out that the 1995 amendments do not contain a clause making those amendments retroactive. Moreover, \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA, does not distinguish between procedural and substantive laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b626 For almost 75 years, this Court has held that the statutes in effect on the date of the accident or injury control in workers\u2019 compensation cases. <em>See e.g. Clark v. Olson, </em>96 Mont. 417, 31 P.2d 283 (1934) (\u201ccase must be decided upon the law as it was when the accident occurred\u201d); <em>Yurkovich v. Industrial Accident Board, </em>132 Mont. 77, 314 P.2d 866 (1957) (the statutes in force when accident occurred applied rather than amended statutes effective six months after the accident); <em>Gaffney v. Industrial Accident Board, </em>133 Mont. 448, 324 P.2d 1063 (1958) (the law in effect on the date the accidental injury occurred governs the extent of liability); <em>Simons v. C. G. Bennett Lumber Company, </em>146 Mont. 129, 404 P.2d 505 (1965) (rate of compensation for work-related injury must be calculated based on the statutes in effect as of the date of the injury); <em>Hutchison v. General Host Corp., </em>178 Mont. 81, 582 P.2d 1203 (1978) (lower court erred in applying statutes not in effect at the time of the injury); <em>Trusty v. Consolidated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>Freightways, </em>210 Mont. 148, 681 P.2d 1085 (1984) (\u201cThe statutes in effect at the time of the injury set the standards by which the benefits for the claimant are to be computed.\u201d); <em>Buckman v. Montana Deaconess Hosp., </em>224 Mont. 318, 730 P.2d 380 (1986) (\u201cWorkers\u2019 compensation benefits are determined by the statutes in effect as of the date of injury.\u201d); <em>Crittendon v. Terri\u2019s Rest. &amp; Lounge, </em>247 Mont. 293, 806 P.2d 534 (1991) (\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Compensation laws in effect at the time of a claimant\u2019s injury are controlling.\u201d); <em>Kuzara v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>279 Mont. 223, 928 P.2d 136 (1996) (\u2018Workers\u2019 compensation laws in effect at the time of a claimant\u2019s injury are controlling.\u201d); <em>Powell v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 321, 302 Mont. 518, 15 P.3d 877 (statute in effect at the time of claimant\u2019s accidental injury governed claimant\u2019s benefits); <em>Simms v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2005 MT 175, 327 Mont. 511, 116 P.3d 773 (the law in effect at the time of claimant\u2019s industrial accident governed his case).</p>\n<p id=\"Acq\">\u00b627  We have applied the same rationale to cases involving occupational disease claims as we applied to workers\u2019 compensation claims-i.e., that the date of accident or injury controls. <em>Gidley v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>221 Mont. 36, 37-38, 717 P.2d 21, 22 (1986). However, because an occupational disease is ongoing and does not occur on one single day or at one exact time, we used the employee\u2019s last day of work-the last day the employee could possibly have been exposed to the injurious mechanism-as the point in time from which the occupational disease claim would flow. \u201cThus, we determined, in effect, that liability for and administration of a claim should correspond with the period in which the injurious exposure occurred.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Cenex, Inc., </em>2008 MT 108, \u00b6 29, 342 Mont. 371, \u00b6 29, 181 P.3d 619, \u00b6 29; <em>see Gidley, </em>221 Mont. at 37-38, 717 P.2d at 22; <em>Grenz v. Fire and Cas. of Connecticut, </em>278 Mont. 268, 924 P.2d 264 (1996); <em>Kessel v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2007 MT 305, 340 Mont. 92, 172 P.3d 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b628 We made no exception in these cases for statutes of limitation or other procedural statutes, and we decline to do so now. <em>See e.g. Carmichael v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, </em>234 Mont. 410, 763 P.2d 1122 (1988) (statutes enacted after date of injury and mandating nonbinding mediation before party could file a petition in the WCC, could not be retroactively applied to party\u2019s claim); <em>Hardgrove v. Transportation Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 340, 324 Mont. 238, 103 P.3d 999 (the statute of limitations in effect on the employee\u2019s last day of work governed the resolution of his ODA claim).</p>\n<p id=\"Air\">\u00b629  Accordingly, on the narrow question of whether Fleming\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>claim against IPC should have been dismissed, we hold that the WCC erred when it failed to apply the statutes in effect on Fleming\u2019s last day of employment with IPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b630 Because Fleming worked at the Libby mill under three different owners, this case also raised questions of whether Fleming\u2019s last day of work for IPC or his last day of work for Stimson should govern his claim based on the \u201clast injurious exposure\u201d doctrine, and whether Fleming is yet \u201ctotally disabled\u201d and entitled to occupational disease benefits. However, these are questions that are more properly determined at trial after presentation of all of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b631 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\"> Liberty also filed a Motion to Dismiss and a Motion for Summary Judgment on May 6, 2005, which the WCC subsequently denied.
