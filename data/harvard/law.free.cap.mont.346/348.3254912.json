We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A4v\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\n<em>\u00b63 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence of Stearns\u2019s 1996 convictions for indecent exposure ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b64 Hamilton police arrested Stearns in March of 2007. Police identified him as a suspect in three indecent exposure incidents in Hamilton\u2019s River Park. The incidents occurred September 19, November 8, and December 23 of 2006. A man exposed himself and masturbated in front of a woman in each of the incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b65 The State charged Stearns with three counts of indecent exposure. Soon after charging Stearns, the State submitted its <em>Just </em>notice of intent to introduce evidence of other crimes. <em>State v. Just, </em>184 Mont. 262, 602 P.2d 957 (1979). The State intended to introduce evidence that Stearns had pled guilty in 1996 to two counts of indecent exposure, one count of sexual intercourse without consent, and had admitted that he was hiding by a trail, masturbating, while watching a fourth woman. The State also intended to introduce evidence that Stearns was in prison from January 3, 1997 to March 14, 2006, and was under intensive supervision until July 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u00b66 Stearns exposed himself and masturbated in front of two women jogging on the River\u2019s Edge Trail in Great Falls in 1996. Stearns\u2019s 1996 rape conviction began in the same manner, and culminated in Stearns chasing the woman down and forcing her to perform oral sex. The State sought to introduce the past offenses to show intent, knowledge, plan, identity and opportunity with respect to the 2006 charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">\u00b67 Stearns conceded that evidence of the 1996 indecent exposure offenses was allowable under present law, but objected to evidence of the rape offense or time of incarceration. The District Court allowed the State to introduce evidence of the prior acts of indecent exposure, but agreed that the evidence of the rape and incarceration was too prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">\u00b68 Five witnesses, including the three victims, identified Stearns at trial as the man who had exposed himself in the park. The State offered evidence of cell phone records placing Steams in Hamilton at the time of each incident. Stearns lived in Missoula. Detective Shook testified that Stearns initially had lied to him about ever having been in Hamilton or River Park. Stearns had changed his story about his whereabouts after Detective Shook informed him about the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>against him, but Steams still denied the indecent exposure allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">\u00b69 The District Court, the State, and Stearns\u2019s counsel discussed the form and timing of the proposed <em>Just </em>instructions before voir dire. The District Court, the State, and Stearns\u2019s counsel again discussed the form and timing of the proposed <em>Just </em>instructions after voir dire. The State referred to the 1996 incidents in its opening statement, and reminded the jury that the prior incidents were not the subject of this trial. Stearns\u2019s counsel, in his opening statement, conceded that Stearns was guilty of the 1996 offenses, but argued that Stearns was not guilty of the 2006 incidents at issue. The parties agreed on an \u201cevidence of prior acts\u201d instruction. The District Court read the instruction to the jury as part of the preliminary instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b610 The Great Falls detective who had arrested Stearns in the 1996 incidents testified as part of the State\u2019s case. Stearns\u2019s counsel cross-examined the detective about the 1996 incidents. Stearns moved for a directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case. The District Court denied the motion. The State twice moved the District Court to allow evidence of the 1996 sexual assault without consent conviction. The District Court denied both motions. Stearns testified about the 1996 convictions on direct. The State cross-examined Steams about the 1996 incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b611 The District Court, the State, and Stearns\u2019s counsel again discussed the proposed <em>Just </em>instruction after the close of Stearns\u2019s case. The State mentioned the 1996 incidents in its closing argument. The State contended that the jury could consider their identical nature to the 2006 incidents. Steams\u2019s counsel admitted in closing that Stearns was guilty of the 1996 indecent exposures in Great Falls, but warned the jury not to convict Stearns based on what had happened in Great Falls. The District Court read the agreed upon \u201cevidence of other acts\u201d instruction as part of the general charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b612 Steams did not object to the District Court\u2019s procedure. The jury convicted Stearns of all three counts of Indecent Exposure. The District Court entered judgment against Stearns on December 24, 2007. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Price, </em>2007 MT 269, \u00b6 10, 339 Mont. 399, \u00b6 10, 171 P.3d 293, \u00b6 10. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence of Stearns\u2019s 1996 convictions for indecent exposure ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b615 Steams argues that the District Court committed reversible error by failing to follow the necessary procedural requirements when it allowed evidence of his past convictions for indecent exposure. The State argues that the District Court followed proper procedures and that, in any case, Stearns waived his right to appeal this issue by failing to object before or during trial to the District Court\u2019s procedures and by actively participating in creating the alleged error. Steams contends that even if he did not object he is still entitled to review because the alleged error affected a substantial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u00b616 The modified <em>Just </em>rule guides a district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts as defined by M.R. Evid. 404(b). <em>State v. </em>Ayers, 2003 MT 114, \u00b6 72-73, 315 Mont. 395, \u00b6 72-73, 68 P.3d 768, \u00b6 72-73. A party offering evidence of prior acts must comply with four substantive elements. <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 76. In addition to satisfying the four substantive requirements of the modified <em>Just </em>rule, a party offering evidence of prior acts also must comply with three procedural requirements. <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u00b617 The procedural rules require the party offering the evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts to first provide proper notice of its intent to offer such evidence. The trial court shall explain to the jury at the time of the introduction of the evidence the limited purpose of such evidence. The procedural rules further require the court to admonish the jury in its final charge that such evidence has been received only for the limited purposes earlier stated and that the defendant is not being tried, and may not be convicted, for any offense except that presently charged. The court must warn the jury that to convict based on other offenses may result in unjust double punishment. <em>Ayers, \u00b6 </em>77.</p>\n<p id=\"AuW\">\u00b618 Stearns conceded the relevance and admissibility of the 1996 indecent exposure crimes evidence. Stearns contends, however, that the District Court did not properly admonish the jury at the introduction of the evidence and in its final charge. Before reaching the merits of the application of the modified <em>Just </em>rule, however, the issue must be properly before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\u00b619 We consider issues presented for the first time to be untimely and will not consider them on appeal. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 14. Absent an objection, an alleged error is not appropriate for review. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 15. We will not fault a trial court where that court has no opportunity to correct itself if warranted. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 14-15; \u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA. Moreover, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>has stated that a defendant must have objected to any procedural irregularities occurring after the prosecution gives notice under <em>Just </em>in order to constitute grounds for reversal. <em>State v. Mix, </em>239 Mont. 351, 359, 781 P.2d 751, 756 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b620  Stearns made no such objection, and the State argues that he actively participated in any alleged error. We agree. Stearns did not object to alleged procedural irregularities at any point during trial. Stearns\u2019s counsel did not object when specifically asked by the District Court if he had any objections to the proposed <em>Just </em>instructions. In fact, Stearns\u2019s counsel actively participated in formulating the <em>Just </em>instructions. We conclude that Stearns did not preserve this issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b621 Stearns argues that even if he did not object, he is still entitled to review. He points to <em>Clark v. Norris, </em>226 Mont. 43, 53, 734 P.2d 182, 188 (1987), for the proposition that failure to object waives a claim of error unless the claimed error affects a substantial right of a party. He contends that the <em>Just </em>procedural safeguards implicate the right to a fair trial, and that the District Court\u2019s alleged failure to implement the safeguards affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b622 We did not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s fair trial claim in <em>Clark. </em>We noted that Clark did not object to the court\u2019s alleged error at trial or in chambers although she had the opportunity to do so either time. We declined to consider the alleged error in light of the fact that Clark could point to no evidence that the failure to object had affected her right to a fair trial. <em>Clark, </em>226 Mont. at 53, 734 P.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u00b623  Stearns likewise failed to object at trial or in chambers, despite the opportunity to do so either time. Stearns\u2019s counsel actively participated in creating the alleged error. The District Court warned the jury during the preliminary instructions and in the general charge that the State offered evidence of the 1996 incidents for limited purposes, and that Stearns was not on trial for the prior acts. The State emphasized in its opening statement that Stearns was not on trial for the 1996 charges. Substantial evidence pointed to Stearns\u2019s guilt apart from the previous convictions. No evidence supports Stearns\u2019s claim that the District Court violated Stearns\u2019s substantial rights or right to a fair trial. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of Stearns\u2019s 1996 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-9\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
