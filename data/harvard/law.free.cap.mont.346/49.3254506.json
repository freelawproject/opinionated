We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u00b62 B.A.M. presents the following issue for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b63 Whether the Youth Court properly determined that exigent circumstances existed sufficient to justify a warrantless entry into the subject home.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b64 Fergus County sheriffs deputies received a tip on November 5, 2006, regarding an underage drinking party at the Landrau ranch about 25 miles outside of Lewistown, Montana. The deputies arrived at about 1:00 a.m. and observed the ongoing party through the open windows of the house. The deputies saw several seemingly underage people inside the house and a large quantity of liquor bottles and beer cans.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b65 The party-goers apparently noticed the deputies and their car outside the house. They began rushing around the house, attempting to hide the beverage containers. People also began running out of the house into the darkness. The deputies, still outside the house, demanded to speak to a homeowner. They received no response. The deputies then called dispatch to report their observations and to discuss whether to pursue a telephonic warrant to search the house. The deputies ultimately entered the house without having obtained the warrant. The deputies apprehended between 12 and 15 underage drinkers, including B.A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u00b66 The deputies gathered the underage drinkers outside the house and began issuing minor in possession (MIP) tickets. B.A.M. refused to stand with the other offenders while they received their tickets. B.A.M. instead ran back into the house and said that \u201cif he was going to get a ticket, he was going to be drunk.\u201d The deputies then observed B.A.M. \u201cgrabbing every bottle he could find ... and chugging.\u201d B.A.M. further resisted arrest by reportedly fighting, and injuring, one of the deputies on the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\u00b67 The State initially charged B.A.M. with assault, obstructing a peace officer, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct. The State later added the MIP charge. B.A.M. moved to suppress the evidence on the grounds that the Fergus County deputies had conducted an illegal warrantless search of the Landrau house. B.A.M. argued in relevant part that exigent circumstances did not exist to justify the warrantless search. B.A.M. asserted that absent a valid warrant the State legally could not sustain any of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">\u00b68 The Youth Court denied the motion. The Youth Court determined that exigent circumstances existed to justify the search based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>several facts. The deputies observed the underage drinkers before entering the house. The underage drinkers fled from the house as the deputies approached. The location was remote and the weather was cold. The Youth Court reasoned that the deputies wisely entered the house to apprehend the underage drinkers in order both to preserve evidence and to ensure that the youths did not risk injury by escaping into the cold. The Youth Court concluded that the deputies would have been delayed too long had they waited to obtain a warrant. B.A.M. pleaded \u201ctrue\u201d to all charges, while reserving his right to appeal the evidentiary issue. B.A.M. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>State v. </em>Rookhuizen, 2007 MT 312, \u00b6 6, 340 Mont. 148, \u00b6 6, 172 P.3d 1257, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u00b610 B.A.M. argues principally that exigent circumstances did not exist to justify the deputies\u2019 warrantless entry of the Landrau house. We need not address B.A.M.\u2019s exigent circumstances argument, however, as evidence of the crimes with which the State charged B.A.M. was admissible regardless of whether the deputies had conducted an illegal warrantless search of the Landrau house.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u00b611 Evidence obtained through search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment constitutes \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d that falls under the exclusionary rule. <em>State v. Therriault, </em>2000 MT 286, \u00b6 57, 302 Mont. 189, \u00b6 57, 14 P.3d 444, \u00b6 57. Montana recognizes three exceptions to the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\u201d <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6 58. The evidence will be admissible notwithstanding a Fourth Amendment violation if it is (1) attenuated from the constitutional violation so as to remove its primary taint; (2) obtained from an independent source; or (3) determined to be evidence that inevitably would have been discovered apart from the constitutional violation. <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6 58 (citing <em>State v. New, </em>276 Mont 529, 536, 917 P.2d 919, 923 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u00b612 The State argues that the evidence was sufficiently attenuated from the alleged constitutional violation as to remove its primary taint as B.A.M. committed the charged offenses in response to the deputies\u2019 presence after the deputies had entered the Landrau house. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>relies on <em>Rookhuizen, </em>\u00b6 13, for the proposition that this Court deems admissible evidence of offenses committed in response to conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. <em>Rookhuizen </em>concerned two bail agents\u2019 warrantless entry into the defendant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s house. The defendant responded to the warrantless entry by threatening the bail agents with a gun. <em>Rookhuizen, </em>\u00b6 4. The State charged the defendant with assault. The defendant moved to suppress all evidence obtained after the illegal entry. <em>Rookhuizen, </em>\u00b6 5. This Court relied upon <em>State v. Courville, </em>2002 MT 330, 313 Mont. 218, 61 P.3d 749, and <em>State v. Ottwell, </em>239 Mont. 150, 779 P.2d 500 (1989), in affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of Rookhuizen\u2019s motion to suppress. \u00b613 The Court determined that offenses committed in response to a Fourth Amendment violation constituted \u201can unlawful response regardless of whether the [state actor] had violated [the defendant\u2019s] federal or state constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Rookhuizen, </em>\u00b6 13. The Court reasoned that evidence of criminal conduct committed against an officer in response to an improper search or stop is so attenuated from the claimed improper search or stop that it \u201c los[es] its primary constitutional taint... and that the evidence is, therefore, not subject to the exclusionary rule.\u2019 <em>\u201dRookhuizen, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 25). The Court further noted that failure to exclude such evidence could have the unwanted effect of encouraging violence toward state actors in response to illegal stops and searches. <em>Rookhuizen, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b614 Similar circumstances existed in <em>Courville, </em>where the defendant assaulted and severely injured a police officer who allegedly had stopped the defendant illegally. <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 12. The defendant moved to suppress evidence of the assault and related crimes on the grounds that the officer had lacked particularized suspicion for the stop. <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 12. The Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress as \u201cthe exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence of criminal conduct committed in response to a claimed Fourth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b615 The Court reached the same conclusion in <em>Ottwell. </em>Two state officers entered the defendant\u2019s motel room without a warrant. The defendant threatened the officers with a handgun and escaped out the window. <em>Ottwell, </em>239 Mont. at 153, 779 P.2d at 502. The Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress evidence of the defendant\u2019s independent criminal conduct that occurred in response to the unconstitutional search and seizure. <em>Ottwell, </em>239 Mont. at 154, 779 P.2d at 502. The Court determined that \u201c[s]uch evidence does not constitute the \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 and thus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>purpose of the exclusionary rule-to protect a person from unreasonable searches or seizures through suppression of evidence-would not be accomplished by its application in such a situation.\u201d <em>Ottwell, </em>239 Mont. at 154, 779 P.2d at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b616 The criminal conduct with which the State charged B.A.M.-he assault, obstructing a peace officer, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, and the MIP-likewise constituted criminal conduct committed in response to an alleged Fourth Amendment violation. <em>Rookehuizen, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Ottwell, </em>239 Mont. at 153, 779 P.2d at 502. The charged offenses occurred in the deputies\u2019 presence after, and in response to, the deputies\u2019 alleged illegal entry into the Landrau house. B.A.M. also committed illegal violent acts against state actors when he resisted arrest and assaulted a deputy, like the defendants in <em>Rookhuizen, Courville, </em>and <em>Ottwell. Rookehuizen, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Ottwell, </em>239 Mont. at 153, 779 P.2d at 502. The evidence of B.A.M.\u2019s criminal conduct committed against the deputies was \u201c \u2018so attenuated from the claimed [Fourth Amendment violation] that the evidence of his conduct lost its primary constitutional taint\u2019 \u201d in light of the fact those crimes occurred after the alleged Fourth Amendment violation. <em>Rookhuizen, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 25). The evidence of those crimes is not subject to the exclusionary rule. <em>Rookehuizen, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Ottwell, </em>239 Mont. at 154, 779 P.2d at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b617 B.A.M. attempts to <em>distinguish Rookhuizen, Courville, </em>and <em>Ottwell </em>on the grounds that the record fails to reveal the exact nature of B.A.M.\u2019s violent conduct after contact with the deputies. The State\u2019s amended petition for youth hearing and a minute entry created for the hearing in which B.A.M. pleaded true to all the charges against him constitute the only records of B.A.M.\u2019s assault. Both documents fail to describe the conduct underlying this charge. B.A.M. argues that the lack of specificity in the record regarding his violent conduct precludes the court from analogizing to <em>Rookhuizen, Courville, </em>and <em>Ottwell </em>as those decisions described the post-arrest violence in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b618 B.A.M. fails to cite any authority for this proposition. B.A.M. also does not dispute that he committed violence toward a state actor. He seems to assert that the nature of a defendant\u2019s violent conduct ought to be known in order to apply the rule. B.A.M. fails to explain, however, why the nature of his violent conduct against the state actor should bear any significance in our application of the rule that offenses committed in response to a Fourth Amendment violation are not covered by the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u00b619 This Court has not distinguished the nature of the violent crime for purposes of this rule. The defendants in <em>Ottwell </em>and <em>Rookehuizen </em>threatened state actors with guns, but did not cause physical injury. <em>Ottwell, </em>239 Mont. at 153, 779 P.2d at 502; <em>Rookhuizen, </em>\u00b6 4. The defendant in <em>Courville </em>punched and pistol whipped the state actor to the extent of breaking the state actor\u2019s nose and causing loss of vision in one eye. <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11. The Court affirmed that all of this conduct constituted criminal conduct sufficient to invoke the exception. <em>Rookehuizen, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Ottwell, </em>239 Mont. at 154, 779 P.2d at 502. The nature of the criminal conduct played no role in the Court\u2019s analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b620 B.A.M.\u2019s suggestion that the degree or nature of the violent conduct ought to play a role in this rule defeats the policies that undergird the rule. The Court in <em>Courville </em>explained that excluding evidence of a defendant\u2019s criminal conduct in response to a Fourth Amendment violation \u201cwould simply encourage violence towards law enforcement officers attempting to do their duties in the field.\u201d <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 24. To distinguish between degrees of violence perpetrated toward state actors in these circumstances would encourage certain kinds of violence, but not others. We read this policy as discouraging all violence against state actors.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b621 B.A.M. also asserts that testimony relating to B.A.M.\u2019s running back into the house to chug alcohol represents the only detailed evidence of B.A.M.\u2019s criminal conduct. B.A.M. contends that this evidence is insufficient to invoke this Court\u2019s rule. B.A.M correctly points out that <em>Rookhuizen, Courville, </em>and <em>Ottwell </em>involved violent crimes. B.A.M. argues that the exclusionary rule must apply to nonviolent offenses committed in response to a Fourth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b622 Evidence is admissible notwithstanding a Fourth Amendment violation when it is obtained from an independent source. <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6 58. The independent source doctrine typically arises in more complex circumstances than these. This Court determined in <em>State v. Dasen, </em>2007 MT 87, \u00b6\u00b6 18-22, 337 Mont. 74, \u00b6\u00b6 18-22, 155 P.3d 1282, \u00b6\u00b6 18-22, that evidence could be admitted under the independent source doctrine when a second lawful warrant obtained evidence after a first warrant had violated the Fourth Amendment. The Court in <em>Therriault </em>concluded that evidence could be admitted under the independent source doctrine after an officer illegally had searched the defendant\u2019s house twice, in light of the fact that the officer had received the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>incriminating evidence that he obtained in the illegal search independently from the defendant\u2019s sister. <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 61-64.</p>\n<p id=\"ApC\">\u00b623  Much simpler facts exist here. The deputies allegedly conducted an illegal warrantless search of the Landrau house that resulted in B.A.M. receiving an MIP. B.A.M. provided the deputies with an independent source for evidence of the MIP, however, when he began defiantly chugging alcohol in the deputies\u2019 presence after their alleged illegal entry. B.A.M. certainly could have argued that evidence of his MIP should be excluded had he ceased engaging in illegal activity after the warrantless entry. B.A.M.\u2019s decision to commence anew that same criminal conduct after the illegal entry and in the deputies\u2019 presence, however, constitutes an independent source that excludes the evidence from the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\u201d <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"ARa\">\u00b624  The Youth Court\u2019s denial of B.A.M.\u2019s motion to suppress did not constitute clear error despite the fact that the court reached this conclusion on different grounds. <em>Rookhuizen, </em>\u00b6 6. We will affirm a trial court when it reaches the correct result even if for the wrong reason. <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 19. The parties sufficiently developed the factual record below to account for the separate theory upon which we base our conclusion even though neither the parties, nor the Youth Court, contemplated this theory.
