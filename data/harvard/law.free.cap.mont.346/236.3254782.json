Peijessy, DDS, and denying Pesarik\u2019s motion for enlargement of time. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u00b62 Pesarik presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court correctly determined that it lacked authority to grant Pesarik\u2019s motion for enlargement of time to serve process upon Peijessy.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court properly concluded that Pesarik had failed to establish excusable neglect to warrant an extension of time to serve process upon Peijessy.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">\u00b65 Pesarik filed a complaint against Peijessy on May 27, 2004, in which she alleged medical malpractice arising from several dental procedures. The District Court issued a summons the same day. Pesarik did not serve the summons or otherwise prosecute the case. Pesarik\u2019s counsel sent her a letter on March 31, 2006, informing her that he no longer would represent her in the matter. The letter advised Pesarik that the summons and complaint must be served upon Peijessy within three years of filing pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 4E. The letter urged her to obtain substitute counsel immediately. Pesarik alleges that she never received the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">\u00b66 Pesarik instead asserts that her original counsel notified her orally sometime during the spring or summer of2006 that he no longer would represent her. Pesarik further claims that she did not know when this change would occur, and, therefore, did not act immediately upon the information. Pesarik obtained substitute counsel by October 2006. Pesarik\u2019s new counsel discovered that her original client file did not include the summons issued on May 27, 2004. Pesarik did not immediately request a second summons from the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">\u00b67 Pesarik instead prepared a settlement proposal that she submitted to Peijessy in March 2007. Peijessy acknowledged receipt of the proposal on March 29, 2007. Pesarik did not request a second summons until May 22, 2007. The District Court issued the second summons on May 24, 2007. Pesarik attempted personal service upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Peijessy through the sheriffs office that same day, the Thursday before Memorial Day, but Peijessy had left town on vacation. Pesarik was not able to serve Perjessy until Wednesday, May 30, 2007. The three-year window authorized by Rule 4E for service of the summons and complaint upon Peijessy expired on May 27, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b68 Peijessy moved to dismiss on the grounds that Pesarik had failed to accomplish service upon Peijessy within three years of the date on which she originally had filed the complaint. Pesarik moved to enlarge the time for service upon Peijessy pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 6(b). The District Court granted Perjessy\u2019s motion to dismiss and denied Pesarik\u2019s motion for enlargement of time. The court first determined that it lacked authority to grant Pesarik an enlarged time to serve the summons upon Peijessy. The court next determined that even if the Rules of Civil Procedure granted it such authority, Pesarik had failed to prove excusable neglect to warrant an enlargement of time. Pesarik appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b69 We review de novo a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Tungsten Holdings, Inc. v Kimberlin, </em>2000 MT 24, \u00b6 8, 298 Mont. 176, \u00b6 8, 994 P.2d 1114, \u00b6 8. We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an enlargement of time pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 6(b). <em>In re Marriage of Weber, </em>2004 MT 206, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23, 322 Mont. 324, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23, 95 P.3d 694, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court correctly determined that it lacked authority to grant Pesarik\u2019s motion for enlargement of time to serve process upon Perjessy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">\u00b611 The District Court based its conclusion that it lacked the authority to enlarge the three-year time limit set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 4E upon this Court\u2019s interpretation of former M. R. Civ. P. 41(e). Rule 41(e) governed the time limit for service of process for actions filed before January 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">\u00b612 The District Court cited <em>Otto v. Montana Dept. of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks, </em>2000 MT 333, \u00b6 20, 303 Mont. 86, \u00b6 20, 15 P.3d 402, \u00b6 20, in which this Court determined that the courts lacked authority to enlarge the time period in which a plaintiff must serve a summons. The court noted that Rule 41(e) provided that \u201cthe summons \u2018must\u2019 be issued within one year of the suit.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>declined to create an excusable neglect exception based upon its conclusion that the plain language of Rule 41(e) rendered the time limit mandatory. <em>Otto, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Janow v. Conoco Pipe Line Co., </em>2000 MT 242, \u00b6 15, 301 Mont. 402, \u00b6 15, 10 P.3d 79, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b613 The District Court analogized <em>Otto\u2019s </em>interpretation of former Rule 41(e) to its interpretation of Rule 4E, the current Rule governing the time limit for service of process. Rule 4E provides that \u201c[a] plaintiff <em>shall </em>have 3 years after filing a complaint to have a summons issued and accomplish service.\u201d (Emphasis added). The District Court determined that Rule 4E contained language at least as clear and as unambiguous as that of former Rule 41(e). The court concluded that, as in <em>Otto, </em>Rule 4E\u2019s plain language constituted a mandate that did not allow an excusable neglect exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b614 Pesarik argues that the District Court incorrectly analogized former Rule 41(e) to current Rule 4E. Pesarik points to M. R. Civ. P. 6(b). Rule 6(b) provides a district court with discretion to enlarge for cause a time limit set forth under the Rules of Civil Procedure. Specifically, the district court may grant an enlargement of time after the expiration of the time period \u201cwhere the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.\u201d M. R. Civ. <em>P. </em>6(b)(2). The rule explicitly prohibits district courts from enlarging the time, however, for taking any action under Rules 50(b) and (c)(2), 52(b), 59(b), (d), (e) and (g), and 60(b). M. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b615 Peijessy argues that the District Court properly analogized Rule 41(e) to Rule 4E in light of the rules\u2019 similar construction. Rule 41(e) provides that a plaintiff <em>\u201cmust\u201d </em>serve the summons and complaint within the specified time period. Rule 4E provides that a plaintiff <em>\u201cshall\u201d </em>serve the summons and complaint within the specified time period. Peijessy asserts that the reasoning of <em>Otto </em>dictates that Rule 4E\u2019s time limit also must be mandatory and not subject to enlargement upon a showing of excusable neglect. Perjessy further contends, citing <em>Haugen v. Blaine Bank of Montana, </em>279 Mont. 1, 6, 926 P.2d 1364, 1367 (1996), that the District Court\u2019s strict interpretation of Rule 4E\u2019s time limit prevents prejudice to the defendant and bolsters the Rule\u2019s purpose of promoting \u201cthe diligent prosecution of claims once suit is filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b616 Peijessy fails to reconcile, however, the apparent conflict between the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the plain language of Rule 4E and the plain language of Rule 6(b). Rule 6(b)(2) specifically provides for an enlargement of time for any time-limited action under the Rules of Civil Procedure except those explicitly prohibited, including M. R. Civ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>P. 50(b) and (c)(2), 52(b), 59(b), (d), (e) and (g), and 60(b). Nothing in Rule 6(b)(2) explicitly prohibits district courts from enlarging the time for taking any action under Rule 4E. We interpret the expression of one thing in a statute to imply the exclusion of another under the canon <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius. E.g. Dukes v. City of Missoula, </em>2005 MT 196, \u00b6 15, 328 Mont. 155, \u00b6 15, 119 P.3d 61, \u00b615 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b617 Moreover, this Court will harmonize two statutes relating to the same subject in order to give effect to both. <em>Yellowstone Federal Credit Union v. Daniels, </em>2008 MT 111, \u00b6 18, 342 Mont. 451, \u00b6 18, 181 P.3d 595, \u00b6 18. Rule 4E provides for a limited time action. Rule 6(b)(2) authorizes an enlargement of time for any rule for excusable neglect except those specifically prohibited. The two statutes cannot be in harmony if we interpret Rule 4E\u2019s use of \u201cshall\u201d to constitute mandatory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b618 Federal courts interpreting identical Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(2) have concluded, as we do, that the rule authorizes courts to enlarge time for service of process upon a showing of excusable neglect. <em>E.g. Dominic v. Hess Oil V.I. Corp., </em>841 F.2d 513, 517 (3rd Cir. 1988); <em>In re Teligent Services, Inc., </em>324 B.R. 467, 472 (Bkrtcy. S.D.N.Y. 2005). Perjessy argues, however, that we cannot analogize the federal rules to the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure in light of the fact that the federal service of process provision, Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), includes a \u201cgood cause\u201d exception to the time limit for service of process. Rule M. R. Civ. P. 4E includes no such exception. The federal rule\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d exception has no relevance here, however, as we have not analyzed a district court\u2019s authority to enlarge the time period for service of process based upon a general good cause standard. We instead have analyzed the district court\u2019s authority based upon the explicit grant contained in M. R. Civ. P. 6(b) that provides for enlargement of time based upon \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b619 Our decisions interpreting Rule 41(e) have limited relevance here as they interpret a now abolished rule, and, also, because they fail to construe that rule in the context of Rule 6(b). <em>See Otto; Janow. </em>Rules 4E and 6(b) only harmonize if we construe Rule 6(b) as creating an explicit grant of authority to the district courts to enlarge the time for service of process upon a showing of excusable negligence. <em>Yellowstone, </em>\u00b6 18. The District Court incorrectly determined that it lacked authority to grant a motion for enlargement of time to serve process pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 4E and 6(b). <em>Tungsten Holdings, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u00b620 <em>Whether the District Court properly concluded that Pesarik had failed to establish excusable neglect to warrant an extension of time to serve process upon Perjessy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b621  Pesarik argues that she sufficiently demonstrated that excusable neglect warranted an extension of time to serve process upon Perjessy. Pesarik urges us to determine excusable neglect based upon the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of excusable neglect pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(2). The federal courts equate excusable neglect under Rule 6(b)(2) with a showing of good cause. <em>E.g. MCI Telecoms. Corp. v. Teleconcepts, Inc., </em>71 F.3d 1086, 1097 (3rd Cir. 1995). A body of federal law exists that defines good cause for purposes of enlarging time for service of process. <em>See MCI Telecoms. Corp., </em>71 F.3d at 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"AOY\">\u00b622  Perjessy correctly points out, however, that a separate body of law exists in Montana that defines excusable neglect differently than the federal courts, and separately from a good cause standard. We analyze excusable negligence under a more stringent standard than good cause. <em>Matthews v. Don K. Chevrolet, </em>2005 MT 164, \u00b6 11, 327 Mont. 456, \u00b6 11, 115 P.3d 201, \u00b6 11. A showing of excusable neglect generally requires justification for error beyond mere carelessness or ignorance of the law. <em>Empire Lath &amp; Plaster, Inc. v. American Casualty Co., </em>256 Mont. 413, 417, 847 P.2d 276, 278 (1993). Neglect that is \u201cdue to forgetfulness and the press of other, more important business is not sufficient to establish excusable neglect.\u201d <em>Foster Apiaries, Inc. v. Hubbard Apiaries, Inc., </em>193 Mont. 156, 161, 630 P.2d 1213, 1216 (1981). A party\u2019s busy schedule or inattentiveness to the matter does not constitute excusable neglect. <em>Matthews v. Don K. Chevrolet, </em>2005 MT 164, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15, 327 Mont. 456, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15, 115 P.3d 201, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15. Lack of knowledge of a clear rule of civil procedure similarly does not constitute excusable neglect that would justify relief from the rule. <em>Sadwosky v. City of Glendive, </em>259 Mont. 419, 423, 856 P.2d 556, 559 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b623 The District Court based its conclusion that Pesarik failed to establish excusable neglect on several factors. Pesarik had been aware that her former counsel no longer represented her since the spring or summer of 2006, at the latest. Pesarik obtained substitute counsel many months before the three-year time period expired. Pesarik\u2019s substitute counsel chose to prepare a settlement proposal before he asked the District Court to issue a second summons to replace the lost original.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b624 Pesarik counters that the District Court improperly ignored several facts that demonstrated excusable neglect. Pesarik points to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>her several attempts to serve Peijessy during late May 2007. Pesarik also emphasizes Peijessy\u2019s unavailability during that period. Pesarik further asserts that late service did not prejudice Peijessy as she missed the deadline by a matter of days. Pesarik does not explain, however, why she waited nearly seven months after obtaining substitute counsel before attempting service. She does not assert any justification that demonstrates that her neglect arose from something beyond mere carelessness. <em>Empire Lath &amp; Plaster, </em>256 Mont. at 417, 847 P.2d at 278. Pesarik does not assert that anything more than the press of business or forgetfulness justified the seven month delay. <em>Foster Apiaries, </em>193 Mont. at 161, 630 P.2d at 1216. Pesarik argues on appeal, in fact, that her focus on the settlement proposal factored into the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b625 Pesarik further argues that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that she failed to demonstrate excusable neglect amounts to a determination that excusable neglect cannot exist where a party could have accomplished timely service. Pesarik contends that this interpretation would preclude a showing that excusable neglect warranted an enlargement of time to serve process pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(2). On the contrary, the District Court determined that Pesarik had failed to show specific factors based upon Montana decisional law that would demonstrate the existence of excusable neglect. <em>Foster Apiaries, </em>193 Mont. at 161, 630 P.2d at 1216; <em>Empire Lath &amp; Plaster, </em>256 Mont. at 417, 847 P.2d at 278; <em>Sadwosky, </em>259 Mont. at 423, 856 P.2d at 559; <em>Matthews, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-15. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Pesarik\u2019s motion for enlargement of time. <em>In re Weber, </em>\u00b6 \u00b6 21, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b626 We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Pesarik\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b278-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AW_\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u00b627 While I agree with the Court\u2019s decision to affirm the District Court, I would do so on the basis that M. R. Civ. P. 4E does not allow a District Court the discretion to enlarge the time period for service of process, regardless of whether excusable neglect is shown. I would not reach Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">\u00b628 In my view, the District Court properly relied on our previous case law construing former M .R. Civ. P. 41(e) in reaching its conclusion. The language of Rule 4E is clear and unambiguous, providing that \u201c[a] plaintiff shall have 3 years after filing a complaint to have a summons issued and accomplish service.\u201d The language of Rule 41(e) was equally clear, stating that all actions \u201cshall be dismissed by the court... unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>summons issued within one year shall have been served and filed with the clerk of the court within three years after the commencement of said action.\u201d There is no substantive difference between the time period required for service under Rule 4E and former Rule 41(e), or with the mandatory language requiring service of the summons. I therefore believe the District Court was correct to rely on our case law which clearly prohibited enlargement of the time period for service of process under former Rule 41(e). <em>See Otto, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Janow, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Sinclair v. Big Bud Mfg. Co., </em>262 Mont. 363, 367, 865 P.2d 264, 266-67 (1993). Neither rule provided discretion to enlarge the three-year time period for purposes of \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b629 The Rules of Civil Procedure are meant to be construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action. <em>Larango v. Lovely, </em>196 Mont. 43, 47, 637 P.2d 517, 519 (1981) (citing M. R. Civ. P. 1).Permitting a plaintiff to seek relief from the three-year time period set forth in Rule 4E for service of process \u201cis prejudicial to the defendant and defeats the purpose of the Rule which is to promote the diligent prosecution of claims once suit is filed.\u201d <em>Haugen v. Blaine Bank of Mont., </em>279 Mont. 1, 6, 926 P.2d 1364, 1367 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b630 The Advisory Commission on Rules could have recommended an exception to the time rule, and this Court could have adopted one. Neither did. Instead of honoring that process and our case law, the Court reads an excusable neglect exception into Rule 4E by linking Rule 4E to Rule 6(b). However, Rule 6(b) existed when this Court interpreted the \u201cplain language\u201d of Rule 41(e), likewise not referenced by Rule 6(b), to contain mandatory limits on the time for service of process. We adhered to this holding unequivocally, repeatedly and expressly declining to create an excusable neglect exception to the time limits for service of process under Rule 41(e). <em>Otto, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Janow, </em>\u00b6 15. The Court offers no reason why our case law on this identical question should not be honored, nor any reason why the process of adopting Rule 4E should not be honored.</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE NELSON join the concurrence of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
