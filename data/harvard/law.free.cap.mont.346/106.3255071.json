We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by revoking Price\u2019s suspended sentence upon its finding that Price did not suffer from a mental illness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">2. Did the District Court err by failing to consider alternatives to incarceration?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">\u00b63 On November 21, 2000, the State charged Price, by Information, with one felony count of custodial interference, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-304, MCA. Price filed motions to dismiss the charge, which were denied. The parties entered into a plea agreement on May 17, 2001, whereby Price withdrew his not guilty plea and entered a guilty plea to the charge, and reserved his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motions. The District Court sentenced Price to a three year deferred sentence and imposed various probationary conditions. The facts surrounding Price\u2019s custodial interference charge were detailed by this Court in <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 229, 311 Mont. 439, 57 P.3d 42 <em>{\u201cPrice I\"), </em>in which we affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">\u00b64 While Price\u2019s first appeal was pending, Price was apprehended for alleged violations of probation conditions. The first occurred on October 3,2001, at Price\u2019s place of employment. The incident involved a twelve year old girl who needed to use the store\u2019s restroom. Price was asked to unlock the restroom door for her. Price allegedly asked the girl several times if she was sure she did not want to use the boy\u2019s restroom, and when he finally unlocked the girl\u2019s restroom, he would not remove his hand from the doorknob. The girl felt uncomfortable and refused to go into the restroom. She then became afraid of Price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>when he asked her about a birthmark on her shoulder. The second alleged violation arose from an incident occurring on March 27, 2002, at the University of Montana campus. Price assaulted an elderly employee of the University\u2019s library by stepping on the man\u2019s heels and calling him a \u201cbitch.\u201d Price was charged with misdemeanor assault for this incident, although the charges were later dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b65 Based on these two incidents, the State filed a petition to revoke Price\u2019s probation on April 5, 2002. Price admitted to the second violation and the District Court dismissed the first violation on the State\u2019s motion. The Court then revoked Price\u2019s deferred sentence and sentenced him to ten years at the Montana State Prison with five years suspended. A year later, Price filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea to the custodial interference charge, which the District Court denied on March 19, 2004. Price appealed and this Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of Price\u2019s motion in <em>State v. Price, </em>2005 MT 79N, 110 P.3d 1057 (Table), 2005 WL 705222 <em>(\u201cPrice II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b66 On January 2, 2006, Price was granted a prison furlough to Bozeman, Montana, and then paroled to the supervision of the Bozeman Intensive Supervision Program. Three months later, the Missoula County Attorney filed a petition to revoke Price\u2019s sentence, alleging three violations of probationary conditions. In support, the State offered a letter which Price had written in January 2005 to the Montana Judicial Standards Commission regarding the Honorable C.B. McNeil, the District Judge who had presided over the Lake County custody dispute which had ultimately led to the custodial interference charge against Price. The letter alleged that Judge McNeil had engaged in misconduct and expressed various hostile sentiments against Judge McNeil, including a request for his violent death.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b67 The State further provided a February 8, 2005 letter Price had written to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel regarding Missoula Deputy County Attorney Kirsten LaCroix. Deputy County Attorney LaCroix prosecuted Price on the custodial interference charge. Price made numerous statements of a violent and sexual nature regarding LaCroix.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b68 The primary basis for the State\u2019s petition to revoke was an incident at the Montana State University campus in Bozeman. On March 23, 2006, Price went to the MSU office of where Jodee Palin worked and told her that he wanted to volunteer for a Shakespeare in the Park program. She informed him that he would need to come back the next day because the responsible person was away from the office. Price returned the following day but Palin informed him that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>responsible person was still away from the office and that he would need to come back the following Monday. Price left but then returned a half an hour later. He gave Palin a book entitled \u201cNew Beginnings\u201d with a ribbon and a \u201cBlow Pop\u201d attached, as well as a card with the following inscription:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">Bon Jour [sic]-Hear [sic] you go-a catalyst you may need to boost you out of your \u201crut.\u201d A bright new day, a renessaince [sic], sparkling genesis to throw out old things from the wardrobe of your soul and replenish said wardrobe with shiny fresh things that go boom, click-clack &amp; shoot out sparks when you dare touch them. A new life is just what you need-dirrobing [sic] of the same old chryasilis [sic] (cocoon). This you are worthy and deserving of-start now-sil vov plait [sic]. Your, ami, R.P.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b69 Palin testified that Price then sat down in one of her office chairs and began reading the paper and eating food he had brought with him. Price told her that she needed a new beginning and that she should leave everything and start over. She replied that she was happy with her family. Price then walked behind her chair, trapping her between her chair and her desk, and began touching and smelling her hair and rubbing her neck. Palin told Price to stop and that he was scaring her, but Price continued. Price grabbed Palin\u2019s wedding ring and told her that she would be more comfortable if she took it off. At this point, a co-worker entered Palin\u2019s office and Palin was able to escape. As she was leaving, Palin noticed that the word \u201cRape\u201d had been written on a dry erase board outside of her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b610 Palin contacted MSU Police, who investigated the incident and arrested Price outside of his apartment. In an interview with police, Price admitted to the physical contact with Palin and told the officer \u201cI wanted to make a fool of myself.\u201d Price also stated that he wanted to see how Palin reacted in order to gauge how loyal she was to her husband, that he believed Palin was lonely, and that she needed him to help her \u201cget out of a rut.\u201d MSU Police cited Price for assault, but the charge was later dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b611 As a result of the petition to revoke, Price was transported back to Missoula and referred for a mental health evaluation. Price filed a motion to dismiss the State\u2019s petition to revoke on October 2, 2006, arguing that the letters submitted to the Judicial Standards Commission and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel were not grounds for revocation of Price\u2019s probation, and that the incident with Palin could not serve as a basis to revoke Price\u2019s probation because the assault charge had been dismissed. The District Court denied Price\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b612 On November 6, 2006, Price advised the District Court that he planned to raise the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. The court conducted a hearing over various days in which it received testimony from Palin, MSU Police Sergeant James Sletten, and therapists Dana Miquelle and Dr. Lynn Johnson, who testified regarding Price\u2019s mental condition. Previous psychological assessments of Price were also admitted. The court found that Price did not suffer from a mental disease or defect and sentenced him to five years at Montana State Prison. The court stated that the reason for this sentence was \u201c[b]y Defendant\u2019s own actions he has shown that he wants to intimidate people and have them believe he is a violent offender.\u201d The court specifically found that \u201cthe Defendant is able to control his conduct but, at times, he openly decides not to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law\u201d and \u201c[t]he Defendant\u2019s conduct poses a risk to any community wherein he resides.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"AdI\">\u00b613  \u201cThe standard for revocation of probation is whether the judge is reasonably satisfied that the conduct of the probationer has not been what he agreed it would be if he were given liberty.\u201d <em>State v. Boulton, </em>2006 MT 170, \u00b6 10, 332 Mont. 538, \u00b6 10, 140 P.3d 482, \u00b6 10 (internal quotation marks omitted). The standard of review of a district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s suspended sentence is \u201cto determine whether the court abused its discretion and whether the court\u2019s decision was supported by a preponderance of the evidence in favor of the State.\u201d <em>State v. Shockley, </em>2001 MT 180, \u00b6 8, 306 Mont. 196, \u00b6 8, 31 P.3d 350, \u00b6 8. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>2008 MT 27, \u00b6 15, 341 Mont. 240, \u00b6 15, 177 P.3d 444, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u00b614 <em>Issue One. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by revoking Price\u2019s suspended sentence upon its finding that Price did not suffer from a mental illness?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">\u00b615 Price argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it found that Price did not suffer from a mental illness and revoked his sentence. While Price recognizes our holding in <em>Boulton </em>that \u00a7\u00a7 46-14-311 and -312, MCA, the statutes governing consideration of mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>disease or defect in sentencing, do not apply in revocation proceedings, he notes that a district court may nonetheless take the fact that a probationer suffers from a mental illness into consideration during the revocation proceeding. <em>See Boulton, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b616 In support of his argument that the District Court erred when it found that he did not have a mental illness, Price references the testimony of Dana Miquelle and Dr. Lynn Johnson at the March 9, 2007 hearing. Miquelle testified that he did an assessment of Price and opined that Price suffered from a psychotic delusional illness. Miquelle stated that Price was socially awkward and lacking in social skills. Miquelle also stated that it would be fair to say that Price did not know right from wrong. However, on cross examination, Miquelle was asked about Price\u2019s confrontational tone during the assessment process, at which point the following exchange between the prosecutor and Miquelle occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">Q. That would indicate to me that he knew darn well that he was saying something that was critical and demeaning, knew what the difference between right and wrong, and wanted to test your reaction to him, in terms of doing that. Would you agree?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">A. I would agree with that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Miquelle went on to testify that psychotic delusions are episodic in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u00b617 Dr. Lynn Johnson testified regarding two evaluations he did of Price in 2005 while Price was still in custody. Dr. Johnson stated that he evaluated Price in light of the letters he had sent regarding Judge McNeil and Prosecutor LaCroix. Dr. Johnson diagnosed Price with a schizotypal personality disorder, which he explained \u201cconsists of odd interests, rather seclusive, and avoidant personality traits, momentary lapses in good judgment, and even good reality testing, a tendency to become somewhat grandiose, and have difficulty, occasionally, intermittently, making good sense of reality.\u201d Dr. Johnson noted that although Price\u2019s letters appeared violent in nature, no violence was actually intended by Price. Dr. Johnson also testified that Price misinterpreted social cues and that the incident with Ms. Palin was consistent with Price\u2019s history of poor judgment. Dr. Johnson further stated that he considered a diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s disorder for Price, but that he had not had sufficient time to pursue that diagnosis in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">\u00b618 Psychological assessments of Price in November 2001 and November 2002 were also received by the court. The November 2001 assessment by Sandy Heaton, LCPC, explained that Price had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>evaluated the year earlier by Dr. Robert Shea, who had opined that while Price was \u201cpersonality disordered,\u201d he did not suffer from a mental disease or defect. Heaton\u2019s November 2001 assessment reached the same conclusion, noting that Price did not appear to be mentally ill. Heaton also concurred with Dr. Shea\u2019s diagnosis of \u201cMixed Personality Disorder NOS with antisocial, narcissistic and borderline traits.\u201d The 2002 assessment, conducted by Dr. William D. Stratford, likewise found that Price was personality disordered but concluded that there was not \u201cany indication that he suffers from a psychosis ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AvX\">\u00b619  A review of the record illustrates that the District Court\u2019s finding that Price did not suffer from a mental illness was supported by the evidence. Further, the District Court\u2019s statement that, by his own actions, Price had shown that he wanted to intimidate people and have them believe that he was violent was likewise supported by the record. This inference was permissibly drawn from various incidents, including the letters he wrote about Judge McNeil and Prosecutor LaCroix, his misdemeanors assaults and his statements about these events, as well as conclusions reached in several previous psychological assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b620 We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Price\u2019s suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b621 Issue Two. <em>Did the District Court err by failing to consider alternatives to incarceration?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b622 Price briefly argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to consider alternatives to incarceration that would further the purposes of Price\u2019s suspended sentence, thereby violating due process, and cites to <em>State v. </em>Lee, 2001 MT 176, 306 Mont. 173, 31 P.3d 998, in support of his argument. In <em>Lee, </em>the defendant was required to complete the prison\u2019s sex offender program while incarcerated as a condition of his pending suspended sentence. <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 12. Due to circumstances beyond Lee\u2019s control, he was unable to complete the sex offender treatment program by the time of his scheduled release date and the State filed a petition to revoke his suspended sentence. <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The District Court granted the State\u2019s petition to revoke and Lee appealed on the ground that revocation of his suspended sentence violated due process. <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 7. We held that, under the circumstances, due process required the trial court to consider whether there were adequate alternatives to incarceration that would further the purpose of Lee\u2019s suspended sentence, and that this was especially true when \u201cLee\u2019s failure to complete sex offender treatment as required by the terms of his sentence was due not to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>willful conduct, but rather was due to the actions of the State.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b623 The State responds by arguing that the District Court had no reasonable alternatives to incarceration that would adequately protect the community. The State distinguishes Price\u2019s case fromLee by noting that while Lee\u2019s failure to satisfy the conditions of his suspended sentence was due to the actions of the State, the State played no role in Price\u2019s violation of the conditions of his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AIN4\">\u00b624  We agree that Lee is inapposite under the facts here. Further, the District Court necessarily considered alternatives to incarceration by concluding that Price posed <em>\u201ca </em>risk to any community wherein he resides.\u201d Price had committed disturbing acts against others in multiple communities. Accordingly, the court concluded that the only option was to incarcerate Price. The statutes governing the revocation process permit a district court to conclude \u201cby virtue of subsequent criminal conduct or evidence that the defendant\u2019s behavior was not in compliance with the rules and objectives of his probation,\u201d and that the purposes of probation are best served by incarceration. <em>Boulton, </em>\u00b6 15 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The District Court\u2019s recognition of the risks of Price\u2019s presence in a community and decision to incarcerate him fell well within this discretion and did not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
