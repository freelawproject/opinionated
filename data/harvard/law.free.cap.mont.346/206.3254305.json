We reverse in part, but ultimately affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-20\">\u00b62 We address two dispositive issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-21\">\u00b63 1. Is the Board of Medical Examiners entitled to quasi-judicial immunity for its actions in granting a medical license to a physician who was subject to disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct in other states?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-22\">\u00b64 2. Did the State owe a duty of care to Emil J. Nelson?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b65 In October of 1995, Dr. Thomas Stephenson (Stephenson) applied for a medical license to the Board of Medical Examiners (Board), which at the time was overseen by the Montana Department of Commerce. After 20 years of practice as a cosmetic surgeon in California, Stephenson sought to practice general medicine in Montana. Stephenson\u2019s application showed he graduated from medical school in 1962, and had obtained medical licenses in California and Florida. Materials submitted with the application disclosed that in 1994, Stephenson\u2019s California medical license had been revoked, but that the revocation was stayed pending Stephenson\u2019s successful completion of 10 years probation with conditions, including 120 days suspension and a ban against practicing cosmetic surgery during probation. The disciplinary action resulted from Stephenson\u2019s unprofessional conduct in violation of the California Business and Professions Code. His application stated he violated Business and Professions Code \u00a7 651, false claims in advertising; \u00a7 810, fraudulent insurance claims; \u00a7 2234(a), treatment of patients; \u00a7 2234(b), gross negligence in treating patients; \u00a7 2234(c), repeated negligence in treating patients; \u00a7 2234(e), dishonesty and corruption in treatment of patients; \u00a7 2234(f), engaging in conduct which would have warranted the denial of a license because of his treatment of patients; and \u00a7 2261, signing medical documents containing false facts. With regard to the California revocation, Stephenson\u2019s application materials also revealed alcohol abuse and Demerol addiction, 11 malpractice suits, bankruptcy, and a history of poor and illegible medical records. In addition, his Florida license was suspended for failure to notify the Florida medical board of the actions taken against his license in California. The application also indicated Stephenson had taken a recent medical refresher course in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b66 The Board requested additional information and determined Stephenson should appear before it for a personal interview. During the interview, the Board questioned him about the disciplinary action in California and his plans for practice in Montana. As a result of that meeting, the Board tabled the application and requested more information from the Fort Belknap Indian Health Hospital in Montana, where Stephenson had worked for several months. At some point during the process, the Board contacted Stephenson\u2019s California probation officer with regard to the reported Demerol addiction. The probation officer apparently stated she was new and not aware of a Demerol problem. The record reflects no further inquiry about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Demerol. The Board contacted three doctors Stephenson listed as references, but did not contact persons involved with the California medical board decisions, the malpractice suits, or the physicians involved in his refresher course in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b67 The Board held a second personal interview with Stephenson in July of 1996, during which it voted to issue Stephenson a temporary license for one year based on several conditions. The Board informed Stephenson that if he did not accept the conditions, it would give him notice of a proposed denial of a license and the opportunity to contest the denial in a formal hearing. Stephenson accepted the conditions, and the Board issued Stephenson a temporary license. Upon Stephenson\u2019s request, the Board modified various conditions of the temporary license in May and July of 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b68 The Board extended Stephenson\u2019s temporary license subj ect to the imposed conditions in November of 1997 and again in March of 1998, to allow time to complete a peer review prior to addressing whether to grant Stephenson a permanent license. In January of 1999, the Board granted Stephenson a full, unrestricted, permanent license to practice medicine in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b69 In November of 1999, Stephenson conducted a routine physical examination of Emil J. Nelson (Jack). Upon examining Jack\u2019s abdomen, Stephenson noted Jack possibly had an abdominal aneurysm. He stated in the medical chart that Jack would present the following week for an x-ray. Jack experienced an abdominal aneurysm rupture six days later, however, and died as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u00b610 Doris filed a complaint against the State as personal representative of Jack\u2019s estate, individually as Jack\u2019s widow, and on behalf of Jack\u2019s heirs. She alleged that the State negligently and in violation of statute granted and renewed a temporary medical license to Stephenson, and then negligently and in violation of statute granted a full, unrestricted physician\u2019s license to Stephenson, when he had been subject to discipline for unprofessional conduct in other states. The complaint, filed in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, also named Stephenson; Liberty County; the Liberty County Hospital; Triangle Health Care; Triangle Health Care, PLLP; and Dr. Richard Buker. The State moved to dismiss, arguing the Board was entitled to quasi-judicial immunity. The First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, denied the motion to dismiss, determining the Board\u2019s decisions were not protected by quasi-judicial immunity because they were not made during the adjudication of a dispute or controversy. Several of the other defendants requested a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>change of venue to the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Liberty County, which the court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b611 The State subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing it was entitled to quasi-judicial immunity for the Board\u2019s actions or, alternatively, that the State owed no duty of care to Jack. Doris responded and moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that the State was not entitled to quasi-judicial immunity and that it owed a duty of care to Jack in licensing Stephenson. The District Court issued an order granting the State\u2019s motion-and denying Doris\u2019s motion-on the issue of quasi-judicial immunity. Doris appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b612 Summary judgment should be granted only when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Prindel v. Ravalli County, </em>2006 MT 62, \u00b6 19, 331 Mont. 338, \u00b6 19, 133 P.3d 165, \u00b6 19. Here, the parties agreed in the District Court that no genuine issues of material fact existed regarding the issues presented in their summary judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"ASuY\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, based on the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria as the district court. We determine whether the district court applied the law correctly. <em>Germann v. Stephens, </em>2006 MT 130, \u00b6 21, 332 Mont. 303, \u00b6 21, 137 P.3d 545, \u00b6 21 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u00b614 1. Is the Board entitled to quasi-judieial immunity for its actions in granting a medical license to a physician who was subject to disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct in other states?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\u00b615 Doris argues the Board was performing ministerial and administrative functions in investigating Stephenson and granting him a license. She also contends the Board\u2019s decision to grant Stephenson a license did not involve the adjudication of a controversy. The State, on the other hand, argues the Board was performing discretionary, quasi-judicial functions when it issued the license because performing a background investigation is discretionary, not mandatory. The State further argues the entire three-year process between the Board\u2019s receipt of Stephenson\u2019s application and its issuance of an unrestricted license was a controversy between the Board and Stephenson. Prior to reaching the specific issue before us, it is helpful to review our jurisprudence involving quasi-judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b616 Although Article II, Section 18 of the 1972 Montana Constitution abolished sovereign immunity, the common-law doctrines of prosecutorial and quasi-judicial immunity still exist in Montana. <em>Koppen v. Board of Medical Examiners, </em>233 Mont. 214, 218, 759 P.2d 173, 175 (1988) (citations omitted). The availability of quasi-judicial immunity depends upon the procedural facts of each case in which the immunity is asserted. In some cases, quasi-judicial immunity has been available. <em>See e.g. Koppen, </em>233 Mont. at 219-20, 759 P.2d at 176; <em>Rahrer v. Board of Psychologists, </em>2000 MT 9, \u00b6 20, 298 Mont. 28, \u00b6 20, 993 P.3d. 680, \u00b6 20. In others, it has not. <em>See e.g. State v. District Court </em>(hereinafter <em>Great Western Sugar), </em>246 Mont. 225, 234, 805 P.2d 1272, 1277 <em>(1990);Newville v. State, Dept. of Family Services, </em>267 Mont. 237, 269, 883 P.2d 793, 812 (1994); <em>State Bd. Of Dentistry v. Kandarian, </em>248 Mont. 444, 448-49, 813 P.2d 409, 412 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b617 In some cases, we have examined the nature of the function undertaken by an administrative entity to determine whether the function was ministerial or discretionary. Where the administrative function is mandated by statute and, thus, purely ministerial in nature, the administrative entity is not acting in a quasi-judicial manner and is not entitled to quasi-judicial immunity. <em>See Great Western Sugar, </em>246 Mont. at 232-33, 805 P.2d at 1277; <em>Newville, </em>267 Mont. at 268-69, 883 P.2d at 812. However, where the administrative function involves discretionary decision-making by an entity, the entity is acting in a quasi-judicial capacity for which quasi-judicial immunity is available. <em>See Koppen, </em>233 Mont. at 219-20, 759 P.2d at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b618 In addressing the application of quasi-judicial immunity to an administrative entity\u2019s actions, we also have looked to the context in which the entity was acting. In that regard, \u00a7 2-15-102(10), MCA, defines \u201cquasi-judicial function\u201d in terms of \u201can adjudicatory function exercised by an agency, involving the exercise of judgment and discretion in making determinations in controversies.\u201d Thus, we have required that an administrative entity\u2019s discretionary decision-making be within the context of adjudicating a controversy or adversarial-type proceeding, such as a contested case proceeding under the provisions of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA) (\u00a7\u00a7 2-4-101 through -711, MCA), for quasi-judicial immunity to apply. <em>See Newville, </em>267 Mont. at 269, 883 P.2d at 812; <em>Rahrer, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Kandarian, </em>248 Mont. at 447-48, 813 P.2d at 411-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b619 As stated above, Doris argues the District Court erred in granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the State summary judgment based on quasi-judicial immunity. She contends our case law clearly establishes that the Board was performing ministerial and administrative functions in investigating Stephenson and granting him a license, and the Board\u2019s decision to grant Stephenson a license did not involve the adjudication of a controversy. The State first responds that, pursuant to Title 37, chapters 1 and 3 of the Montana Code Annotated (MCA), the Board\u2019s decision-making functions relating to investigating applications and issuing temporary and permanent licenses to practice medicine are discretionary, rather than ministerial, thus entitling the Board to quasi-judicial immunity. The State contends, and Doris does not dispute, that the statutes in effect in 1997 when Stephenson was granted his license are applicable here. Consequently, all references to statutes contained in Title 37 of the MCA are to the 1997 version.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b620 Title 37, chapter 1 of the MCA contains provisions generally applicable to all licensure and regulation of professions and occupations by the State and its agencies. Chapter 3 of Title 37 contains the provisions specific to the licensing of physicians in this State. The provisions of Title 37, chapter 1 apply to and are intended to supplement the statutes governing the Board\u2019s actions in licensing and regulating physicians under chapter 3 unless specific provisions in chapter 3 provide otherwise. <em>See </em>\u00a7 37-1-303, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b621 Section 37-3-321, MCA, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">[i]f the board determines that an applicant for a license to practice medicine does not possess the qualifications or character required by this chapter or that he has committed unprofessional conduct, it shall refrain from authorizing the department to issue a license. The department shall mail to the applicant, at his last address of record with the department, written notification of the board\u2019s decision, together with notice of a time and place of a hearing before the board. If the applicant without cause fails to appear at the hearing or if after hearing the board determines he is not entitled to a license, the board shall refuse to grant the license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALW\">In addition, \u00a7 37-1-316(7), MCA, defines \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d in part, as \u201cdenial, suspension, revocation, probation, fine, or other license restriction or discipline against a licensee by a state, province, territory, or Indian tribal government or the federal government if the action is not on appeal, under judicial review, or has been satisfied.\u201d It is undisputed here that Stephenson\u2019s California license was conditionally revoked and his Florida license was suspended. It further is undisputed that Stephenson had not satisfied the requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>necessary to lift the conditional revocation and suspension of those licenses at the time he applied for a license in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b622 Thus, at the time he applied for a Montana license, Stephenson had \u201ccommitted unprofessional conduct.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 37-3-321, MCA, the Board was required to refrain from authorizing issuance of a license to Stephenson, and the department was required to notify Stephenson of that decision and provide him with the opportunity for a hearing. The statutory \u201cshall\u201d language in \u00a7 37-3-321, MCA, clearly reflects mandatory, nondiscretionary duties. The Board may not avoid statutory requirements by the simple expedient of not making a determination that an applicant has \u201ccommitted unprofessional conduct.\u201d This situation is similar to those in <em>Great Western Sugar </em>and <em>Newville </em>in which we held that an agency action which is mandated by statute is ministerial in nature and cannot provide a basis for quasi-judicial immunity. <em>Great Western Sugar, </em>246 Mont. at 232-33, 805 P.2d at 1277; <em>Newville, </em>267 Mont. at 268-69, 833 P.2d at 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b623 The State also contends the Board\u2019s actions in investigating Stephenson\u2019s application and issuing him a temporary, and then permanent, license meet the definition of \u201cquasi-judicial function\u201d set forth in \u00a7 2-15-102(10)(c), MCA (2007) (formerly \u00a7 2-15-102(9), MCA (1997)). Consequently, the State asserts entitlement to quasi-judicial immunity for those actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b624 Section 2-15-102(10), MCA, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa-I\">\u201cQuasi-judicial function\u201d means an adjudicatory function exercised by an agency, involving the exercise of judgment and discretion in making determinations in controversies. The term includes but is not limited to the functions of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">(c) issuing, suspending, or revoking licenses, permits, and certificates[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u00b625 The State is correct that \u00a7 2-15-102(10)(c), MCA, includes the delineated actions of an agency with regard to licenses as quasi-judicial functions. The State apparently reads the statutory listing of included functions on a stand-alone basis, however, and ignores other statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u00b626 This Court is obligated to read the statute in its entirety, giving meaning to all its parts and neither inserting nor omitting language therein. Section 1-2-101, MCA. The license-related language in \u00a7 2-15-102(10)(c), MCA, as well as the other listed functions delineated in the statute, are constrained by the preceding language of \u00a7 2-15-102(10), MCA, which requires an \u201cadjudicatory function ... involving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>exercise of judgment and discretion in making determinations in controversies.\u201d Thus, unless the license-related functions occur while the agency is \u201cmaking determinations in controversies,\u201d the agency action does not meet the statutory definition of \u201cquasi-judicial function.\u201d Absent a quasi-judicial function, quasi-judicial immunity is not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b627 We previously have discussed the necessity of the existence of a controversy in determining whether an adjudicatory function is a quasi-judicial function. In that regard, we have determined that situations where an agency is conducting a contested or adversarial proceeding pursuant to the notice and hearing provisions of the MAPA and where an agency is responding to citizen complaints which are adversarial in nature involve determinations in controversies which are adjudicatory functions and, therefore, quasi-judicial functions pursuant to \u00a7 2-15-102(10), MCA. <em>See e.g. Rahrer, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Great Western Sugar, </em>246 Mont. at 230 and 234, 805 P.2d at 1275-76 and 1278 (citing <em>Koppen, </em>233 Mont. at 216, 759 P.2d at 176). It is undisputed here that no formal MAPA contested case proceeding was ever noticed or initiated during the three-year period during which the Board investigated Stephenson and issued him temporary and permanent licenses to practice medicine. It also is undisputed that the Board did not receive any citizen complaints or objections regarding Stephenson or his license application during those three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b628 Notwithstanding, the State argues that the entire three-year process between the Board\u2019s receipt of Stephenson\u2019s application and its issuance of an unrestricted license was a controversy or adversarial proceeding between the Board and Stephenson. In support of its contention, the State points out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">the licensing process was arduous and lengthy. Stephenson appeared before the Board, either in person or by telephone, approximately a half dozen times; was required to submit to testing and educational courses in areas specified by the Board; was subjected to strict restrictions on his practice and continued oversight by the Board; and submitted to two extensive peer reviews of his diagnosis and treatment of patients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The State\u2019s factual recitations are correct; however, they do not support its legal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u00b629 \u201cControversy\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] disagreement or a dispute, esp. in public.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>354 (8th ed., West 2004). Similarly, \u201ccontrovert\u201d means \u201cto dispute or contest; esp. to deny ... or oppose in argument ....\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 354. Additionally, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u201cadversary proceeding\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] hearing involving a dispute between opposing parties.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 58. Consequently, there must be some dispute between opposing parties for a controversy or adversarial proceeding to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b630 Here, the Board received Stephenson\u2019s application for a Montana medical license in 1995; the application disclosed the conditional revocation of his California license and the suspension of his Florida license. The Board requested additional information and had Stephenson appear before the full Board for a personal interview. As a result of that interview, the Board tabled the license application, requested additional information from a health clinic in Montana where Stephenson practiced for a short time, and then requested another personal interview with Stephenson. At this second interview, the Board voted to issue Stephenson a temporary license for one year subject to several conditions, including limitations on his medical practice as well as testing and continuing education requirements. The Board informed Stephenson that if he did not accept the conditions, it would give him notice of a proposed denial of a license and give him the opportunity to contest the denial in a formal hearing. Stephenson accepted the conditions and obtained his temporary license. The Board continued to extend Stephenson\u2019s temporary license subject to conditions, including peer reviews, and-in 1999-granted Stephenson a full, unrestricted, permanent license to practice medicine in Montana. Stephenson complied with the Board\u2019s requests at every step of the licensing process. He did not oppose the Board\u2019s decision to issue temporary licenses rather than a permanent license, nor did he oppose the conditions attached to issuance of the temporary licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"AW0\">\u00b631  We conclude that, regardless of whether the Board\u2019s actions in investigating Stephenson\u2019s license application and granting him temporary and permanent medical licenses were discretionary functions, the Board\u2019s actions were not -undertaken in the context of a controversy or adversarial proceeding as contemplated by \u00a7 2-15-102(10), MCA. We conclude, therefore, that the Board is not entitled to quasi-judicial immunity for its actions in granting a medical license to Stephenson. Consequently, we hold the District Court erred in granting the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b632 2. Did the State owe a duty of care to Jack Nelson?</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b633 Doris alleged in her complaint that the State acted negligently and in violation of statute in investigating Stephenson\u2019s license application and granting him temporary and permanent medical licenses. In its answer, the State asserted the public duty doctrine as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>an affirmative defense. It also raised the doctrine as an alternative basis in support of its motion for summary judgment in the District Court. The State argued it owed no duty of care to Jack Nelson because the medical licensing statutes benefit the general public and do not create a special duty to an individual to protect from, or insure against, the negligent actions of a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b634 The District Court, having granted the State summary judgment based on quasi-judicial immunity, did not address the State\u2019s public duty doctrine argument. We held above, however, that the State is not entitled to quasi-judicial immunity here and, as a result, we address the issue of whether the State owed a duty of care to Jack Nelson. We do so under our longstanding practice of affirming a trial court\u2019s result, even if that result was based on incorrect reasoning. <em>See e.g. In re Trust B, </em>2008 MT 153, \u00b6 19, 343 Mont. 240, \u00b6 19, 184 P.3d 296, \u00b6 19; <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Talmage, </em>2007 MT 45, \u00b6 23, 336 Mont. 125, \u00b6 23, 152 P.3d 1275, \u00b6 23. We further observe that whether a legal duty exists can be determined as a matter of law. <em>Eklund v. Trost, </em>2006 MT 333, \u00b6 32, 335 Mont. 112, \u00b6 32, 151 P.3d 870, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"Afv\">\u00b635  \u201cThe public duty doctrine provides that a governmental entity cannot be held liable for an individual plaintiffs injury resulting from a governmental officer\u2019s breach of a duty owed to the general public rather than to the individual plaintiff.\u201d <em>Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, \u00b6 41, 321 Mont. 210, \u00b6 41, 90 P.3d 394, \u00b6 41. The rationale underlying this doctrine is that \u201ca duty owed to all is a duty owed to none.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 363, \u00b6 21, 983 P.2d 972, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b636 An exception to the public duty doctrine exists when there is a special relationship between the governmental entity and the plaintiff which gives rise to a special duty that is \u201cmore particular than the duty owed to the public at large.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22. A special relationship can be established in one of four ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">(1) by a statute intended to protect a specific class of persons of which the plaintiff is a member from a particular type of harm; (2) when a government agent undertakes specific action to protect a person or property; (3) by governmental actions that reasonably induce detrimental reliance by a member of the public; and (4) under certain circumstances, when the agency has actual custody of the plaintiff or of a third person who causes harm to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\"><em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22 (citations omitted). In <em>Nelson, </em>we concluded an exception to the public duty doctrine existed under the second criteria because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the law enforcement officer had taken specific actions to ensure the decedent\u2019s safety and, by those actions, the officer assumed the duty to protect the decedent from harm. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b637 In the present case, the issue is whether a special relationship was created between the Board and Jack via a statute. If so, an exception to the public duty doctrine exists and the State owed a duty to Jack. We begin with a brief review of our cases addressing this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b638 In <em>Massee, </em>three sons sued Broadwater County and the county sheriff for the wrongful death of their mother (Vickie), who had been fatally shot by her husband (Ray). <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 1. Vickie and Ray had a tumultuous relationship, including many encounters in which Ray threatened physical harm to both Vickie and himself using a .44 magnum pistol. These encounters resulted in numerous contacts with sheriffs deputies and the sheriff himself. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-19. Eventually, Ray fatally shot Vickie and then killed himself with the pistol. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 20. Vickie\u2019s sons alleged that the sheriff had negligently failed to take appropriate action to prevent Ray from killing Vickie. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the sons, but the trial court subsequently vacated the verdict and granted judgment as a matter of law to the defendants. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22. The trial court determined, in part, that no special relationship existed between the sheriff and Vickie and, consequently, the sheriff had no legal duty to protect her from Ray. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b639 On appeal, we addressed whether a special relationship existed between Vickie and the sheriff so as to create an exception to the immunity provided by the public duty doctrine. Specifically, we addressed creation of a special relationship via a statute intended to protect a specific class of persons of which the injured party is a member from a particular type of harm. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42-43. Two domestic violence statutes in effect at the time of Vickie\u2019s death were at issue in <em>Massee. </em>It was undisputed that the two statutes were enacted to protect the specific class of persons who are victims of domestic violence, that Vickie was a member of that specific class of persons and that, as a result, the sheriff owed a special duty to Vickie as a member of the protected class of domestic abuse victims. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 43. We concluded, therefore, that an exception to the public duty doctrine existed. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u00b640 We again addressed the first exception to the public duty doctrine in <em>Eklund. </em>There, Roy Trost escaped from a youth detention center and was driving a stolen vehicle. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-12. Law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>officers pursued Mm at a Mgh rate of speed as they entered Harlowton, Montana, in Wheatland County. Trost lost control of the vehicle and struck Donald Eklund. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15 and 17. Eklund sued Trost, Wheatland County and the Wheatland County Sheriff, among others, alleging negligence. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 18. The county and the sheriff argued that no exception to the public duty doctrine existed because the statute on which Eklund relied did not create a special relationship. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 35. The district court concluded no exception to the public duty doctrine existed and granted summary judgment to the county and the sheriff on that basis; Eklund appealed. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b641 We first observed on appeal that, in the context of claims against law enforcement officers, the public duty doctrine expresses the policy that an officer\u2019s overarching duty to protect and preserve the peace is owed to the public at large, not to individual members of the public. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 33 (citing <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 21). In determining whether the public duty doctrine applied, we addressed whether a special relationsMp was created by a statute intended to protect a specific class of persons of which the plamtiff is a member from a particular type of harm. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b642 The statute at issue, \u00a7 61-8-107, MCA (2003), provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">(2) The driver of a police vehicle or authorized emergency vehicle may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">(b) proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign, but only after slowing down as may be necessary for safe operation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">(c) <em>exceed the speed limits so long as he does not endanger life or property;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">(4) <em>The foregoing provisions shall not relieve the driver of a police vehicle ... from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons, nor shall such provisions protect the driver from the consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety of others.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-10\"><em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 36. Although the statute uses general terms, \u201call persons\u201d and \u201cothers,\u201d we held that the statute imposed a duty on drivers of law enforcement vehicles and created \u201ca special class of persons-those, who by use of the streets and highways are potential victims of a high speed chase-to whom the duty is owed.\u201d <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 39. Thus, a special relationship was established and the public duty doctrine did not apply. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u00b643 We addressed the first exception to the public duty doctrine again recently in <em>Prosser v. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., </em>2008 MT 87, 342 Mont. 209, 179 P.3d 1178. There, Kennedy purchased property zoned for commercial use in Hamilton, Montana; the property was bordered to the west by property zoned for residential use. Kennedy then approached the Hamilton City Zoning Board of Adjustment (Board) with a plan to modify the original restaurant on her property for use as a casino and lounge. The Board eventually approved the plan-including a condition that Kennedy comply with all federal, state and local laws-and issued a certificate of occupancy. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Neighbors living in the residentially-zoned properties to the west of Kennedy subsequently sued both Kennedy and the City, alleging in part that the Board had violated City ordinances in approving Kennedy\u2019s plan, and that various City officials had failed to abate a nuisance at the casino and failed to take legal action against Kennedy when requested by the plaintiffs. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 8. The district court granted summary judgment to the City on all claims. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 9. Specifically, the court concluded that the City owed no duty to the neighbors because no special relationship existed between the City and the neighbors which would create an exception to the public duty doctrine. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b644 The plaintiffs argued on appeal that a special relationship existed between them and the City pursuant to two City ordinances imposing a special duty on the City to protect them when approving Kennedy\u2019s proposed plan to modify the property. They contended that language in the two ordinances created a specific class of persons-those persons who are occupants of property in the vicinity of property which is the subject of a proposed plan-of which the plaintiffs were members and whom the two ordinances were intended to protect. Thus, the plaintiffs asserted, an exception to the public duty doctrine existed. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b645 We concluded the two ordinances at issue were subparts of a grouping of City zoning ordinances, the entirety of which was intended to promote the general welfare and benefit the general public rather than a circumscribed class of persons. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 23. Consequently, no special relationship existed between the City and the plaintiffs which would provide an exception to the public duty doctrine. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"A84L\">\u00b646 Returning to the present case, the question is whether the statutes governing the regulation of the practice of medicine contained in Title 37, Chapter 3 of the MCA, were intended to protect a specific class of persons of which Jack was a member from a particular type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>harm. If so, the statutes created a special relationship between the State and Jack which would constitute an exception to the public duty doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"A8t\">\u00b647  Section 37-3-101, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">Purpose. It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative policy in the state of Montana, that the practice of medicine within the state of Montana is a privilege granted by the legislative authority and is not a natural right of individuals and that it is deemed necessary, as a matter of such policy and <em>in the interests of the health, happiness, safety, and welfare of the people of Montana, </em>to provide laws and provisions covering the granting of that privilege and its subsequent use, control, and regulation to the end that the <em>public shall be properly protected </em>against unprofessional, improper, unauthorized, and unqualified practice of medicine and to license competent physicians to practice medicine and thereby <em>provide for the health needs of the people of Montana. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On its face, the clear language of this statute speaks in terms of protecting the entire public-the people of Montana-via the licensing of health care providers. The statute\u2019s \u201cintended beneficiaries\u201d are all of the citizens of the state who receive medical care. Thus, as in <em>Prosser, </em>the explicit legislative policy and rationale for Title 37, Chapter 3 of the MCA creates an overarching duty to protect and provide for the health and welfare of Montanans. The duty is owed to the public at large. Nothing in the statutory language supports a legislative intent to protect a specific class of persons from a particular type of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b648 Section 37-3-101, MCA, is readily distinguishable from those statutes addressed in <em>Massee </em>and <em>Eklund </em>which produced different conclusions. <em>Massee </em>dealt with the specific, limited situation of a domestic abuse incident under which the law enforcement officer had specific statutory duties to advise the victim of her rights as a victim and to confiscate the weapon used in the incident. These legislatively-imposed duties owed to a specified class of Montanans-domestic abuse victims-created a special relationship between the officer and the victim. Similarly, <em>Eklund </em>addressed the specific situation of a high speed chase and the officers\u2019 statutory duty to drive with due regard for safety in that situation. Again, the statutory duty was owed to a specified class of Montanans-those occupying the streets during a high speed chase-and, therefore, created a special relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u00b649 Such specificity is lacking in \u00a7 37-3-101, MCA. Rather, this statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>directs the State to regulate all physicians for the benefit and protection of all Montanans. The present case is more analogous to the situation in <em>Prosser, </em>where the two city ordinances cited by the plaintiffs as creating a special relationship between them and the city were subparts of a grouping of ordinances intended in their entirety to promote the general welfare and benefit of the public at large. Here, Title 37, Chapter 3 of the MCA contains numerous statutes, the entirety of which-as stated in \u00a7 37-3-101, MCA-are intended to benefit and protect all the people of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b650  We conclude that \u00a7 37-3-101, MCA, is not \u201ca statute intended to protect a specific class of persons of which the plaintiff is a member from a particular type of harm,\u201d and, therefore, the statute does not create a special relationship between the State and Jack giving rise to a special duty. Thus, we further conclude that the statutory special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine does not exist. We hold the State did not owe a duty of care to Emil J. Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b651  We concluded above that the District Court erred in granting the State summary judgment based on the court\u2019s determination that the Board was entitled to quasi-judicial immunity. The District Court did not reach the public duty doctrine issue before it, but we may affirm a trial court\u2019s ruling where that court reaches the correct result, even if its reasoning is incorrect. <em>In re Trust B, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Wells Fargo Bank, </em>\u00b6 23. Because the State owed no duty of care to Jack, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"A-L\">\u00b652 Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b257-6\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"AhX\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. \u00b653 I concur with the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue One and dissent as to Issue Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u00b654 At the District Court and here, the State argued that if it was not entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, it should be entitled to summary judgment because the State owed no duty of care to Jack Nelson, either pursuant to statute or common law, on the premise that the medical licensing statutes are for the benefit of the general public and do not create a special duty to an individual to protect from or insure against the negligent actions of a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b655 Whether a legal duty exists can be determined as a matter of law. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 32. In a negligence action, a duty may arise from a statutorily imposed obligation. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 38; <em>Prindel v. Ravalli County, </em>2006 MT 62, \u00b6 29, 331 Mont. 338, \u00b6 29, 133 P.3d 165, \u00b6 29; <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 43; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>State, </em>1998 MT 46, \u00b6 62, 287 Mont. 473, \u00b6 62, 956 P.2d 35, \u00b6 62. It is necessary to consider the public duty doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>when considering negligence claims against a public entity or person. <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 41. Under the public duty doctrine, \u201ca governmental entity cannot be held liable for an individual plaintiffs injury resulting from a governmental officer\u2019s breach of a duty owed to the general public rather than to the individual plaintiff.\u201d <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 41. An exception to the public duty doctrine exists when there is a special relationship between the governmental entity and the plaintiff giving rise to a special duty that is \u201cmore particular than the duty owed to the public at large.\u201d <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 34 (citing <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6 22, 295 Mont. 363, \u00b6 22, 983 P.2d 972, \u00b6 22); <em>see also Orr v. State, </em>2004 MT 354, \u00b6 41, 324 Mont. 391, \u00b6 41, 106 P.3d 100, \u00b6 41. A special relationship can be established in one of four circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\">(1) by a statute intended to protect a specific class of persons of which the plaintiff is a member from a particular type of harm; (2) when a government agent undertakes specific action to protect a person or property; (3) by governmental actions that reasonably induce detrimental reliance by a member of the public; and (4) under certain circumstances, when the agency has actual custody of the plaintiff or of a third person who causes harm to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22. At issue in this case is whether an exception to the public duty doctrine exists by way of a statute establishing a special relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b656 In the recent <em>Eklund </em>case, the plaintiff filed suit against Wheatland County and the Wheatland County Sheriff after he was hit and injured by a vehicle being driven by another defendant, Roy Trost. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Trost had escaped from a youth detention center and was driving a stolen vehicle. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-12. Law enforcement officers pursued him at a high rate of speed, even as they entered town. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 15. Trost lost control of the vehicle and struck Eklund. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 17. Wheatland County and the Sheriff argued that under the public duty doctrine they had no duty to Eklund. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 35. In determining whether the public duty doctrine applied, this Court addressed the first circumstance under which the exception to the doctrine is established-whether a special relationship was created by a statute intended to protect a specific class of persons of which the plaintiff is a member from a particular type of harm. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"A9t\">\u00b657 The statute at issue was \u00a7 61-8-107, MCA, regarding police vehicles, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">(2) The driver of a police vehicle or authorized emergency vehicle may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>(b) proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign, but only after slowing down as may be necessary for safe operation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">(c) <em>exceed the speed limits so long as he does not endanger life or property;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">(4) <em>The foregoing provisions shall not relieve the driver of a police vehicle ... from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons, nor shall such provisions protect the driver from the consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety of others.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asl\"><em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 36 (emphasis in original). Even though the statute uses general terms, \u201call persons\u201d and \u201cothers,\u201d we concluded that the statute imposed a duty on drivers of emergency vehicles and created \u201ca special class of persons-those, who by use of the streets and highways are potential victims of a high speed chase-to whom the duty is owed.\u201d <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 39. Accordingly, a special relationship was established and the public duty doctrine did not apply. <em>Eklund, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"Al2\">\u00b658 In this case, we concluded in Issue One that the medical licensing statutes indeed impose a duty on the State to properly investigate an applicant and refrain from licensing an applicant who has committed unprofessional conduct. The question then, in determining whether the special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine applies, is whether the statutes create a special class of persons to whom the duty is owed. Section 37-3-101, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">Purpose. It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative policy in the state of Montana, that the practice of medicine within the state of Montana is a privilege granted by the legislative authority and is not a natural right of individuals and that it is deemed necessary, as a matter of such policy and in the interests of the health, happiness, safety, and welfare of the people of Montana, to provide laws and provisions covering the granting of that privilege and its subsequent use, control, and regulation to the end that the <em>public shall be properly protected </em>against unprofessional, improper, unauthorized, and unqualified practice of medicine and to license competent physicians to practice medicine and thereby <em>provide for the health needs of the people of Montana. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b659 Despite the Court\u2019s protestations to the contrary, this statute lends itself to the same analysis as the high speed chase statute involved in <em>Eklund-th&amp;t </em>is, although the statute uses general terms, \u201cpeople of Montana\u201d and \u201cpublic,\u201d it creates a special class of persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>to whom the duty is owed. Since a licensed doctor does not, in fact, treat the <em>entirety of the Montana population, </em>this class consists of the doctor\u2019s patients who, by seeking care for their health needs from a licensed physician, are potential victims of unprofessional, improper, unauthorized, or unqualified practice of medicine. The <em>Eklund </em>class of potential victims using a particular street that is the scene of a high-speed chase is no different analytically from potential victims who seek health care from a particular doctor licensed by the State. Both classes, although less than the public at large, are the intended beneficiaries of the respective statutes. The patient as a potential victim presents an even more compelling argument than the random bystander to a police chase given that the patient, in reliance on the State\u2019s licensing process, has chosen this licensed doctor to attend to his or her health needs. Jack Nelson was a member of this special class of persons created by \u00a7 37-3-101, MCA. The State owed a duty to Jack, not to insure against specific instances of malpractice, but to investigate applicants and license only qualified, competent physicians from whom he might seek care for his health needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b660 The State is concerned that if it is found to have a duty to individual patients, it would become liable for every act of negligence committed by licensed physicians. The State argues the public interest would not be served by creating a duty by which a licensing board is responsible to control the conduct of its licensees. This concern arises out of the State\u2019s mischaracterization of its duty. The State\u2019s duty is not to anticipate every interaction between a doctor and patient. Rather, the State\u2019s duty is preliminary. It occurs before a doctor ever has an opportunity to interact with a patient. That is, the State has a duty to license only qualified doctors; a duty to screen applicants who have engaged in unprofessional conduct and to require that they proceed through a contested case proceeding. Sections 37-1-305, 37-3-321, MCA. Likewise, the State\u2019s duty is not to control the conduct of its licensees at the risk of being liable for licensees\u2019 negligent acts. Its duty is to license only applicants who meet the statutory qualifications-a matter within the <em>State\u2019s </em>control. If the State fails to carry out that duty, it may be liable for its own negligence as opposed to the negligence of the licensee. If the State complies with the statutory requirements for licensing, it is not exposed to any liability for having issued the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b661 Having determined that the State owed a statutory duty to Jack Nelson, it is unnecessary to determine whether a common law duty existed. <em>Orr, </em>\u00b6 48. Further, a discussion of foreseeability, necessary in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>an analysis of common law duty, is not warranted. When the legislature enacted statutes to protect a special class-patients seeking medical care-it foresaw the harm to patients that could occur if the State failed to follow the statutes for licensing a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b662 The State farther argues that the Board\u2019s statutory duty in granting or denying medical licenses nans to the applicant, not the patient, to ensure an applicant\u2019s due process rights are not violated. The State claims that this duty arises from the physician\u2019s property interest in the license. This contention is contradicted by the licensing statutes. Section 37-3-321, MCA, provides the procedures that are to be undertaken when a license is denied, giving rise to a contested case under MAPA. However, as stated in \u00a7 37-3-101, MCA, the purpose in denying the license of an unqualified applicant in the first place is to protect patients from unqualified, unprofessional physicians. Further, \u00a7 37-3-101, MCA, provides that the practice of medicine is a privilege and not a natural right.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b663 I dissent. An exception to the public duty doctrine exists because there was a special relationship between Jack Nelson and the Board by virtue of \u00a7 37-3-101, MCA, which requires that the Board protect patients by investigating applicants and licensing only qualified physicians.</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-6\">JUSTICE COTTER joins the dissent of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b261-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Anb\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"Afva\">\u00b664 I join the Court\u2019s decision as to Issue 1, but I note my continued disagreement with the doctrine of quasi-judicial immunity. <em>See Rahrer v. Board of Psychologists, </em>2000 MT 9, \u00b6\u00b6 28-44, 298 Mont. 28, \u00b6\u00b6 28-44, 993 P.2d 680, \u00b6\u00b6 28-44 (Nelson &amp; Trieweiler, JJ., specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">\u00b665 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision as to Issue 2. Since the medical licensing statutes protect everybody, they protect nobody. That, in a nutshell, is the application of the public duty doctrine to the facts of this case. There is probably no more byzantine, pernicious, or illogical a doctrine in the law than the public duty doctrine. The public duty doctrine does not depend for its existence on any statute enacted by the peoples\u2019 representatives in the Legislature. It is not grounded in Montana\u2019s Constitution; in fact, Article II, Section 18 prohibits it. It has been rejected in numerous States as a throwback to a feudal time when it was thought that the King could do no wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u00b666 Here, the State of Montana, acting through the Board of Medical Examiners, licensed Dr. Thomas Stephenson to practice medicine in this State. This doctor\u2019s track record includes license revocation and suspension, practice restrictions, probation, discipline for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>unprofessional conduct, false advertising, fraudulent insurance claims, repeated negligence in treating patients, gross negligence in treating patients, numerous malpractice suits, dishonesty and corruption in treating patients, conduct warranting the denial of his license, signing medical documents containing false facts, improperly subscribing and maintaining medical records, bankruptcy, alcohol abuse, and Demerol addiction. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 5. Yet, this Court invokes the public duty doctrine and holds that since the laws governing the regulation of the practice of medicine contained in Title 37, Chapter 3, MCA, protect \u201call the people of Montana,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 49, they do not, therefore, protect any of the people of Montana from the likes of Dr. Stephenson. In short, a duty to all is a duty to none. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 35, 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b667 The Court\u2019s position is untenable. The Legislature enacted the medical licensing laws to protect innocent, unsuspecting, sick Montanans like Jack Nelson from physicians like Dr. Stephenson. The Legislature enacted these laws to prevent the harm that foreseeably would occur if physicians like Dr. Stephenson were allowed to practice medicine in Montana. Section 37-3-101, MCA. While the Board may not have a duty to anticipate or prevent malpractice or misconduct committed by a properly licensed physician against his or her patient, the Board does have a statutory duty to license only properly credentialed, ethical, and qualified physicians in the first place. Section 37-3-101, MCA. Under the various provisions of Title 37, Chapter 3, Part 3, MCA, the Board has a clear duty to screen applicants who have engaged in unprofessional conduct, fraud, gross negligence, dishonesty, and corruption and require them to proceed through a contested case hearing. In short, the Board has a statutory duty to do what is -uniquely within its power to do-to make sure that a physician with a track record like Dr. Stephenson\u2019s is not licensed and loosed upon innocent, unsuspecting, sick Montanans to perpetrate in this State the same sort of misconduct for which he was revoked, suspended, and severely disciplined in two other States. <em>See </em>\u00a7 37-3-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b668 These are the statutorily imposed duties which the Board breached and for which it is liable-its duties under the laws enacted by the Legislature to screen applicants, to proceed through a contested case hearing, and to refuse unqualified, unprofessional, and corrupt physicians the privilege of practicing medicine in this State. Yet, it is precisely the Board\u2019s breaches of this statutory law which this Court absolves through application of the public duty doctrine. The Court\u2019s application of the public duty doctrine under these circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>effectively renders the provisions of Title 37, Chapter 3, MCA, unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b669 I detailed the legal rationale for my disagreement with this Court\u2019s continued application of the public duty doctrine in <em>Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, \u00b6\u00b6 65-96, 321 Mont. 210, \u00b6\u00b6 65-96, 90 P.3d 394, \u00b6\u00b6 65-96 (Nelson, J., specially concurring and dissenting), and <em>Prosser v. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., </em>2008 MT 87, \u00b6\u00b6 70-75, 342 Mont. 209, \u00b6\u00b6 70-75, 179 P.3d 1178, \u00b6\u00b6 70-75 (Nelson, J., dissenting). I am not going to explain all of those arguments again here. I suggest, though, that given the Court\u2019s decision in this case and its apparent unalterable commitment to perpetuate the public duty doctrine, the only way the doctrine will be exterminated is through the legislative process or by way of a citizen initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b670 In the meantime, I am left to wonder how one explains to Doris Nelson the outcome of this case. On one hand, we decide that the Board violated \u00a7 37-3-321, MCA, of the medical licensing statutes, Opinion, \u00b6 22, and that Doris, therefore, can sue the Board, Opinion, \u00b6 31. Yet, on the other hand, we turn around and hold that while she can sue the Board, she cannot obtain a just remedy for her or her late husband\u2019s injuries because the Board did not owe Jack a duty of care. Opinion, \u00b6 51. We can explain to her that we are depriving her of her ability to obtain a remedy for the Board\u2019s negligence and misfeasance because of the public duty doctrine. Opinion, \u00b6 50. We can tell her that \u201c \u2018[t]he public duty doctrine provides that a governmental entity [here, the State acting through the Board] cannot be held liable for an individual plaintiffs injury resulting from a governmental officer\u2019s breach of a duty owed to the general public rather than to the individual plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 35 (quoting <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6 41). Hence, we can tell her that she loses because of a logical absurdity: \u201c \u2018a duty owed to all is a duty owed to none.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 35 (quoting <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 363, \u00b6 21, 983 P.2d 972, \u00b6 21). In other words, since the medical licensing laws protect \u201call the people of Montana,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 49, they protect none of the people of Montana, Opinion, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b671 We also can tell Doris that the public duty doctrine is judicially created, <em>see Massee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79-87 (Nelson, J., specially concurring and dissenting), meaning that the doctrine was not enacted by any legislative process. We can tell her that the public duty doctrine is not grounded in the Montana Constitution but, rather, was created by judges who have perpetuated it for years in cases such as this. We can tell her that courts use the doctrine as a tool to shield governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>entities because judges fear that if they do not do so-i.e., if they do not proactively take action to shield governmental entities-there will be a flood of lawsuits which will adversely impact the government financially. <em>See </em>Frank Swindell, <em>Municipal Liability for Negligent Inspections in </em>Sinning v. Clark-A <em>\u201cHollow\u201d Victory for the Public Duty Doctrine, </em>18 Campbell L. Rev. 241, 249 (1996). We can tell her that there is absolutely no evidence supporting this paranoia. No doubt she will conclude that use of the public duty doctrine is motivated by the government\u2019s self-serving need to exonerate its own negligence and misfeasance. And she will be right. It is.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b672 Further, we can tell Doris that notwithstanding the parade of horribles routinely thrown up in defense of the public duty doctrine, a significant number of states that have abrogated governmental tort immunity-as the Montana Constitution does at Article II, Section 18-have also rejected the public duty doctrine altogether. <em>See Massee, </em>\u00b6 88 (Nelson, J., specially concurring and dissenting), and cases cited therein. We can tell her that this makes logical sense, because the public duty doctrine achieves the same result as governmental tort immunity \u2014 they both preclude a plaintiff from obtaining just compensation for injuries perpetrated by a negligent governmental actor. <em>See </em>Eugene McQuillin, <em>The Law of Municipal Corporations </em>vol. 18, \u00a7 53.04.25, at 197-98 (3d ed., West 2003) (\u201cThe public duty rule is not technically grounded in government immunity, though it achieves much the same results. Unlike immunity, which protects a municipality from liability for breach of an otherwise enforceable duty to the plaintiff, the public duty rule asks whether there was any enforceable duty to the plaintiff in the first place.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"AMkV\">\u00b673 And, we can point out to Doris that Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution states that governmental entities \u201cshall have <em>no </em>immunity from suit for injury to a person or property, except as may be specifically provided by law by a 2/3 vote of each house of the legislature\u201d (emphasis added). We can tell her that because the Montana Legislature has not adopted the public duty doctrine by a two-thirds vote of both houses-keep in mind that judges created this doctrine-it is clear that the doctrine is unconstitutional on its face. <em>See Prosser, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 73-75 (Nelson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b674 We can also tell Doris that even the black-letter law denies this Court its continuing use of the common law public duty doctrine. Specifically, \u00a7 1-1-108, MCA, says that \u201c[i]n this state there is no common law in any case where the law is declared by statute.\u201d Accordingly, the Montana Constitution\u2019s abrogation of tort immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>likewise abrogates the common law public duty doctrine. <em>See Prosser, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 71-72 (Nelson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b675 Yet, in the face of all this, we must also tell Doris that we will persist in applying the public duty doctrine to deny Montanans a just remedy for injuries perpetrated by governmental entities. If she concludes that our perpetuation of the public duty doctrine is little more than an exercise in legislating from the Bench, again she will be right. It is.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b676 No doubt Doris will also conclude that she and Jack have been victimized twice by their government-once when the Board violated the law and licensed Dr. Stephenson to practice medicine, and a second time when this Court absolved this violation of the law on the basis of an antiquated legal doctrine that is anathema to common sense, logic, the law, and our Constitution. Doris will be right, again.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b677 \u201cThe public duty doctrine frustrates the will of the people as expressed in Article II, Section 18, and this Court errs in perpetuating the doctrine\u2019s existence 36 years after the adoption of the Constitution. It is long past time that we consign this antiquated doctrine to the dustbin of history, where it belongs.\u201d <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 75 (Nelson, J., dissenting). I simply cannot agree that a judicially created, medieval throwback to the common law can be used to deprive Doris Nelson and Jack\u2019s estate of their right to the just remedy to which they are lawfully entitled. The Board should be held liable for its negligence and misfeasance in licensing Dr. Stephenson. The Board should be held accountable for violating the law. The King <em>can </em>do wrong. And in this case, the King did.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b678 I would reverse the District Court\u2019s decision. I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b265-8\">DISTRICT JUDGE SIMONTON</author>\n<p id=\"ARy\">concurs and dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">\u00b679 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision on Issue 1, and concur with its decision on Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">\u00b680 I would affirm the decision of the District Court granting summary judgment to the State on the issue of quasi-judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">\u00b681 Professional licensing statutes have two purposes: first, to protect the public; and second, to provide for the licensure of qualified professionals. The legislature\u2019s intent is that appointed members of a board regulating a profession determine who is qualified to be licensed. In this case, the Board of Medical Examiners is responsible for that decision. The Board of Medical Examiners consists of eleven members appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>include five members who have the degree of doctor of medicine; one member who has the degree of doctor of osteopathy; one member who is a licensed podiatrist; one member who is a licensed nutritionist; one member who is a licensed physician\u2019s assistant; and two members of the general public. The law applicable at the time Dr. Stephenson applied for licensure allowed the Department of Labor and Industry, at the direction of the Board, to issue three forms of certificates of licensure including a restricted certificate and a temporary certificate. To be eligible for any one of the three licenses, an applicant must be of good moral character \u201cas determined by the board\u201d; be a graduate of an approved medical school; have completed an approved internship of at least one year; and be able to communicate in English. Section 37-3-305, MCA. Subsection 2 allows a conditional or probationary license to be issued even if the Board is aware of unprofessional conduct or the applicant is otherwise unqualified. Only later, in \u00a7 37-3-321, MCA, is there any reference to \u201crefraining\u201d from issuing a license and requiring a contested case hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b682 Under \u00a7 37-3-321, MCA, if the Board determines that an applicant is not eligible for licensure, it shall refrain from authorizing the Department to issue a license. In such an instance, the Board shall mail to the applicant notice of its decision together with notice of a hearing before the Board. \u201cIf the applicant without cause fails to appear at the hearing or if after hearing the board determines he is not entitled to a license, the board shall refuse to grant the license.\u201d Section 37-3-321, MCA. The Court concludes that if a hearing occurs, a controversy then arises and quasi-judicial immunity would be a defense. \u00b6 31. However, the Board, after interviews and an investigation did determine that Dr. Stephenson was eligible for a temporary, conditional license under the authority of \u00a7 37-3-305, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A6R\">\u00b683 Admittedly, there was not a contested case hearing after the Board denied full licensure because under \u00a7 37-3-305(2), MCA, the Board authorized the Department to issue a license subject to conditions and limitations. It authorized the issuance of a temporary and restricted certificate after an investigation and two meetings between the applicant and the Board. Presumably, any information that could have been derived from a contested case hearing was gathered in a more informal manner at these meetings. The Board additionally made the applicant\u2019s conditional license subject to peer review and interviews with other physicians. It required additional education. Even though Dr. Stephenson\u2019s full licensure, which existed at the time of the alleged malpractice, was a process that took more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>than three years, the Plaintiff claims that the Board\u2019s considerations in 1995 and 1996 and its decision to issue a license are somehow causally related to any medical malpractice. I do not think it is necessary to reach the causation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b684 According to the Court and Plaintiff, the Board would be protected by quasi-judicial immunity if it had simply denied the license and issued a notice rather than conducting two interviews, an investigation, and other processes. If Dr. Stephenson then requested a hearing, one could have been held. If the Board had decided to issue the conditional temporary license, the defense of quasi-judicial immunity would be available. However, the Administrative Procedure Act allows for informal resolutions of contested cases, like the Board\u2019s actions with Dr. Stephenson. Section 2-4-603, MCA. That is exactly what was done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b685 I believe the controlling issue in this case is: Should a licensing board\u2019s failure to strictly perform administrative tasks negate the defense of quasi-judicial immunity, which would otherwise be available to a Board making a licensing decision? I would answer the question in the negative. Unlike the Court, I believe such a result is supported by prior decisions. The division that currently exists between administrative/ministerial functions and quasi-judicial functions can be clarified.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b686 In <em>Koppen v. Board of Medical </em>Examiners, 233 Mont. 214, 759 P.2d 173 (1988), this Court held that quasi-judicial immunity was a defense available to the Board of Medical Examiners despite its failure to take action on complaints about a doctor\u2019s competence. The Court recognized the discretion vested in the Board to grant, revoke, or suspend licenses. It discussed the procedure that must be followed to revoke or suspend a license, including the necessity of a contested case hearing. <em>Koppen, </em>233 Mont. at 219-20, 759 P.2d at 176. However, there was no contested case hearing in <em>Koppen </em>because the Board did nothing in response to the complaints. Whether that inaction was a conscious choice or the result of negligence does not appear significant to the Court. The inaction is treated as a quasi-judicial act protected from liability. I agree with the result in <em>Koppen </em>where the Court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">The opinions in <em>Ronek, Dept, of Justice </em>and <em>Butz </em>stand for the proposition that entities called upon to function judicially should be immunized in order to facilitate the proper execution of their duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>Koppen, </em>233 Mont. at 220, 759 P.2d at 176. The decision to take no action was made by the Board and not by an agency or department employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b687 The next decision in the line of cases on this subject is <em>State v. District Court, </em>246 Mont. 225, 805 P.2d 1272 (1990) <em>(Great Western Sugar). </em>In <em>Great Western Sugar, </em>employees of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation allowed an employer to self insure without requiring it to post security guaranteeing the availability of benefits. Employees of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation failed to follow administrative duties to determine whether the employer was eligible to self insure. None of the review necessary to make the determination was followed. The Court held, and I agree, that no quasi-judicial decision making was involved. <em>Great Western Sugar, </em>246 Mont. at 234, 805 P.2d at 1279. State employees had the responsibility to follow legislatively imposed duties to insure the availability of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. No discretion was involved. Had the employees properly done their jobs, the employer\u2019s eligibility to be self insured would have been obvious. And, as the Court notes in <em>Great Western Sugar, </em>246 Mont. at 233, 805 P.2d at 1278, there was no policy decision that required the conscious balancing of risks and advantages, which is a prerequisite to quasi-judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b688 In <em>Newville v. State, Dept. of Family Services, </em>267 Mont. 237, 883 P.2d 793 (1994), employees of the Department of Family Services approved an application to be foster parents, apparently after only a cursory examination, and the child was subsequently seriously injured in the care of those foster parents. The Court said no quasi-judicial act was performed by the employees and therefore, immunity was not available. Iagree with the result and again note that ATeicciiie involved employees and not a Board. The employees\u2019 acts were ministerial and not discretionary. The Department\u2019s actions were not discretionary, but were mandated by statute and were ministerial and administrative in nature. <em>Newville, </em>267 Mont. at 269, 883 P.2d at 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b689 Finally, in <em>Rahrer v. Bd. of Psychologists, </em>298 Mont. 28, 993 P.2d 680 (2000), this Court decided that the Board of Psychologists had quasi-judicial immunity in its pursuit of a complaint against a psychologist, its decision to investigate the complaint, and its decision to hold a contested case hearing. <em>Rahrer, </em>298 Mont. at 33, 993 P.2d at 683. Clearly in <em>Rahrer, </em>the decision by the Board of Psychologists to pursue the complaint was protected even though the ultimate decision to dismiss the complaint was made by a hearings examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u00b690 The decision by the Court in this case is the first where a licensing board\u2019s decision is not protected as a quasi-judicial act.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b691 In considering whether acts are ministerial or quasi-judicial in nature, I would also look at who performs those acts. There is certainly a difference between the actions of an employee who is performing what is required by his job (generally ministerial and administrative) and the discretionary decisions made by a Board appointed for its expertise in the licensing of professionals. The legislature has recognized the expertise of Board members in making them responsible for the screening and selection of applicants for licensure and for the discipline of licensees who act unprofessionally. This Court should grant that same deference to licensing boards. It may help resolve some of the confusion the Court recognized in <em>Great Western Sugar, </em>246 Mont. at 228-29, 805 P.2d at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b692 In general, any licensing board authorized by the legislature may \u201cgrant or deny a license and, upon a finding of unprofessional conduct by an applicant or license holder, impose a sanction provided by this chapter.\u201d Section 37-l-307(l)(e), MCA. Likewise, any Board which decides that a license applicant is unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety may restrict or limit the practice of the applicant, require completion of specific programs, monitor the practice, or establish conditions of probation for a designated period of time. Section 37-1-312(1), MCA. That statute, like \u00a7 2-4-603, MCA, also provides that the Board and a license applicant can enter into stipulated agreements to resolve disputes. The legislature recognized that not all applicants may initially be qualified for licensure and provided that the Board of Medical Examiners may hold hearings and establish programs to assist and rehabilitate those with mental or physical problems. Section 37-3-203, MCA. As previously stated, \u00a7 37-3-305(2), MCA, allows the Board to authorize the issuance of licenses subject to terms of probation, other conditions, or limitations that it sets. Once the Board receives an application, it may make an independent examination and can require whatever records and information it desires in determining whether the application should be granted. Section 37-3-309, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b693 The Court seems to ignore the authority and discretion of the Board by relying on the language in \u00a7 37-3-321, MCA, which says the Board shall refrain from authorizing the issuance of a license if the Board determines that the applicant does not possess the qualifications or that he has committed unprofessional conduct. In deciding that the applicant in this case is guilty of unprofessional conduct and is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>qualified to practice, the Court, however, is substituting its judgment for that of the Board. Fact finding is the province of the Board, not this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b694 The Court notes that the Board did exercise its authority and duties in requesting additional information and in determining that Dr. Stephenson should appear before it for a personal interview. Dr. Stephenson was questioned about the disciplinary action in California. Having considered that, the Board tabled his application and requested even more information. The Board contacted Dr. Stephenson\u2019s probation officer, three doctors who Dr. Stephenson had listed as references, and then held another personal interview with him. Only then did it authorize a temporary restricted license to Dr. Stephenson who was also given the option of declining it and then having a contested case hearing. Dr. Stephenson agreed to the conditions, and an informal resolution was reached. Only after peer reviews, additional education, and the passage of three years was Dr. Stephenson granted full licensure.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b695 After defining ministerial functions as a duty imposed by law where actions are not discretionary but mandated by statute, the Court limits quasi-judicial acts subject to immunity only if they are discretionary in nature and in the context of a contested or adversarial type of proceeding. Quasi-judicial function is defined in \u00a7 2-15-102(10), MCA, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">an adjudicatory function exercised by an agency, involving the exercise of judgment and discretion in making determinations in controversies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">It includes \u201cissuing, suspending, or revoking licenses, permits, and certificates.\u201d \u201cHolding hearings\u201d is only an example of a quasi-judicial function. Now the Court has limited the power of the Board to issue temporary or restricted licenses by requiring a contested case hearing before it will be protected by quasi-judicial immunity. In effect, the Court is saying the Board\u2019s decision to issue a medical license becomes a quasi-judicial function only after a contested case hearing is held. But it is the Board\u2019s initial inquiry or investigation and its discretionary weighing of facts, combined with its discretionary decision to grant or not grant a license that is the quasi-judicial function. In this instance, because the Board exercised its discretion to make its decision, it should be cloaked with the protection of quasi-judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b696 The Court states that the process involved in this case was never adversarial. There is no requirement that the process be adversarial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>There is a requirement that there be a controversy and certainly the applicant\u2019s request for full licensure and the Board\u2019s denial of it created a controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b697 In my opinion, the Court has substituted its judgment for that of a specialized board composed of individuals best qualified to decide who should be licensed to practice medicine and under what conditions. The decision to refrain from licensing and then to allow it on a temporary restricted basis was certainly not just a ministerial act, but was an exercise of the Board\u2019s discretion which should entitle it to quasi-judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b698 While I dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion on Issue 1,1 agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion on Issue 2 that the judgment of the District Court must nevertheless be affirmed because the Board is insulated from liability on the basis of the public duty doctrine.</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-6\">JUSTICES WARNER and RICE join in the foregoing dissent and concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
