Did delays between the answer hearing and the evidentiary hearing deny Triplett due process of law in his probation revocation proceeding?</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court unlawfully expand Triplett\u2019s sentence upon revocation of his suspended sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b65 On June 22,2005, the State filed an Information charging Triplett with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, felonies. The charges were based on Triplett, who was twenty-seven, having sexual intercourse with a fifteen year old girl. Triplett entered into a plea agreement with the State and pled guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent in exchange for the State dismissing the other two counts. On February 27, 2006, the District Court sentenced Triplett to MSP for twelve years with four years suspended. Triplett was made ineligible for parole until he completed Phase I and II of the Sex Offender Treatment Program. The court also imposed other conditions upon his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b66 Triplett then petitioned the Sentence Review Division for review of the District Court\u2019s sentence. After a hearing on May 5, 2006, the Sentence Review Division amended Triplett\u2019s sentence, imposing a forty-year sentence, all of which was suspended upon specific conditions. On June 8, 2006, the District Court issued an Amended Judgment and Commitment reflecting the Sentence Review Division\u2019s action. Triplett was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b67 On September 28, 2006, the State filed a Petition for Revocation of Suspended Sentence. The petition alleged Triplett had violated the conditions of his suspension, including: listing an incorrect address on his Sexual and Violent Offender Registration; having contact with the victim on several occasions; failing to successfully complete outpatient sexual offender treatment; failing to keep his probation officer apprised of his current address; having contact with a fourteen-year-old female without adult supervision; and failing to make payments on his court-assessed fines and fees and other financial obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b68 The District Court issued a bench warrant and Triplett was arrested on October 2, 2006. On October 17, 2006, Triplett made an initial appearance and the court informed Triplett of the allegations in the petition and of his rights. On October 24,2006, the court conducted an answer hearing, wherein Triplett denied each allegation of the petition. Triplett\u2019s counsel requested at least three to four weeks in which to prepare for an evidentiary hearing. Based on the parties\u2019 schedules and the court\u2019s calendar, the court then set an evidentiary hearing for December 22, 2006. On December 8, 2006, citing difficulties with interviewing witnesses, defense counsel moved to continue the hearing until January 2007, and the court rescheduled the hearing for January 9, 2007. On January 8, 2007, the parties filed a joint motion to continue the evidentiary hearing, based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>unavailability of witnesses. The District Court granted the motion and continued the hearing \u201c[t]o a date agreed by counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b69 On March 6,2007, Triplett filed a <em>pro se </em>motion titled Request for Electronic Monitoring. However, his motion also indicated that Triplett had hired private counsel, who was \u201cinvestigating the case and ... trying to get up to speed.\u201d On March 26, 2007, the court scheduled a hearing for April 6, 2007, for purposes of the evidentiary hearing on the petition and to address Triplett\u2019s motion for electronic monitoring. On April 6, the parties appeared for the hearing and the State moved to continue the hearing because the State had learned the previous day that the probation and parole officer had taken medical leave. The court thus continued the hearing until April 20, 2007. On April 19, 2007, Triplett filed a <em>pro se </em>motion requesting appointment of new counsel. The following day, both parties appeared before the court and Triplett stated he and his attorney had resolved their differences and he was ready to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b610 The parties advised the court they had reached an agreement for adjudication and recommended disposition. Pursuant to the agreement, Triplett answered \u201ctrue\u201d to some of the alleged violations of his sentence conditions in exchange for the State\u2019s agreement to request dismissal of other allegations and to recommend the court impose \u201cthe sentence it originally imposed, which was twelve years with the four suspended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b611 Based on his admissions, the court found Triplett did \u201cviolate the terms of the suspended portion of his previously imposed sentence.\u201d The District Court indicated it had not decided whether it would follow the terms of the plea agreement and scheduled a dispositional hearing for May 1,2007. At the May 1,2007 hearing, the court asked the State for its sentencing recommendation and, consistent with the plea agreement, the State recommended that Triplett be sentenced to \u201cthe original sentence,\u201d or twelve years with four suspended, with no possibility of parole until after completion of Phase I and II of the Sexual Offender Treatment Program. Counsel for Triplett concurred. The court then took a recess to review the sentencing statutes. Stating that it saw nothing in the statutes giving it authority to overturn the Amended Judgment and Commitment of the Sentence Review Division, the court sentenced Triplett to forty years in MSP with twenty years suspended. Triplett received credit for 595 days prior time served in prison and in jail during the revocation proceedings. \u00b612 Triplett appeals from the District Court\u2019s Order Revoking Suspended Sentence and Imposing Sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b613 This Court\u2019s review of questions regarding constitutional law is plenary. <em>State v. LaFreniere, </em>2008 MT 99, \u00b6 7, 342 Mont. 309, \u00b6 7, 180 P.3d 1161, \u00b6 7. More specifically, plenary review is applied to whether a court violated a probationer\u2019s constitutional right of due process. <em>State v. Finley, </em>2003 MT 239, \u00b6 10, 317 Mont. 268, \u00b6 10, 77 P.3d 193, \u00b6 10. Likewise, the interpretation and construction of a statute is a matter of law and we review whether the district court interpreted and applied a statute correctly de novo. See <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 196, \u00b6 10, 179 P.3d 534, \u00b6 10; <em>State v. Clark, </em>2006 MT 313, \u00b6 7, 335 Mont. 39, \u00b6 7, 149 P.3d 551, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b614 Did delays between the answer hearing and the evidentiary hearing deny Triplett due process of law in his probation revocation proceeding?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u00b615 Citing the \u201cwithout unreasonable delay\u201d language within \u00a7 46-18-203(4), MCA, Triplett argues the District Court \u201cunduly delayed [his] final revocation hearing\u201d in violation of this statute, \u201cresulting in prejudice to his liberty interests and associated due process rights.\u201d The State counters, stating Triplett \u201cfailed to prove that the district court denied him due process\u201d and \u201cfailed to establish that he was in any way prejudiced by the delay between the answer hearing and the evidentiary hearing.\u201d Both parties concede, and the record indicates, there were various delays between the answer hearing and the final evidentiary hearing. The disagreement arises, however, over whether there were \u201cundue\u201d delays that rise to the level of a due process violation and, if so, whether those delays prejudiced Triplett.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\u00b616  The due process rights of a probationer in a revocation proceeding are different from those afforded a defendant in a criminal proceeding. We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">The revocation hearing is not a criminal trial but a summary hearing to establish a violation of the conditions of the prisoner\u2019s probation. The probationer already stands convicted of a crime no matter what the grounds for the revocation may be, whether it is the commission of another crime or unauthorized travel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-10\"><em>State v. Kingery, </em>239 Mont. 160, 165, 779 P.2d 495, 498 (1989) (citing <em>Petition of Meidinger, </em>168 Mont. 7, 15, 539 P.2d 1185, 1190 (1975)). Further, the constitutional right to a speedy trial does not apply to a revocation of probation proceeding. <em>State v. Oppelt, </em>184 Mont. 48, 56, 601 P.2d 394, 399 (1979). However, because a probationer\u2019s liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>interests are at stake in this type of proceeding, \u201cthe minimum requirements of due process are extended to sentence revocation hearings.\u201d <em>State v. Pedersen, </em>2003 MT 315, \u00b6 21, 318 Mont. 262, \u00b6 21, 80 P.3d 79, \u00b6 21 (2003); <em>State v. Nelson, </em>225 Mont. 215, 218, 731 P.2d 1299, 1302 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b617 Due process protections for a revocation hearing are codified in \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">(4) Without unnecessary delay, the offender must be brought before the judge, and the offender must be advised of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">(a) the allegations of the petition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">(b) the opportunity to appear and to present evidence in the offender\u2019s own behalf;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">(c) the opportunity to question adverse witnesses; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">(d) the right to be represented by counsel at the revocation hearing. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">(5) A hearing is required before a suspended or deferred sentence can be revoked or the terms or conditions of the sentence can be modified . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Section 46-18-203(4)-(5), MCA (2005). This Court has held that \u201c[t]he foundation of the guarantee of due process is fairness, which calls for safeguards tailored to the demands of the particular legal context of probation revocation.\u201d <em>State v. Finley, </em>2003 MT 239, \u00b6 29, 317 Mont. 268, \u00b6 29, 77 P.3d 193, \u00b6 29 (citing <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S. Ct. 1756, 1760, 36 L.Ed.2d 656). In other words, \u201ca probation revocation hearing must be fundamentally fair.\u201d <em>State v. Pedersen, </em>2003 MT 315, \u00b6 20, 318 Mont. 262, \u00b6 20, 80 P.3d 79, \u00b6 20 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">\u00b618 Triplett argues he was denied due process because the State failed to bring him before the judge for his final revocation hearing \u201cwithout unnecessary delay,\u201d which he asserts is required by \u00a7 46-18-203(4), MCA. The State argues, and we agree, that the \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d language plainly refers to the first court appearance after an offender is arrested pursuant to a revocation petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">\u00b619 Triplett cites our holding in <em>State v. Swan </em>and offers that the language therein stating a \u201crevocation hearing should be \u2018held promptly\u2019 and defendant should be \u201cbrought before the court without unnecessary delay for a hearing on the violation charged,\u201d\u2019 demonstrates the applicability of the statutory language to a revocation hearing. 220 Mont. 162, 166, 713 P.2d 1003, 1006 (1986). Triplett\u2019s attempt to extend the holding of <em>Swan </em>and the \u201cwithout necessary delay\u201d statutory language to a revocation hearing negates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>the distinction <em>Swan </em>made between an initial hearing and the revocation hearing. This is a misapplication of <em>Swan, </em>and we have further explained that the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, apply <em>\u201cprior to </em>a revocation hearing ...\u201d <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 30 (emphasis added). It is clear the statutory language refers to a probationer\u2019s initial appearance before the court, when he is advised of the rights set forth in \u00a7 46-18-203(4)(a)-(d), MCA. In Triplett\u2019s case, this occurred well before the revocation proceeding, and his reliance on this authority is misplaced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b620 Triplett next sirgues that even if the \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d language of \u00a7 46-18-203(4), MCA, does not apply to the revocation hearing, minimum due process requirements require that a revocation hearing take place \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d As noted above, the standard this Court has articulated for determining whether a defendant was afforded minimum due process in a revocation proceeding is \u201cfundamental fairness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b621 After Triplett\u2019s arrest on October 2, 2006, initial appearance on October 17, 2006, and answer hearing on October 24, 2006, a series of delays and continuances occurred at the request of both parties. Counsel for Triplett requested a continuance on December 8,2006, and jointly moved with the State for continuance of the hearing scheduled for January 9, 2007. The court again granted the continuance and indicated it would schedule a new date agreeable with the parties\u2019 counsel. Triplett\u2019s March 6, 2007 motion for electronic monitoring indicated he had hired new counsel, leading the court to schedule a hearing for April 6,2007. Triplett then changed course two more times in regard to his counsel, ultimately reaffirming his satisfaction with appointed counsel. The parties reached an agreement for adjudication and recommended disposition on April 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b622  The delays at issue in this case arose out of the parties\u2019 scheduling needs, particularly Triplett\u2019s. Triplett also made multiple requests for change of counsel. Triplett is not in a position to claim the delays were unfair when his counsel procured many of them, either by seeking a continuance or by delaying efforts to schedule a hearing date, and when Triplett\u2019s requests for new counsel added to the uncertainty of the schedule. We conclude the scheduling of the revocation hearing was fundamentally fair and Triplett\u2019s due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b623 Did the District Court unlawfully expand Triplett\u2019s sentence upon revocation of his suspended sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b624 Triplett argues that, upon revocation of his suspension, the District Court unlawfully expanded his sentence by following the amended sentence imposed by the Sentence Review Division. Section 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA, provides that, upon revocation, a judge may \u201crequire the offender to serve either the sentence imposed or any sentence that could have been imposed that does not include a longer imprisonment or commitment term than the original sentence.\u201d Triplett contends the term \u201coriginal\u201d expressly refers to the sentence imposed by the District Court, rather than the amended sentence imposed by the Sentence Review Division, and thus the district court\u2019s sentence set the limits of the sentence which may be imposed upon revocation under the statute. The State replies that, when the Sentence Review Division has acted pursuant to its authority, the term \u201coriginal\u201d necessarily refers to the Sentence Review Division\u2019s amended sentence, and adoption of Triplett\u2019s interpretation of the statute \u201cwould render the work of the Sentence Review Division meaningless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b625 This Court construes a statute by reading and interpreting the statute as a whole, \u201cwithout isolating specific terms from the context in which they are used by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Montana Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. State, Montana Dept. of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 1, \u00b6 11, 185 P.3d 1003, \u00b6 11 (internal citations omitted). \u201cStatutory construction is a holistic endeavor and must account for the statute\u2019s text, language, structure and object.\u201d <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, \u00b6 24, 321 Mont. 280, \u00b6 24, 90 P.3d 426, \u00b6 24 (internal quotations and citations omitted). We must also \u201cread and construe each statute as a whole so as to avoid an absurd result and to give effect to the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Infinity Ins. Co. v. Dodson, </em>2000 MT 287, \u00b6 46, 302 Mont. 209, \u00b6 46, 14 P.3d 487, \u00b6 46 (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b626 With these standards in mind, we look to the context within which \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, operates and, more specifically, its relation to the sentence review process. The Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court is authorized under \u00a7 46-18-901, MCA. Pursuant thereto, a person sentenced to incarceration for a term of one year or more may apply for review of his sentence. Upon receiving such an application, the Sentence Review Division:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">(a)(i) shall review the judgment as it relates to the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>imposed and any other sentence imposed on the person at the same time; and (ii) may order a different sentence or sentences to be imposed as could have been imposed at the time of the imposition of the sentence under review, including a decrease or increase in the penalty; or (b) may decide that the sentence under review should stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Section 46-18-904(1), MCA. The decision of the Sentence Review Division in each case \u201cis final.\u201d Section 46-18-905(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b627 This Court has held that review before the Sentence Review Division, like the original sentencing itself, is a critical stage of a criminal proceeding. <em>Ranta v. State, </em>1998 MT 95, \u00b6 29, 288 Mont. 391, \u00b6 29, 958 P.2d 670, \u00b6 29. The sentence review process is unique; it has aspects similar to sentencing before a district court and to an appeal. Sentence review resembles an appellate process because it is the only opportunity a defendant has to challenge an otherwise lawful sentence on equitable grounds. <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 27. In conducting its review, the Sentence Review Division functions as an arm of this Court and if the legislature were to abolish the review division, this function would simply return to this Court. <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 27. Like decisions issued directly by this Court, the Sentence Review Division decisions are final, cannot be appealed and are reported in the Montana Reports. <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 27. Pursuant to statute and the Division\u2019s rules, a district court must re-sentence a defendant in accordance with the sentence imposed by the Division. Section 46-18-904(1), MCA; Rule 19, Rules of Sentence Review Division, promulgated under \u00a7 46-18-901, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b628 However, the sentence review process is also similar to the sentencing procedures of a district court. The Sentence Review Division has authority to impose any sentence which \u201ccould have been imposed\u201d by the district court in the first instance. This includes increasing the sentence, a power this Court does not possess on appellate review. Section 46-18-904(l)(a)(2), MCA; <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 28. The Review Division can \u201crequire the production of presentence reports and any other records, documents, or exhibits relevant to the review proceedings.\u201d Section 46-18-904(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u00b629 Triplett gleans from the holding in <em>Ranta </em>that this Court \u201chas assumed that a sentence amended by the [Sentence Review Division] does not become the \u201coriginal\u201d sentence.\u201d At issue in <em>Ranta </em>was the defendant\u2019s right to counsel in a sentence review proceeding. Thus, our holding that the Sentence Review Division process is a \u201ccritical stage of the proceedings\u201d necessitating application of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel did not infer or assume that the Sentence Review Division\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>amended sentence did not qualify as the \u201coriginal\u201d sentence for purposes of applying the revocation sentencing provision of \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b630 Under the interpretational standards articulated above, we must read and interpret \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, holistically so as to avoid an absurd result and to give effect to the purpose of the statute. The only logical interpretation of \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, in light of the authority of the Sentence Review Division, is that a sentence imposed by the Division steps into the stead of the previous district court sentence and, in effect, becomes the \u201coriginal\u201d sentence for purposes of revocation. Indeed, the statute says that Division sentences are \u201cfinal.\u201d Only this interpretation can give meaning and purpose to the sentence review process as a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the criminal proceeding. Any other interpretation would yield an absurd result. As the State notes, adopting Triplett\u2019s interpretation would allow a defendant to apply for sentence review and, upon receiving an unfavorable sentence, force a revocation proceeding to return to the sentence imposed by the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b631  Upon issuance of the Sentence Review Division\u2019s decision amending Triplett\u2019s sentence, an amended judgment was entered by the District Court. The Division\u2019s decision was published in Montana Reports and Triplett was notified of the amended judgment. It became final. We conclude that, for purposes of a sentence revocation proceeding, the amended sentence imposed by the Sentence Review Division superseded the sentence Triplett received from the District Court, and the District Court, upon revocation of that sentence, could impose a sentence not exceeding the terms of that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b632 Triplett chose to apply to the Sentence Review Division and the process initially worked to his advantage-he received a new sentence that reduced his prison time and allowed him to be released, with the power to remain out of prison. Now that his sentence has been revoked, Triplett cannot now escape that sentence by arguing it is not the \u201creal\u201d sentence after all.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\u00b633  Triplett\u2019s final revocation hearing was not unduly delayed. Scheduling of the final revocation hearing was fundamentally fair and Triplett\u2019s due process rights were not violated. Additionally, the term \u201coriginal,\u201d as used in \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA, does not refer to Triplett\u2019s initial sentence from the District Court, as that sentence has been superseded by the amended sentence imposed by the Sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Review Division. Thus, the District Court did not unlawfully expand Triplett\u2019s sentence upon revocation of his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-5\">JUSTICES MORRIS, NELSON, LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> Triplett does not claim the fifteen days between his arrest and his initial appearance or the seven days between his initial appearance and the answer hearing, in and of themselves, violate either the statute or constitutional due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
