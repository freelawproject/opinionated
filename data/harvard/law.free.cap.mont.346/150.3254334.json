We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b62 The State filed a petition for revocation in Cause No. DC 00-230, alleging that Humphrey had violated the conditions of a previously imposed suspended sentence. In addition, in three separate cases, the State charged Humphrey with the following offenses: felony theft and five counts of misdemeanor unsworn falsification to authorities (DC 03-075), felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs (DC 04-962), and felony criminal possession with intent to distribute (DC 05-154).</p>\n<p id=\"AmW\">\u00b63 The State and Humphrey ultimately negotiated a plea agreement under \u00a7 46-12-211(c), MCA, to dispose of all four cases. The agreed-upon sentencing recommendations were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u2022 DC 00-230: four years at the Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">\u2022 DC 03-075: ten years at DOC with three years suspended, plus a concurrent six-month jail term which was suspended except for time served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">\u2022 DC 04-962: five years at DOC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">\u2022 DC 05-154: ten years at DOC with five years suspended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">The four sentences were to run concurrently. Thus, the net effect of the plea agreement was a ten-year sentence at DOC with three years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">\u00b64 At the change-of-plea hearing on May 24,2005, the District Court advised Humphrey of the maximum possible penalty for each offense. The court also advised Humphrey that \u201cthis is a non-binding plea agreement on the Court, and if the Court does not follow the plea agreement, you will not be allowed to withdraw your plea of Guilty as a matter of law.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-12-211(2), MCA. Humphrey responded, \u201cYes, sir, I do understand that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">\u00b65 Just prior to the court\u2019s accepting Humphrey\u2019s guilty pleas, the prosecutor interrupted the proceeding and pointed out that the sentence recommended in DC 03-075 (ten years at DOC with three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>years suspended) was illegal because all but the first five years of a sentence to DOC must be suspended. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-201(3)(d)(i), MCA (2001). The prosecutor suggested amending the plea agreement to reflect a recommendation under DC 03-075 of ten years at the Montana State Prison (\u201cMSP\u201d) with three years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b66 Defense counsel stated that he had already \u201cexplained to Mr. Humphrey that even though the plea offer said DOC, the reality was probably going to be MSP, given the amount of time.\u201d Humphrey then suggested suspending five years instead of three. He also stated he did not want a sentence that would preclude him from getting treatment for his drug addiction. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">[The Court]: Mr. Humphrey, um, let me just try to explain a couple of things if I could. I understand that you\u2019re, I think you said \u201cI\u2019d like to get a five DOC suspended.\u201d Well, the reality is, you\u2019ve got four different cases here. I don\u2019t know how many felonies. Like, five felonies, and you have a criminal possession with intent to distribute, which is a very egregious crime. Nobody\u2019s going to give you a five-year suspended and, um, I certainly am not going to, in fact, I think ten MSP with three suspended is very generous. That\u2019s basically what you\u2019re looking at. You have all these different charges that are running concurrent. And so, I guess, I want to make sure, do you want to go forward? You are looking at a plea agreement of a ten-year Montana State Prison, with three suspended. Do you, are you willing to go forward, knowing that that is truly what the recommendation is going to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">[Humphrey]: Yes, sir, I am. The reason I said that sir, is \u2018cause I want treatment for my drug addiction problem. And the way I understand it, the only way to do that is if it\u2019s below five, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">[The Court]: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know where you got that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">[Humphrey]: That was my understanding, that\u2019s the only reason I said that, \u2018cause, like I told my attorney here, I want to get treatment, I want to get well so if I come back out here, I don\u2019t gotta do this stuff all over again. I don\u2019t want to be back in here no more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u00b67 The District Court then struck the term \u201cDOC\u201d on the plea agreement under DC 03-075 and wrote \u201cMSP\u201d in its place. Thus, the recommended sentence read: \u201cTen (10) years MSP with three (3) years suspended ....\u201d Both defense counsel and Humphrey initialed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>revisions. Thereafter, the court accepted Humphrey\u2019s guilty pleas and his admissions to the alleged probation violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b68 On August 30, 2005, a probation/parole officer with DOC filed a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). Admittedly \u201cstray[ing]\u201d from the parties\u2019 plea agreement, the officer recommended sentences amounting to twenty-two years at MSP with seven years suspended. As grounds for this recommendation, she cited the \u201csheer volume of resources it has taken to stop this defendant\u2019s criminal activity in the community\u2019 and her determination that Humphrey \u201chas not led a law-abiding life for any substantial period of time before the commission of these crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b69 The parties appeared before the District Court that same day for purposes of sentencing and disposition. With respect to the State\u2019s recommendation, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[T]he State would ask that the Court follow the plea agreement. I would state that the PSI author ... does disagree with the State\u2019s recommendation and the plea agreement.\u201d Defense counsel also urged the court to follow the plea agreement, acknowledging that it was \u201csomewhat lenient\u201d but arguing that it was appropriate in light of Humphreys poor health. Humphrey then spoke on his own behalf, apologizing for \u201call the trouble\u201d he had caused and requesting that the court go along with the plea agreement. Notwithstanding, the District Court adopted the recommendation of the probation/parole officer in the PSI and imposed the following sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\u2022 DC 00-230: seven years at MSP, all suspended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\u2022 DC 03-075: ten years at MSP, plus concurrent six-month jail terms, which were suspended except for time served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">\u2022 DC 04-962: five years at MSP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">\u2022 DC 05-154: ten years at MSP with five years suspended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">The sentences in DC 00-230, DC 03-075, and DC 04-962 are to run consecutively. The sentence in DC-05-154 is to run concurrently with the others. Thus, the net effect of the sentences is twenty-two years at MSP with seven years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">\u00b610 Humphrey now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">\u00b611 Humphreys primary argument on appeal is that his guilty pleas were not voluntarily and knowingly made because he was \u201cnot adequately informed of the consequences\u201d of pleading guilty. In addition, Humphrey makes a somewhat offhand assertion that the prosecutor breached the plea agreement when, at the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>hearing, she informed the court that the author of the PSI did not agree with the State\u2019s recommendation. Humphrey\u2019s corresponding argument, however, is a single sentence, in which he observes that \u201c[Requesting the sentencing court follow the plea agreement while at the same time specifically pointing out the pre-sentence author\u2019s disagreement with the sentencing recommendation is a questionable practice.\u201d Humphrey fails to explain why the prosecutor\u2019s statement amounts to a breach of the plea agreement; and while he cites <em>State v. Bowley, </em>282 Mont. 298, 311, 938 P.2d 592, 599 (1997), in support of his position, <em>Bowley </em>appears to be distinguishable from the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajy\">\u00b612 It is well-established that this Court will not consider unsupported issues or arguments and is under no obligation to locate authorities or formulate arguments for a party in support of positions taken on appeal. <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, \u00b6 6, 53 P.3d 1266, \u00b6 6; <em>State v. Miller, </em>2008 MT 106, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 355, \u00b6 15, 181 P.3d 625, \u00b6 15. Accordingly, we will not address Humphrey\u2019s breach-of-agreement contention. Rather, we have determined the sole issue on appeal is whether Humphrey\u2019s guilty plea was involuntary because he was not adequately advised of the consequences of pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b613 The question of whether a plea was entered voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review de novo. <em>State v. Deserly, </em>2008 MT 242, \u00b6 9, 344 Mont. 468, \u00b6 9, 188 P.3d 1057, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b614 Because the process of pleading guilty to a criminal charge involves a waiver of numerous constitutional rights and protections, a guilty plea must be a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant. <em>State v. Radi, </em>250 Mont. 155, 159, 818 P.2d 1203, 1206 (1991) <em>(citing North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160 (1970)). To that end, before accepting a guilty plea, the trial judge must ensure that the defendant understands each of the considerations set out in \u00a7 46-12-210(1), MCA. Those include \u201cthe nature of the charge for which the plea is offered,\u201d \u201cthe maximum penalty provided by law\u201d for each charge, and the fact that \u201cif the defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere in fulfillment of a plea agreement, the court is not required to accept the terms of the agreement.\u201d Section 46-12-210(l)(a)(i), (a)(iii), (d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u00b615 To determine the voluntariness of a guilty plea, this Court applies the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 90 S. Ct. 1463 (1970). <em>See Deserly, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6 21, 326 Mont. 214, \u00b6 21, 108 P.3d 500, \u00b6 21. Under that standard,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">a plea of guilty entered by one fully aware of the direct consequences, including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor, or his own counsel, must stand unless induced by threats (or promises to discontinue improper harassment), misrepresentation (including unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises), or perhaps by promises that are by their nature improper as having no proper relationship to the prosecutor\u2019s business (e.g. bribes).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><em>Brady, </em>397 U.S. at 755, 90 S. Ct. at 1472 (internal quotation marks omitted). The voluntariness of a plea \u201ccan be determined only by considering all of the relevant circumstances surrounding it.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>397 U.S. at 749, 90 S. Ct. at 1469.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b616 In the present case, Humphrey acknowledges that before he changed his pleas, the District Court correctly advised him of the maximum possible penalty for each charge and the fact that the court was not bound by the parties\u2019 plea agreement. Humphrey claims, however, that later in the change-of-plea proceeding, the District Court \u201cagreed to be bound by the parties[\u2019] plea agreement despite the court\u2019s earlier advice to the contrary.\u201d As support for this proposition, Humphrey cites the discussion among the court, the prosecutor, defense counsel, and Humphrey concerning the sentence recommended in the plea agreement under DC 03-075. As noted, the prosecutor pointed out that a sentence of ten years at DOC with three years suspended was illegal and, thus, needed to be revised to read \u201cten years at MSP with three years suspended.\u201d Humphrey argues the District Court\u2019s \u201cactions in changing the terms on the [plea agreement], coupled with the court\u2019s repeated references to the ten with three year sentence Humphrey was \u2018looking at\u2019 justifiably led Humphrey to the conclusion that the actual sentence he was to receive upon his change of plea would be a ten year sentence to [MSP], with three suspended.\u201d In light of this allegedly \u201cinconsistent advice\u201d he received during the change-of-plea colloquy, Humphrey contends he was not \u201cadequately advised\u201d of the consequences of pleading guilty. Humphrey also seems to suggest his pleas were involuntary because they were induced by an unfulfilled promise, namely, that the court would follow sentencing recommendations in the plea agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>\u00b617 Before addressing this argument, we note the State\u2019s contention that Humphrey\u2019s claim is procedurally barred by \u00a7 1-3-207, MCA, and <em>State v. Micklon, </em>2003 MT 45, \u00b6 10, 314 Mont. 291, \u00b6 10, 65 P.3d 559, \u00b6 10. According to the State, Humphrey\u2019s claim is based on an error to which he \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the District Court. The State points to the fact that Humphrey initialed the change of \u201cDOC\u201d to \u201cMSP\u201d on the plea agreement. This contention, however, is wholly without merit and completely misstates Humphrey\u2019s argument. Humphrey did not \u201cacquiesce\u201d in a sentence beyond the plea agreement by initialing this change. Moreover, he does not claim the District Court erred; rather, he claims the court\u2019s statements and actions led him to believe the court was agreeing to be bound by the agreement. Humphrey\u2019s claim is not procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b618 Nevertheless, the portions of the colloquy on which Humphrey relies do not support his argument. Indeed, the District Court informed him not that it would follow the plea agreement, but that it was changing \u201cDOC\u201d to \u201cMSP\u201d in accordance with the parties\u2019 discussion, in which Humphrey himself had just participated. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">I think ten MSP with three suspended is very generous. That\u2019s basically what you\u2019re looking at. You have all these different charges that are running concurrent. And so, I guess, I want to make sure, do you want to go forward? You are looking at a plea agreement of a ten-year Montana State Prison, with three suspended. Do you, are you willing to go forward, knowing that that is truly what the recommendation is going to be?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b619 Humphrey emphasizes the court\u2019s statements, \u201cI think ten MSP with three suspended is very generous. That\u2019s basically what you are looking at.\u201d When these statements are read in context, however, it is clear the court was referring to the corrected <em>recommendation </em>in the plea agreement under DC 03-075. Indeed, immediately after making these statements, the court told Humphrey he was looking at \u201ca plea agreement\u201d of ten years at MSP with three suspended and that this was truly what the \u201crecommendation\u201d was going to be. Moreover, this entire discussion related to the problem that a ten-year commitment to \u201cDOC\u201d with three years suspended was illegal and the plea agreement, therefore, needed to be revised to read \u201cMSP.\u201d The court\u2019s remarks do not amount to an assurance that it was actually going to impose this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b620 Humphrey also relies on the conversation which occurred shortly after the quoted text above. He emphasizes the language italicized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">[The Court]: Okay. <em>So I\u2019m going to make a change on here that says ten years, Montana State Prison. Are you okay with that? Because I\u2019m going to have you initial it just so that there is no misunderstanding. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">[Humphrey]: I wanted DOC, though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">[Defense Counsel]: Well, we talked about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">[The Court]: It\u2019s on page three, if you\u2019d have Mr. Humphrey review that, and if he understands that\u2019s what we are talking about in reality...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">[Humphrey]: What is the difference between an MSP commitment and a DOC commitment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">[The Court]: The most you can suspend on a DOC is five years. That\u2019s not true on a MSP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">[Humphrey]: That\u2019s the only difference between a DOC and MSP?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqi\">[The Court]: Well, MSP means for sure, you are going to go to prison. With a long sentence on this like a with a DO... a DOC sentence means the DOC department, Department of Corrections decides where you are going to go. It\u2019s not a for certain that it\u2019s going to be prison. <em>What I can tell you as [Defense Counsel] said, when you are looking at a ten with three suspended, it will be Montana State Prison. That\u2019s their policy. This just makes it clear up front, to you, that your first step will be the Montana State Prison.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-11\">[Humphrey]: The &lt;inaudible&gt; time and all that stuff is all the same with MSP as it is with DOC and...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">[The Court]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">[Humphrey]: Oh, okay. Well, that\u2019s what I was worried about. I was wondering about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">Again, when the District Court\u2019s statements are read in context, it is clear that the court was simply explaining the revision of \u201cDOC\u201d to \u201cMSP\u201d in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">\u00b621 Humphrey, nevertheless, apparently viewed things differently, and this brings us to the crux of the issue. He claims the District Court conveyed \u201cthe impression\u201d that it had agreed to be bound by the terms of the plea agreement. He also claims the court\u2019s comments and actions gave him \u201cthe understanding\u201d that the only sentence he was facing was the sentence that had been recommended by the parties. In essence, Humphrey maintains he subjectively believed the courtwould follow the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">\u00b622 As stated above, a plea of guilty must be a \u201cvoluntary, knowing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\u201d <em>Radi, </em>250 Mont. at 159, 818 P.2d at 1206. Accordingly, before pleading guilty, the defendant must be \u201cfully aware\u201d of the direct consequences of doing so, <em>Brady, 397 </em>U.S. at 755, 90 S. Ct. at 1472 (internal quotation marks omitted), and must \u201cunderstand[ ]\u201d the rights and protections being waived, \u00a7 46-12-210(1), MCA. These standards suggest our analysis must take into account Humphrey\u2019s subjective perceptions. <em>See Caudill v. Jago, </em>747 F.2d 1046, 1050 (6th Cir. 1984) (\u201cThis court must . . . assess the voluntariness of [the defendant\u2019s] plea in light of all the relevant circumstances surrounding that plea, including the subjective perceptions of the defendant at the time of his agreeing to plead guilty.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>cf. United States ex rel. Thurmond v. Mancusi, </em>275 F. Supp. 508, 516 (E.D.N.Y. 1967) (\u201c[V]oluntariness connotes a state of mind of an actor. If the actor-i.e., the defendant-believes that a promise has been made, the effect on his state of mind is exactly the same as if such a promise had in fact been made. Thus, any test of whether a person acts voluntarily is necessarily \u2018subjective.\u2019 \u201d); <em>but see United States ex rel. LaFay v. Fritz, </em>455 F.2d 297, 303 (2d Cir. 1972) (rejecting <em>Thurmond\u2019s </em>subjective test).</p>\n<p id=\"A9U\">\u00b623  Yet, while a defendant\u2019s subjective perceptions shed light on his state of mind, which in turn bears on the voluntariness of his plea, allegations of having had certain mental impressions at the time of the plea must be supported by objective proof in the record. <em>See United States ex rel. Robinson v. Housewright, </em>525 F.2d 988, 991-92 (7th Cir. 1975) (\u201cWe deem it preferable to base an analysis upon objective record facts rather than upon the defendant\u2019s recital of what he now claims were his subjective mental impressions.\u201d); <em>Toler v. Wyrick, </em>563 F.2d 372, 373 (8th Cir. 1977) (\u201cDetermination of the defendant\u2019s state of mind is certainly critical in determining the voluntariness of a plea. However, to a large extent, it is to be determined by examining the totality of the circumstances surrounding the plea instead of solely on the basis of the defendant\u2019s subsequent testimony.\u201d (citations omitted)). Moreover, the mental impressions must be reasonably justified under the circumstances. Of particular relevance to the issue at hand, the court in <em>People v. Artale, </em>612 N.E.2d 910 (Ill. App. 2 Dist. 1993), observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">In the absence of substantial objective proof showing that a defendant\u2019s mistaken impressions were reasonably justified, subjective impressions alone are not sufficient grounds on which to vacate a guilty plea. Rather, the burden is on the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>establish that the circumstances existing at the time of the plea, judged by objective standards, justified the mistaken impression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADdf\"><em>Artale, </em>612 N.E.2d at 915 (citation omitted). Numerous cases espouse a similar rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b624 This approach, with which we agree, is critical to the finality of guilty pleas. Without it, a defendant could plead guilty \u201cwith the assurance that if he should later be disappointed at the treatment accorded him he could withdraw his plea and demand a trial on the ground that at the time of his guilty plea he had labored under an erroneous impression as to what would happen to him after acceptance of the plea.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Curtis v. Zelker, </em>466 F.2d 1092, 1098 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>see also Calabrese v. United States, </em>507 F.2d 259, 260 (1st Cir. 1974) (\u201cIn the absence of any indication that appellant was misled by the prosecutor, or that the sentencing court failed adequately to probe appellant\u2019s state of mind, we cannot look into the subjective mental set of appellant to see to what extent misconceptions played a part in his guilty plea.... [S]uch a rule would virtually give a defendant an argument for a veto every time he received a sentence not to his liking.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b625 This approach is also consistent with the objective standard applicable in other related contexts. For instance, in determining whether a plea agreement has been broken, \u201ccourts look to what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>reasonably understood by [the defendant] when he entered his plea of guilty. If disputed, the terms of the agreement will be determined by objective standards.\u201d <em>United States v. Clark, </em>781 F.2d 730, 731 (9th Cir. 1986) (brackets in original, citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, in <em>State v. Brown, </em>262 Mont. 499, 503-04, 865 P.2d 282, 284-85 (1993), we held that a trial court must strictly comply with \u00a7 46-12-210(l)(a)(iii), MCA, and correctly inform a defendant of the maximum possible penalty for the charged offense, irrespective of whether the defendant may already have subjective knowledge of the maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b626 Here, as noted, Humphrey claims the District Court\u2019s \u201cactions in changing the terms on the [plea agreement], coupled with the court\u2019s repeated references to the ten with three year sentence Humphrey was \u2018looking at\u2019justifiably led Humphrey to the conclusion that the actual sentence he was to receive upon his change of plea would be a ten year sentence to [MSP], with three suspended.\u201d We cannot agree that this mistaken impression was reasonably justified under the circumstances existing at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b627 The parties and the court were correcting an error in the plea agreement, and Humphrey\u2019s statements indicate he understood this. It does not appear during the colloquy that the court \u201cagreed to be bound\u201d by the plea agreement; rather, it is clear the court sought to clarify the sentencing recommendation, explain the difference between \u201cDOC\u201d and \u201cMSP,\u201d and ensure that Humphrey was \u201cwilling to go forward, knowing that that is truly what the <em>recommendation </em>is going to be\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b628 Humphrey\u2019s own statements are consistent with this interpretation. Indeed, though he expressed concern about being sentenced to MSP instead of DOC, he did not indicate in any way that he thought the court was promising to follow the plea agreement. While he now claims he did, in fact, understand the District Court to be assuring him of a particular sentence, there is not substantial objective proof in the record supporting this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b629 Lastly, we are not persuaded by Humphrey\u2019s proffered scenario that he began the change-of-plea hearing with the understanding that the District Court was not bound by the plea agreement, that he was willing at that point to plead guilty, but that his pleas ultimately were involuntary because the court\u2019s subsequent actions led him to believe the court was binding itself to the plea agreement. If he was willing to plead guilty knowing the court was not bound by the plea agreement, we fail to understand why the court\u2019s actions suddenly caused him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>be willing to plead guilty <em>only if </em>the court agreed to be bound by the plea agreement. This -unexpressed change of heart, being highly implausible, requires greater substantiation than Humphrey has provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aub\">\u00b630  Humphrey has failed to show with substantial objective proof that his mistaken impression-namely, that the District Court had \u201cagreed to be bound\u201d by the plea agreement-was reasonably justified \u25a0under the circumstances existing at the time of his pleas. Thus, he has not established his guilty pleas in this case were involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"AP9\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\"> <em>See United States v.
