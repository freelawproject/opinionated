Twite Family Partnership, Lloyd A. Twite, Scott Twite, d/b/a Scott Twite Construction, and C. &amp; L. Trust (collectively, \u201cthe Twites\u201d), appeal the order from the Fourth Judicial District Court granting summary judgment in favor of Unitrin Multiline Insurance and Security National Insurance (\u201cSecurity National\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\u00b62 The Twites operate a construction company which builds housing complexes. The Twites held a commercial package insurance policy with Security National that included the Commercial General Liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policy at issue here. Under the CGL policy, Security National had a duty to defend the Twites against lawsuits alleging \u201cbodily injury\u201d that resulted from a covered \u201coccurrence.\u201d Both terms are specifically defined in the policy and discussed in more detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"Aly\">\u00b63 Montana Fair Housing, Inc. (\u201cMFH\u201d) and its Executive Direction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Robert Liston (\u201cListon\u201d) filed a complaint in federal court against the Twites, alleging several counts of negligence, as well as violations of the federal Fair Housing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d) and the Montana Human Rights Act (\u201cMHRA\u201d). The complaint was brought on behalf of MFH and Liston, and on behalf of MFH\u2019s staff, members, and constituents who are disabled or have family members with disabilities (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d). The Plaintiffs alleged that the design and construction of several housing complexes designed and built by the Twites failed to comply with state and federal requirements, and thus denied equal use and access to persons with disabilities. The complaint charged the Twites with intentionally violating Plaintiffs\u2019 fair housing rights and engaging in a pattern of discrimination against those with disabilities in the design, construction, operation, and management of these housing complexes.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b64 The Twites tendered the claim to Security National for defense. Security National refused to defend or indemnify, explaining that it did not believe the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged any property damage, bodily injury, or occurrence covered by the policy. During discovery, the Twites sought a more specific description of the Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Liston responded that he was seeking damages for \u201ccompensable emotional harm based on the emotional impact to him as a result of the denial of his rights to access the subject property and the violation of his fundamental rights....\u201d Liston also refused to admit that he did not suffer \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d The Twites forwarded this information to Security National, arguing that Liston\u2019s claim for emotional damages fell within the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d under Montana law. Again, Security National refused to defend or indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b65 The Twites subsequently filed this suit against Security National, alleging statutory and common law breach of contract and breach of statutory duties. Security National moved for summary judgment, arguing that as a matter of law, no duty to defend existed because no bodily injury or property damage was alleged on the face of the complaint. In response, the Twites filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the breach of contract issue, which the District Court denied. The District Court granted Security National\u2019s summary judgment motion, and found that none of the allegations made in the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint were covered under the policy and thus, Security National had no duty to defend. The Twites appeal this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b66 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>judgment, using the criteria set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Hogenson Const. of North Dakota v. Montana State Fund, </em>2007 MT 267, \u00b6 11, 339 Mont. 389, \u00b6 11, 170 P.3d 471, \u00b6 11. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Hogenson, </em>\u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b67 An insurer has a duty to defend its insured against complaints that allege \u201cfacts which represent a risk covered by the terms of [the] insurance policy.\u201d <em>Blair v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>2007 MT 208, \u00b6 15, 339 Mont. 8, \u00b6 15, 167 P.3d 888, \u00b6 15. To determine whether Security National had a duty to defend the Twites, we look first to the coverage afforded by the policy, and next, to the facts alleged by MFH\u2019s complaint, to determine whether the alleged facts fall within the policy\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">A. Coverage Under the Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b68 The scope of an insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured is determined by the language of the insurance policy. <em>Grimsrud v. Hagel, </em>2005 MT 194, \u00b6 34, 328 Mont. 142, \u00b6 34, 119 P.3d 47, \u00b6 34 (citation omitted). If the facts alleged in the complaint do not come within the policy\u2019s terms, then there is no duty to defend. <em>Grimsrud, </em>\u00b6 34. The Twites\u2019 CGL policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">We [Security National] will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u201csuit\u201d seeking those damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The policy defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">This policy only covers bodily injury that: 1) occurs during the policy period, and 2) \u201cis caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 that takes place in the \u2018coverage territory.\u2019 \u201d An \u201coccurrence\u201d is \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d In sum, under this CGL policy, Security National has a duty to defend the Twites against complaints that allege bodily injury arising from an accident which occurred during the policy period and within the coverage territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">B. Facts Alleged in MFH\u2019s Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">\u00b69 The Plaintiffs alleged the following injuries in their federal complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>[Plaintiffs] have been denied an increase in the accessible housing stock [in Missoula]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">Plaintiffs have suffered injury to their ability to carry out the purpose of Montana Fair Housing to find and to make available decent, affordable and accessible rental housing for persons regardless of disability....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">Plaintiff Bob Liston has suffered injury to his ability to perform his job....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">Plaintiff MFH [has] suffer [ed] economic losses in staff pay, in the inability to undertake other efforts to end unlawful housing practices, in lost opportunities to pursue funding, and in other diversion of resources....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, to compensate for these alleged harms.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u00b610 The duty to defend is triggered when a complaint alleges facts that, if proven, would result in coverage. <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 21, 321 Mont. 99, \u00b6 21, 90 P.3d 381, \u00b6 21. None of the injuries alleged by MFH on the face of the complaint come within the policy definition of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Each injury alleged by MFH stems from the Twites\u2019 design and construction of the housing complexes. The Twites\u2019 alleged failure to comply with the requirements of the FHA and the MHRA is not an accident that meets the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d under the CGL policy. Even if we assume that every allegation in MFH\u2019s complaint were true, no fact alleged on the face of this complaint would bring it within the coverage of the CGL policy. In short, no duty to defend is triggered by the allegations on the face of this complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\u00b611 The Twites, however, argue that Security National should have looked beyond the four corners of the complaint in assessing whether or not it had a duty to defend. The Twites claim that during discovery, information was revealed which triggered Security National\u2019s duty to defend. In response to the Twites\u2019 requests for admission, the Plaintiffs refused to admit that they had not suffered personal injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">Request for Admission No. 18: Please admit Plaintiffs did not suffer personal injury, including emotional distress, because of these Defendants [sic] actions, errors or omissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-11\">MFH Answer: Admit to the extent the organization cannot sustain such personal injury but deny to the extent Montana Fair Housing [sic] sustained diversion of resources and frustration of its organizational goals and purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-12\">Liston Answer: Deny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Additionally, in response to the Twites\u2019 interrogatories, Liston stated he was seeking damages for the \u201ccompensable emotional harm\u201d he suffered, \u201cbased on the emotional impact to him as a result of the denial of his rights to access the subject property and the violation of his fundamental rights in that regard.\u201d Emotional injury, the Twites argue, is a form of bodily injury under Montana law in some circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\">\u00b612 We do not reach the question of whether Security National had a duty to look beyond the four corners of the complaint in assessing its duty to defend. Even assuming that a duty to defend could arise from facts uncovered during discovery, the facts alleged above still do not come with the policy\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b613 Even if we assume that Liston did suffer \u201ccompensable emotional harm\u201d and that emotional harm could qualify as \u201cbodily injury\u201d under the policy\u2019s definition, the alleged emotional harm did not arise from a covered \u201coccurrence.\u201d As discussed above, the scope of the insurer\u2019s duty to defend is defined by the language of the policy. <em>Grimsrud, </em>\u00b6 34. The Twites\u2019 policy only covers bodily injuries that arise from \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d The Plaintiffs allege that their injuries occurred as a result of the design and construction of the housing units-not as a result of an accident. Liston\u2019s alleged injury, regardless of whether it constitutes \u201cbodily injury\u201d did not result from a covered occurrence. Therefore, Liston\u2019s claim fell outside the policy\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b614 The Twites rely heavily on <em>Staples </em>for the proposition that the insurer has a duty to defend the claim unless it has been \u201cunequivocally demonstrated\u201d that the claim falls outside of the policy\u2019s coverage. In <em>Staples, </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">Unless there exists an unequivocal demonstration that the claim against the insured does not fall within the policy coverage, the insurer has a duty to defend. In other words, if there is any dispute as to the facts relevant to coverage, those factual disputes must be resolved in favor of coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\"><em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 24 (internal citation omitted). There is a crucial difference between <em>Staples </em>and the instant case: in <em>Staples, </em>the facts allegedly giving rise to coverage were disputed. Here, there is no factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"AWT\">\u00b615  Courts must liberally construe the allegations of a complaint in favor of finding an obligation to defend. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22. Where a claim falls unequivocally outside the policy\u2019s coverage, however, there is nothing for the court to construe, and no reason to impose a duty to</p>\n<p id=\"AKl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>defend. <em>See e.g. Hogenson, </em>\u00b6 20 (the insured failed to file his claim within the mandatory six month period, thus no coverage existed); <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. </em>Rumph, 2007 MT 249, \u00b6 25, 339 Mont. 251, \u00b6 25, 170 P.3d 934, \u00b6 25 (facts alleged in the complaint did not fall within the insured\u2019s GCL policy; facts not alleged in the complaint were disregarded); <em>New Hampshire Ins. Group v. Strecker, </em>244 Mont. 478, 481, 798 P.2d 130, 131 (1990) (molestation was not a covered \u201coccurrence\u201d); <em>Graber v. State Farm, </em>244 Mont. 265, 270, 797 P.2d 215-17 (1990) (complaint alleging trademark and copyright violations did not meet policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"ALC\">\u00b616  In the instant case, the facts alleged in the complaint and during discovery were unequivocally outside the policy\u2019s coverage. MFH did not present any facts on the face of the complaint or in discovery, which, if true, would result in coverage. Thus, the District Court did not err in concluding that the allegations made in MFH\u2019s complaint unequivocally fell outside the policy\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">\u00b617  The Twites have failed to demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to whether Security National had a duty to defend the Twites against the MFH suit. Neither the facts alleged on the face of the complaint nor the facts disclosed during discovery constitute a covered occurrence within the terms of the policy. The District Court did not err in concluding that the complaint was unequivocally outside the policy\u2019s coverage, and thus, as a matter of law, Security National had no duty to defend. We affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Security National.</p>\n<judges id=\"b84-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
