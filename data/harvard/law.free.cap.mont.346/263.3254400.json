At trial, Ommundson moved for a directed verdict, appropriately referred to as a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence, claiming the State failed to establish the elements of indecent exposure under \u00a7 45-5-504, MCA (2005). Ommundson appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u00b62 The restated issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by denying Ommundson\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence on the charge of felony indecent exposure?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">\u00b64 At approximately 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, April 22, 2006, two women hiking along a trail on top of the \u201cRimrocks\u201d in an area known as Airport Overlook Park in Billings, Montana, came across a totally nude male. The public trail, which is loosely maintained by the City of Billings, runs adjacent to Highway 3 and receives fairly heavy use from hikers, walkers, joggers, bicyclists, and view seekers.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">\u00b65 The naked man, later identified as Ommundson, was lying next to a fully clothed woman about eight to ten feet from the trail. In phone statements following the incident, one of the women stated that she \u201ccame across a man who was totally nude\u201d and that she was \u201cdisgusted and offended that he [Ommundson] would be nude in a public place.\u201d When asked whether she had any conversations with the man, the woman stated, \u201c[n]o, because I wanted to get by him as quickly as possible. I was very uncomfortable.\u201d The woman also stated that the man made eye contact with her. Finally, she stated that while she did not see the man\u2019s genitals, she would have if the woman on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>blanket had not been sitting there. Similarly, the second woman stated that they \u201ccame across a very naked man\u201d and that when both of them went back to the area after calling police, the man was in the same place, lying \u201ccompletely nude.\u201d Finally, the woman stated that Ommundson did not appear to care that he was lying nude in a public place.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b66 Approximately ten to fifteen minutes later, a Billings police officer responded to the area and found Ommundson lying on his back with his eyes closed, genitals fully exposed, in the same place described by the women. The officer told Ommundson to get dressed, which prompted Ommundson to grab a pair of nylon shorts that were within his reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b67 Ommundson was charged with two counts of felony indecent exposure, a charge later amended to a single count of the same. A two-day jury trial was held during which the State called the women as well as the officer to testify about the incident. The first woman testified that she saw a \u201cnude\u201d man sitting on a blanket. When asked how she knew whether he was totally naked, she said, \u201cwhat I saw was open, nothing was covered, you know, and as far as I could see, nothing was covered.\u201d The other woman testified that they \u201ccame across someone who was nude\u201d and that she \u201cwas double shocked to see this nude person right on the trail.\u201d Finally, the officer testified that when he got out of his patrol car upon responding to the area, that he \u201clooked over to the side, and sure enough they [the women] were right, here\u2019s some guy laying out there naked.\u201d Ommundson did not testify in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b68 At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Ommundson moved for a directed verdict (motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence). Ommundson argued that the witnesses failed to positively identify Ommundson and that the State failed to establish the elements of indecent exposure since neither of the women testified that she actually saw Ommundson\u2019s genitals. Specifically, Ommundson\u2019s counsel stated, \u201c[t]here\u2019s been no testimony that either [woman was] exposed or viewed his genitalia.\u201d When asked by the District Court whether Montana\u2019s indecent exposure statute required the women to actually see Ommundson\u2019s genitals, the State responded by stating that it did not, because the statute focuses on the defendant\u2019s intent. Further, the State argued that, at minimum, there was \u201ccircumstantial evidence that he was exposed to those women on the rims that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyF\">\u00b69 The District Court denied Ommundson\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t think [the] legislature would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>require these women to actually say that they then looked at his genitalia if they believed his genitalia was exposed, and from that, they were offended.\u201d The jury subsequently found Ommundson guilty of the charge of felony indecent exposure, and the District Court entered its judgment and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b610 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 33, 342 Mont. 1, \u00b6 33, 180 P.3d 1102, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u00b611 I. Did the District Court err when it denied Ommundson\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence on the charge of felony indecent exposure?</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\u00b612 Under \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, the District Court may dismiss a criminal action and discharge the defendant if the evidence is insufficient to support a guilty verdict. Further, \u201c[a] motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there is not sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt <em>.\"Rosling, </em>\u00b6 35. At the District Court, and here, Ommundson contends the evidence is insufficient for a rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of indecent exposure under \u00a7 45-5-504, MCA, which required the State to establish: (1) that Ommundson knowingly or purposely exposed his genitals; (2) that he did so under circumstances that he knew were likely to cause affront or alarm; and (3) that he did so \u201cin order to abuse, humiliate, harass, or degrade another\u201d or to \u201carouse or gratify [his] own sexual response or desire ....\u201d We address each element separately in the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">\u00b613 A. Did Ommundson knowingly or purposely expose his genitals?</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\u00b614 Ommundson claims the evidence is insufficient to find that he knowingly or purposely <em>exposed </em>his genitals. Specifically, Ommundson claims that exposure cannot be established in this case since the two female hikers did not directly observe Ommundson\u2019s genitals, even though Ommundson admits in his brief to this Court that he was nude in Airport Overlook Park on April 22, 2006. Ommundson argues that a person is not \u201cexposed\u201d for purposes of Montana\u2019s indecent exposure statute unless a complaining witness directly observes the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>genitals. Further, Ommundson appears to argue that circumstantial evidence is not sufficient to prove exposure. In response, the State contends that nothing in \u00a7 45-5-504, MCA, requires direct evidence of genital exposure, and further, that \u201cdirect observation of a person\u2019s genitals is not necessary to support a finding that a person has exposed his genitals.\u201d Rather, the State claims that \u201ctestimony that a person is \u2018nude\u2019 or \u2018naked\u2019 is sufficient to support a finding that the person\u2019s genitals are exposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b615  In this case, there is direct evidence from the investigating officer that Ommundson\u2019s genitals were exposed. Upon arriving at the scene described by the women, the officer stated that he saw Ommundson, \u201claying on his back,\u201d that \u201che didn\u2019t have a stitch of clothing on,\u201d and that he \u201cwas naked.\u201d When asked whether Ommundson\u2019s genitals were exposed, the officer stated, \u201cYeah.\u201d Indeed, Ommundson admits to being naked that morning, arguing only that the women did not directly observe his genitals. Given the officer\u2019s testimony and Ommundson\u2019s own admission, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Ommundson was exposed for purposes of \u00a7 45-5-504, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b616 The jury in this case could have reached the same conclusion from the women\u2019s testimony. In Montana, \u201ccircumstantial evidence alone may be sufficient to obtain a conviction in a criminal case.\u201d <em>State v. Southern, </em>1999 MT 94, \u00b6 92, 294 Mont. 225, \u00b6 92, 980 P.2d 3, \u00b6 92. Circumstantial evidence is evidence that \u201ctends to establish a fact by proving another and which, though true, does not itself conclusively establish that fact but affords an inference or presumption of its existence.\u201d Section 26-1-102(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b617 At trial, one of the women testified that she saw a \u201cnaked man\u201d and that she did.not see any clothing on him. When pressed about how she knew the man was naked, she stated that, \u201cwhen I looked at him, all I could think is that man is totally nude ....\u201d Further, she testified that the only reason she did not see Ommundson\u2019s genitals was because she chose not to. The other woman testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t see his genitals because he was faced the other way, but I know he was nude because you could just see his buttocks and, you know, just kind of straight on down, so I say that I did see a naked man.\u201d From this testimony alone, a rational trier of fact could find that Ommundson\u2019s genitals were exposed for purposes of \u00a7 45-5-504, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u00b618 B. Did the exposure of Ommundson\u2019s genitals occur under circumstances in which Ommundson knew the conduct was likely to cause affront or alarm?</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u00b619 Ommundson claims the evidence is insufficient to establish the second element of \u00a7 45-5-504, MCA, which requires the exposure to occur under circumstances in which the defendant knew the conduct was likely to cause affront or alarm. In support of his argument, Ommundson appears to claim that this element can only be satisfied if a person <em>intends </em>to elicit \u201caffront or alarm.\u201d This is not true. Section 45-5-504, MCA, requires only that the exposure take place \u201cunder circumstances in which the person <em>knows </em>the conduct is likely to cause affront or alarm.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In Montana, \u201c[w]hen knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence.\u201d Section 45-2-101(35), MCA. Given that a person\u2019s mental state can rarely be established with direct evidence, \u201c[a] mental state may be inferred from the acts of the accused and the facts and circumstances connected with the offense.\u201d <em>State v. Krum, </em>238 Mont. 359, 361, 777 P.2d 889, 890 (1989); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 45-2-103(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b620  In this case, we agree with the State that the evidence presented during the course of the trial, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was sufficient for the jury to find that Ommundson knew his conduct occurred under circumstances likely to cause affront or alarm. Both women testified that Ommundson was lying naked not more than eight to ten feet from a trail on a Saturday morning in a public park that is frequently used by hikers, bikers, and joggers and that he was clearly visible from both the trail and a nearby parking lot. The second woman testified that she \u201ccame across someone who was nude\u201d and that she \u201cwas double shocked to see this nude person right on the trail.\u201d Because the exposure occurred in such a place and time that was sure to be viewed by a member of the public, we conclude there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that Ommundson knew the exposure occurred under circumstances that were likely to cause affront or alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b621 We also note that Ommundson conceded \u201cknowledge\u201d during pretrial discussions with the District Court about whether to allow evidence of Ommundson\u2019s arrest in 2002 for indecent exposure. In objecting to the evidence, Ommundson\u2019s counsel stated the following: \u201cOur client is not saying in any way, shape or form that he did not know that this conduct was not against the law.\u201d Further, counsel conceded \u201cthat our client has knowledge that if his genitalia were exposed, that that would be against the law, and he would also concede that if his genitalia were exposed, that that could reasonably cause the remaining portion and remaining elements in the statute.\u201d Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>counsel stated, \u201c[s]o basically what we would like, Your Honor, is we would object to any testimony given by the officer, being that we would concede knowledge.\u201d Although the District Court overruled Ommundson\u2019s objection, the State ultimately did not introduce evidence of the 2002 incident, relying instead on the concession and posture of the trial at that point. Ommundson\u2019s attempt to argue this element later at the District Court and on appeal to this Court is especially unpersuasive in light of his concession that he had the requisite knowledge required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b622 C. Did Ommundson expose himself in order to \u201cabuse, humiliate, harass, or degrade another\u201d or to \u201carouse or gratify\u201d his own sexual desire?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b623 Ommundson argues the evidence is insufficient for a rational trier of fact to find that he exposed himself in order to \u201cabuse, humiliate, harass, or degrade another\u201d because his actions amounted to nothing more than nude sunbathing. We disagree. As previously stated, \u201c[a] mental state may be inferred from the acts of the accused and the facts and circumstances connected with the offense.\u201d <em>Krum, </em>238 Mont. at 361, 777 P.2d at 890; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 45-2-103(3), MCA. We also note that determinations of witness credibility and the weight of evidence presented at trial is within the province of the jury. <em>See State v. Kuipers, </em>2005 MT 156, \u00b6 11, 327 Mont. 431, \u00b6 11, 114 P.3d 1033, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"ALx\">\u00b624  A jury could have reasonably inferred from Ommundson\u2019s actions and from the facts and circumstances presented at trial that he exposed himself in order to \u201cabuse, humiliate, harass, or degrade another.\u201d First, the jury heard testimony from three different witnesses, including an investigating officer, that the exposure occurred in a very public setting near a frequently used trail on a warm Saturday morning. From this conduct, a jury could reasonably conclude that Ommundson knew he would be seen naked that morning. Second, the jury heard testimony that he was not merely sunbathing, but that he maintained prolonged eye contact with one of the women. In response, the woman stated that she stared back to \u201clet him know that [she] was disgusted and that he [Ommundson] wasn\u2019t intimidating [her] sitting there in the nude.\u201d The jury could reasonably infer from this interaction that Ommundson\u2019s conduct toward the women was deliberate and that he engaged in that manner of behavior in order to humiliate, harass, or degrade another.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b625 Finally, on a related matter, Ommundson argues on appeal that \u201cthe investigating officer\u2019s testimony [was] not sufficient to establish the elements of the offense.\u201d Therefore, according to Ommundson, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>jury should not have considered the investigating officer\u2019s testimony. However, we agree with the State that Ommundson provides no authority for this proposition. Accordingly, we do not address this issue further on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b626  Based on Ommundson\u2019s actions and in consideration of all the facts and circumstances presented, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the charge of indecent exposure beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Ommundson\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
