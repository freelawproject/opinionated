He challenges his conviction on the ground that four hours elapsed between the time he operated his vehicle and the time his blood was drawn for purposes of determining his blood alcohol concentration (BAC). He asserts that this was an unreasonable amount of time. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court improperly deny Kummerfeldt\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to convict him of DUI per se because the four-hour delay between his act of driving and the BAC test was unreasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">\u00b64 On April 30,2006, at approximately 9:30 p.m., Kummerfeldt was involved in a one-car accident outside of Nashua, Montana. During the accident, he struck his head and claims he has no memory of the time from 9:30 until 10:45 p.m. when a passing motorist discovered the accident and called 911. A Valley County deputy sheriff was dispatched and arrived on the scene at 11:11 p.m. At approximately 12:10 a.m., a Montana Highway Patrol trooper arrived to investigate. By that time, Kummerfeldt had been transported to the hospital. The Valley County deputy did not conduct field sobriety tests at the scene. After investigating the scene, where numerous beer cans were discovered, the trooper traveled to the hospital to interview Kummerfeldt. At 1:20 a.m., he read Kummerfeldt the implied consent advisory and had Kummerfeldt\u2019s blood drawn for a BAC. Kummerfeldt\u2019s BAC was 0.14%.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">\u00b65 Following a bench trial in Justice Court, Kummerfeldt was convicted of DUI. He appealed to the District Court and a jury trial was held. Following the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Kummerfeldt moved for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to convict him under the DUI per se statute. He based his argument on the fact that four hours had elapsed between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the time of his driving and the time of his blood test. The District Court denied the motion and Kummerfeldt was found guilty. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b66 As we explained in <em>State v. McWilliams, </em>2008 MT 59, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 341 Mont. 517, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 178 P.3d 121, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, a motion for a judgment of acquittal constitutes a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA. We review the denial of such motions de novo. <em>McWilliams, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court improperly deny Kummerfeldt\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to convict him ofDUIper se because the four-hour delay between his act of driving and the BAC test was unreasonable ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AL3\">\u00b68 After the State closed its case-in-chief and the jury was in recess, Kummerfeldt moved for a judgment of acquittal. He argued that the State had failed to prove that his BAC was .08 or more <em>at the time </em>he was driving and that under <em>State v. McGowan, </em>2006 MT 163, 332 Mont. 490, 139 P.3d 841, four hours was not reasonable. Kummerfeldt, without authority, argued to the District Court that a determination of what is a \u201creasonable time\u201d between driving and testing was a legal question for the court the determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u00b69 In <em>McGowan, </em>we held that tests to determine alcohol concentration administered within fifty minutes after McGowan stopped driving were reasonable and that such tests \u201cadministered within a reasonable amount of time after the alleged act are ... consistent with the DUI per se statute.\u201d <em>McGowan, </em>\u00b6 17. In denying Kummerfeldt\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, the District Court noted that <em>McGowan </em>did not define \u201cwithin a reasonable time,\u201d nor has the Legislature taken action to declare public policy on the issue. It stated that Kummerfeldt had stipulated to the entry of the BAC report which informed the jury that four hours after the accident he had a BAC of .14. The court expressly ruled that Kummerfeldt could argue to the jury that the alcohol concentration test was not performed within a reasonable amount of time and as a result the State failed to prove an element of the crime. However, the court denied Kummerfeldt\u2019s motion, stating that a determination of the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the time was an issue for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\u00b610 On appeal, Kummerfeldt argues that the four-horn\u2019 lapse of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>between his act of driving and the drawing of his blood was unreasonable; therefore, the BAC results cannot constitute sufficient evidence of DUI under the per se statute without other evidence tending to show his alcohol concentration level at the time he drove. He argues that the maximum delay recognized as reasonable in Montana is fifty minutes under the DUI per se statute and three hours in a DUI case. See <em>McGowan, \u00b6 </em>9, and <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2002 MT 263, \u00b6 12, 312 Mont. 249, \u00b6 12, 59 P.3d 387, \u00b6 12, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b611 He further argues that <em>Hamilton </em>is distinguishable on the ground that it did not involve a DUI per se charge; therefore, the \u201creasonable time\u201d determination in that case is inapplicable here. He maintains, therefore, that four hours is not reasonable and that the long delay disconnected any relationship between his blood alcohol level and his driving. Lastly, he urges us to conclude that the District Court erred by leaving the determination of what constitutes a reasonable amount of delay to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b612 The State points out that evidence at the scene observed by the Montana State trooper included an 18-pack of beer, some of which appeared to have been opened by hand and others which may have been punctured during the accident. It also maintains that several hours after the accident, the trooper detected alcohol on Kummerfeldt\u2019s breath and noted his eyes were bloodshot. Additionally, the State notes that Kummerfeldt admitted that he had been drinking earlier in the day and that he had had nothing to drink after the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AjL\">\u00b613 The State also argues that Kummerfeldt waived his right to raise the unreasonable delay argument on appeal. Relying on \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, and <em>State v. Vincent, </em>2007 MT 94, \u00b6 11, 337 Mont. 87, \u00b6 11, 155 P.3d 1292, \u00b6 11, the State argues that because Kummerfeldt stipulated to the admissibility of the BAC result prior to trial, he waived his opportunity to argue that the judge should have decided, as a matter of law, whether the lapsed time was reasonable. Additionally, it argues that Kummerfeldt, like Vincent, did not challenge the admissibility of evidence until the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief. Therefore, as we did in <em>Vincent, </em>the State urges us to hold that Kummerfeldt\u2019s failure to bring this argument at or before the omnibus hearing or the latest date ordered by the District Court, resulted in a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b614 Section 46-13-101, MCA, requires that certain pretrial motions and notices must be raised at or before the omnibus hearing held during the criminal proceeding. In relevant part, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">(1) Except for good cause shown, any defense, objection, or request that is capable of determination without trial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>general issue must be raised at or before the omnibus hearing unless otherwise provided by Title 46.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">(2) Failure of a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests that must be made prior to trial, at the time set by the court, constitutes a waiver of the defense, objection, or request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8i\">\u00b615 As noted by the State, we addressed this provision in <em>Vincent. </em>Vincent was arrested for DUI. At an omnibus hearing, he requested a bench trial. Before trial he filed a motion to suppress the State\u2019s evidence based on lack of particularized suspicion but he failed to submit a timely brief. His motion was deemed to be without merit. At trial, after the State\u2019s case-in-chief, he moved for acquittal due to insufficient evidence. The court denied the motion. On appeal, we held that \u201c[t]he issue of whether particularized suspicion existed to stop Vincent is capable of determination without trial of the general issue of whether he is guilty of DUI.\u201d Therefore, under \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, he should have brought such a defense before the omnibus hearing or the latest date ordered by the court and failing to do so, he waived it. <em>Vincent, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"Apiy\">\u00b616  The same rationale is applicable here. An Omnibus Hearing was held on August 2, 2007. Kummerfeldt did not ask the court to determine, as a matter of law, that the four-hour delay was unreasonable. This argument was potentially dispositive of the matter before the court, and in that it was \u201ccapable of determination without trial of the general issue,\u201d per \u00a7 46-13-101(1), MCA, it \u201cmust\u201d be raised at or before the omnibus hearing. Under <em>Vincent </em>and \u00a7 46-13-101(2), MCA, his failure to do so constituted a waiver of this legal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b6 17 Moreover, Kummerfeldt not only failed to raise his obj ection to the report before or at the omnibus hearing, he subsequently stipulated to the report\u2019s admission into evidence. We note, as well, that the court specifically asked Kummerfeldt\u2019s counsel during trial whether the BAC report was stipulated for admission and whether such stipulation was \u201ca matter of trial strategy.\u201d Counsel replied in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"AqE\">\u00b618  Under these circumstances, we conclude that Kummerfeldt waived his right to argue that the court should determine as a matter of law what constitutes a \u201creasonable time\u201d between a person\u2019s act of driving and his or her blood test for purposes of determining BAC. Based on this waiver and his stipulation, the District Court did not improperly deny his motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b619 As this case is resolved on Kummerfeldt\u2019s waiver and stipulation, we decline to address whether the determination of \u201creasonable time\u201d under the DUI per se statute is a question of fact for the fact-finder or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>a question of law for the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b620 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Kummerfeldt\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b228-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
