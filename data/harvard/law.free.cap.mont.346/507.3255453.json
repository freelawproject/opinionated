The BRPA, along with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (\u201cFWP\u201d), also appeals the District Court\u2019s May 10, 2006 Opinion and Order holding that the Mitchell Slough is not subject to Montana\u2019s statutes governing stream access for public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>recreational use, referred to by the District Court and commonly as the \u201cStream Access Law\u201d or \u201cSAL.\u201d We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"ACy\">\u00b62 As the above introduction notes, this appeal comprises two cases, the first applying the 310 Law and the second applying the SAL, to the Mitchell Slough. We address the following dispositive issues in these cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">\u00b63 I. The 310 Law case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">A. Did the District Court err in upholding the process used by the BCD in determining the Mitchell Slough\u2019s status under the 310 Law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">B. Did the District Court err by upholding the BCD\u2019s declaratory ruling that the Mitchell Slough is not subject to the 310 Law?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b64 II. The Stream Access Law case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">A. Did the District Court err by adopting verbatim Appellee\u2019s Walter E. Babcock, et al. and the Montana Farm Bureau Federation\u2019s proposed findings of fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">B. Did the District Court err by requiring Appellants to prove by a \u201cclear preponderance\u201d that the Mitchell Slough is a natural water body, and in its application of that burden of proof?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">C. Did the District Court err by concluding the Mitchell Slough is not a \u201cnatural water body\u201d for purposes of the SAL, and therefore not subject to public recreational access?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">\u00b65 In 1999, the BCD received a letter inquiring whether 310 Law permits were required for work done within the bed and banks of the Mitchell. The answer to this question necessitated a determination of whether the Mitchell was a \u201cnatural, perennial-flowing stream\u201d under the 310 Law. The BCD unsuccessfully sought the intervention of the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, the Department of Environmental Quality, or FWP to make this determination. Following these \u201cthree strikes,\u201d the BCD initiated its own process, publishing notices related thereto in the <em>Ravalli Republic </em>in December of 2000 and January of 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">\u00b66 On January 24, 2001, the BRPA petitioned the District Court for an alternate writ of prohibition to stop the BCD from determining whether the Mitchell Slough was subject to the 310 Law, asserting that the BCD did not have jurisdiction to do so. The District Court denied the BRPA\u2019s petition for writ, and thereafter the BRPA sought a writ of prohibition from this Court. We denied that request in <em>Bitterroot River Protection Association v. Bitterroot Conservation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>District, </em>2002 MT 66, 309 Mont. 207, 45 P.3d 24 (hereinafter <em>\u201cBRPA F). </em>The BCD then continued its administrative declaratory ruling process, leading to the determination that the Mitchell is not a \u201cnatural perennial-flowing stream\u201d and thus not subject to the 310 Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b67 In November 2003, the BRPA sought declaratory relief and judicial review of the BCD\u2019s decision in the Twenty First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, Hon. Ted L. Mizner, presiding. In its First Amended Complaint, the BRPA alleged four counts. Count I challenged the process employed by the BCD, Count II challenged the BCD\u2019s decision on the evidence and as an abuse of discretion, and Count III alleged that the BCD\u2019s 310 Law decision violated the Public Trust Doctrine. Count III was dismissed prior to trial and is not at issue on appeal. Based upon the administrative record and the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment, the District Court entered an order on Counts I and II on January 12, 2006, affirming the BCD\u2019s 310 Law determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b68 Count IV claimed that the waters of the Mitchell were open to recreational access under the SAL. A five-day bench trial was conducted in July 2005 on the stream access issue, and on May 10, 2006, the District Court filed an order holding that the Mitchell Slough was not subject to public access.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b69 The posture of the parties and the issues in which they are participants are complex. The BCD is a party to the 310 Law issue only, by virtue of the appeal of its administrative decision. A group of individuals and ranch owners along the Mitchell Slough, Walter R. Babcock, Bitterroot Springs Ranch, John and Kathy Lewis, et al., intervened in the action, cross-claiming for a declaration that the Mitchell was not subject to the SAL. Landowner Marnell Corrao Associates, Inc., likewise intervened, contesting the status of the segment of the Mitchell passing through its property. The three primary irrigations companies, Etna Ditch, Webfoot Ditch and Union Ditch, and the Montana Farm Bureau likewise intervened. The Intervenors, along with the aforementioned landowners, about 25 in total, will be collectively referred to herein as the \u201cLandowners.\u201d Landowners supported the decision of the BCD. The BRPA moved for joinder of FWP, who was a party in the proceeding before the BCD but did not appeal, as an \u201cinvoluntary plaintiff\u2019 pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 19(a). Given its failure to appeal from the BCD\u2019s decision, joinder of FWP was denied for the 310 Law case, but was granted for the SAL case. Certain of the Landowners filed a third-party complaint against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Ravalli Comity alleging that the Mitchell Slough was not under the jurisdiction of the SAL, seeking to enjoin issuance of further portage permits on the Mitchell. After the parties stipulated to a stay of the County\u2019s intended portage hearings, it does not appear that the County further participated in the matter. Before this Court, Montana Trout Unlimited (\u201cMTU\u201d) has filed an amicus brief supporting the BRPA\u2019s position on the 310 Law issue. Thirteen outdoor recreation organizations (collectively \u201cSportsmen\u2019s Groups\u201d) have filed a joint amicus brief supporting Appellants\u2019 positions on the stream access issue. Four stockgrower and resource organizations (collectively \u201cStockgrowers\u201d) have filed an amicus brief supporting Appellees\u2019 position on the stream access issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\">\u00b610 The BRPA appealed the District Court\u2019s decision upholding the BCD\u2019s 310 Law determination. The BRPA and FWP appeal the District Court\u2019s decision regarding stream access on the Mitchell Slough.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b611 Two factual records were originally developed, one before the BCD for the 310 Law case, and the other before the District Court in the trial of the SAL case. The factual recitation here is drawn generally from both records, and more specific facts are referenced in the respective discussions under each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u00b612 The Mitchell Slough is located in Ravalli County, Montana, east of the Bitterroot River between Hamilton and Stevensville. Tucker Headgate directs water from the East Fork of the Bitterroot River into the Mitchell. The water travels through and across private property in a north/northeasterly direction, covering a linear distance of approximately ten miles before rejoining the Bitterroot River. The Mitchell Slough itself meanders along a pathway approximately 16 miles in length. The Mitchell splits into its own east and west channels, which both flow northerly in a parallel fashion and empty into the Bitterroot River. Ditch companies and private water users have historically used water from the Mitchell Slough for irrigation, stockwater, and fish and wildlife purposes, and have routinely taken actions upstream of Tucker Headgate to ensure an even supply of water into the East Fork of the Bitterroot River, thereby also ensuring the consistent flow of water for diversion by the Tucker Headgate into the Mitchell. This activity has been ongoing for decades, for most of a century. Approximately 4,300 acres are irrigated from the Mitchell\u2019s flow every season.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u00b613 The point of diversion for water moving from the East Fork into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the Mitchell Slough used to be a quarter-mile downstream from its present location. In 1915, the three primary ditch companies using water from the Mitchell Slough constructed a concrete diversion structure in the East Fork to direct a dependable supply of water into the Mitchell. However, in the mid-twentieth century, the ditch companies constructed Tucker Headgate upstream from the natural entry into the Mitchell Slough and dug a quarter-mile canal to create a new connection from the East Fork to the Mitchell\u2019s channel via Tucker Headgate. The BCD found that, after surface water is diverted through this canal, it \u201cultimately flows into a historic natural channel\u201d known as the Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b614 Rivers and streams throughout Montana have been manipulated for centuries, and the Bitterroot River and Mitchell Slough are no exception. Bruce Anderson, Landowners\u2019 expert hydrologist, testified that many Montana rivers have been channelized and riprapped, and have had weirs and diversion structures placed in them, for years. Anderson testified that the surface waters and groundwater in the Bitterroot Valley had been significantly altered by humans in many places. Likewise, the BCD relied on the expert report of Water Consulting, Inc., which noted that tributaries formerly drained from the Sapphire Mountains into the Bitterroot River floodplain but have been permanently severed and intercepted for irrigation purposes and no longer reach the Bitterroot River. Water is now impounded at Painted Rock Reservoir and released as necessary into the Bitterroot.</p>\n<p id=\"AeX\">\u00b615 Similarly, throughout the length of the Mitchell, residents have reconstructed the bed and banks of the watercourse, narrowed its channel, increased water velocities, and improved aesthetics and the fish and wildlife habitats. Certain portions of the Mitchell Slough have been rerouted, redirected, and controlled by humans to the extent that the Mitchell Slough does not follow the same path it may otherwise have naturally followed without intervention. The Mitchell has also been unnaturally elevated and bermed to access certain terraces lying to the east of the Bitterroot River. Periodic maintenance is required at Tucker Headgate and in certain locations within the Mitchell to clean sediment and gravel plugs from the watercourse. Nonetheless, though the extent is disputed, the Mitchell remains in partially the same location as in 1872, when the Government Land Office (GLO) Survey Map designated the Mitchell as the \u201cRight Fork of the St. Mary\u2019s Fork of the Bitterroot River.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b616 One major source of contention between the parties centers on the water flowing through the Mitchell which enters, not from Tucker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Headgate, but from flows, drains and ditches that discharge water into the Mitchell at various points along its path. The amount of water entering the Mitchell at Tucker Headgate is less than the amount of water exiting at its confluence with the Bitterroot River, despite the fact that the Mitchell serves multiple diversions, including the Union, Etna, and Webfoot irrigation ditches. Discharges of irrigation wastewater and return flows from waters diverted upstream on the Bitterroot River enhance the flow of the Mitchell. The District Court found that \u201c[t]hese flows [into the Mitchell] would not exist but for the activity of humans to \u2018import\u2019 the water into the Mitchell drainage area.\u201d These irrigation wastewater and return flows contribute to the Mitchell Slough year-round. Even in February and March, when no irrigation is taking place, the amount of water flowing out of the Mitchell into the Bitterroot River is approximately double the amount flowing into the Mitchell Slough from the Bitterroot River at Tucker Headgate.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\">\u00b617 The BCD concluded that the Mitchell Slough is \u201cpartly man-made and partly within an historic channel of the Bitterroot River.\u201d The BCD also concluded that there is \u201csignificant ground water in the area of the Mitchell,\u201d and \u201csome of the water in the Mitchell results from ground water, the likely source of which is diverted or irrigation water.\u201d Additionally, the BCD concluded that \u201cthe Mitchell flows are mainly from water directly diverted to it at the Tucker Headgate or indirectly diverted to it from man-made drainage ditches, although it would likely flow at some level and some places in the absence of the above-mentioned diversions.\u201d Both the BCD and the District Court concluded that without the current diversion of water into the East Fork of the Bitterroot River and then into the Mitchell Slough by Tucker Headgate, and without the water contributions from irrigation wastewater and return flows, the Mitchell Slough would not sustain a natural, perennial flow. The Mitchell has never run dry, and 310 Law permits have previously been issued on the Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b618 We review agency declaratory rulings \u201cin the same manner as decisions or orders in contested cases\u201d under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act (MAPA). Section 2-4-501, MCA; <em>accord </em>\u00a7 2-3-113, MCA; <em>BRPA I, </em>\u00b6 18. This applies to the BCD\u2019s declaratory ruling on the applicability of the 310 Law. Thus, our review is guided by the standards of review set forth in \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA. \u201cWhen reviewing an agency decision, a district court may not substitute its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.\u201d <em>Ray v. Montana Tech of the U. of Mont., </em>2007 MT 21, \u00b6 24, 335 Mont. 367, \u00b6 24, 152 P.3d 122, \u00b6 24 (citing \u00a7 2-4-704(2), MCA). Instead, the district court reviews an agency\u2019s decision to determine if the agency\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law were correct. <em>Ray, </em>\u00b6 24. We'apply the same standard to our review of a district court\u2019s decision to affirm an agency decision. <em>Ray, </em>\u00b6 24. In reviewing conclusions of law under \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA, we determine whether the agency s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601,603 (1990). The BCD argues that its decisions are entitled to deference. However, while long-standing statutory interpretations by agencies are entitled to \u201crespectful consideration,\u201d <em>Montana Power Co. v. Montana Public Service Commission, </em>2001 MT 102, \u00b6 25, 305 Mont. 260, \u00b6 25, 26 P.3d 91, \u00b6 25, and we have acknowledged the value of the BCD\u2019s expertise in the review of 310 determinations, <em>BPRA I, </em>\u00b6 19, \u201cno discretion is involved when a tribunal arrives at a conclusion of law-the tribunal either correctly or incorrectly applies the law.\u201d <em>Steer, </em>245 Mont. at 474, 803 P.2d at 603. With regard to the SAL case, we apply the same standards with regard to findings of fact and conclusions of law entered by the district court following trial, reviewing the findings for clear error and the conclusions for correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\n<em>I. The 310 Law case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b619 A. Did the District Court err in upholding the process the BCD used in determining the Mitchell Slough\u2019s status under the 310 Law?</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u00b620 The BRPA argues that the process the BCD used in rendering its 310 Law determination regarding the Mitchell was inadequate, especially because constitutional rights involving natural resources were implicated in the matter. The BCD responds that it was not required to comply with any particular process or procedure, such as a MAPA contested case proceeding, and that it complied with constitutional mandates by affording the public, including the BRPA, a reasonable opportunity to participate prior to making its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"AQI\">\u00b621 Article II, Section 8, of the Montana Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he public has the right to expect governmental agencies to afford such reasonable opportunity for citizen participation in the operation of the agencies prior to the final decision as may be provided by law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Section 2-3-101, MCA, referencing \u201cthe mandate of Article II, section 8,\u201d provides that citizens are to be \u201cafforded reasonable opportunity to participate ...\u201d Section 2-3-111(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[procedures for assisting public participation must include a method of affording interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or arguments, orally or in written form, prior to making a final decision that is of significant interest to the public.\u201d The essential elements of public participation are notice and an opportunity to be heard. Section 2-3-103(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\">\u00b622 The BRPA does not argue that it was provided inadequate notice in this matter. Rather, the BRPA argues that after the BCD began an informal information-gathering process, it \u201cswitched to an adversarial hearing\u201d and announced that MAPA procedures would be used and would require the BRPA to hire an attorney. After this announcement was made, the BRPA argues, the BCD failed to employ MAPA procedures because \u201c[discovery, production of documents or entry upon land wasn\u2019t allowed\u201d and the parties could not subpoena witnesses. The BCD also restricted the BRPA\u2019s ability to cross-examine one of Landowners\u2019 experts, Barry Dutton, who submitted a report but did not appear. Thus, the BRPA argues that the BCD \u201ccontradicted its own rules\u201d by employing MAPA-like procedures in some ways, but not others.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b623 The BCD responds that the proceeding was \u201ca unique, but nonetheless reasonable, method to gather information to make its declaratory ruling.\u201d BCD argues that no particular procedure was required, as in a MAPA contested case proceeding, because the proceeding was intended for the sole purpose of gathering information for its decision. According to the BCD, it \u201cundertook a non-contested case declaratory ruling\u201d as authorized by this Court in <em>BRPA I </em>which strictly adhered to the mandate of Article II, Section 8 by providing a reasonable opportunity to participate. The BCD explains that it proceeded under Montana\u2019s public participation statutes and its own rules in conducting a public hearing. BCD Rule 6(2) provides that \u201c[i]f questions arise, about the accuracy of the perennial stream designation of these maps, the district may use water rights records, stream flow and hydrologice [sic] data and interviews with area residents and professionals. The district may also conduct a public hearing to gather information.\u201d Under BCD Rule 18(4), the BCD may hold a public hearing \u201cwhen the supervisor determines a proposed project to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>controversial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or where additional information is desired prior to final action by the supervisors.\u201d Acknowledging that the process took on certain attributes of a MAPA proceeding, the BCD nonetheless argues that nothing more was required, and it was free to formulate a process that fit the demands of the task before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\u00b624 The BCD initiated the declaratory ruling process by holding an open public meeting. Individuals were allowed to provide oral and written statements, and interested persons were granted an additional seven days to submit further information. The BCD then suspended its decisionmaking process when the BRPA filed a petition for writ of prohibition challenging the BCD\u2019s authority, the litigation which led to our decision in <em>BRPA I. </em>Following that decision, the BCD allowed another sixty days for the submission of additional written information, and provided that any party adverse to someone presenting information would be afforded an opportunity for cross-examination. A cross-examination hearing was thereafter conducted. During the process, the BCD received 1,528 pages of information, in addition to oral statements. The Board\u2019s members each spent approximately 550 hours discussing and reviewing the information prior to issuing a declaratory ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u00b625 The BCD correctly notes that it was not required to hold a contested case proceeding under MAPA, because it is exempted from MAPA as a political subdivision of the State. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-4-102(2)(b), MCA. As we have held, conservation districts can initiate 310 Law determinations through the use of non-MAPA declaratory rulings. <em>BRPA I, </em>\u00b6 22. We see no reason why the BCD could not use certain procedures similar to those in a MAPA contested case proceeding, if fairly employed, without being obligated to implement all of MAPA\u2019s requirements, as the BRPA essentially contends. The BCD did not have the ability to subpoena witnesses, but it provided an opportunity to cross-examine presenters. Although the BRPA argues it was unable to cross-examine every witness it desired, this limitation cannot be faulted within the more informal declaratory process used here and, although the BCD\u2019s decision referenced the withdrawn Dutton Report without granting an opportunity for cross-examination of the author, we agree with the District Court that any error this may have constituted was harmless, given the cumulative nature of other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u00b626  The BCD did appear to stutter-step in communicating its intentions about how it would conduct the statutory process we characterized in <em>BPRA I </em>as offering \u201cno clear guidance.\u201d <em>BPRA I, </em>\u00b6 16. However, in a case which was both complicated and controversial, the BCD, four members of which are locally elected, <em>BRPA I, </em>\u00b615, n. 1, complied with its own rules, gave notice and provided an extended opportunity to submit information, permitting the BRPA and other interested persons to submit voluminous materials, offer oral opinions and statements, make objections and provide written arguments prior to the rendering of a final decision. James Haynes, now a district court judge, was appointed \u201cHearing Facilitator\u201d by the BCD and did a commendable job presiding over the hearings. We conclude that the BCD\u2019s \u201cmethod of affording\u201d public participation, \u00a7 2-3-111(1), MCA, was fundamentally fair and provided a \u201creasonable opportunity for citizen participation\u201d as required by Article II, Section 8 of the Montana Constitution, and we affirm the District Court in upholding the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\">\u00b627 B. Did the District Court err by upholding the BCD\u2019s declaratory ruling that the IMitchell Slough is not subject to the 310 Law?</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b628 The 310 Law is one of \u201ca comprehensive set of laws\u201d enacted by the Legislature to \u201caccomplish the goals of the constitution,\u201d including Article IX, section 1, which requires legislative provision of remedies to prevent \u201cdepletion and degradation of natural resources.\u201d Preamble, Ch. 361, L. 2003.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the 310 Law, enacted in 1975, Montana\u2019s \u201cnatural rivers and streams and the lands and property immediately adjacent to them\u201d are to be \u201cprotected and preserved to be available in their natural or existing state.\u201d Section 75-7-102(2), MCA. To fulfill this purpose, the 310 Law requires any person planning a physical alteration or modification of a stream to obtain approval from the conservation district before initiating the proposed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b629 At issue is whether the Mitchell Slough is a \u201cstream\u201d that falls within the regulatory provisions of the 310 Law. A \u201cstream\u201d is defined by the 310 Law as a \u201cnatural, perennial-flowing stream or river, its bed, and its immediate banks ....\u201d Section 75-7-103(6), MCA. The phrase \u201cnatural, perennial-flowing stream\u201d is not further defined in the 310 Law. A regulation promulgated by the Department of Natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Resources and Conservation (DNRC) defines the term as \u201ca stream which in the absence of diversion, impoundment, appropriation, or extreme drought flows continuously at all seasons of the year and during dry as well as wet years.\u201d Admin. R. M. 36.2.402(7).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9V\">\u00b630 In its declaratory ruling, the BCD concluded that the Mitchell is not a natural, perennial-flowing stream, and thus, is not subject to the requirements of the 310 Law. In affirming this decision, the District Court started with the proposition that \u201cnatural\u201d means something which exists in nature and is \u201cnot artificial,\u201d and thus reasoned that, when read in their entirety, \u201cthe law and the administrative regulation intended the term \u2018natural\u2019 to mean in the absence of any man-made manipulation ....\u201d From this interpretation, the District Court concluded that water diverted into the Mitchell is \u201cunnatural, appropriated water and must be excluded when determining whether or not the Mitchell is a natural, perennial-flowing stream.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\u00b631 On the premise that the Mitchell was thus not a natural stream and did not run in a primarily natural channel, the District Court also reasoned that the rule of <em>Hidden Hollow </em>did not bring irrigation return flows into the calculus of the Mitchell\u2019s status. <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch v. Fields, </em>2004 MT 153, 321 Mont. 505, 92 P.3d 1185. In <em>Hidden Hollow, </em>we held that \u201c[wjhere ... vagrant, fugitive waters have finally collected and reached a natural channel... [such as] water of a slough fed by seepage from irrigation, the waters flowing in such natural channel constitute a watercourse within the meaning of the law of water rights.\u201d <em>Hidden Hollow, </em>\u00b6 31 (quoting <em>Popham v. Holloron, </em>84 Mont. 442, 451, 275 P. 1099, 1103 (1929)). Though acknowledging that the Mitchell flowed \u201cin parts of its natural channel,\u201d the District Court observed that, due to \u201cman-made alterations such as headgates, lifts, drops[,] ... channel excavations[,] and renovations necessary to lift water from the Bitterroot River,\u201d which had migrated over the years to the west, parts of the Mitchell Slough no longer flowed in its natural channel. It concluded the <em>Hidden Hollow </em>rule would apply only \u201c[w]hen the returns flows from this diverted water hit the Bitterroot River, a natural stream.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court concluded that the Mitchell Slough is not a natural, perennial-flowing stream for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>purposes of the 310 Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\">\u00b632 The critical terms within the statutory definition of \u201cstream\u201d are \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cperennially-flowing.\u201d Regarding the latter term, there appears to be no dispute that the Mitchell flows continuously throughout the year, both during and outside of irrigation season. The BRPA notes that there was no evidence indicating the Mitchell had ever run dry. The BCD found that significant groundwater was present in the area and that \u201c[s]urface inflows and outflows on the Mitchell system do not account for all water flowing in the waterway.\u201d It found that between 10 and 16 cubic feet per second of groundwater flowed in the Mitchell, and that there was an increase in the Mitchell\u2019s flow between the diversion at Tucker Headgate and its discharge into the Bitterroot River at Bell\u2019s Crossing. However, the District Court turned to the term \u201cnatural,\u201d concluding that the Mitchell\u2019s perennial flow was sustained only by the \u201cunnatural\u201d additions discussed above. It compared the 123,000 acre feet of water \u201cdiverted into the Mitchell\u201d with 700 acre feet of \u201cnatural flow\u201d and noted testimony which predicted that the Mitchell would become \u201ca well-vegetated swale and series of disconnected wetlands\u201d but for the Tucker diversion and return flows, a conclusion it reasoned was supported by the evidence that the Mitchell\u2019s hydrology, slope and channel geometry was inconsistent with a typical rain and snowmelt dominated stream.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Arh\">\u00b633 The technical and scientific evidence entered upon the record with regard to the nature and status of the Mitchell Slough is comprehensive and compelling. Detailed professional studies have been completed. One of the studies explains the standards applied in assessing the Mitchell\u2019s status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">The primary purpose of the assessment presented in this report is to render an opinion, based upon available information, of the degree to which the Mitchell Ditch is a \u201cnatural perennial-flowing stream.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">... We assessed this question by applying criteria that are now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>being used on an international front as a guide for sustainable management of waterways (PIANC, 2002), and are being tested and evaluated for use in the US Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 Section 404 determinations (Fischenich, 2002). These criteria relate to assessing the natural functions of stream and riparian ecosystems, and were formulated by a panel of international experts in hydrology, biology, ecology, geomorphology, water resource management, and related fields. The US Army Corps of Engineers, US Environmental Protection Agency, and the US Forest Service were active participants in their formulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The approach of this study was to \u201cdescribe the stream and riparian ecosystem functions deemed important by this body of experts, and to the extent to which the functions are met on the Mitchell Ditch.\u201d Applying these standards, the report concluded: \u201cOur assessment of the functional characteristics of the Mitchell Ditch suggest that, while the ditch and its riparian corridor provide significant biological attributes, they lack the system dynamics and hydrodynamic conditions that sustain those attributes and that characterize natural systems. Despite appearances, the Mitchell Ditch is a highly artificial system that required construction to attain its current form.... [Cassation of the management activities would result in the rapid degradation of many of the functions, conversion to a lotic system, and the eventual loss of most aquatic features and characteristics.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARh\">\u00b634 The evidence in the record is substantial and clearly supports the BCD\u2019s findings of fact. Like the District Court, we do not generally disagree with the Board\u2019s factfinding. Our concern, however, is with the application of our state\u2019s legal principles to this dispute. We have few, yet important, constitutional, statutory, and regulatory provisions to guide the consideration of the question, none of which either expressly incorporates or rejects the highly technical approaches used by the studies to assess the Mitchell\u2019s natural status. While we certainly do not eschew the use of scientific evidence and models, neither can we permit such approaches to impose techni cal definitions of \u201cnatural\u201d or other terms which would be inconsistent with our State\u2019s legal principles. The District Court wrestled with this, ultimately adopting a narrow, perhaps \u201cscientific\u201d definition of \u201cnatural.\u201d It reasoned that \u201cthe law and administrative regulation intended the term \u2018natural\u2019 to mean <em>in the absence of any man-made </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>manipulation </em>...\u201d (emphasis added), and concluded that the water in the Mitchell was overwhelmingly \u201cunnatural.\u201d For reasons explained below, we believe the definition adopted by the District Court, and the conclusions premised thereon, are errors of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\">\u00b635 There would be little disagreement with the proposition that virtually all of Montana\u2019s waters have been altered or manipulated by man. The evidence in this case demonstrates that the primary source water for the Mitchell, the Bitterroot River, is no exception. The western migration of the Bitterroot noted by the District Court has necessitated extensive manipulations by man in order to keep water flowing into the Bitterroot\u2019s East Fork, from which the Tucker Headgate diverts water into the Mitchell, and has done so for one hundred years:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">Flow must be redirected at times of the year from the West Channel into the East Channel of the Bitterroot River... The very existence of the East Channel has recently been dependent upon the actions of the ditch companies who are required to regrade and berm channel deposits in order to convey flow to the East Channel. Without the East Channel, Mitchell Ditch would not receive surface water flow, directly from the Bitterroot River.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4b\"><em>Summary of Opinions, Mitchell Ditch, </em>May 2005, Michael E. Nicklin, Ph.D., P.E., Nicklin Earth &amp; Water, Inc., p. 3.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">As a result of man\u2019s activities, numerous structures can be seen on all the different years of aerial photography that were analyzed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">These structures indicate that large-scale early efforts were required by people to prevent westward migration of the Bitterroot in order to capture its water and move it east and northward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">...

Although the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Court\u2019s determination that the Bitterroot is a \u201cnatural stream\u201d would not be disputed, it is also clear that the East Fork of the Bitterroot would not sustain a flow in its present location \u201cin the absence of man-made manipulation.\u201d Of course, in the absence of manipulation, the Bitterroot would flow elsewhere, but this point serves only to demonstrate the problem with employing a strictly technical definition of the term \u201cnatural\u201d: even the water diverted at Tucker Headgate is not entirely \u201cnatural.\u201d Thus, the District Court\u2019s definition of the term, as definitive and convenient as it may be, is unworkably narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b637 When passing the 310 Law, the Legislature recognized man\u2019s impact, both past and future, upon the State\u2019s waters, requiring that rivers and streams \u201care to be protected and preserved to be available in their <em>natural, or existing state, </em>and to prohibit unauthorized projects ....\u201d Section 2, Chap. 463, L. 1975 (emphasis added). The bill\u2019s title stated it was for \u201cAn Act to provide for a policy of preserving the <em>natural or existing shape, form and course </em>of streams to activities of private persons or organizations ...\u201d (emphasis added). The 310 Law thus contemplated protection of the \u201cexisting shape, form and course\u201d of waters, even if those waters were no longer purely \u201cnatural.\u201d The \u201cexisting\u201d state of affairs when the 310 Law was passed in 1975 was that the East Fork of the Bitterroot had already been heavily manipulated in order to convey water to Tucker Headgate, which was then diverting water into the quarter-mile dug channel leading to the Mitchell Slough. Looking ahead to future impacts, the 310 Law required stream \u201cprojects\u2019-physical alterations or modifications-tobe pre-authorized by a conservation district. Section 75-7-103(5) -111, - 112, MCA. The Tucker Headgate is precisely the kind of stream alteration which would be subject to review and approval under the 310 Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b638 The DNRC\u2019s regulation, promulgated in an effort to provide a workable definition of a \u201cnatural, perennial-flowing stream\u201d to be protected by the 310 Law, defines the term as \u201ca stream which in the absence of diversion, impoundment, appropriation, or extreme drought flows continuously at all seasons of the year and during dry as well as wet years.\u201d Admin. R. M. 36.2.402(7). The parties argue over whether the term \u201cabsence of diversion\u201d requires exclusion of water diverted only \u201cout of\u2019 a stream, as argued by BRPA, or also water \u201cinto\u201d a stream, as argued by BCD and applied by the District Court, in determining a stream\u2019s status under the 310 Law. BRPA also argues that the term \u201cabsence of diversion\u201d is ambiguous, given these possible interpretations, and urges us to consider the rule\u2019s legislative history. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>That history supports BRPA\u2019s interpretation, as does the plain language of the terms listed in the rule. \u201cDiversion,\u201d \u201cimpoundment,\u201d \u201cappropriation,\u201d and \u201cextreme drought,\u201d when viewed together, all contemplate water being taken \u201cout\u201d of a stream, not being added to a stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\">\u00b639 However, though helpful, it is clear that this regulation does not contemplate all of the circumstances presented in this case. The rule\u2019s definition of \u201cnatural, perennial-flowing stream\u201d assumes the existence of a natural stream: \u201c \u2018[a] natural, perennial-flowing stream\u2019 means a stream....\u201d It provides protection for the stream which runs dry, if the stream would otherwise flow continuously without diversions, impoundments, appropriations and droughts. <em>See also </em>Admin. R. M. 36.2.407 (\u201cA [conservation] district may consider a stream to flow perennially if it dries up periodically due to man-made causes, or extreme drought.\u201d). The rule does not provide guidance on the question of whether a natural stream exists in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b640 Given the state of the law, we see no other way to determine whether the Mitchell Slough is a \u201cnatural, perennial-flowing stream or river\u201d other than by considering the totality of the circumstances demonstrated by the factual record. In view of man\u2019s pervasive impact upon the State\u2019s waters, and the 310 Law\u2019s originally stated purpose to protect streams in their \u201cnatural or existing\u201d state in order to implement the constitutional directive to prevent the \u201cdepletion and degradation of natural resources,\u201d the nature and extent of man\u2019s impact must also be a consideration in this determination. The question is necessarily more complicated than simply asking whether man has or has not manipulated the water and its channel. With this in mind, we turn to the factual record.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b641 Evidence of the Mitchell\u2019s history includes a General Land Office surveying map prepared in 1872, prior to statehood, which indicated area water courses. Although noting that the Mitchell does not correspond precisely with the courses noted thereon, the BCD found that several sections of the Mitchell\u2019s channel are co-extensive with the slough depicted on the 1872 GLO map. The BCD found that the Mitchell has been \u201cmanipulated, moved and straightened\u201d since 1872, but that surface waters flowing into the Mitchell through the manmade channel at Tucker Headgate \u201cultimately flow into a historic natural channel.\u201d The BCD concluded from these findings that the Mitchell \u201cis partly man-made and partly within a historic channel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AECa\">\u00b642 Despite these findings regarding the Mitchell\u2019s channel, the BCD now argues that the term \u201cnatural\u201d should apply only to \u201cflow\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>should not \u201cbe defined in terms of the character of the channel.\u201d The BCD reasons that \u201ca gully, an ephemeral stream, and an intermittent stream all exist in natural channels. The fact that the channels are natural says nothing about the character of the flow.\u201d However, we disagree. The 310 Law\u2019s definition of \u201cstream\u201d includes \u201cany natural, perennial-flowing stream or river, <em>its bed, and its immediate banks...\u201d </em>\u00a7 75-7-103(6), MCA (emphasis added), and the Law\u2019s statement of intent refers to preservation of \u201cnatural rivers and streams <em>and the lands and property immediately adjacent to them.\u201d </em>Section 75-7-102(2), MCA (emphasis added). While the stream\u2019s flow is obviously critical, the nature of the channel is nonetheless a relevant consideration. Although man has made many alterations, the Mitchell is acknowledged to flow in a significantly historic, natural channel, parts of which date back over 100 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b643 This conclusion undermines the District Court\u2019s determination that return irrigation flows cannot be included in the calculus of the Mitchell\u2019s status under <em>Hidden Hollow </em>because such flows do not return to a <em>\u201cnatural </em>channel\u201d (emphasis by District Court). The District Court acknowledged that its exclusion of return flows rested on the presupposition that the Mitchell was not a natural watercourse but, of course, that is the ultimate issue of this litigation, and the facts must be considered before a conclusion of law can be reached. Given the Mitchell\u2019s significantly historic, natural channel and the return of irrigation waters to the Mitchell\u2019s flow, wherein such fugitive waters collect and \u201close their original character as seepage,\u201d such as \u201cwater of a slough fed by seepage from irrigation,\u201d and become part of the watercourse, these waters are subject to further appropriation and are properly considered in determining the Mitchell\u2019s status. <em>Hidden Hollow, </em>\u00b6 31. As noted, the BCD found that the Mitchell\u2019s flow increases along its course, and one reason for that is the return of irrigation waters from the entire Mitchell Catchment, some of which are originally diverted at Tucker Headgate, and some of which are diverted elsewhere. The Mitchell thus serves as a conduit to collect and carry these vagrant waters, from various point sources, to their reunification with the Bitterroot River at Bell\u2019s Crossing. These return flows join the Mitchell\u2019s natural waters, fed by groundwater springs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>and precipitation, and flow together.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\">\u00b644 The first feature which stands out about the Tucker Headgate is the magnitude of water it diverts from the Bitterroot River. The District Court described the diversion as a \u201chuge volume of water.\u201d Although the total amount of water diverted annually at Tucker Headgate is not a matter of record, it is estimated that the water diverted from the Mitchell Slough for irrigation purposes exceeds 40,000 acre-feet,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or enough water to cover 40,000 acres with a foot of water. Of course, the Tucker Headgate diverts a large volume of water primarily to serve the appropriative rights of area irrigators, and rightfully so. As the 310 Law states, \u201cit is the policy of this state to recognize the needs of irrigation and agricultural use of the rivers and streams of the state of Montana,\u201d Section 75-7-102(2), MCA, and the Tucker Headgate diversion provides for these uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u00b645 In consideration of this primary use, the District Court concluded that \u201c[wjater diverted into the Mitchell is unnatural, appropriated water and must be excluded\u201d from consideration of the Mitchell\u2019s status. (Emphasis omitted.) However, it is very clear from the record that the large volume of water diverted at Tucker Headgate is not exclusively dedicated to appropriative rights. Although the District Court noted that the weight to be assigned to the \u201cvibrant\u201d fishery evidence was in the BCD\u2019s discretion, there is no dispute that such fisheries exist and habitat has been developed along the Mitchell, as the BCD found. The fisheries are supported by a perennial flow, whether in or out of irrigation season. The flow increases along its path and deposits more water back into the Bitterroot River than diverted from the Bitterroot at Tucker Headgate. The fishery development along the Mitchell is made possible by deployment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>state natural resource-waters diverted from Tucker Headgate not consumed by appropriative rights, as well as return flows, groundwater, springs and precipitation. The 310 Law is intended to \u201cprotect the use of water for any useful or beneficial purpose as guaranteed by The Constitution of the State of Montana.\u201d Section 75-7-102(2), MCA. Further, the Law\u2019s purpose is to fulfill the constitutional directive to \u201cprevent unreasonable depletion and degradation of natural resources.\u201d Section 75-7-102(1), MCA; Mont. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 1(3). To allow the volume of water flowing in the Mitchell which is not consumed by appropriative uses to simply cede from the jurisdiction of the Law designed to protect the state\u2019s waters would be to fail \u201cto protect the use of water for any useful or beneficial purpose,\u201d and would be an \u201cunreasonable depletion\u201d of a state resource.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b646  The District Court did a yeoman\u2019s job in wrestling with this issue. However, the conclusion that natural, perennial-flowing streams must have flows which have never been diverted, impounded, appropriated or otherwise manipulated by man was incorrect. That definition is unreasonably narrow as inconsistent with the 310 Law and the extensive, man-impacted condition of the state\u2019s waters. The Mitchell flows continuously through significant portions of a historic channel, includes flows from groundwater, springs, return flows and precipitation, and includes waters exceeding what are necessary to serve seasonal irrigation rights and other beneficial uses. Such excess waters are a state resource.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b647  Thus, upon this record and upon a consideration of the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the Mitchell Slough qualifies as a natural, perennial-flowing stream under the 310 Law. We thus reverse the judgment and remand for entry of a judgment in favor of BRPA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\n<em>II. The Stream, Access Law Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u00b648 As noted above, the BRPA and FWP are appealing from the stream access judgment. Landowners are Appellees. The BCD is not a party to the stream access issue, as that issue was raised by a declaratory action filed in the district court. The stream access claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>constituted Count IV of the First Amended Complaint and the Landowners\u2019 cross-claim and was tried before the District Court, sitting without a jury. By order of May 10, 2006, the District Court entered judgment in favor of the Intervenors and Landowners that the Mitchell Slough was not subject to public recreational use under the Stream Access Law. In addition to its own analysis and order, the District Court adopted by reference the extensive proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law submitted by the Intervenors/Landowners. Those findings took judicial notice of the Declaratory Ruling issued by the BCD in the 310 Law case within n. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\">\u00b649 Although the two primary issues in this appeal involve the status of the Mitchell Slough, they are not the same inquiry. As we have explained, \u201cthe Streambed Preservation Act [310 Law] and the Stream Access Act each use two entirely different definitions for designating what bodies of water are covered under their respective provisions ... Neither the [310 Law] nor the Stream Access Act states that if a body of water is not a stream under the [310 Law], it is necessarily a ditch under the Stream Access Act. Therefore, while the BCD\u2019s decision on the Mitchell Slough\u2019s status as a stream is potentially significant, the decision, regardless of its outcome, does not necessarily determine whether the Mitchell Slough is a ditch under the Stream Access Act. These are two separate factual inquiries.\u201d <em>BRPA I, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b650 The arguments of the parties and amici regarding the application of the SAL do not venture far from the underlying constitutional rights which protect their respective interests. BRPA, FWP and Amici Sportmen\u2019s Groups focus on the declaration within Article IX, Section 3, that all waters within Montana are owned by the state for the use of its people. Landowners and Amici Stockgrowers emphasize that same provision\u2019s preservation of appropriative rights and cite the property right protections within Article II, Section 3, and Article IX, Section 7. Each party beckons us to view the case and decide it while looking through different constitutional lenses. This is not the first time the Court has experienced the constitutional tension which permeates this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u00b651 The 1972 Constitution contained a new provision-not part of the 1889 Constitution-which expressly addressed the state\u2019s ownership of all waters. Article IX, Section 3(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">All surface waters, underground, flood, and atmospheric waters within the boundaries of the state are the property of the state for the use of its people and are subject to appropriation for beneficial uses as provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Citing this provision, the Court, in <em>Montana Coalition for Stream Access, Inc. v. Curran, </em>held that \u201cunder the public trust doctrine and the 1972 Montana Constitution, any surface waters that are capable of recreational use may be so used by the public without regard to streambed ownership or navigability for nonrecreational purposes.\u201d 210 Mont. 38, 53, 682 P.2d 163, 171 (1984); <em>see also Mont. Coalition for Stream Access, Inc. v. Hildreth, </em>211 Mont. 29, 35, 684 P.2d 1088, 1091 (1984). We added a \u201ccautionary note that nothing herein contained in this opinion shall be construed as granting the public the right to enter upon or cross over private property to reach the State-owned waters hereby held available for recreational purposes.\u201d <em>Curran, </em>210 Mont. at 55, 682 P.2d at 172; <em>Hildreth, </em>211 Mont. at 36, 684 P.2d at 1091. In response to the <em>Curran </em>and <em>Hildreth </em>decisions, the 1985 Legislature enacted the SAL, an act \u201cgenerally defining laws relating to recreational use of state waters,\u201d to codify and provide specifics with regard to recreational use of state waters. Ch. 556, L. 1985. The SAL was challenged on constitutional grounds by landowners in <em>Galt v. State, </em>225 Mont. 142, 731 P.2d 912, (1987), and the constitutional protections referenced by the parties in this case were likewise argued by the parties in <em>Galt </em>to respectively challenge and defend the various provisions of the SAL. We stated that \u201c[t]he real property interests of private landowners are important as are the public\u2019s property interest in water. Both are constitutionally protected. These competing interests, when in conflict, must be reconciled to the extent possible.\u201d <em>Galt, </em>225 Mont. at 148, 731 P.2d at 916. The Court reconciled these constitutional rights by striking several provision of the SAL as violative of private property rights, and by affirming the balance of the Act as constitutional.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Galt, </em>225 Mont. at 148-49, 731 P.2d at 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b652 Although the parties\u2019 arguments are laced with constitutional language, we are not faced here, as in <em>Galt, </em>with a constitutional challenge to any of the provisions of the SAL. Rather, this case is primarily one of statutory interpretation, the application of the SAL to the factual record. We do our utmost, in undertaking this task, to act with respect for all of the constitutional rights of the parties, and with respect for this Court\u2019s previous efforts to balance the constitutional rights at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u00b653 A. Did the District Court err by adopting Appellee\u2019s Walter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>E. Babcock, et al. and the Montana Farm Bureau Federation\u2019s proposed findings of fact verbatim?</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\">\u00b654 The BRPA argues that the District Court failed to exercise independent judgment by adopting Landowners\u2019 proposed SAL Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law verbatim. According to the BRPA, the District Court\u2019s adopted Findings are clearly erroneous because they are not supported by substantial credible evidence. The BRPA argues that the adopted Findings contain imprecise citations to the record and are contradicted by the BCD\u2019s 310 Law decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\u00b655 \u201cAlthough we have discouraged the practice of adopting verbatim the proposed findings and conclusions submitted by a party, we recognize that, once adopted, the findings become formally those of the district court judge, and are not to be overturned simply because the court relied upon proposed findings and conclusions submitted by counsel.\u201d <em>Rossi v. Pawiroredjo, </em>2004 MT 39, \u00b6 26, 320 Mont. 63, \u00b6 26, 85 P.3d 776, \u00b6 26 (citation omitted). \u201c[A] court is not necessarily prohibited from adopting the prevailing party\u2019s proposed findings; the test is whether the findings are sufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to the issues to provide a basis for decision and whether they are supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Crilly, </em>2005 MT 311, \u00b6 38, 329 Mont. 479, \u00b6 38, 124 P.3d 1151, \u00b6 38 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u00b656 A review of the District Court\u2019s order and the Landowners\u2019 proposed findings and conclusions does not indicate error was committed merely by virtue of the court\u2019s verbatim adoption of the findings and conclusions. While there are instances in which Landowners\u2019 proposed findings do not entirely comport with the District Court\u2019s opinion, those discrepancies are minor. The District Court clearly performed its own analysis and drafted its own narrative order. Its further verbatim adoption of the Landowners\u2019 proposed findings and conclusions, which did not conflict with the court\u2019s narrative order in any significant way, was not error. Whether these conclusions were substantively correct is a separate issue, discussed hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\u00b657 B. Did the District Court err by requiring Appellants to prove by a \u201cclear preponderance\u201d that the Mitchell Slough is a natural water body, and in its application of that burden of proof?</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\u00b658 Noting the District Court\u2019s conclusion that BRPA did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Mitchell was a natural water body, the BRPA argues that, because Landowners brought a cross-claim asking the District Court to declare the Mitchell Slough exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>from the SAL, the burden of proof should have been on Landowners to prove that the Mitchell is <em>not </em>a natural water body in order to further protection of the state\u2019s resources. BRPA also argues that, because constitutional interests in accessing a public resource are at stake when a stream is declared exempt from recreational use under the SAL, and the public\u2019s use foreclosed, the District Court should have imposed a heightened burden of proof on Landowners in order to prevail on their claim. Instead of proof by preponderance of the evidence, BRPA, citing <em>Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 99 S. Ct. 1804 (1979), urges the Court to require a \u201cclear, unequivocal and convincing\u201d standard of proof in order to \u201cde-list\u201d a stream from SAL\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u00b659 Landowners reply that the SAL protects many constitutional rights, including their right to protect private property and privacy, and that the District Court decided disputed issues of fact by properly applying a \u201cclear preponderance of the evidence\u201d standard to both sides. Appellee Marnell Corrao\u2019s brief notes that the Legislature has departed from the standard civil burden of proof for specific kinds of cases only rarely, and did not do so for the SAL, arguing that BRPA\u2019s request for a heightened standard \u201cis a weak reed. Montana\u2019s noxious weed management trust fund enjoys constitutional status proximate to those advocated by Appellants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u00b660 The BRPA\u2019s reliance upon <em>Addington </em>is not persuasive for purposes of this issue. <em>Addington </em>concerned the quantum of evidence a state was required to provide in order to comport with due process when seeking the involuntary commitment of a mentally ill person. <em>Addington, </em>441 U.S. at 419-20, 99 S. Ct. at 1806. The U.S. Supreme Court explained that \u201cthe individual\u2019s interest in the outcome of a civil commitment proceeding is of such weight and gravity that due process requires the state to justify confinement by proof more substantial than a mere preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Addington, </em>441 U.S. at 427, 99 S. Ct. at 1810. Such individual liberty interests are not at stake here.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u00b661 Each side filed pleadings seeking a determination of the status of the Mitchell. Landowners\u2019 cross-claim sought a declaration that the Mitchell was an artificial waterway not subject to recreation under the SAL, and BRPA amended its complaint to request the opposite declaration, that the Mitchell was natural and subject to recreational access. The District Court required the parties to meet \u201cthe burden of persuasion as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense he is asserting,\u201d \u00a7 26-1-402, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>MCA, by imposing the burden of preponderance of the evidence on each side.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Had the court been faced with just one claim, it is possible that the proof would have been insufficient, the claim dismissed, and the status of the Mitchell left undetermined. However, faced with dueling claims seeking the opposite relief, the court concluded that the Landowners\u2019 claim had been established by the evidence and that BRPA\u2019s claim had not, thus concluding that the Mitchell was not subject to recreational access.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\">\u00b662 The burden of proof required of the parties by the court was appropriate for the issue and reflected the balance of the Landowners\u2019 private property rights and the public\u2019s stream access rights. \u201cBoth are constitutionally protected.\u201d <em>Galt, </em>225 Mont. at 148, 731 P.2d at 916. Thus, we discern no error in the District Court\u2019s requirement that Appellants prove their claim that the Mitchell Slough is a natural water body by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d Whether the District Court correctly concluded that Appellants failed to satisfy that burden of proof is another question, which we next address.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">\u00b663 C. Did the District Court err by concluding the Mitchell Slough is not a \u201cnatural water body\u201d for purposes of the SAL, and therefore not subject to public recreational access?</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u00b664 The BRPA and FWP argue that the Mitchell Slough is subject to public recreational use because it was naturally formed, flows perennially, sustains a vibrant fishery, and has been used by fishermen and hunters for decades. According to the BRPA and FWP, the District Court erred by concluding that the Mitchell Slough, though once natural, has been changed into an irrigation ditch or canal by way of physical alterations made by Landowners over the years. In response, Landowners argue that the Mitchell Slough\u2019s existence is a demonstration of \u201cthe genius of man\u201d which has prevented the Bitterroot River from migrating west and thereby abandoning the Mitchell Slough, which flows through a series of diversions, weirs, and excavations at a higher elevation than the Bitterroot. According to Landowners, the Mitchell Slough has become merely a canal or drain serving the needs of appropriators along its path, and would not exist in its present condition without artificial controls and irrigation inflows from the broader Bitterroot Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u00b665 The SAL provides that \u201call surface waters that are capable of recreational use may be so used by the public without regard to the ownership of the land underlying the waters.\u201d Section 23-2-302(1), MCA. The Act defines \u201csurface waters\u201d as \u201ca natural water body, its bed, and its banks up to the ordinary high-water mark.\u201d Section 23-2-301(12), MCA. The SAL further provides that this public right of recreational access does not include \u201cthe recreational use of waters while diverted away from a natural water body for beneficial use\u201d without \u201cpermission or contractual arrangement with the landowner.\u201d Section 23-2-302(2)(c), MCA. In turn, the phrase \u201cdiverted away from a natural water bod/\u2019 is defined as \u201ca diversion of surface water through a manmade water conveyance system, including but not limited to ... an irrigation or drainage canal or ditch ....\u201d Section 23-2-301(6)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\u00b666 The District Court identified the \u201ccritical question\u201d before it as whether the Mitchell is a \u201cnatural water body\u201d under the SAL, and whether the exceptions under the SAL apply. \u201cNatural\u201d is not defined in the Act, and thus the District Court applied a Webster\u2019s Dictionary definition of \u201cnatural\u201d as \u201carising from; in accordance with what is found in nature; not artificial or manufactured.\u201d The court concluded that the Mitchell does not fall within this definition. The court noted that the Mitchell may have been a natural water body at some point in the past, but that it is \u201cno longer a natural water body\u201d because the Bitterroot River has, by natural processes, migrated away from and below the elevation of the Mitchell, and the Mitchell itself has been extensively manipulated to ensure a continued, substantial flow. The court reasoned that yearly maintenance at Tucker Headgate and \u201cmassive amounts of channel work\u201d have changed the Mitchell enough that it \u201ccan no longer be considered a natural channel even though some portions of the channel are still in identifiable historic locations.\u201d Though stating its agreement with the proposition that man\u2019s manipulations cannot change a natural channel into a manmade ditch, the court concluded that nonetheless \u201cit is only as a result of man\u2019s manipulations that the Mitchell maintains any appearance at all of a natural channel.\u201d These determinations, combined with its conclusion that Appellants had not proven that natural flows in the Mitchell were \u201cuninfluenced by diverted water[,]\u201d led the District Court to hold that the Mitchell is not a \u201cnatural water bod/\u2019 under the SAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\u00b667 Three statutory phrases of the SAL are at issue and must be satisfied for the Mitchell to be subject to public recreational use. They are essentially stated as follows: that the Mitchell is 1) a natural water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>body 2) capable of recreational use and 3) not diverted away from a natural water body through a manmade conveyance system-one of the SAL\u2019s exceptions. Taking the easiest one first-capable of recreational use-there is no dispute that the Mitchell is so capable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Landowners do not rebut BRPA\u2019s arguments regarding hunting, boating and, particularly, fishing which has historically occurred on the Mitchell, including BRPA\u2019s citation to the testimony of a witness who moved to the area in 1928 and reported extensive fishing along the Mitchell in the years thereafter. For this reason the District Court noted that the dispute before it concerned the other two statutory criteria-that \u201cthe Mitchell is not a natural water body and falls under the exceptions to the Stream Access Law ....\u201d While these were no doubt the contested issues, the court nonetheless minimized the significance of the Mitchell\u2019s recreational capability. Although finding that the Mitchell is used for \u201cfish and wildlife purposes\u201d by landowners who \u201chave altered the condition of the Mitchell in an attempt to develop or enhance fish and wildlife habitat,\u201d it reasoned that \u201cwhether people have fished or recreated on the Mitchell or whether fish inhabit the Mitchell\u201d or \u201csimply because fish may migrate in and out of the Bitterroot to the Mitchell\u201d is of \u201clittle assistance in determining the character of the Mitchell as a natural water body.\u201d The District Court thus turned quickly to the question of the Mitchell\u2019s status as a natural water body, entering no conclusions of law regarding the Mitchell\u2019s capability for recreational use. Our determination of the Mitchell\u2019s natural status will incorporate its recreational capability, a fact we will return to in the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\">\u00b668 As noted, to decide the Mitchell\u2019s status, the District Court employed a dictionary definition of natural: \u201cin accordance with what is found in nature; not artificial or manufactured.\u201d The District Court\u2019s logic followed strictly from this point of beginning, rejecting consideration of any waters flowing in the Mitchell unless they were \u201cuninfluenced\u201d by man in any way. Consequently, for example, the court refused to attach any significance to irrigation returns flows from the surrounding area, commonly referred to as the Mitchell Catchment and encompassing various irrigation ditches, into the Mitchell Slough because such flows were \u201cnot natural water.\u201d Rather, the court deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>these waters \u201cartificially imported\u201d-not because they had been imported into the Mitchell Slough itself, but because they had been imported into the surrounding area-and, thus, their eventual flow into the Slough could not be considered natural because of man\u2019s previous impact upon them. As Amici Sportsmen\u2019s Groups note, \u201cthe court means by the phrase \u2018natural water\u2019 water that has <em>never </em>been \u2018diverted.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\u00b669 The Court heard testimony from a number of witnesses qualified as experts in the field of hydrology and reasoned that a dictionary definition of \u201cnatural\u201d was \u201cused by most, if not all, of the experts,\u201d noting that the \u201cscientific evidence clearly carried the most sway in deciding the critical questions before the Court.\u201d Many of the same witnesses who participated in the 310 Law case also testified at the SAL trial, providing similar information to that made available to the BCD. Upon this testimony, the court adopted the Landowners\u2019 proposed findings of fact, including Finding of Fact #115, which found that \u201cthe Mitchell is not a natural waterbody.\u201d The Landowners press this designation on appeal, asserting that \u201c[w]hether the Mitchell is a \u2018natural water body\u2019 is a question of fact.... The central issue of this case boils down to a simple factual dispute of whether or not the Mitchell is a natural water body.\u201d However, we view the central question as neither simple nor as one of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\u00b670  By its terms, the SAL requires a determination to be made about whether a stream is a \u201cnatural water body.\u201d As a prerequisite to the statute\u2019s applicability, that determination is a conclusion of law. While evidence concerning a stream\u2019s natural characteristics may support findings of fact, the ultimate determination of the SAL\u2019s interpretation and application is a legal question. \u201cA statutory interpretation is a conclusion of law, which we review to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 150, \u00b6 15, 310 Mont. 320, \u00b6 15, 50 P.3d 530, \u00b6 15. Thus, whether the Mitchell is a natural water body for purposes of the SAL is ultimately a conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\u00b671 In addition, we have not found the application of this statutory term to be as simple and straightforward as a dictionary definition might permit. The expert testimony which provided opinions about the \u201cnaturalness\u201d of the Mitchell in accordance with a dictionary definition of the term was logical in a scientific sense. As we noted in the 310 Law case, we certainly do not reject the use of such scientific evidence. However, in addition to considering the evidence, we have the additional duty of interpreting the law-here, applying a statute \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>implement the objectives that the Legislature sought to achieve,\u201d <em>Boettcher v. Montana Guaranty Fund, </em>2007 MT 69, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont. 393, \u00b6 19, 154 P.3d 629, \u00b6 19, in accordance with our precedent previously addressing the SAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\">\u00b672  The record reveals that man\u2019s impact upon the waters at issue begins long before those waters reach the Mitchell Slough. The Bitterroot River is migrating to the west. Although the District Court noted that it is not man\u2019s manipulations which are causing this migration, man has responded to the migration by manipulating the West Fork of the Bitterroot to force more water down the East Fork, from which the Tucker Headgate moves water into the Mitchell. One rancher testified that the Bitterroot River \u201cwants to go to the west, so we have to keep bringing it back.\u201d Bruce Anderson, an expert hydrologist for the Landowners, testified that many Montana rivers have likewise been channelized and reshaped, and have had weirs and diversion structures placed in them. At Painted Rocks Reservoir, man manipulates the water by first impounding it and then releasing it to feed the Bitterroot River in late summer. Under a definition of \u201cnatural\u201d which rejects consideration of water flows on which man has had any impact, precious little water in the Mitchell Slough could be considered natural-and, for that matter, flows within the Bitterroot River might not qualify either. Under cross examination, Bruce Anderson testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\">Q. And you would agree with me that, in your familiarity with the Bitterroot Valley, the whole surface and groundwater in the valley has, in fact, been altered by humans?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">A. That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Indeed, under this narrow interpretation, few Montana streams and rivers would qualify as \u201cnatural.\u201d FWP notes the testimony of Chris Clancy, a Department expert in streams and fisheries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">Q. Are there any mainstem rivers-I\u2019m talking about the Yellowstone, the Missouri, the Beaverhead, Gallatin-any mainstem rivers in Montana that have not been altered by humans?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">A. None that I\u2019m aware of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Under a technical or scientific definition of natural, recreational access under the SAL could be drastically limited. We thus conclude that the District Court\u2019s dictionary-based definition, which essentially requires a pristine river unaffected by humans in order to be deemed \u201cnatural,\u201d results in an absurdity: for many Montana waters, the SAL would prohibit the very access it was enacted to provide. \u201cStatutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>construction should not lead to absurd results if a reasonable interpretation can avoid it <em>.\u2019\u2019Mont.

Evidence of the extent of man\u2019s efforts must be considered in conjunction with all other circumstances in a fact-driven inquiry. Amici Stockgrowers has stated the proposition well: \u201cThere is simply no requirement in the law that a man-made conveyance system may not make use of natural features, nor is there a requirement that a natural water body must exist in a pristine, untouched condition. Rather, the analysis required by the Stream Access Law is fact dependent.\u201d Thus, the mere fact that man has influenced a waterway does not require its exclusion from access provided under the SAL. All of the salient facts and circumstances must be considered in the determination. With this reversal of the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the statutes as an error of law, we turn to the facts and circumstances regarding the Mitchell Slough.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\u00b674 In the Nineteenth century, the Mitchell Slough was substantial enough to support the irrigation needs of three ditch companies: the Union, Etna, and Webfoot. The District Court noted that perhaps \u201cas early as 130 years ago the Mitchell Slough may well have been considered a natural water body....\u201d At that time, the Mitchell Slough appeared to be a side-channel of the Bitterroot River, and an 1872 GLO Survey Map reflects a channel which overlaps to some degree the Mitchell\u2019s present location.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The District Court found that, in 1915, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>project to improve flow to the Union, Etna, and Webfoot Ditches included the construction of a concrete diversion dam across the Bitterroot \u201cto divert water ... into a side channel of the river, where a dependable supply of water would be available at all times to the three ditch systems,\u201d and that this \u201cside channel\u201d of the Bitterroot was the Mitchell Slough.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Tucker Headgate was placed in its current location in the 1940\u2019s and a quarter-mile canal was dug to connect the Mitchell with this new diversion point.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\">\u00b675 It is not disputed that the Mitchell flows perennially, whether in or out of irrigation season, and that the Mitchell\u2019s flow increases during its course. Measurements taken out in February 2001, by the U.S. Geological Survey found that the flow below Tucker Headgate was 18.2 c.f.s. The combined discharge of the east and west branches of the Mitchell as they flowed back into the Bitterroot was 43.9 c.f.s., or a gain of 25.7 c.f.s. Dr. Kendy estimated that, when the discharge from the Mitchell into Bushy Creek, which also empties back into the Bitterroot, was added in, the total flow from the Mitchell into the Bitterroot would be approximately 60.45 c.f.s., or an increase of about 42.25 c.f.s. over the flow measured below Tucker Headgate.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">\u00b676 There are various sources for this increased flow and the most significant source was found by the District Court to be irrigation return flows and drain waters. \u201c[B]ecause of the tremendous amount of irrigation and drain water imported into the Mitchell catchment from upstream River diversions and ditch systems, irrigation waste water and return flows contribute to the Mitchell on a year round basis.\u201d The District Court explained the sources of these waters more specifically as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">This water is water that is artificially imported into the Mitchell catchment from the Bitterroot River and upstream reservoir releases, including water from the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation\u2019s... Painted Rocks Reservoir, by the extensive system of ditches and drains east and south of the Mitchell. This water and its influence on the hydrology of the Mitchell are dramatic and is not a natural condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Thus, after finding that the Mitchell served to collect and conduct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>significant volume of water which drained from the entire area-including lands irrigated by water from other water bodies and diversions-the District Court determined that these collective flows must be considered \u201cartificial\u201d and \u201cnot natural.\u201d By so doing, the District Court eliminated consideration of the Mitchell\u2019s most significant source of flow, except for the Tucker Headgate, and the primary reason that the Mitchell\u2019s flow increases over its 16-mile pathway. We conclude that this exclusion, arising from the initial narrow definition of natural, was in error. Many Montana streams carry discharged irrigation flows. As we held in <em>Hidden Hollow, </em>\u201cwhere ... vagrant, fugitive waters have finally collected and reached a natural channel, and thus lose their original character as seepage, percolating, surface, or waste waters, and flow with such regularity,\u201d such waters become a watercourse for purposes of appropriative water rights. <em>Hidden Hollow, </em>\u00b6 31. The Mitchell serves as a conduit for more irrigation wastewater than just the water it provides for irrigation; irrigation returns from the surrounding area also flow into the Mitchell. This collection serves a greater purpose than merely draining the fields it sources and should not, without more, be considered an \u201cunnatural\u201d occurrence. Rather, the Mitchell serves as the watercourse from which such waters can again be appropriated<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">\u00b677 Application of the analogy from appropriative water law as expressed in <em>Hidden Hollow </em>requires the conclusion that the Mitchell is a watercourse flowing in a \u201cnatural channel,\u201d and thus we depart momentarily from our consideration of whether the Mitchell\u2019s waters are \u201cnatural\u201d and turn to the allied question of whether the Mitchell Slough is \u201ca manmade water conveyance system.\u201d Section 23-2-301(6), MCA. This is an exception to the SAL\u2019s provision of public access to surface waters which are capable of recreational use. Though requiring an inquiry which, in this case, overlaps factually with the question of the naturalness of the Mitchell, the exception focuses more directly upon the origin and nature of the channel and its role in conveying water diverted by Tucker Headgate and tunneled through the 400 yard canal dug to the Mitchell. Referencing these functions, and noting the other extensive improvements they have made, the Landowners argue that the Mitchell Slough \u201cis, in fact, a man-made water conveyance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>system\u201d which \u201cexists only because of man\u2019s manipulations.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AhZ\">\u00b678 The claim that man has made the Mitchell Slough is a bold one, indeed. The Landowners were necessarily ambitious in undertaking proof of the claim, providing a mountain of evidence to support the District Court\u2019s findings of fact detailing the extensive alterations made by man along the 16-mile course of the Mitchell. This ambitious effort to demonstrate man\u2019s impact was necessary in light of the long historical record of the Mitchell as a water body. The District Court acknowledged that, 130 years ago, the Mitchell was a natural water body which may have then qualified as such under today\u2019s SAL, and it is undisputed that water has flowed through the Mitchell Slough ever since. Except for the canal directly below the Tucker Headgate, dug to connect the Mitchell with the Tucker Headgate diversion, there is no evidence that the Mitchell\u2019s 16-mile channel was originally dug or created by humans. It was naturally formed and significant portions of the channel remain in its historic location.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">\u00b679  Although briefly mentioning this historical evidence, the District Court gave short shrift to it in favor of man\u2019s relatively recent work upon the Mitchell, particularly over the past fifteen to twenty five years: \u201clandowners have conducted extensive alterations of the Mitchell since approximately the mid-1980s to establish the Mitchell\u2019s now stream-like characteristics\u201d; \u201csince at least the 1990s, this reach of the Mitchell has undergone systematic alteration by the owners ....\u201d However, although more recent efforts undertaken for the benefit of the irrigators using the Mitchell have altered it into something other than the pristine side-channel of the Bitterroot River that it once was, it cannot be concluded from this record that the Mitchell\u2019s 16-mile channel lost its original natural character by such work and was transformed into a \u201cmanmade\u201d conveyance system. Man-improved, certainly, but not man-made. While the Tucker Headgate, the 400 yard canal and other improvements were certainly man-provided, too much of the Mitchell\u2019s physical channel, and too many of the functions served by the channel, are provided by nature to be able to conclude that it has since become man-made. The District Court\u2019s statements, although not entering specific conclusions on this issue, were essentially incorrect conclusions of law to the effect that the Mitchell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>could no longer be considered natural under the SAL. The correct conclusion is that return flows which find their way to and join the flow in the Mitchell\u2019s historic channel are appropriately analyzed as freed, appropriative waters by analogy to <em>Hidden Hollow.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">\u00b680 These return flows are joined by other flows into the Mitchell, including groundwater recharge and natural springs.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> One by one, the District Court listed and then discounted these sources in its findings, pursuant to its definition of natural. For example, the court stated: \u201cWhile springs may exist in the northern reaches of the east branch of the Mitchell, it is abundantly clear that these features exist mainly, if not entirely, due to the impacts of upgradient applied irrigation water into the Mitchell catchment\u201d; and, \u201cbecause of the magnitude of irrigation water artificially imported in to the Mitchell catchment, groundwater levels along the Mitchell and in the area to the east and west of the Mitchell are artificially elevated.\u201d However, for the reasons explained above, the waters from these sources should also have been considered as natural flows.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u00b681 In its narrative order, the District Court noted that \u201cthere is a healthy, breeding fish population in the Mitchell which is some evidence of a natural water body.\u201d However, the court backed away from this initial observation, stating in its narrative order that the fish population \u201cwas not a factor to be heavily considered,\u201d and stating in the adopted findings that the presence of fish was \u201cof little assistance in determining the character of the Mitchell as a natural water body.\u201d Although we agree that the presence of fish alone does not make a water body natural, it is one fact to be considered in the determination, both of a stream\u2019s recreational capability and its naturalness. The \u201chealthy, breeding fish population\u201d found by the District Court, and the undisputed past use of the Mitchell for other recreational uses such as hunting and boating, support the Mitchell\u2019s satisfaction of these statutory requirements. Indeed, the evidence includes Chris Clancy\u2019s testimony that electrofishing surveys of the Mitchell in the early 1980s-prior to any major restoration effort \u2014 revealed an eclectic mix of rainbow, brown and a few cutthroat trout, northern pike minnows, suckers and a number of \u201credds,\u201d or trout nests. Further, there are no private pond licenses on the Mitchell. The fish are a public resource.</p>\n<p id=\"APB\">\u00b682 Of course, the primary source of water in the Mitchell, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>though it does not account for all of the flow, is the water diverted by Tucker Headgate. The District Court stated in its findings that \u201cthe undeniable fact that water is diverted away from the East Channel of the Bitterroot River in the Mitchell and is conveyed via the Mitchell for use by water users along its reach is a critical fact in determining\u201d the Mitchell\u2019s status. It is indeed a critical fact, one which most obviously demonstrates man\u2019s influence. However, it should be remembered that installation of the Tucker Headgate and the digging of the canal were completed to alter the manner in which water naturally flowed from the Bitterroot into the Mitchell. The passage of water from the Bitterroot into the Mitchell had naturally occurred prior to these alterations, perhaps from time immemorial. Man enhanced the flow with this alternative diversionary mechanism, but it cannot be said that such efforts unilaterally changed the Mitchell from natural to unnatural. Further, while it is clear that the Tucker Headgate is a man-made device providing flows into the Mitchell, it is also clear from the record that the year-round diversion at Tucker provides more water than necessary to satisfy irrigation needs during irrigation season and, year-round, provides more water than necessary to satisfy other appropriative needs, such as stock watering and fisheries. Thus, there is more \u201cgoing on\u201d here than simply a diversion of water to satisfy water rights. The \u201chuge volume of water\u201d which the District Court noted was diverted by Tucker Headgate dedicates a public resource to a multiplicity of functions discussed herein. Thus, while the Mitchell has been improved primarily by irrigators, it is much more than an irrigation ditch. If the Mitchell was simply an irrigation ditch, there would likely be little or no water flowing in it outside of irrigation season. Here, however, the Mitchell flows year-round and presents the characteristics of a stream throughout all seasons, a condition which, as the District Court acknowledged, has been enhanced by the Landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\">\u00b683  The District Court erred in its conclusions of law interpreting the SAL. Its definition of \u201cnatural\u201d was too narrow and inconsistent with the purposes of the SAL. The narrow definition incorrectly excluded from consideration of the Mitchell\u2019s status significant water flows and other natural characteristics which should have been included. Upon these errors, the court incorrectly concluded that BRPA and FWP had failed to sustain their burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Mitchell was a natural water body, and that it was not a manmade water conveyance system. When these errors of law are corrected, and upon consideration of the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>record, it is clear that the Plaintiffs met their burden of proof. This \u201cfact dependent\u201d inquiry demonstrates that the Mitchell Slough consists of surface water capable of recreation, and cannot be considered a \u201cmanmade\u201d water conveyance system. When the water is diverted from the Mitchell into manmade ditches such as the Etna, Union, and Webfoot, constructed to carry water to irrigation sites, then the manmade <em>conveyance </em>exception is applicable, and recreation thereon is not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">\u00b684  The Mitchell flows through private property. What we have previously emphasized we once again repeat: \u201cnothing herein contained in this opinion shall be construed as granting the public the right to enter upon or cross over private property to reach the State-owned waters hereby held available for recreational purposes.\u201d <em>Curran, </em>210 Mont. at 55, 682 P.2d at 172. The Landowners are entitled to every expectation of the peaceful enjoyment of their property and the exclusive use thereof, excepting only the public\u2019s right to recreate as provided by the SAL on the water and on the banks of the Mitchell \u201cup to the ordinary high-water mark.\u201d Section 23-2-301(12), MCA. \u201cThe right of the public to make recreational use of surface waters does not grant any easement or right to the public to cross private property in order to use such waters for recreational purpose.\u201d Section 23-2-302(4), MCA. Specific kinds of recreational uses which would otherwise be prohibited on the Mitchell under the provisions of the SAL are not at issue here and thus remain prohibited in accordance with the SAL\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\u00b685  In conclusion, the Mitchell Slough is subject to stream access and public recreation as provided by the SAL. We reverse the judgment and remand for entry of a judgment in favor of BRPA and FWP.</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, NELSON, MORRIS and DISTRICT JUDGE McCARTER, sitting for JUSTICE LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\"> There would seem to be little doubt that this matter would be properly classified as \u201ccontroversial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\"> The parties do not address which year\u2019s version of either the 310 Law or the SAL is applicable.

A significant portion of the groundwater in the Mitchell Slough has been attributed to return flows from other irrigation sources, although the precise amounts have not been determined. However, all of these waters, when joining a stream, are unappropriated. While we understand, as Appellees point out, that this is not an appropriative rights case, the legal status of return waters for appropriative purposes provides an apt analogy in determining the Mitchell\u2019s status. Further, similar to the District Court\u2019s, the Landowners\u2019 rationale against consideration of the appropriative status of return flows is premised, in part, on the assumption that the Mitchell is merely a drain ditch which conveys water away from the point of irrigation. As noted herein, our conclusion is that the Mitchell serves greater purposes than merely a conduit to drain the fields which are irrigated by its waters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b563-6\"> <em>The Mitchell Ditch, A Geomorphic and Hydrologic Analysis of its Historic and Current Condition, </em>January 2001, Water Consulting, Inc., p.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\"> BRPA also raises the issue of whether a review of the whole record leaves the Court with an impression that a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d by the District Court in reviewing the BCD\u2019s 310 Law determination and determining that the Mitchell Slough is not a natural, perennial-flowing stream.
