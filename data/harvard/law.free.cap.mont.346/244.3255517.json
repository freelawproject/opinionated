The court accordingly revoked the sentence and resentenced West to the Department of Corrections. West now appeals, contending that the nearly 26-month delay in bringing him before the District Court on the alleged violation constituted \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d under \u00a7 46-18-203(4), MCA, and infringed his rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b62 We conclude that revoking West\u2019s suspended sentence notwithstanding the 26-month delay in bringing him before the District Court implicates his due process rights. However, we have determined that the factual record presently before this Court is not adequate for deciding this claim on the merits. Accordingly, we set out the relevant legal principles in this Opinion and then remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u00b63 The State charged West in Cause No. BDC-01-032(c) with burglary (a felony) and criminal mischief, possession of burglary tools, and unlawful use of a computer (all misdemeanors). These offenses were committed on or about January 14, 2001. West and the State ultimately entered into a plea agreement under \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(b), MCA (1999). West pleaded guilty to burglary and criminal mischief, the State dismissed the other two charges, and the District Court accepted the plea agreement. The court then sentenced West on April 16, 2002, to the Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d) for 20 years with 15 years suspended on the burglary charge and to the Cascade County Detention Center for 6 months on the criminal-mischief charge. These sentences were to run concurrently. The court also included the proviso that \u201c[p]rior to the Defendant\u2019s release into the community, he is required to enter and successfully complete a pre-release program.\u201d Defense counsel thereafter filed a motion to withdraw as counsel, which the court granted on July 1, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">\u00b64 West was placed at the Montana State Prison (\u201cMSP\u201d) on April 24, 2002. According to his probation officer, West had a \u201cgood adjustment\u201d at MSP, progressed to lower custody levels, received satisfactory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>housing and work reports, had clear conduct, and completed treatment mandates. On November 5,2002, he was placed in the Treasure State Correctional Training Center (colloquially referred to as \u201cBoot Camp\u201d), but three weeks later, he escaped from Boot Camp on horseback. West was apprehended and returned to MSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b65 The State then charged West in the District Court for the Third Judicial District, Powell County, with felony escape (Cause No. DC-02-69). West pleaded guilty, and the court sentenced him on December 19, 2002, to two years at MSP, to run consecutively to the term of imprisonment already being served.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b66 The State next filed a petition in the Eighth Judicial District Court on April 2, 2003, seeking revocation of West\u2019s suspended sentence in Cause No. BDC-01-032(c) based on his escape from Boot Camp. The State requested that \u201ca copy of this petition be served upon the defendant\u201d and that \u201ca Warrant of Arrest be issued for the apprehension of defendant.\u201d The District Court issued a bench warrant the following day (April 3), commanding that West be arrested and brought before the court to answer the State\u2019s petition. The court also issued a separate Order for Revocation of Suspended Sentence (also dated April 3), ordering that \u201ca copy of the Petition be served upon the defendant as well as a copy of this Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b67 The record reflects that the Warrant Department of the Cascade County Sheriffs Office received the arrest warrant on April 4, 2003, but that the warrant was not executed until May 25, 2005-over two years later. The record also reflects that West was in the State\u2019s custody or under the State\u2019s supervision during this entire period.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b68 West was brought before the District Court on May 31, 2005, at which time he answered \u201cnot true\u201d to the alleged violation of his suspended sentence. The court held an evidentiary hearing on June 14, 2005, at which time the court took judicial notice of the Powell County judgment in Cause No. DC-02-69 and found that West had committed the alleged violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u00b69 The court and the parties then proceeded with disposition. The prosecutor recommended that the court revoke the 15-year suspended portion of West\u2019s original 20-year sentence and impose in its place a sentence of 15 years with 10 suspended. (Under this recommendation, West\u2019s original sentence of 20 years with 15 suspended would effectively be converted into a sentence of 20 years with 10 suspended.) In response, defense counsel argued that the court should reimpose the original sentence, since West had already been penalized for the escape by virtue of the 2-year consecutive sentence imposed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Third Judicial District Court. In addition, counsel observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">Your Honor, I would also like the Court to take into consideration this case, for reasons unbeknownst to myself or [the prosecutor], I don\u2019t know why this case is languished, but the Court noticed earlier his report of violation is March 21st 2003, over two years ago, Your Honor. I don\u2019t know why this could not have been taken care of two years ago. Mr. West has been incarcerated or under the State\u2019s umbrella all that time. This could have been handled a couple years ago but I don\u2019t have any explanation to offer to the Court why it has not been-why that has not happened, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">It seems like this case is languished and now, even though he\u2019s already been given a consecutive term for his escape, I think that is a sufficient reason for the Court to, in effect, reinstate the same sentence that Mr. West had before for the underlying charge, Your Honor, and I ask the Court to take those factors into consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b610 Notwithstanding, the District Court adopted the State\u2019s recommendation. The court revoked the 15-year suspended portion of West\u2019s original sentence and resentenced him to DOC for 15 years with 10 years suspended. West now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u00b611 West articulates four issues in his opening brief, which boil down to two basic questions: first, did the delay in executing the arrest warrant and bringing him before the District Court to answer the State\u2019s petition for revocation constitute \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d under \u00a7 46-18-203(4), MCA, or infringe his constitutional rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution (West\u2019s \u201cdelay claim\u201d); and second, is the new sentence imposed by the District Court following the revocation of his 15-year suspended sentence illegal (West\u2019s \u201csentencing claim\u201d)? We need not reach the second question until the first question has been resolved. Thus, because we are remanding this case for further proceedings on West\u2019s delay claim, we do not consider his sentencing claim (Issue IV in his opening brief) in this Opinion. We expect that this case will come back before this Court following the proceedings in the District Court, and we will address West\u2019s sentencing claim at that time, if it is necessary to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">\u00b612 The State contends that West\u2019s delay claim is procedurally barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>because he did not properly preserve the issue in the District Court. West argues, however, that we should address this claim pursuant to our common-law doctrine of plain error review. Accordingly, we will address the following two questions in this Opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">1. Is West\u2019s delay claim procedurally barred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">2. Did the 26-month delay in executing the arrest warrant and bringing West before the District Court to answer the State\u2019s petition for revocation constitute \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d under \u00a7 46-18-203(4), MCA, or infringe his constitutional rights to due process?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u00b613 This Court\u2019s review of questions regarding constitutional law is plenary. <em>State v. LaFreniere, </em>2008 MT 99, \u00b6 7, 342 Mont. 309, \u00b6 7, 180 P.3d 1161, \u00b6 7. Likewise, the interpretation and construction of a statute is a matter of law; thus, we review de novo whether the district court interpreted and applied the statute correctly. <em>See State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 196, \u00b6 10, 179 P.3d 534, \u00b6 10; <em>State v. Clark, </em>2006 MT 313, \u00b6 7, 335 Mont. 39, \u00b6 7, 149 P.3d 551, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u00b614 <em>Issue 1. Is West\u2019s delay claim procedurally barred?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">\u00b615 As a preliminary matter, we must consider the State\u2019s argument that West\u2019s claim concerning the delay in bringing him before the District Court is procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">\u00b616 As a general rule, a party may raise on direct appeal only those issues and claims that were properly preserved. <em>See State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 76, 342 Mont. 1, \u00b6 76, 180 P.3d 1102, \u00b6 76; <em>State v. Spotted Blanket, </em>1998 MT 59, \u00b6 13, 288 Mont. 126, \u00b6 13, 955 P.2d 1347, \u00b6 13. To properly preserve an issue or claim for appeal, it is necessary that the issue or claim be timely raised in the first instance in the trial court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA; <em>State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6 117, 331 Mont. 517, \u00b6 117, 134 P.3d 53, \u00b6 117; <em>State v. Paoni, </em>2006 MT 26, \u00b6 16, 331 Mont. 86, \u00b6 16, 128 P.3d 1040, \u00b6 16; <em>In re T.E., </em>2002 MT 195, \u00b6 20, 311 Mont. 148, \u00b6 20, 54 P.3d 38, \u00b6 20. We explained in <em>Day v. Payne, </em>280 Mont. 273, 929 P.2d 864 (1996)-and the notion has been carried forward in numerous cases-that an issue must be raised first in the trial court because \u201c \u2018it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u2019 \u201d <em>Day, </em>280 Mont. at 276-77, 929 P.2d at 866 (quoting 5 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Appellate Review </em>\u00a7 690 (1995)). This mantra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>however, which the <em>Day </em>court adopted from secondary authority, does not accurately encapsulate the principal purpose of the timely-objection rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b617 Above all else, the rationale underlying the timely-objection rule is judicial economy and \u201cbringing alleged errors to the attention of each court involved, so that actual error can be prevented or corrected at the first opportunity.\u201d <em>City of Missoula v. Asbury, </em>265 Mont. 14, 20, 873 P.2d 936, 939 (1994) (citing <em>State v. Applegate, </em>591 P.2d 371, 373 (Or. App. 1979)). As aptly summarized in <em>Applegate:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">There are many rationales for the raise-or-waive rule: that it is a necessary corollary of our adversary system in which issues are framed by the litigants and presented to a court; that fairness to all parties requires a litigant to advance his contentions at a time when there is an opportunity to respond to them factually, if his opponent chooses to; that the rule promotes efficient trial proceedings; that reversing for error not preserved permits the losing side to second-guess its tactical decisions after they do not produce the desired result; and that there is something unseemly about telling a lower court it was wrong when it never was presented with the opportunity to be right. The principal rationale, however, is judicial economy. There are two components to judicial economy: (1) if the losing side can obtain an appellate reversal because of error not objected to, the parties and public are put to the expense of retrial that could have been avoided had an objection been made; and (2) if an issue had been raised in the trial court, it could have been resolved there, and the parties and public would be spared the expense of an appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><em>Applegate, </em>591 P.2d at 373; <em>accord United States v. Vontsteen, </em>950 F.2d 1086, 1089-90 (5th Cir. 1992); <em>Commonwealth v. Bly, </em>830 N.E.2d 1048, 1057 (Mass. <em>2005);Napier v. Jacobs, </em>414 N.W.2d 862, 864 (Mich. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"Ayq\">\u00b618 In the case at hand, West contends that he adequately raised his delay claim in the District Court. He cites defense counsel\u2019s observations during the disposition hearing that this case had \u201clanguished\u201d in the system for two years even though West was \u201cincarcerated or under the State\u2019s umbrella\u201d that entire time. We agree with the State, however, that when read in context, these observations were-as defense counsel put it at the time-\u201cfactors\u201d for the court to take into consideration when determining the proper sentence to impose. Counsel was in essence arguing for leniency; he did not in any way challenge the propriety of the proceedings themselves, move to dismiss the petition for revocation, or otherwise suggest that the delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>in bringing West before the court constituted a statutory or due process violation. Accordingly, we conclude that this issue was not properly preserved in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b619 While the timely-objection rule, as discussed above, serves a number of important purposes, it nonetheless is subject to a few narrow exceptions. The Legislature, for instance, has authorized review of a belatedly raised claim if \u201cthe right asserted in the claim did not exist at the time of the trial and has been determined to be retroactive in its application\u201d; if \u201cthe prosecutor, the judge, or a law enforcement agency suppressed evidence from the convicted person or the convicted person\u2019s attorney that prevented the claim from being raised and disposed of\u2019; or if \u201cmaterial and controlling facts upon which the claim is predicated were not known to the convicted person or the convicted person\u2019s attorney and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d Section 46-20-701(2), MCA. We also note that jurisdictional issues, because they concern the power and authority of a court to hear and decide the matters before it, transcend procedural considerations and may be raised at any time. <em>See State v. Reeder, </em>2004 MT 244, \u00b6 4, 323 Mont. 15, \u00b6 4, 97 P.3d 1104, \u00b6 4; <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 334 Mont. 489, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 148 P.3d 643, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32; <em>Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, \u00b6 20, 344 Mont. 300, \u00b6 20, 187 P.3d 654, \u00b6 20. Likewise, this Court may review any sentence imposed in a criminal case, whether objected to or not, if the defendant raises a plausible allegation that the sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates. <em>See State v. Southwick, </em>2007 MT 257, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, 339 Mont. 281, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, 169 P.3d 698, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23; <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 18, 335 Mont. 344, \u00b6 18, 151 P.3d 892, \u00b6 18; <em>State v. Garrymore, </em>2006 MT 245, \u00b6\u00b6 10-15, 334 Mont. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 10-15, 145 P.3d 946, \u00b6\u00b6 10-15; <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979). None of these exceptions applies to West\u2019s delay claim.</p>\n<p id=\"ASu\">\u00b620 West thus relies on another exception to the timely-objection rule: this Court\u2019s inherent power of plain error review. <em>See State v. Finley (\u201cFinley I\"), </em>276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215 (1996), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, \u00b6 21, 19 P.3d 817, \u00b6 21. West contends that we should invoke this doctrine to review his delay claim. For ease of analysis, we will consider the doctrine\u2019s applicability to his statutory and constitutional theories in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>\u00b621 First, as noted above, West relies on \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA (1999),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\">(1) Upon the filing of a petition for revocation showing probable cause that the offender has violated any condition of a sentence or any condition of a deferred imposition of sentence, the judge may issue an order for a hearing on revocation. The order must require the offender to appear at a specified time and place for the hearing and be served by delivering a copy of the petition and order to the offender personally. The judge may also issue an arrest warrant directing any peace officer or a probation officer to arrest the offender and bring the offender before the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">(4) Without unnecessary delay, the offender must be brought before the judge ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">West contends that the State \u201ccaused unnecessary delay and violated Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-18-203 when it failed to serve West with the warrant for over two years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b622 We will not address this statutory-based claim under the doctrine of plain error review. As explained in <em>Finley I, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104(2) and - 701, MCA, \u201cuniquely restrict[ ] review of errors not objected to at trial.\u201d <em>See Finley I, </em>276 Mont. at 133, 915 P.2d at 212-13. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA, states that \u201c[flailure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection except as provided in 46-20-701(2).\u201d Section 46-20-701(2), MCA, in turn, enumerates specific criteria (see \u00b6 19, <em>supra) </em>under which a claim not raised in the trial court may be reviewed. None of these criteria, however, applies here; and it would be incongruous for this Court to review West\u2019s statutory-based claim notwithstanding the statutory-based prohibition on our doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u00b623 That leaves us with the question of whether West\u2019s constitutional-based delay claim is appropriate for plain error review. We explained in <em>Finley I </em>that \u201c[ajppellate courts have the inherent duty to interpret the constitution and to protect individual rights set forth in the constitution and necessarily have the correlative authority to invoke the plain error doctrine in order to carry out those duties.\u201d <em>Finley I, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>276 Mont. at 134, 915 P.2d at 213. Thus, given our \u201cinherent power and paramount obligation to interpret Montana\u2019s Constitution and to protect the various rights set forth in that document,\u201d we held that this Court may discretionarily review \u201cclaimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights,\u201d even if a timely objection was not made in the trial court, and notwithstanding the inapplicability of the criteria set forth in \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA. <em>Finley </em>I, 276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. However, we clarified that we use this doctrine \u201csparingly, on a case-by-case basis,\u201d and only where failing to review the claimed error \u201cmay result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 138, 915 P.2d at 215; <em>see also State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 331, \u00b6 20, 77 P.3d 224, \u00b6 20; <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 77, 342 Mont. 1, \u00b6 77, 180 P.3d 1102, \u00b6 77. We must consider, therefore, whether West has made a threshold showing that his constitutional-based delay claim meets any of these three criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b624 West cites a number of cases for the proposition that \u201cdue process is violated if there is an unreasonable delay between the issuance and execution of a warrant for a probation violation.\u201d <em>See e.g. Barker v. State, </em>479 N.W.2d 275, 278 (Iowa 1991) (\u201c[A] long delay between issuance and execution of an arrest warrant may be unreasonable, constituting a denial of due process.\u201d); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>719 F.2d 1402, 1405 (9th Cir. 1983) (\u201c[A] warrant for arrest based on a probation or parole violation should be executed within a reasonable time after issuance.\u201d). In <em>State v. Flemming, </em>907 P.2d 496 (Ariz. 1995), the trial court issued a warrant for Flemming\u2019s arrest on December 3,1990, but the warrant was not served until March 16, 1993, even though Flemming was in the state\u2019s custody during the intervening period. The Arizona Supreme Court concluded that this \u201cunseemly\u201d and \u201cinexplicable\u201d delay violated the time periods set forth in the applicable Rule of Criminal Procedure, which had been adopted specifically to ensure that a probationer\u2019s due process rights were not violated by undue delay in probation-revocation procedures. <em>See Flemming, </em>907 P.2d at 501-03. In <em>State v. Bennett, </em>138 P.3d 1284 (Kan. App. 2006), the Kansas Court of Appeals held that revocation of Bennett\u2019s probation violated her due process rights because the delay of more than two years between the issuance of the probation-violation warrant (February 11, 2003) and Bennett\u2019s arrest on the warrant (March 14, 2005) was unreasonable. The court hinged its analysis on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the fact that the government had failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into Bennett\u2019s whereabouts. <em>See Bennett, </em>138 P.3d at 1286-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b625 In addition to these cases cited by West, we note similar statements of the law in a number of other jurisdictions. <em>See e.g. Gaddy v. Michael, </em>519 F.2d 669, 673 (4th Cir. 1975) (\u201c[T]he warrant must be executed with reasonable dispatch and an extremely long delay between the issuance of an arrest warrant and its execution may be unreasonable and a deprivation of due process.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Strada, </em>503 F.2d 1081, 1084 (8th Cir. 1974) (\u201c[A] long delay between the issuance of an arrest warrant and its execution may be unreasonable and a deprivation of due process.\u201d); <em>Simon v. Moseley, </em>452 F.2d 306, 309 (10th Cir. 1971) (\u201cThe warrant must be executed within a reasonable time, depending on the circumstances of the particular case. Such a reasonable limitation is necessary to avoid violation of due process principles.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>State v. Langley, </em>711 So. 2d 651, 669 (La. 1998) (\u201cAn unreasonable delay in executing a parole violation warrant may violate a parolee\u2019s due process rights in some cases.\u201d); <em>State v. Kahl, </em>814 P.2d 1151, 1153 (Utah App. 1991) (\u201cDue process requires reasonable diligence on the part of the State in the issuance and execution of an arrest warrant for an alleged probation violation.\u201d); <em>see also State v. Jenkins, </em>2006 MT 85, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 332 Mont. 34, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 134 P.3d 79, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15 (Warner, J., dissenting) (concluding that due process required the city court to exercise \u201creasonable diligence\u201d in the execution of its arrest warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b626 Although our prior cases have not squarely addressed the due process issue raised by West, we recognized in <em>State v. Finley (\u201cFinley II:), </em>2003 MT 239, 317 Mont. 268, 77 P.3d 193, that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution protect the substantive and procedural rights of persons faced with a deprivation of liberty, and that revocation of a suspended or deferred sentence \u201ccan adversely implicate a probationer\u2019s liberty interests as seriously as the original determination of guilt.\u201d <em>Finley II, </em>\u00b6 29; <em>see also Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 781-82, 93 S. Ct. 1756, 1759-60 (1973) (holding that the loss of liberty associated with probation revocation is \u201ca serious deprivation\u201d requiring that the probationer be accorded due process). We further observed in <em>Finley II </em>that the foundation of the guarantee of due process is fairness, which calls for \u201csafeguards tailored to the demands of the particular legal context of probation revocation.\u201d <em>Finley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>II, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b627 These same principles underlie the reasoning of the cases cited above. <em>See e.g. Barker, </em>479 N.W.2d at 278; <em>Flemming, </em>907 P.2d at 501; <em>Bennett, </em>138 P.3d at 1287; Langley, 711 So. 2d at 669; <em>see also State v. Haines, </em>39 P.3d 95, 96 (Kan. App. 2002). We join these courts in holding that the execution of a probation-violation warrant without unreasonable delay is one of the due process protections accorded defendants in the context of probation-revocation proceedings. While this appears to be mandated by the Fourteenth Amendment, we need not decide that question because we ground our holding on adequate and independent state-law grounds-namely, the due process guarantee of Article II, Section 17, which is a \u201cseparate and enforceable constitutional right[ ] insofar as the jurisdiction of the State of Montana extends.\u201d <em>Madison v. Yunker, </em>180 Mont. 54, 60, 589 P.2d 126, 129 (1978); <em>see also State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, \u00b6 20, 290 Mont. 479, \u00b6 20, 964 P.2d 766, \u00b6 20 (\u201cIt is well-established ... that we may interpret a provision of the Montana Constitution to afford greater protection than that afforded by its federal counterpart.\u201d); <em>State v. Barron, </em>2008 MT 69, \u00b6 17, 342 Mont. 100, \u00b6 17, 179 P.3d 519, \u00b6 17 (\u201c[T]he Montana Constitution affords defendants their full panoply of rights without fail whenever the State chooses to charge an individual with a criminal offense.\u201d (citing, e.g., Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 17)); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>221 Mont. 503, 514, 719 P.2d 1248, 1255 (1986) (\u201c \u2018[N]o federal issue is properly reached when the state\u2019s law protects the claimed right.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Hans A. Linde, <em>E Pluribus-Constitutional Theory and State Courts, </em>18 Ga. L. Rev. 165, 178 (1984))), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v.

The State filed its petition on April 2, 2003, seeking revocation of West\u2019s suspended sentence and requesting that \u201ca Warrant of Arrest be issued for the apprehension of defendant.\u201d The District Court granted the State\u2019s request and issued a bench warrant the following day, commanding that West be arrested and brought before the court to answer the State\u2019s petition. The Warrant Department of the Cascade County Sheriffs Office received the arrest warrant on April 4,2003. The warrant was executed nearly 26 months later on May 25, 2005. None of these facts is disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b629 West contends that he was incarcerated and, thus, \u201cdirectly under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the State\u2019s custody\u201d during the entire 26-month period. The probation officer\u2019s Report of Violation, dated March 21, 2003, supports this assertion: \u201cSince returning to Montana State Prison from the Escape he will be placed at a higher custody level for a minimum of three years.\u201d Nevertheless, the State contends that West\u2019s assertion he was in the State\u2019s custody is \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d The State does not actually deny that West was continually incarcerated from April 2003 through May 2005, but this is the import of the State\u2019s argument-one which we find highly implausible on the record before us. In any event, it is clear that West was either incarcerated or under the State\u2019s supervision during the entire period in question, given his sentences: a commitment to DOC of 20 years with 15 years suspended imposed on April 16, 2002, in BDC-01-032(c), plus a consecutive sentence of 2 years at MSP imposed on December 19, 2002, in DC-02-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b630 In sum, the record establishes that for nearly 26 months beginning on April 4, 2003, and running through May 25, 2005, the State of Montana (1) had in its possession a warrant for West\u2019s arrest, (2) had West in its custody or under its supervision, and (3) failed to execute the warrant. This is a quintessential example of \u201cwhere failing to review the claimed error at issue ... may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Finley I, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. Hence, this is one of those rare instances in which plain error review is appropriate. We accordingly will proceed to address West\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"A3T\">\u00b631 <em>Issue 2. Did the 26-month delay in executing the arrest warrant and bringing West before the District Court to answer the State\u2019s petition for revocation infringe his constitutional rights to due process?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b632 \u201c[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 2600 (1972). Indeed, \u201c[t]he very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation.\u201d <em>Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886, 895, 81 S. Ct. 1743, 1748 (1961); <em>see also State v.

Rather, \u201c \u2018[ajsserted denial [of due process of law] is to be tested by an appraisal of the totality of facts in a given case. That which may, in one setting, constitute a denial of fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice, may, in other circumstances, and in the light of other considerations, fall short of such denial.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 850, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 1719 (1998) (quoting <em>Betts v. Brady, </em>316 U.S. 455, 462, 62 S. Ct. 1252, 1256 (1942)).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b633 Given the \u201cflexible\u201d nature of due process, we cannot say that a 26-month delay in executing a probation-violation warrant and bringing the defendant before the court amounts to a per se due process violation. The prohibition is against \u201cunreasonable\u201d delay, which contemplates a case-by-case analysis, not hard-and-fast rules. In other words, the question must be decided based on \u201c \u2018an appraisal of the totality of facts in [the] given case.\u2019 \u201d <em>County of Sacramento, </em>523 U.S. at 850, 118 S.

Langley, </em>711 So. 2d 651, 669 (La. 1998). Other factors that courts have considered relevant to the analysis include the following: the State\u2019s diligence in attempting to serve the arrest warrant; the reasons behind the State\u2019s delay in executing the warrant; the conduct of the probation violator in frustrating or impeding service of the warrant (e.g., if he absconded from the jurisdiction or concealed his identity to avoid detection); whether the probation violator\u2019s whereabouts were known or readily ascertainable; and any actual prejudice suffered by the probation violator as a result of the delay (e.g., if the delay prejudiced his ability to defend against the petition for revocation). <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>895 F.2d 208, 210-11 (5th Cir. 1990); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>941 F.2d 571, 573 (7th Cir. 1991); <em>State v.

App. Div. 2 Dept. 1979); <em>Kahl, </em>814 P.2d at 1153-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b635 We agree that all of these factors are relevant in determining whether due process was satisfied, i.e., whether the State executed the arrest warrant and brought the defendant before the court without unreasonable delay. But we do not suggest that these are the only factors which may be considered or that any one factor is dispositive. To the contrary, we emphasize that all of the surrounding circumstances must be taken into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b636 As an aside, we note that the factors identified above are reminiscent of the factors which inform the constitutional right to a speedy trial. <em>See State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6\u00b6 107-111, 338 Mont. 442, \u00b6\u00b6 107-111, 167 P.3d 815, \u00b6\u00b6 107-111; <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530-33, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2192-93 (1972). However, speedy trial precedents are not controlling here. For one thing, the right to a speedy trial is available to an accused in a \u201ccriminal prosecution[ ],\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24, and probation revocation \u201cis not a stage of a criminal prosecution,\u201d <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S. Ct. 1756, 1759-60 (1973). <em>Cf. Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 480, 92 S. Ct. at 2600 (\u201cRevocation deprives an individual, not of the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only of the conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special parole restrictions.\u201d); <em>Finley II, </em>\u00b6 29 (\u201c[S]entence revocation is a civil proceeding, thus, a probationer does not enjoy the same constitutional guarantees as a defendant facing criminal prosecution.\u201d). Moreover, the foundation of the due process right at issue here is \u201cfairness,\u201d not \u201cspeedy trial,\u201d and the safeguards applicable to probation-revocation proceedings must be \u201ctailored to the demands of [that] particular legal context.\u201d <em>Finley II, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b637 Turning now to West\u2019s claim, we first must consider the parties\u2019 contentions concerning the adequacy of the record. In West\u2019s view, the record \u201cillustrates the lack of due diligence by the State in executing the warrant.\u201d He argues that \u201cno evidence could possibly exist to defend the State against its lack of due diligence in serving the warrant,\u201d given that he \u201cwas <em>incarcerated </em>(completely under the State\u2019s custody) during the two-year period between the warrant\u2019s issuance and execution.\u201d According to West, therefore, the record is adequate to permit intelligent review of his delay claim. The State, however, is adamant that West\u2019s claim \u201cnecessitates evidentiary development,\u201d particularly with respect to \u201cwhy West\u2019s warrant was not timely enforced, whether State authorities acted with reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>dispatch under all the circumstances, whether the defendant caused the delay, or if he suffered any prejudice due to the delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b638 In essence, West suggests that a 2-year delay in executing an arrest warrant, when the named individual is in the State\u2019s custody during that entire period, is per se unreasonable. While this theory may have a certain intuitive appeal, it is contrary to the totality-of-the-circumstances approach outlined above. In this regard, the record is devoid of evidence concerning the reasons behind the State\u2019s delay in executing the arrest warrant. Although it may be difficult to fathom why the State took nearly 26 months to do so even though West was in its custody or under its supervision that entire time, the State nevertheless must be given the opportunity at an evidentiary hearing to provide a meritorious justification. Likewise, the record is devoid of evidence concerning actual prejudice suffered by West as a result of the delay. West claims that his prerelease program application to Crossroads Correctional Center was rejected in May 2005 due to the outstanding arrest warrant from Cascade County; however, unsubstantiated assertions in an appellate brief are not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b639  For these reasons, we conclude that the factual record presently before us is not adequate for deciding West\u2019s constitutional-based delay claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u00b640 In sum, West claims that the nearly 26-month delay in executing the arrest warrant and bringing him before the District Court to answer the State\u2019s petition for revocation infringed his constitutional rights to due process. Although West has made the requisite threshold showing that plain error review of this claim is appropriate, the record before us is too undeveloped to undertake a full analysis of the claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">,\u00b641 Accordingly, we remand this case to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing at which the parties may present evidence bearing on the question of whether the State\u2019s delay in executing the arrest warrant was unreasonable-including, but not limited to, the reasons behind the delay, any conduct by West that frustrated or impeded service of the warrant, and any actual prejudice suffered by West as a result of the delay. We instruct the District Court, following this hearing, to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law relevant to West\u2019s constitutional-based delay claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\u00b642 Remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b294-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, RICE and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\"> The law in effect at the time an offense is committed controls as to the possible sentence for the offense, as well as a revocation of that sentence. <em>State v.
