We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">\u00b62 The restated issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred by applying jurisprudential factors, rather than the plain language of \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, in determining reasonable and necessary attorney fees in this condemnation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">\u00b63 In July of2004, MDOT initiated a condemnation action regarding a portion of American Bank\u2019s real property. After a hearing in 2005, the District Court dismissed MDOT\u2019s complaint with prejudice and awarded American Bank all necessary expenses of litigation. It ordered American Bank to submit a request for reasonable and necessary attorney fees, expert witness fees, exhibit costs, and court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">\u00b64 American Bank did not submit a request, but filed affidavits of two of its attorneys \u201cin support of award of attorney fees and necessary expenses of litigation.\u201d Triel D. Culver\u2019s affidavit stated, among other things, that a reasonable hourly rate for his work and that of attorney Cliff Edwards was $250, and a reasonable hourly rate for work performed by attorney Lori Armstrong was $125. Edwards\u2019 affidavit stated his hourly rate was $450, but he lowered it to $250 to be consistent with what other lawyers were charging in eminent domain cases in Flathead County. Edwards attached copies of the affidavits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>local attorneys Frank B. Morrison, Jr., and Dale L. McGarvey regarding attorney fees for Wade J. Dahood\u2019s services in another Flathead County eminent domain case. Those affidavits addressed the affiants\u2019 hourly rates and Dahood\u2019s experience, skill and background.</p>\n<p id=\"AXy\">\u00b65 MDOT filed a motion to retax costs, objecting to American Bank\u2019s requested attorney fees. Relying on \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, MDOT asserted American Bank\u2019s requested hourly rates exceeded the \u201ccustomary hourly rates\u201d for an attorney\u2019s services in Flathead County, which MDOT posited were $150 or $175. In support, MDOT submitted affidavits of local attorneys Marshall Murray and Richard DeJana. American Bank opposed MDOT\u2019s motion, and submitted the affidavits of Douglas Wold and Sean Frampton-also attorneys in Flathead County-addressing the complexity of the case and Edwards\u2019 and Culver\u2019s respective experience and skill, as well as the City of Whitefish\u2019s stipulation to a $250 hourly rate in a different condemnation case. MDOT replied.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">\u00b66 The District Court held a hearing, at which DeJana and Murray testified in support of a $150 hourly rate. No other witnesses testified. The District Court subsequently entered an order stating that-absent any challenge to the number of hours at issue, the hourly rates for Armstrong\u2019s work or any costs-the sole issue in MDOT\u2019s challenge to American Bank\u2019s requested $250 hourly rate for work by Edwards and Culver was the meaning of the phrase \u201ccustomary hourly rates\u201d in \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA. Rejecting MDOT\u2019s argument that \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, sets forth a unique standard, the District Court applied jurisprudential factors and awarded fees based on hourly rates of $250 for Edwards, $200 for Culver, and $125 for Armstrong. MDOT appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute for correctness. <em>See Polasek v. Omura, </em>2006 MT 103, \u00b6 8, 332 Mont. 157, \u00b6 8, 136 P.3d 519, \u00b6 8 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err in applying jurisprudential factors, rather than the plain language of\u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, in determining reasonable and necessary attorney fees in a condemnation case?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\u00b69 In various types of cases, non-exclusive factors apply in determining the amount of \u201creasonable\u201d attorney fees. These factors include the amount and character of the legal services rendered; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>labor, time and trouble involved; the character and importance of the litigation; the amount of money or the value of the property to be affected; the professional skill and experience called for; the attorney\u2019s character and standing in the profession; and the results secured. <em>See e.g. James Talcott Constr., Inc. v.P &amp; D, </em>2006 MT 188, \u00b6 63, 333 Mont. 107, \u00b6 63, 141 P.3d 1200, \u00b6 63 (citation omitted); <em>Chase v. Bearpaw Ranch Assn., 2006 </em>MT 67, \u00b6 38, 331 Mont. 421, \u00b6 38, 133 P.3d 190, \u00b6 38 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b610 These jurisprudential factors derive from <em>Forrester &amp; MacGinniss v. B &amp; M Co., </em>29 Mont. 397, 409, 74 P. 1088, 1093 (1904), as reflected in <em>Crncevich v. Georgetown Recreation Corp., </em>168 Mont. 113, 119-20, 541 P.2d 56, 59 (1975), and <em>First Security Bank of Bozeman v. Tholkes, </em>169 Mont. 422, 429-30, 547 P.2d 1328, 1332 (1976). Several cases setting forth the factors cite to <em>Crncevich, Tholkes </em>or both. <em>See e.g. Plath v. Schonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, \u00b6 36, 314 Mont. 101, \u00b6 36, 64 P.3d 984, \u00b6 36; <em>Weinberg v. Farmers State Bank, </em>231 Mont. 10, 35, 752 P.2d 719, 735 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b611 Article II, Section 29, of the Montana Constitution and \u00a7 70-30-305(2), MCA, provide that a prevailing private property owner in condemnation litigation must be awarded \u201cnecessary expenses of litigation.\u201d \u201cNecessary expenses of litigation ... mean reasonable and necessary attorney fees, expert witness fees, exhibit costs, and court costs.\u201d Section 70-30-306(1), MCA. \u201cReasonable and necessary attorney fees are the customary hourly rates for an attorney\u2019s services in the county in which the trial is held. Reasonable and necessary attorney fees must be computed on an hourly basis and may not be computed on the basis of any contingent fee contract.\u201d Section 70-30-306(2), MCA. The 1977 Legislature enacted the precursor to \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, and the statute has been amended only once in a manner not relevant here. Sec. <em>1, Ch. 48, L. 1977; Sec. 71, </em>Ch. 125, L. 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b612 This Court cited to <em>Crncevich </em>or <em>Tholkes </em>in relation to the <em>Forrester </em>factors in two eminent domain cases decided after the 1977 enactment of \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA. Both <em>State v. Schumacher, </em>180 Mont. 329, 590 P.2d 1110 (1979), and Rauser <em>v. Toston Irrigation Dist., </em>172 Mont. 530, 565 P.2d 632 (1977), arose prior to the July 1, 1977 effective date of the 1977 statute. In <em>Rauser, </em>172 Mont. at 543-44, 565 P.2d at 640, we merely noted the 1977 statute\u2019s existence and applicability to future cases. In <em>Schumacher, </em>180 Mont. at 338-39, 590 P.2d at 1116, we did not mention the 1977 statute in our discussion of attorney fees. Accordingly, we conclude those cases have no bearing on the issue presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\u00b613 Having so concluded, we address as an issue of first impression the standard for determining \u201creasonable and necessary attorney fees\u201d in condemnation litigation pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA. MDOT argues this statutory provision for eminent domain cases is unique in that it specifically defines the basis for an attorney fee award vis-a-vis its \u201ccustomary hourly rates for an attorney\u2019s services in the county in which the trial is held\u201d language. Advancing dictionary definitions, MDOT further asserts that \u201creasonable and necessary attorney fees\u201d under \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, are based on the usual hourly rates for any attorney in the county. MDOT\u2019s argument apparently is not, however, that attorney fees in an eminent domain case must be based on one randomly-selected attorney\u2019s rates-or, in other words, a \u201cpick an attorney, any attorney\u201d approach. Nor, as mentioned above, does MDOT challenge the number of hours at issue here. MDOT\u2019s argument is that the District Court erred in interpreting \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, to require consideration of the jurisprudential Forrester factors, including the character of the litigation and the skill and reputation of the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b614  In construing a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>In re Montana License, </em>2008 MT 165, \u00b6 32, 343 Mont. 331, \u00b6 32, 184 P.3d 324, \u00b6 32 (citations omitted). We conclude the plain \u201ccustomary hourly rates\u201d language of \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, means that \u201creasonable and necessary attorney fees\u201d are to be computed in a condemnation case based on hourly rates typical or common for a non-specific attorney\u2019s services in the county in which the trial is held. Thus, we further conclude the District Court erred in applying the <em>Forrester </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b615 We acknowledge, in this regard, the District Court\u2019s extensive analysis leading to its conclusion that the <em>Forrester </em>factors apply in eminent domain cases. First, construing the \u201ccustomary hourly rates\u201d language of \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, the court determined that language was intended merely \u201cto legislate the basis for fees to be awarded (hourly) and the locale for the determination of those fees (the county in which the trial is held).\u201d We must presume the Legislature would not pass useless or meaningless legislation. <em>Mont. Shooting Sports Assn. v. Dept. of FWP, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 15, 344 Mont. 1, \u00b6 15, 185 P.3d 1003, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted). Thus, we reject the District Court\u2019s interpretation, because it would render the statutory term \u201ccustomary\u201d meaningless, and it would render the second sentence of \u00a7 70-30-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>306(2), MCA-providing that attorney fees \u201cmust be computed on an hourly basis\u201d \u2014 redundant and useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b616 Apparently in the alternative to its plain language analysis, the District Court also relied on <em>State ex rel. DOT v. Slack, </em>2001 MT 137, 305 Mont. 488, 29 P.3d 503, for the proposition that this Court has adopted a \u201cmarket rates\u201d standard for attorney fee awards in condemnation cases akin to that applied in determining \u201creasonable\u201d attorney fees in federal civil rights cases. The question before us in the portion of <em>Slack </em>referenced by the District Court, however, was whether \u00a7 70-30-306, MCA, attorney fees could be enhanced for delay between the attorney fee rate at the time the services were performed and the time the determination was made. In that context, we concluded that neither \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, nor any jurisprudence of which we were aware precluded an enhancement for delay. We also analogized to <em>Missouri v. Jenkins, </em>491 U.S. 274, 283, 109 S. Ct. 2463, 2469 (1989), in which the United States Supreme Court determined that attorney fees awarded under a federal civil rights statute were to be based on the \u201cmarket rates\u201d for services rendered, and enhancement for delay was authorized. <em>Slack, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-25. We did not address in <em>Slack </em>whether the plain language of \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, sets forth a different standard for determining attorney fees in condemnation cases from the jurisprudential <em>Forrester </em>factors applied in other types of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b617 The District Court\u2019s final relevant determination was that-given the variety of attorneys\u2019 services, hourly rates and levels of skill, experience and reputation-awarding fees based on an average hourly rate for all services by all attorneys in the county \u201cwould be illogical, unfair and, probably, impossible.\u201d We appreciate the District Court\u2019s practical concerns and do not disagree. Our function here, however, is to construe a statute in accordance with its plain language, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>In re Montana License, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b618  Section 70-30-306(2), MCA, does not mention \u201caverage\u201d rates, and we decline to insert that term into the statute. As set forth above, we construe the plain language of the phrase \u201ccustomary hourly rates\u201d in \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, to require a determination of typical or common hourly rates for a non-specific attorney\u2019s services in the county where the trial is held.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b619  We need address American Bank\u2019s arguments regarding the jurisprudential factors very briefly. Its estoppel assertions are unsupported by authority. Its contentions regarding Article II, \u00a7 29 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the Montana Constitution are not properly before us, because neither party has challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA. Finally, American Bank\u2019s characterization of MDOT\u2019s statutory interpretation argument as a \u201cbackdoor\u201d attempt to challenge findings and re-litigate facts is simply incorrect. We decline to address these arguments further. For reasons discussed above, we conclude the District Court erred by applying jurisprudential factors in determining attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\">\u00b620 We now turn to the appropriate resolution of this case. In this regard, we agree with the District Court\u2019s determinations to the effect that American Bank\u2019s prehearing affidavits and Murray\u2019s testimony were largely based on the jurisprudential <em>Forrester </em>factors-which, as discussed above, are inapplicable to a \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA, determination. We also observe MDOT\u2019s assertion, in the alternative to its statutory argument addressed above, that American Bank\u2019s prehearing affidavits are not competent evidence on which an attorney fee award could be based, in light of cases such as <em>Pumphrey v. Empire Lath and Plaster, </em>2006 MT 255, \u00b6 19, 334 Mont. 102, \u00b6 19, 144 P.3d 813, \u00b6 19. On the other hand, we note American Bank\u2019s factually accurate response that MDOT failed to raise this argument in the District Court, as well as its assertion without citation to authority that this failure constitutes waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b621 Instead of trying to fashion a remedy based on these appellate arguments and an arguably inadequate record, we conclude the best way forward is to remand to the District Court for further proceedings to determine attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA. We are confident, in this regard, that the District Court will-as it has to this point-fully address any arguments presented on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b622 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, NELSON, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b447-7\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Am\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u00b623 I respectfully dissent. I think the Court over-parses the issue before us, and deprives the district courts of the latitude needed to arrive at a \u201ccustomary hourly rate\u201d in this type of case. I would conclude that the District Court reached the correct result and therefore would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">\u00b624 As noted above at \u00b6 11, \u00a7 70-30-306, MCA, defines \u201creasonable and necessary attorney fees\u201d as \u201cthe customary hourly rates for an attorney\u2019s services in the county in which the trial is held.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>majority concludes that this language limits a district court to considering only \u201chourly rates typical or common for a non-specific attorney\u2019s services in the county in which the trial is held.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 14.1 disagree. However, assuming for the sake of argument that the <em>Forrester </em>factors should not have been considered, there was, in my judgment, sufficient evidence presented to support the court\u2019s ruling even <em>without </em>consideration of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b625 The evidence included multiple affidavits from attorneys practicing in Flathead County for many years. In fact, together with the affidavits of the two attorneys representing American Bank, affidavits of four local attorneys were presented, all of which supported a rate of $250 as fair, reasonable and customary. Additionally, the court received a stipulation by the City of Whitefish that a local attorney\u2019s hourly rate in a condemnation case was $250. Had the court simply considered this evidence alone, it was enough to support a determination that the charged fees were customary, and \u201creasonable and necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b626 However, I disagree that it was error for the District Court to consider the <em>Forrester </em>factors. The words \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d in \u00a7 70-30-306(1), MCA, are not displaced by the requirement of \u201ccustomary fees\u201d in \u00a7 70-30-306(2), MCA. A determination of \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d mandates considering the circumstances involved. The circumstances of the case before us illustrate this necessity. Notably, the District Court concluded that the affidavits supported an hourly fee of $250 for attorney Edwards after considering, among other things, Edwards\u2019 area of expertise and the length of his legal career. Conversely, relying on the same factors, the court determined that attorney Culver\u2019s length of experience did not warrant the \u201ccustomary hourly rate\u201d appropriate to a more senior attorney and therefore awarded a lesser fee for Culver\u2019s services. Without explanation, but presumably based on the same considerations, the court awarded a still lesser hourly fee to attorney Armstrong. I would conclude the court did so properly, based upon the circumstances before it. Had the court instead determined that \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d required only the consideration of the customary hourly fees in the county, it could have conceivably-based upon the affidavits presented-awarded $250 per hour for all three attorneys, regardless of their levels of experience, expertise or skill. This would not be reasonable or just.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b627 The \u201ccustomary hourly rate\u201d for a second-year Flathead County attorney in a condemnation case would be markedly lower than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u201ccustomary hourly rate\u201d for an attorney with thirty years experience practicing in the same case and county. Because this is so, a determination of what is \u201ccustomary\u201d should not be made in a vacuum. Context is needed. In our ruling today, we effectively deprive the district courts of resort to that context, and in so doing, assure an arbitrary result rather than one grounded in the realities of the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b628 For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the decision of the District Court. I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
