We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by determining W.G., a developmentally disabled woman, was competent to testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying the defense\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u00b65 The State of Montana charged Longfellow by amended information with the alternative felony charges of sexual intercourse without consent and attempted sexual intercourse without consent. The State alleged, among other things, that Longfellow digitally penetrated the vagina of W.G., a developmentally disabled woman.</p>\n<p id=\"ABW\">\u00b66 On Longfellow\u2019s motion, the District Court held a pretrial hearing regarding W.G.\u2019s competency to testify. At the hearing, the court heard testimony from W.G. and other witnesses, and admitted recordings and transcripts of W.G.\u2019s interviews with a police detective and psychologist Dr. Bruce Frumkin into evidence. The court orally ruled W.G. was competent to testify; it subsequently entered a written order denying the defense\u2019s request to disqualify her. The case proceeded to trial, and W.G. and other witnesses testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">\u00b67 The defense objected twice during the prosecution\u2019s closing arguments, and the District Court overruled both objections. Immediately after submission of the case to the jury, the defense moved for a mistrial. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">\u00b68 The jury convicted Longfellow of felony sexual intercourse without consent, and the District Court entered judgment and sentence. Longfellow appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on witness competency for abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Olson, </em>286 Mont. 364, 370, 951 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>571, 575 (1997) (citation omitted). We also review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 80, 330 Mont. 103, \u00b6 80, 126 P.3d 463, \u00b6 80 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b6 10 <em>l.Did the District Court abuse its discretion by determining W.G. was competent to </em>testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b611 Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in the Montana Rules of Evidence. M. R. Evid. 601(a). A person is disqualified to be a witness if the court finds that (1) the person is incapable of expression concerning the matter so as to be understood by the judge and jury either directly or through interpretation by one who can understand the person or (2) the person is incapable of understanding the duty to tell the truth. <em>See </em>M. R. Evid. 601(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b612 At the pretrial hearing, the District Court orally reasoned, among other things, that Longfellow had failed to establish that W.G. was incapable of expression concerning the matter so as to be understood; psychiatrist Dr. William Stratford could not state W.G. did not understand the duty to tell the truth based on Frumkin\u2019s report or otherwise; W.G.\u2019s statements \u201cdid not seem to be particularly inconsistent as to the basic allegation here\u201d; and W.G.\u2019s interview statements and hearing testimony established she understood her responsibility to tell the truth and the difference between the truth and a lie. The court also observed the proposition that inconsistencies go to witness credibility rather than competency, and stated that proposition was \u201cnot overcome ... by the consistency issues that have been raised here, her weak IQ and susceptibility to suggestion, the fact that a retarded person would have a less accurate memory are not persuasive [sic].\u201d Longfellow does not mention any of this reasoning on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b613 Acknowledging that determinations of witness credibility are within the province of the jury, Longfellow asserts that W.G.\u2019s statements were inconsistent. He argues that the consistency of a witness in reporting an event is crucial in determining his or her competency to testify, and advances <em>State v. A.D.M., </em>216 Mont. 419, 701 P.2d 999 (1985), and <em>State v. Eiler, </em>234 Mont. 38, 762 P.2d 210 (1988), in support of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b614 In <em>A.D.M., </em>the issue was whether a young girl\u2019s testimony was sufficient, without corroboration, to support the defendant\u2019s conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>of felony sexual assault. We observed that Montana law does not require corroboration of a victim\u2019s testimony in a sexual assault case. We then discussed prior cases regarding the competency of child witnesses, determined the girl\u2019s testimony was consistent with her prior reports and a psychologist\u2019s testimony, and concluded she was competent to testify. We also stated the defendant\u2019s arguments went to the weight or credibility of the testimony. A.D.M., 216 Mont. at 421, 701 P.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b615 In <em>Eiler, </em>the appellant asserted a child witness was not competent to testify and pointed to her inability to remember certain details of the alleged acts. We cited to <em>A.D.M. </em>after concluding the consistency of the child\u2019s testimony and reports, along with a doctor\u2019s supporting testimony, demonstrated her capacity to remember the occurrence and her ability to relate her impressions. <em>Eiler, </em>234 Mont. at 42-43, 762 P.2d at 213. Noting our prior holding that inconsistencies regarding perception of location do not affect the competency of a witness, we then determined that the rephrasing of questions regarding a timeframe alleviated the child\u2019s difficulties in answering. <em>Eiler, </em>234 Mont. at 43, 762 P.2d at 213-14 (citing <em>State v. Phelps, </em>215 Mont. 217, 226, 696 P.2d 447, 453 (1985)). We also stated that inconsistencies go to credibility, a matter decided by the jury. <em>Eiler, </em>234 Mont. at 43, 762 P.2d at 214 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b616 Longfellow asserts W.G. was \u201cfar less consistent\u201d than the witnesses in <em>A.D.M. </em>and <em>Eiler, </em>although his discussion of those cases\u2019 facts consists of rather scant assertions that the reports and testimony of the witness in each case were consistent and supported by another witness. He also sets forth a number of W.G.\u2019s asserted inconsistencies in the \u201cstatement of facts and case\u201d portion of his brief, but presents no developed argument that those inconsistencies-as opposed to the inability of the witness to recall details in Eiler-render a witness incompetent to testify. Nor, as mentioned above, does he address the District Court\u2019s determination that W.G.\u2019s statements were not particularly inconsistent with respect to the \u201cbasic allegation.\u201d We agree with Longfellow that W.G.\u2019s statements were not altogether consistent. We reject, however, Longfellow\u2019s assertion that these inconsistencies bear on an evidentiary question regarding W.G.\u2019s competency to testify rather than a jury question regarding her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b617 Next, Longfellow advances <em>Olson, </em>286 Mont. at 370, 951 P.2d at 575, and that case\u2019s citation to <em>Eiler, </em>in positing that, to be competent, a witness must understand the duty to tell the truth. In the \u201cstatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>of facts and case\u201d portion of his brief, Longfellow sets forth some of W.G.\u2019s responses to questions regarding the truth and lies. In his argument, Longfellow points to other such responses and asserts Frumkin was concerned regarding W.G.\u2019s conception of the truth because Frumkin believed W.G. was suggestible and likely to \u201cmirror\u201d statements to please others. Longfellow also asserts W.G. was \u201ccoached\u201d and sought to please the female prosecutor in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b618 The appellant bears the burden of establishing error, and must cite to legal authority to meet that burden. <em>See State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 22, 331 Mont. 471, \u00b6 22, 133 P.3d 206, \u00b6 22 (citation omitted). Absent authority or developed argument, we decline to address Longfellow\u2019s apparent assertion that Frumkin\u2019s opinions regarding suggestibility and mirroring render a witness unable to appreciate the duty to tell the truth or otherwise incompetent. We also conclude, absent argument to the contrary, that some of W.G.\u2019s hearing testimony-that lying is a \u201c[b]ad thing\u201d and her correct responses that certain statements were true and others were lies-are similar to the testimony at issue in <em>Olson </em>and <em>Eiler, </em>wherein we affirmed district courts\u2019 determinations that the witnesses understood the duty to tell the truth. <em>See Olson, </em>286 Mont. at 371, 951 P.2d at 575; <em>Eiler, </em>234 Mont. at 44-45, 762 P.2d at 214-15. Moreover, we observe again that Longfellow totally ignores the District Court\u2019s reasoning which, by its terms, addressed these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b619 We decline to address Longfellow\u2019s assertion that W.G. cried as soon as she took the stand and \u201cfell apart\u201d when questioned by defense counsel at the competency hearing, because Longfellow advances no authority suggesting these factors bear on witness competency. <em>See Hicks, </em>\u00b6 22. We also decline to consider Longfellow\u2019s arguments regarding W.G.\u2019s trial testimony in reviewing the District Court\u2019s pretrial competency determination. Finally, we do not address Longfellow\u2019s Confrontation Clause arguments, in light of our longstanding rule that we generally do not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See State v. Rahn, </em>2008 MT 201, \u00b6 22, 344 Mont. 110, \u00b6 22, 187 P.3d 622, \u00b6 22 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b620  We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining W.G. was competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b621 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying the defense\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>\u00b622 Toward the end of the State\u2019s initial closing argument, the following exchange occurred between the prosecutor, defense counsel and the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">MS. WEBER: The defendant\u2019s case is based purely on speculation and trickery. They [apparently referring to defense counsel and Frumkin] have shown very succinctly that they can trick a retarded girl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">MR. VAN DER HAGEN: Your Honor, I\u2019m objecting at this point; that\u2019s inappropriate and also that violates due process clause of the constitution and federal constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">MS. WEBER: It\u2019s argument, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">The Court: Overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">MS. WEBER: Thank you. They can trick a retarded girl. Now they have to trick you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The defense objected again during the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">MS. WEBER: Their entire defense is based upon the experts that you heard testify. You saw how vulnerable [W.G.] was on that witness stand. They tried to trick her. They tried to confuse her. They tried to take advantage of her disabilities just like the defendant did on March 3rd of 2005. And, again, the only suggestions that were made were those from Mr. van der Hagen and Dr. Frumkin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">The reason the defendant picked [W.G.] as his victim is the same reason they are claiming she can\u2019t be believed; she\u2019s retarded. You can\u2019t believe her, she\u2019s retarded. Reject that, ladies and gentlemen. Reject it outright. Don\u2019t let them get away with it. Don\u2019t allow this type of a defense to be effective in our town. Send a message to everyone out there that all the members of our community-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">MR. VAN DER HAGEN: Your Honor, I object to this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">MS. WEBER: -mentally retarded, physically handicapped or otherwise will be protected. I\u2019m confident that you will do the right thing, that you will do what\u2019s just, that you will make the only decision that fits the facts and the law. I\u2019m confident that you will find William Longfellow guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">\u00b623 Immediately after the jury was excused to deliberate, defense counsel moved for a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-16\">MR. VAN DER HAGEN: Your Honor, I move for a mistrial based on the statements of counsel\u2019s made [sic] using trickery. I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>that, that\u2019s an inappropriate comment on counsel, violates the due process clause of the Montana Constitution, the Federal Constitution. I think it\u2019s also reversible error and I think she also went over the top when she charged them to send a message to the community. I think that\u2019s grounds for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">THE COURT: Miss Weber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">MS. WEBER: Your Honor, this was all in argument. We\u2019re entitled to argue the facts that have been presented to the jury. The facts that were presented is that whatever suggestion that he want [sic] to talk about came through Mr. van der Hagen and the doctor from Florida and I was simply arguing that. I\u2019m allowed to use the wording that I think is appropriate. And I believe that trickery is absolutely appropriate under the circumstances and we have every right to charge the jury to do what is right under the law based upon the facts that they\u2019ve been given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">THE COURT: All right. Motion is denied. We\u2019re in recess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b624 In addition to the statements set forth above, Longfellow discusses other aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct, including objections posed during the defense\u2019s cross-examination of W.G. and statements during closing arguments to which defense counsel did not object. Longfellow advances no authority for the proposition that an objection may constitute prosecutorial misconduct; thus, we do not address his objection-related assertions. <em>See Hicks, </em>\u00b6 22. Moreover, while we consider an allegedly improper statement in the context of the entire closing argument, <em>State v. Roubideaux, </em>2005 MT 324, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 521, \u00b6 15, 125 P.3d 1114, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted), we generally do not address issues of prosecutorial misconduct pertaining to a prosecutor\u2019s statements not objected to at trial. <em>See State v. Racz, </em>2007 MT 244, \u00b6 36, 339 Mont. 218, \u00b6 36, 168 P.3d 685, \u00b6 36. Indeed, we have only once granted a party\u2019s request for plain error review of a prosecutorial misconduct issue, and we have no such request before us here. <em>See State v. Hayden, </em>2008 MT 274, \u00b6\u00b6 29-33, 345 Mont. 252, \u00b6\u00b6 29-33, 190 P.3d 1091, \u00b6\u00b6 29-33. Thus, we do not address as stand-alone arguments Longfellow\u2019s assertions regarding matters other than the statements during closing arguments to which the defense objected at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u00b625  Prosecutorial misconduct is determined by reference to established norms of professional conduct. To demonstrate the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion for a mistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct, the defendant must show that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct and that the prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>misconduct violated his substantial rights; this Court will not presume prejudice. <em>See State v. Duffy, </em>2000 MT 186, \u00b6 35, 300 Mont. 381, \u00b6 35, 6 P.3d 453, \u00b6 35 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b626 With respect to whether the prosecutor engaged in misconduct, Longfellow acknowledges a prosecutor may comment during closing argument on conflicts and contradictions in testimony, and may comment on the evidence and suggest reasonable inferences the jury may draw from the evidence. <em>See e.g. State v. Raugust, </em>2000 MT 146, \u00b6 43, 300 Mont. 54, \u00b6 43, 3 P.3d 115, \u00b6 43 (citation omitted). He asserts, however, that we strongly disapproved of prosecutors\u2019 characterizations of witness testimony as untruthful in <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 82, and <em>State v. Arlington, </em>265 Mont. 127, 157-58, 875 P.2d 307, 325 (1994). He also argues that the prosecutor violated Rule 3.4(e) of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, which states in part that a lawyer shall not \u201cin trial... state a personal opinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness ... or the guilt or innocence of an accused.\u201d Longfellow asserts the prosecutor played to the jurors\u2019 sympathies and advanced the justness of the cause by calling on them to \u201csend a message\u201d and stating she was confident the jurors would do what was \u201cjust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b627 The State responds that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201ctrickery\u201d remarks may properly be characterized as comments on the evidence and reasonable inferences the jury could make from the evidence. It also asserts, based on federal cases, that the \u201csend a message\u201d remark was a proper appeal to the jury to act as the conscience of the community because it was an isolated remark that was not designed to inflame the jury. In addition, the State asserts the \u201csend a message\u201d remark was consistent with the District Court\u2019s jury instruction that the jury was not to be governed by sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b628 It is not entirely clear whether Longfellow advances the \u201ccomments on untruthfulness\u201d portions of <em>Ferguson </em>and <em>Arlington </em>in relation to the prosecutor\u2019s \u201ctrickery\u201d remarks, as opposed to her other comments made without objection-which, as discussed above, we do not address. In any event, the record reflects that, in an apparent attempt to demonstrate W.G.\u2019s suggestibility, both Frumkin\u2019s pretrial interview and defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of W.G. at trial included questions positing incorrect facts, to which W.G. sometimes responded affirmatively. On this record and absent developed argument, we are not convinced that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201ctrickery\u201d remarks necessarily related to the truthfulness of any witness. With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>regard to the \u201csend a message\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d remarks, Longfellow\u2019s only relevant authority is the above-mentioned Rule 3.4(e) and, having failed to file a reply brief, he does not address the State\u2019s arguments or federal authorities to the effect that \u201csend a message\u201d comments and appeals to act as the conscience of the community are not improper. We conclude Longfellow has not established the prosecutor engaged in misconduct; thus, we need not address his assertions of prejudice. <em>See Duffy, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b629  We hold Longfellow has failed to establish an abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b630 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b330-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
