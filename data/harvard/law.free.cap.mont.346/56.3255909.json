R. Civ. P. 60(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b62 This case arises out of a dispute between Genuin e Parts Company and the Lawrences. Genuine Parts filed an action in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, in March 2006 <em>(Genuine Parts Co. v. Rascal\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., </em>Civil Action File No. 2006-CV-114231) alleging breaches of certain agreements. The Lawrences, proceeding pro se, made special appearances in the Georgia court to contest jurisdiction; however, they did not file an answer to Genuine Parts\u2019 complaint as required by Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-ll-12(a). In fact, aside from filing motions and briefs regarding the issue of jurisdiction, it appears that the Lawrences took no other action in the Georgia court. In April 2007, the Georgia court held a hearing on Genuine Parts\u2019 motion for default judgment. The Lawrences did not appear at this hearing. Thereafter, the Georgia court ruled that it had personal jurisdiction over the Lawrences, and the court entered judgment in favor of Genuine Parts. The Lawrences did not appeal from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b63 Genuine Parts then filed the Georgia judgment in the Montana Seventeenth Judicial District Court on May 14, 2007. The Lawrences responded with a motion for relief under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b). They asserted that the Georgia judgment was not conclusive under \u00a7 25-9-605(1), MCA, because (a) the Georgia court did not have personal jurisdiction over the Lawrences and (b) the Georgia court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter, including the Montana assets that were claimed as collateral by Genuine Parts. They further asserted that the Georgia judgment need not be recognized under \u00a7 25-9-605(2), MCA, because (a) the claim for relief sought by Genuine Parts in the Georgia court was \u201crepugnant\u201d to the public policy of Montana and (b) the Georgia court was a \u201cseriously inconvenient forum\u201d for the trial of the action. On these grounds, the Lawrences requested that the District Court deny full faith and credit to the Georgia judgment and refuse to recognize that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u00b64 The District Court denied the Lawrences\u2019 motion. The court observed that the Georgia judgment had been filed in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 25-9-503 and -504, MCA. The court then evaluated the Georgia court\u2019s jurisdiction analysis and determined that the record supported the essential findings made by the Georgia court. The District Court concluded that the Georgia court had given \u201cfull and fair consideration of the jurisdiction issue\u201d and that the Lawrences \u201chad the necessary minimal contacts with Georgia for application of its long-arm statute.\u201d The District Court also rejected the Lawrences\u2019 public-policy arguments and their contention that the Georgia court was a seriously inconvenient forum, and the District Court noted that the Lawrences had failed to cite any other authority for the proposition that the Georgia judgment should not be enforced in Montana. Accordingly, citing <em>Carr v. Bett, </em>1998 MT 266, \u00b6 39, 291 Mont. 326, \u00b6 39, 970 P.2d 1017, \u00b6 39, the District Court concluded that it was required to give the Georgia judgment \u201cthe <em>res judicata </em>effect it would be accorded in its own state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b65 On appeal, the Lawrences ask this Court to review the jurisdiction issue anew and reach the opposite conclusion of that reached by the Georgia court and the Montana District Court. They set forth a lengthy argument that the Georgia court\u2019s analysis is based on \u201cincorrect assumptions and unsupported \u2018facts\u2019 \u201d and is contrary to <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S. Ct. 154 (1945), and its progeny. They also contend that the forum-selection clause in the parties\u2019 contract violates due process and should not be enforced, though it appears from the Georgia court\u2019s Order and Judgment that the court grounded its decision in Georgia\u2019s long-arm statute, not the forum-selection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b66 In considering the Lawrences\u2019 contentions, we first observe that whether or not this Court agrees with the Georgia court\u2019s determinations on the jurisdiction question is beside the point. \u201c \u2018[A] judgment is entitled to full faith and credit-even as to questions of jurisdiction-when the second court\u2019s inquiry discloses that those questions have been fully and fairly litigated and finally decided in the court which rendered the original judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Underwriters Nat\u2019l Assurance Co. v. North Carolina Life &amp; Accident &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>455 U.S. 691, 706, 102 S. Ct. 1357, 1367 (1982) <em>(quoting Durfee v. Duke, </em>375 U.S. 106, 111, 84 S. Ct. 242, 245 (1963)). \u201c \u2018After a party has his day in court, with opportunity to present his evidence and his view of the law, a collateral attack upon the decision as to jurisdiction there rendered merely retries the issue previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>determined. There is no reason to expect that the second decision will be more satisfactory than the first.\u2019 \u201d <em>Underwriters, </em>455 U.S. at 706 n. 13, 102 S. Ct. at 1367 n. 13 (quoting <em>Stoll v. Gottlieb, </em>305 U.S. 165, 172, 59 S. Ct. 134, 138 (1938)). Accordingly, the Supreme Court held in <em>Underwriters </em>that the second court must initially determine whether the first court \u201cfully and fairly considered\u201d the jurisdiction question, and if the matter was \u201cfully considered and finally determined\u201d in the first court, that court\u2019s judgment is entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of the second state. <em>Underwriters, </em>455 U.S. at 706-07, 102 S. Ct. at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">\u00b67 This Court acknowledged these principles <em>in In re Child Support of Mason, </em>1998 MT 192, \u00b6 15, 290 Mont. 253, \u00b6 15, 964 P.2d 743, \u00b6 15. We then stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\">Thus, when issues of jurisdiction have been determined by one court, the doctrine of res judicata precludes a second court from considering jurisdiction so long as the first court fully and fairly considered the issue. Moreover, that judgment as to jurisdiction is entitled to full faith and credit in the second court. Such an interpretation comports with the full faith and credit policy that courts of one state must give such force and effect to a foreign judgment as the judgment would have received in its own state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axd\"><em>Mason, </em>\u00b6 16. Because the appellant in <em>Mason </em>had presented his personal jurisdiction issue to the Utah court, which in turn determined that it had personal jurisdiction over him, we stated that our scope of review was \u201climited\u201d to determining whether the Utah court had \u201cfully and fairly considered the issue.\u201d <em>Mason, </em>\u00b6 16. Likewise here, we must first determine whether the Georgia court fully and fairly considered the jurisdiction question. If the matter was \u201cfully considered and finally determined\u201d in the Georgia court, that court\u2019s judgment is entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of Montana. <em>Underwriters, </em>455 U.S. at 707, 102 S. Ct. at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b68 The Lawrences acknowledge these points but maintain that the Georgia court lacked jurisdiction over them and their assets. They reiterate their view that the Georgia court\u2019s analysis \u201cwas based on numerous inaccuracies and misunderstandings of the facts surrounding the Lawrences\u2019 minimal contacts with Georgia.\u201d The threshold question, however, is not whether the Georgia court\u2019s ruling was wrong; rather, it is whether the jurisdiction issue was fully and fairly litigated in that court. In this regard, the Lawrences do not deny that they had the opportunity to present their evidence and their view of the law to the Georgia court. Indeed, they acknowledge that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>filed motions and briefs regarding the issue of jurisdiction. If they were convinced that the Georgia court, notwithstanding their legal arguments and the evidence presented, reached the wrong conclusion, then the proper course of action was to pursue a reversal or amendment of the Georgia court\u2019s judgment in the courts of that state, not to wait until Genuine Parts sought to enforce the judgment in Montana and then initiate a collateral attack against the judgment in the courts of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">\u00b69  In sum, the Lawrences have failed to demonstrate that the Georgia court did not fully and fairly consider the jurisdiction issue. Although the District Court reached this same conclusion for slightly different reasons, this Court will uphold a district court\u2019s judgment if the court reaches the correct result, regardless of the court\u2019s reasoning. <em>Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 37, 344 Mont. 540, \u00b6 37, 189 P.3d 615, \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b610 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b96-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE, MORRIS and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
