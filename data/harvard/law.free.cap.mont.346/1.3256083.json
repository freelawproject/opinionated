Balek (Linda) and Marilyn M. Haugen (Marilyn) appeal an order issued by the District Court in the Tenth Judicial District Court, Fergus County, which denied a motion filed by Linda and Marilyn to substitute District Court Judge E. Wayne Phillips. This motion to substitute was filed after appellee Audrey A. Haugen (Audrey) filed a verified petition in the District Court before Judge Phillips seeking to have herself replaced as the trustee of the Clifford C. Haugen testamentary trusts (Haugen Trusts). Because the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Audrey\u2019s petition, we reverse its decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b62 Clifford C. Haugen (Clifford) died on May 7,1998. After his death, his estate was probated informally in the Tenth Judicial District, Fergus County in Cause No. DP 98-40. Audrey, Clifford\u2019s surviving spouse, served as the personal representative of the estate during probate, and then was appointed as trustee of the Haugen Trusts upon the closing of Clifford\u2019s estate. Linda and Marilyn are both daughters of Clifford. Under the testamentary instruments, they were named beneficiaries of the Haugen Trusts and also nominated as successor trustees in the event that Audrey was unable to serve as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">\u00b63 Linda and Marilyn claim that Clifford\u2019s estate was valued at $2,854,222.00 when it was closed on April 7, 2000. As of October 17, 2007, the aggregate value of the Haugen Trusts was $1,775,298.84. Linda and Marilyn claim that the Haugen Trusts have lost approximately $1 million due to Audrey\u2019s mismanagement and improper handling. On May 22, 2007, Linda and Marilyn made a demand on Audrey for breach of trust. Subsequently, they filed a verified petition and complaint against Audrey in the Tenth Judicial District, under Cause No. DP 07-08. In their complaint, Linda and Marilyn alleged manifold breaches of trust by Audrey, and sought to remove her as trustee and recover damages for her actions in administering the Haugen Trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">\u00b64 On October 26,2007, Audrey filed a verified petition in the Tenth Judicial District Court under the closed probate proceeding in Cause No. DP 98-40, with Judge Phillips presiding. In her verified petition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Audrey sought to have herself removed as the trustee of the Haugen Trusts, and asked the District Court to appoint a corporate trustee successor. In her petition, Audrey explicitly referenced the complaint filed by Linda and Marilyn in Cause No. DP 07-08, and addressed the allegations contained in that complaint. Linda and Marilyn claim that she filed this petition in order to quit her role as trustee before she could be removed under Linda and Marilyn\u2019s previously-filed action in Cause No. DP 07-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b65 On November 5, 2007, Linda and Marilyn filed a motion to dismiss Audrey\u2019s verified petition in Cause No. DP 98-40 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and a motion for substitution of District Court Judge Phillips. On November 9,2007, Judge Phillips denied the motion for substitution. Though he did not formally deny the motion to dismiss, Judge Phillips concluded that Audrey\u2019s verified petition was properly filed under the original probate Cause No. DP 98-40 because it dealt \u201cwith issues pertaining to both the probate of the estate and the administration of the trusts. The District Court has concurrent jurisdiction over matters pertaining to both the probate and the administration of the trusts pursuant to \u00a7 72-35-101(2)(c), MCA.\u201d Judge Phillips went on to observe that Linda and Marilyn failed to file for a substitution of judge in 1998, and thus their present motion for substitution was untimely under \u00a7 3-l-804(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b66 Linda and Marilyn now appeal this decision of the District Court. They argue, in part, that Judge Phillips was without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Audrey\u2019s verified petition due to the limited subject matter jurisdiction of district courts sitting in probate under \u00a7 72-1-202, MCA, of the Montana Probate Code. Linda and Marilyn maintain that Judge Phillips did not have jurisdiction over Audrey\u2019s petition because her petition concerned a trust proceeding and not the closed probate of Clifford\u2019s estate. We agree with Linda and Marilyn and find this issue to be dispositive. <em>See Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 31, 334 Mont. 489, \u00b6 31, 148 P.3d 643, \u00b6 31 (quotation omitted) (\u201c[Olnce a court determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it can take no further action in the case other than to dismiss it.\u201d) Thus, we state the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Audrey\u2019s verified petition?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u00b68 \u201cWhether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>whether they are correct.\u201d <em>Boe v. Ct. Adminstr. for the Mont. Jud. Branch of Personnel Plan and Policies, </em>2007 MT 7, \u00b6 5, 335 Mont. 228, \u00b6 5, 150 P.3d 927, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">\u00b69  \u201cA district court sitting in probate has only the special and limited powers conferred by statute, and has no power to hear and determine any matters other than those which come within the purview of the statute or which are implied as necessary to a complete exercise of those expressly conferred.\u201d <em>In re Graff's Estate, </em>119 Mont. 311, 316-17, 174 P.2d 216, 218 (1946) (quotation omitted). As Linda and Marilyn correctly note, \u00a7 72-1-202, MCA, provides district courts with limited subject matter jurisdiction over probate and conservatorship matters. This statute reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">Subject matter jurisdiction. (1) To the full extent permitted by the constitution, the court has jurisdiction over all subject matter relating to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">(a)estates of decedents, including construction of wills and determination of heirs and successors of decedents, and estates of protected persons[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Section 72-1-202(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">\u00b610 Conversely, \u00a7 72-35-101, MCA, of the Montana Trust Code provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">Subject matter jurisdiction. (1) The district court having jurisdiction over the trust pursuant to chapters 33 through 36 has exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings concerning the internal affairs of trusts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-11\">(2) The district court having jurisdiction over the trust pursuant to chapters 33 through 36 has concurrent jurisdiction of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-12\">(a) actions and proceedings to determine the existence of trusts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-13\">(b) actions and proceedings by or against creditors or debtors of trusts; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-14\">(c) other actions and proceedings involving trustees and third persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-15\">\u00b611 Clearly, Audrey\u2019s petition to have herself removed as trustee was a trust matter, and not a matter relating to Clifford\u2019s estate or the construction of his will, as \u00a7 72-1-202(1), MCA, requires. Although Audrey argues that the District Court\u2019s initial jurisdiction over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>probate matter provided it with concurrent subject matter jurisdiction over the subsequent administration of the Haugen Trusts, this argument is unavailing. Section 72-1-202(1), MCA, provides a district court with limited subject matter jurisdiction over the probate matters related to an estate. <em>See In re Estate of Pegg, </em>209 Mont. 71, 84, 680 P.2d 316, 322 (1984) (holding that limited grant of jurisdiction under \u00a7 72-1-202(1), MCA, did not extend to the approval of a settlement of a wrongful death action which was pursued by the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate); <em>see also In re Estate of Thomas, </em>216 Mont. 87, 89-90, 699 P.2d 1046, 1048 (1985) (holding that a district court sitting in probate did not have jurisdiction to decide title to real property).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b612 Exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over trust proceedings is conferred upon district courts pursuant to \u00a7 72-35-101, MCA. A trust proceeding brought pursuant to the Montana Trust Code is a proceeding separate and apart from the probate of an estate. Audrey has provided no authority for the proposition that a district court sitting in probate has jurisdiction over testamentary trusts which come into being after probate has ended and the decedent\u2019s estate is closed. Linda and Marilyn correctly note that probate courts once had such jurisdiction under \u00a7 72-12-101, MCA (1987); however, this statute was explicitly repealed by the Legislature in 1989 when \u00a7 72-35-101(1), MCA, was enacted. <em>See </em>1989 Mont. Laws 1877. Thus, \u00a7 72-35-101(1), MCA, and not \u00a7 72-1-202(1), MCA, confers upon district courts exclusive jurisdiction over trust proceedings pursuant to the Montana Trust Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b613 Audrey was not attempting to re-open the probate proceedings or re-litigate any probate matter when she filed her petition in DP 98-40; rather, she was seeking relief under the Trust Code. Therefore, the district court sitting in probate lacked subject matter jurisdiction to preside over her petition to have herself removed as trustee. This being so, Judge Phillips should have granted Linda and Marilyn\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and should not have even addressed the motion for substitution of judge. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 31. Accordingly, we reverse the decisions of the District Court, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b41-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
