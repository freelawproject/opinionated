Johnston and the State entered into a plea agreement on May 10, 2001, whereby Johnston agreed to plead guilty to the charge of Failure to Register as a Sex Offender, and the State agreed to dismiss the charge of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent. Johnston and the State agreed to recommend that the District Court sentence Johnston to four years in Montana State Prison, with all but 36 days suspended. Johnston and the State also agreed to recommend that the District Court place Johnston on probation for the balance of his suspended sentence. The court accepted the plea agreement and imposed Johnston\u2019s sentence pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b69 Johnston was arrested on October 13,2001, in Lake County for an alcohol-related incident. Johnston\u2019s State Probation and Parole Officer Dave Weaver (Officer Weaver) issued a \u201cWarrant to Arrest and Hold\u201d Johnston the next day, alleging that Johnston had violated two \u201cspecial conditions\u201d of his probation in light of the fact that \u201cJohnston was allegedly intoxicated in Lake County, MT,\u201d on October 13, 2001, and that Johnston had \u201crefused to submit to an alcohol breath test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHr\">\u00b610 The Ronan City Police arrested Johnston again on November 30, 2001, in Lake County for Partner/Family Member Assault and Obstructing a Police Officer. Officer Weaver issued a second \u201cWarrant to Arrest and Hold\u201d Johnston on December 1, 2001. Officer Weaver\u2019s \u201cWarrant to Arrest and Hold\u201d alleged that various charges pending against Johnston also constituted probation violations. Officer Weaver recommended a bond of $10,000. Officer Weaver then filed a Petition for Suspected Violation of Probation on December 3, 2001, and filed a \u201cReport of Violation\u201d on December 11, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b611 Weaver alleged in the \u201cReport of Violation\u201d that Johnston had committed the following probation violations: (1) Johnston had pled guilty to driving with a suspended license; (2) the police had arrested and charged Johnston on [November 30, 2001], with Partner/Family Member Assault and Obstructing a Peace Officer; (3) Johnston had tested positive for marijuana on August 6, 2001; (4) Johnston had failed to pay a $45.00 supervision fee in November 2001; (5) Johnston had submitted to a blood-alcohol test that indicated his blood-alcohol level was \u201c.018 mg%.\u201d; and (6) Johnston had refused to submit to an alcohol breathalyzer test. Officer Weaver recommended in his \u201cReport of Violation\u201d that Johnston \u201cbe returned to the District Court for a formal revocation hearing.\u201d The State filed a petition to revoke Johnston\u2019s probation that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b612 Johnston appeared in the District Court to answer to the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>probation violations on December 20, 2001. The District Court found that Johnston\u2019s admission to several of the charges was sufficient to revoke Johnston\u2019s suspended sentence for the charge of Failure to Register as a Sex Offender. The court sentenced Johnston to four years in Montana State Prison with all but 75 days suspended and credit for time served. Johnston did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b613 The State released Johnston after he had served 20 days in jail, but he was arrested several more times throughout 2002 and 2003 for various crimes and probation violations. Johnston eventually admitted at a hearing on March 10,2005, to numerous probation violations, and the District Court found these admissions sufficient to revoke Johnston\u2019s suspended sentence. The District Court sentenced Johnston on March 17, 2005, to four years in Montana State Prison. Johnston did not appeal. Johnston filed a \u201cMotion to Set Aside Revocation and Petition for Post-Conviction Relief\u2019 on January 3, 2006, alleging that the District Court\u2019s December 20, 2001, revocation violated state and federal law. The District Court denied Johnston\u2019s motion on February 9, 2006. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b614 We review <em>de novo </em>a grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case. <em>State v. Mallak, </em>2005 MT 49, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 165, \u00b6 13, 109 P.3d 209, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AO8\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">\u00b615 <em>Does \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, bar Johnston\u2019s claim that the District Court revoked his probation in violation of the procedures set forth in \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">\u00b616 The State argues for the first time on appeal that \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, bars Johnston\u2019s claim that the State failed to comply with \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA. Section 46-21-105(2), MCA, provides that \u201c[w]hen a petitioner has been afforded the opportunity for a direct appeal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction, grounds for relief that were or could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised, considered, or decided in a proceeding brought under this chapter.\u201d The State points to the fact that Johnston failed to raise the alleged violation of \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, in a direct appeal from his December 20, 2001, revocation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">\u00b617 We normally do not review an argument made for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Osborne, </em>2005 MT 264, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 95, \u00b6 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>124 P.3d 1085, \u00b6 11. The State argues, however, that it can raise the \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, procedural bar for the first time on appeal in light of the fact that this provision represents a limit on a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction that can be raised at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b618 The State relies on a line of cases beginning with <em>Pe\u00f1a v. State, </em>2004 MT 293, 323 Mont. 347, 100 P.3d 154, where we permitted the State to argue for the first time on appeal that a petition for post-conviction relief was time barred in light of \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. We held in <em>Pe\u00f1a </em>that \u201cbecause the time bar is jurisdictional, it cannot be waived by the State by failing to raise the issue in the District Court.\u201d <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 35. We have concluded recently in <em>Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, 344 Mont. 300, 187 P.3d 654, however, that the Legislature\u2019s enactment of a one-year time bar on the filing of petitions for post-conviction relief did \u201cnot circumscribe a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 23. We determined that the Montana Constitution grants the district courts subject matter jurisdiction over post-conviction relief. We overruled <em>Pe\u00f1a </em>and other cases \u201cto the extent they have held that the Legislature limited district courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction ...\u201d by codifying a statutory time bar on post-conviction relief. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"Adk\">\u00b619 Section 46-21-105(2), MCA, represents a similar statutory limitation on post-conviction relief, and, thus, \u201cdoes not circumscribe a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 23. Like the statutory time bar in <em>Davis, </em>\u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, represents merely a rigid statutory prescription governing post-conviction petitions. The Iowa Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in <em>DeVoss v. State, </em>648 N.W.2d 56 (Iowa 2002). There a statute required post-conviction relief applicants to raise all available grounds for relief in their original petitions. <em>DeVoss, </em>648 N.W.2d at 63. The court previously had interpreted the statute \u201c \u2018to impose a burden upon a post[-]conviction applicant to show sufficient reasons why any ground for relief asserted in a post[-]conviction relief petition was not previously asserted on <em>direct </em>appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>DeVoss, </em>648 N.W.2d at 63 <em>(quoting Bugley v. State, </em>596 N.W.2d 893, 896 (Iowa 1999)) (emphasis in <em>DeVoss). </em>The State raised for the first time on appeal DeVoss\u2019s failure to raise in her direct appeal a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court determined that the State\u2019s failure to raise the defect in the trial court waived the claim on appeal: \u201cBecause error preservation is based on fairness, we think <em>both </em>parties should be bound by the rule.\u201d <em>DeVoss, </em>648 N.W.2d at 63 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b620 We agree that our general rule regarding error presentation binds both parties in a post-conviction relief proceeding. We note again, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>however, that nothing in our ruling \u201cprecludes a court from raising, sua sponte...\u201d the prescription set forth in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 24. A trial court may raise the prescription set forth in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, on its own initiative, however, only after the court \u201cafford[s] the parties fair notice and an opportunity to present their positions....\u201d <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 24. The court also must \u201cdetermine whether \u2018the interests of justice would be better served\u2019 by addressing the merits or by dismissing the petition...\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting Day <em>v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 198, 210, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 1684 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b621 Section 46-21-105(2), MCA, does not limit a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 23. The State, therefore, waived the procedural bar found in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, by raising it for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b622 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that the State did not violate the procedures set forth in \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, when the State sought to revoke Johnston\u2019s probation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u00b623 Johnston points out that \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, provides that \u201c[i]f the probationer is detained and bond is set, the probation and parole officer shall file a report of violation within 10 days of the arrest of the probationer.\u201d Johnston argues that Officer Weaver violated \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, when Officer Weaver filed his \u201cReport of Violation\u201d on December 11,2001, eleven days after the police had arrested Johnston for Partner/Family Member Assault and Obstructing a Police Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"AJd\">\u00b624 The State concedes that Officer Weaver filed the \u201cReport of Violation\u201d eleven days after Johnston\u2019s initial arrest. The State points to the fact, however, that Officer Weaver filed his \u201cReport of Violation\u201d within ten days of the time that Officer Weaver had filed his \u2018Warrant to Arrest and Hold\u201d Johnston on December 1, 2001. The State asserts that the ten-day limit in \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, did not begin to run when the police arrested Johnston on November 30, 2001. The State argues that the ten-day limit in \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, began to run only when the probation officer, Officer Weaver, initiated an arrest pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\u00b625 We have acknowledged that \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, contemplates dual revocation proceedings. <em>Gonzales v. Mahoney, </em>2001 MT 259, \u00b6 11, 307 Mont. 228, \u00b6 11, 37 P.3d 653, \u00b6 11. We have explained that the manner in which the State initiates revocation proceedings will determine which of the requirements set forth in \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>will apply. <em>State v. Finley, </em>2003 MT 239, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 268, \u00b6 20, 77 P.3d 193, \u00b6 20. The State must bring a probationer arrested pursuant to a bench warrant before the court \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-1012(1) and 46-18-203, MCA. <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 20. The State must follow the requirements set forth in \u00a7 46-23-1012(2)-(5), MCA, on the other hand, when the State arrests the probationer pursuant to an arrest initiated by a probation officer under \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA. <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Gonzales, </em>\u00b6 11. Section 46-23-1012, MCA, does not address, however, the State\u2019s obligations when a probationer is arrested on grounds independent from the violation of a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b626 We must determine whether the word \u201carrest\u201d in \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, refers to any arrest initiated for any reason, or, more specifically, to an arrest initiated pursuant to the procedures outlined in \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA. Our purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain the legislative intent and give effect to the legislative will. <em>S.L.H. v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 362, \u00b6 16, 303 Mont. 364, \u00b6 16, 15 P.3d 948, \u00b6 16. We interpret a statute by looking first to the statute\u2019s plain language, and if the language is clear and unambiguous no further interpretation is required. <em>Small v. Board of Trustees, </em>2001 MT 181, \u00b6 21, 306 Mont. 199, \u00b6 21, 31 P.3d 358, \u00b6 21. We resolve ambiguous terms, however, by looking to the structure, purpose and/or legislative history of a statute to determine the intent of the Legislature. <em>S.L.H., </em>\u00b6 16; <em>State v. Knudson, </em>2007 MT 324, \u00b6 23, 340 Mont. 167, \u00b6 23, 174 P.3d 469, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b627 The plain meaning of the word \u201carrest\u201d as used in the statute is ambiguous. It could refer to the specific type of arrest a probation officer initiates pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA, or it could refer to the more general type of arrest that a police officer initiates, for example, pursuant to probable cause. We agree with the State that the structure of \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, indicates that the Legislature intended the term \u201carrest\u201d to have the more specific meaning. We note that \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, addresses only two possible ways that a probationer may be \u201carrested\u201d on grounds of an alleged probation violation: (1) the probation officer may ask the court to issue a warrant; or (2) the probation officer may arrest the probationer or may authorize a police officer to arrest the probationer. Section 46-23-1012(l)-(2), MCA. We also note that \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, provides that the probation officer may authorize a detention center to hold for up to 72 hours a probationer who was arrested pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AT2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u00b628  We note additionally that Johnston\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201carrest\u201d in \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, could lead to absurd results. Johnston\u2019s interpretation would mean that the ten-day limit found in \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, would begin to run when a probationer is arrested based upon facts that also may happen to establish a probation violation, regardless of whether the probation officer is aware of the arrest. This interpretation could lead the State unknowingly to waive its right to revoke probation if the arresting officer fails to communicate the arrest of a probationer to the probation officer in sufficient time for the probation officer to file a report. We conclude that the structure of \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, indicates that the Legislature intended to limit the term \u201carrest\u201d in subsection (4) to the specific types of arrests that subsection (2) permits a probation officer to initiate. We further conclude that the State correctly followed the procedures required under \u00a7 46-23-1012(4), MCA, when it filed its \u201cReport of Violation\u201d within ten days of Officer Weaver issuing a \u2018Warrant to Arrest and Hold\u201d Johnston.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b629 <em>Did the 21-day period of incarceration between Johnston\u2019s arrest and his probation revocation hearing deny him due process of law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ak9\">\u00b630 Johnston argues that the State violated his due process rights, as guaranteed by the Untied States Constitution, by holding him in custody for 21 days with no preliminary hearing to establish probable cause for his alleged probation violations. Johnston acknowledges that no statutory authority exists for requiring the State to provide a preliminary probable cause hearing. <em>State v. Goebel and Giddings, </em>2001 MT 155, \u00b6 3, 306 Mont. 83, \u00b6 3, 31 P.3d 340, \u00b6 3, <em>abrogated in part on other grounds, Gundrum v. Mahoney, </em>2001 MT 246, \u00b6 12, 307 Mont. 96, \u00b6 12, 36 P.3d 890, \u00b6 12; <em>see also Finley, </em>\u00b6 20 (explaining which statutory requirements apply to revocation proceedings); <em>Gonzales, </em>\u00b6 11 (same). Johnston asserts that case law establishes that the due process requirement of the United States Constitution requires the State to provide a preliminary probable cause hearing. Johnston relies solely on <em>County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, </em>500 U.S. 44, 111 S. Ct. 1661 (1991), where the United States Supreme Court held that persons subjected to warrantless arrests normally must be provided a judicial determination of probable cause within 48 hours of the warrantless arrest. Johnston argues that the State\u2019s failure to provide a preliminary hearing on probable cause within 48 hours of his arrest rendered his revocation proceeding presumptively unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u00b631 Johnston misplaces reliance on <em>County of Riverside, </em>however, as that case involved a criminal prosecution rather than a probation revocation proceeding. Johnston fails to note that probationers already have been \u201ctried and convicted\u201d for the offense underlying their probation, and, thus, they are entitled to \u201cless than the full panoply of due process rights accorded a defendant at a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Carchman v. Nash, </em>473 U.S. 716, 725-26, 105 S. Ct. 3401, 3406 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b632 This Court previously has considered the question of whether due process requires a preliminary hearing for a probation revocation hearing. <em>State v. Swan, </em>220 Mont. 162, 713 P.2d 1003 (1986). We noted in <em>Swan </em>that the Supreme Court has held in <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S. Ct. 2593 (1972), and <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 93 S. Ct. 1756 (1973), that due process entitles a defendant to a preliminary hearing on probable cause in addition to a final hearing. <em>Swan, </em>220 Mont. at 165, 713 P.2d at 1006. We determined, however, that the reasons underlying the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Morrissey </em>and <em>Gagnon </em>regarding preliminary hearings were absent under Montana\u2019s probation revocation scheme at \u00a7 46-23-1012 and \u00a7 46-23-1013, MCA (1983). <em>Swan, </em>220 Mont. at 166, 713 P.3d at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b633 Unlike the procedures at issue in <em>Morrissey </em>and <em>Gagnon, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-23-1012 and 46-23-1013, MCA (1983), provided the following due process protections: (1) \u201c[t]he revocation hearing is held promptly, before a defendant is returned to prison;\u201d (2) \u201c[t]he defendant receives notice of the hearing and of the alleged violations;\u201d (3) and \u201cthe hearing is held before a judge, rather than an administrative body, providing additional protection for the defendant.\u201d <em>Swan, </em>220 Mont. at 166, 713 Mont. at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b634 We deemed sufficient the 1983 version of \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, in <em>Swan </em>and concluded that the State did not need to provide a preliminary probable cause hearing in order to satisfy Swan\u2019s constitutional right to due process. <em>Swan, </em>220 Mont. at 167, 713 P.2d at 1006-07. The Legislature amended \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, in 1999, however, to provide a probationer facing a possible revocation with a right to a probable cause hearing under limited circumstances. Laws of Montana, 1999, Ch. 505, \u00a7 3. We acknowledged the limited statutory requirement of a probable cause hearing in <em>State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 73, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22, 305 Mont. 53, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22, 31 P.3d 335, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22. The Legislature amended \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, again in 2001 and eliminated the probable cause hearing requirement from the statute. Laws of Montana, 2001, Ch. 493, \u00a7 5. We noted the absence of a statutorily required preliminary probable cause hearing in <em>Goebel and Giddings. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number><em>Goebel and Giddings, </em>\u00b6 3. We did not revisit in these cases, however, the need for a probable cause hearing under the due process clauses of the Montana and United States constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao1\">\u00b635  The current version of \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, provides due process protections to a probationer similar to those contained in the 1983 probation revocation process that we deemed constitutionally adequate in <em>Swan. </em>The probation officer must file a \u201creport of violation\u201d within ten days of when the probationer is arrested pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA. Section 46-23-1012(4), MCA. The State must bring the probationer before a judge for a hearing on the charges \u201c[wjithout unnecessary delay,\u201d after a \u201creport of violation\u201d is filed. Sections 46-23-1012(5), 46-18-203(4), MCA. The State must notify the probationer at the hearing of the alleged probation violations. Section 46-18-203(4)(a), MCA. Section 46-23-1012, MCA, provides adequate due process to an alleged probation violator. The District Court correctly dismissed Johnston\u2019s due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b636 <em>Did the District Court subject Johnston to double jeopardy when it revoked Johnston\u2019s suspended sentence for alleged probation violations for which he previously had been arrested?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b637 Johnston argues that he was \u201cpunished twice\u201d for probation violations in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution. Johnston points to the fact that he was held in jail in October 2001, for probation violations that the State used against him again in the December 20, 2001, revocation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\u00b638 We recently have determined that a probation officer cannot pursue a revocation proceeding for a probation violation if the officer already has subjected the probationer to sanctions for that violation. <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2008 MT 233, 344 Mont. 394, 188 P.3d 1034. Martinez\u2019s probation officer initiated a revocation hearing by filing a report of violation that alleged that Martinez had committed multiple violations of his conditions of probation. <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 11. Martinez sought to prohibit the District Court from considering those violations for which the probation officer already had subjected Martinez to intervention hearings under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3)(b), MCA. <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 11. We confirmed in <em>Martinez </em>that a probation officer acting under \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, cannot pursue a revocation hearing for conduct if the officer already has subjected the probationer to an intervention hearing for the same conduct. <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 18. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u00b639 Authorities arrested Johnston in October 2001. Johnston\u2019s probation officer, Officer Weaver, filed a \u2018Warrant to Arrest and Hold\u201d Johnston based upon Johnston\u2019s use of alcohol and his refusal to submit to an alcohol breath test in violation of his conditions of probation. Officer Weaver filed with the District Court a petition entitled \u201cSuspected Violation of Probation\u201d that asked the court to \u201cset bond on [Johnston] pending further action by the Probation Department.\u201d The court set Johnston\u2019s bond at $5,000. Johnston posted bond and was released after spending five days in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b640 Authorities arrested Johnston again on November 30, 2001. Officer Weaver filed another Warrant to Arrest and Hold\u201d based upon Johnston\u2019s arrest for partner or family member assault and for obstructing a peace officer. Officer Weaver recommended, and the court agreed, to set Johnston\u2019s bond at $10,000 pursuant to a second petition of a \u201cSuspected Violation of Probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b641 Officer Weaver ultimately filed a \u201cReport of Violation\u201d and a \u201cPetition to Revoke\u201d as a result of the November 30,2001, arrest. The petition to revoke alleged six violations as grounds for revocation of Johnston\u2019s probation. The District Court revoked Johnston\u2019s probation on the basis that Johnston had \u201cadmitted several of the violations The record does not reveal the specific conduct that Johnston had admitted as violations of his conditions of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayn\">\u00b642  The District Court could not revoke Johnston\u2019s sentence for conduct for which the court already had set bond pursuant to the two petitions of \u201cSuspected Violation of Probation\u201d without subjecting Johnston to double jeopardy under our decision in <em>Martinez. Martinez, </em>\u00b6 18. Officer Weaver\u2019s petition to revoke included one alleged violation, however, that Officer Weaver did not include in either of the petitions of suspected violation for which the court had set bond: Johnston\u2019s conviction for driving with a suspended or revoked license. This conviction constituted a violation of a condition of Johnston\u2019s probation and provided the District Court with a sufficient basis for revoking his probation. <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 20. Our holding in <em>Martinez </em>does not preclude the State from pursuing a revocation when a probationer receives an original sentence for conduct that also constituted a probation violation, but the probationer did not suffer a \u201cprobation\u201d sanction as outlined in <em>Martinez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aln\">\u00b643  We have recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to a revocation of probation because a revocation proceeding does not constitute a \u201c \u2018criminal adjudication, does not require proof of a criminal offense, [and] does not impose punishment for any new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>offense ....\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Oppelt, </em>184 Mont. 48, 53-54, 601 P.2d 394, 398 (1979) (quoting <em>State v. Eckley, </em>579 P.2d 291, 293 (Or. App. 1978)). Oppelt faced the revocation of a suspended sentence that he had received in 1975 based upon conduct that had resulted in convictions in 1977. <em>Oppelt, </em>184 Mont. at 49-50, 601 P.2d at 395-96. We noted in <em>Oppelt </em>that a revocation proceeding constitutes merely \u201can act in the performance of the duty of judicial supervision of probationary liberty ...\u201d and determined that the Double Jeopardy Clause did not apply. <em>Oppelt, </em>184 Mont. at 53-54, 601 P.2d at 398 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b644 Johnston\u2019s conviction for driving with a suspended or revoked license did not result in an intervention hearing or in the court setting bond pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA. <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 18. The fact that Johnston pled guilty to the offense does not implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause with regard to the State\u2019s petition for revocation. <em>Oppelt, </em>184 Mont. at 53-54, 601 P.2d at 398. We conclude that the District Court did not subject Johnston to double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u00b645 Was <em>Johnston denied effective assistance of counsel in his revocation proceedings?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AkE\">\u00b646  Johnston claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Johnston rests his ineffective assistance of counsel allegation wholly on the following assertion: \u201cHere, it is apparent from the record and the proceedings that Johnston had substantial issues to raise before the Court. None of the issues were raised.\u201d We find no evidence in the record, or in Johnston\u2019s arguments on appeal, however, that the result of the December 20, 2001, revocation proceeding would have been different had the issues raised in this appeal been raised in the revocation proceeding. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6 11, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 11. We conclude that the District Court properly dismissed Johnston\u2019s Motion to Set Aside Revocation and Petition for Post-conviction Relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u00b647 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b140-9\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"AB\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"A1T\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">\u00b648 I concur in Issues One, Two, Four and Five. I also concur in the result of Issue Three, but I do so on a narrower basis than does the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">\u00b649 We begin \u00b6 30 with the statement of Johnston\u2019s claim-specifically, that the State violated his constitutional right to due process by holding him in custody for 21 days with no preliminary hearing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>establish probable cause for his alleged probation violations. We then proceed in the subsequent paragraphs to explain that \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, provides probationers with due process protections. However, the Court\u2019s Opinion does not explain why the 21-day delay in Johnston\u2019s case does not constitute \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d under \u00a7 46-18-203(4), MCA, or a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b650 It appears to me that the Court is treating Johnston\u2019s due process claim as a <em>facial </em>challenge to \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-1012(5) and 46-18-203(4), MCA, and is then reaffirming our holding in <em>State v. Swan, </em>220 Mont. 162, 713 P.2d 1003 (1986), Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 32-35, when in reality, Johnston\u2019s claim is an <em>as-applied, </em>challenge. I would explain that \u00a7 46-23-1012, MCA, provides adequate due process protections, as the Opinion states in \u00b6 35, and <em>also </em>that the 21-day delay challenged by Johnston does not fall outside the \u201c[w]ithout unnecessary delay\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46-18-203(4), MCA, on the facts of this case. This approach recognizes that there may be a fact scenario wherein this amount or nature of delay would be \u201cunnecessary,\u201d \u00a7 46-18-203(4), MCA, or would violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b651 On that basis I concur with Issue Three.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b141-6\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AFv\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u00b652 I dissent from the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue One and would not reach Issues Two-Five.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\u00b653 The Court states that the State argues for the first time on appeal that Johnston\u2019s claim is barred by \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, and reasons that the State has therefore \u201cwaived\u201d this procedural bar. Opinion, \u00b6 21. The record reflects that, in its written response to Johnson\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief, the State argued that \u201c[a]ny claims which could have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised in a petition for post-conviction relief,\u201d citing \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, but thereafter focused its argument on the time bar and the substantive merits of Johnston\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u00b654 For the reasons set forth in my dissent <em>in Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, 344 Mont. 300, 187 P.3d 654, regarding the similar issue of the time bar set forth in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, I disagree with the Court\u2019s analysis with regard to the holdings of our previous cases and the effect of the post-conviction statutes. I do not believe that the procedural bar at issue here was waived or forfeited by the State, and would conclude that Johnston\u2019s claims were barred by that provision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b141-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the foregoing dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
