We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">\u00b62 The Lohmeiers sought a declaratory judgment invalidating the DNRC\u2019s repeal of Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(39) (2005), which defined the term municipal use as used in the Montana Water Rights Act. The Lohmeiers claimed the repeal was invalid because the repeal essentially broadened the municipal use exception contained in \u00a7 85~2-343(2)(c), MCA (2005), thereby allowing the DNRC to consider and approve more permits and a wider variety of applicants in the upper Missouri River basin than before the regulation\u2019s repeal. The Lohmeiers further asserted that the DNRC\u2019s likely approval of more applications had the potential to harm their senior appropriated water rights on the Gallatin River, a tributary of the upper Missouri. The District Court agreed, granting summary judgment for the Lohmeiers and reinstating the regulation defining \u201cmunicipal use\u201d as \u201cwater appropriated by and provided for those in and around a municipality or unincorporated town.\u201d Admin. R.

R. M. 36.12.101(39) (2005), defining \u201cmunicipal use,\u201d invalid under \u00a7 2-4-506, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b64 After the passage of the Montana Water Use Act in 1973 and the DNRC\u2019s subsequent determination of claims, \u201c[i]t became clear... that there were significantly more adjudicated and legitimate non-adjudicated claims to water than there was available water\u201d in the upper Missouri River basin. <em>Montana Trout Unlimited v. Montana DNRC, </em>2006 MT 72, \u00b6 7, 331 Mont. 483, \u00b6 7, 133 P.3d 224, \u00b6 7. The upper Missouri River basin closure law (basin closure law), \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-342 and -343, MCA (2005), enacted in 1993 in response to this over-appropriation of water, placed a moratorium on new applications for water rights in the Missouri River basin upstream from the Morony Dam near Great Falls. The Gallatin River is a tributary of the upper Missouri River and subject to the basin closure law.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b65 The 2003 Legislature amended \u00a7 85-2-302(2), MCA, to require the DNRC to \u201cadopt rules that are necessary to determine whether or not an application is correct and complete, based on the provisions applicable to issuance of a permit under this part. The rules must be adopted in compliance with Title 2, chapter 4.\u201d 2003 Mont. Laws, ch. 574, \u00a7 1. The DNRC ultimately promulgated many new rules addressing the permit application process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among these rules was a regulation defining \u201cmunicipal use,\u201d a term used at least thirteen times in the text of and annotations to the 2003 Montana Water Use Act, but undefined by statute. The new regulation defined municipal use as \u201cwater appropriated by and provided for those in and around a municipality or an unincorporated town.\u201d Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(39) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u00b66 Problems arose when the new regulation, Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(39) (2005), was applied in conjunction with \u00a7 85-2-343(2)(c), MCA (2005). This statute exempts from basin closure limitations any application for a permit to appropriate water for \u201cmunicipal use.\u201d Under the administrative rule\u2019s new definition of \u201cmunicipal use,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>arguably only a municipality or unincorporated town could qualify as an acceptable appropriator, whereas previously it was only necessary that the water be appropriated <em>for </em>those in a municipality or unincorporated town. Therefore, private entities, such as private utility companies who sought to appropriate water for public or municipal purposes and who were previously allowed to do so, could no longer qualify for closed basin water rights under the municipal use exception under this definition. Moreover, this definition was not limited to the basin closure law. It applied to all references to municipal use throughout the Montana Water Use Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b67 One year after the DNRC promulgated the regulation defining \u201cmunicipal use,\u201d the DNRC sought to repeal it, asserting that the definition was not in keeping with the historical interpretation of the term by the Montana Water Court and the DNRC. The DNRC asserted that, between the years 1973 and 2005 before Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(39) (2005) went into effect, the DNRC had permitted many appropriations for municipal use by private entities and utility companies, such as the Mountain Water Company in Missoula. The DNRC argued that this new definition was not in keeping with the historical application of municipal use and unfairly resulted in denying appropriators municipal use applications based on their status as or affiliation with a private entity. Among others, US, the utility and development company based in the Four Corners area outside Bozeman, submitted several comments to the DNRC both before and after the promulgation of the municipal use definition, arguing against the new definition because it effectively excluded private entities seeking municipal use permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b68 The DNRC followed the necessary protocol and procedural steps to repeal the rule, offering a comment period and public notice. Following repeal, the Lohmeiers brought a declaratory judgment action, requesting the District Court to declare the DNRC\u2019s repeal of Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(39) (2005) invalid, pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-506, MCA. US subsequently intervened in the case as a co-defendant with the DNRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b69 The DNRC moved for summary judgment arguing that the Lohmeiers could suffer no harm by the repeal given the other protections afforded by \u00a7 85-2-311(l)(b), MCA (2005), which provided that the permit applicant must show that its proposed use would have no negative effect on senior water rights holders in that area. The DNRC also argued that the rule was not repealed with an arbitrary and capricious disregard for the purpose of the authorizing statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Also requesting summary judgment, intervener US argued that the case was non-justiciable because there was no actual injury to the Lohmeiers. In addition, the Lohmeiers filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that \u00a7 2-4-506, MCA, and this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Montana Trout Unlimited </em>provided ample legal authority for their request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b610 The District Court held that the DNRC violated \u00a7 2-4-506, MCA, when it repealed the administrative rule defining \u201cmunicipal use.\u201d The court determined that by repealing Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(39) (2005), the DNRC rendered the term municipal use nebulous and unfairly accommodating of private developers\u2019 applications for permits. The court ruled that the basin closure law was designed to protect and preserve existing water rights holders and that the DNRC\u2019s repeal of the definition of municipal use would undermine that purpose, potentially threatening the senior water rights holders in an already over-appropriated water source. The court further concluded that the DNRC\u2019s repeal of the administrative rule contravened legislative intent and placed the existing water rights of the plaintiffs in jeopardy. The court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, declaring the DNRC\u2019s repeal of its administrative rule invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b611 Prior to the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment, US had applied for and was granted several municipal use permits. Then, the 2007 Legislature amended the basin closure laws by eliminating any mention of municipal use and devising a new method of granting closed basin water rights. 2007 Mont. Laws, ch. 391, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 9, 11. Because the 2007 law was not retroactive, the permits that the DNRC granted in 2006, after it repealed the definition of municipal use, were still effective. Additional cases have since been brought by senior water rights holders challenging the grant of these 2006 municipal use permits and arguing that the Legislature did not intend the municipal use exception to allow private entities, like US, to apply for or be granted a municipal use permit, when it enacted the basin closure law.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b612 We review a grant of summary judgment de novo under the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 standard applied by a district court. <em>Chain v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>2004 MT 216, \u00b6 8, 322 Mont. 381, \u00b6 8, 96 P.3d 1135, \u00b6 8. Where a court determines that no genuine issues of material fact exist and concludes that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we review the court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>v. Union Reserve Coal Co., Inc., </em>271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Mootness and justiciability.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b613 Before we reach the main issue before this court, we must consider the threshold issue of whether this case is moot. <em>Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>1999 MT 21, \u00b6 17, 293 Mont. 188, \u00b6 17, 974 P.2d 1150, \u00b6 17. A matter is moot when, due to a change in circumstance, the legal issue presented to a court ceases to exist and no longer presents a controversy. <em>Grabow v. Montana High School Ass\u2019n, </em>2000 MT 159, \u00b6 14, 300 Mont. 227, \u00b6 14, 3 P.3d 650, \u00b6 14, citing <em>Shamrock, </em>\u00b6 19. However, when faced with a constitutional question that becomes moot due to a change in circumstance, this Court will nonetheless consider the merits of the moot issue when the issue is capable of repetition yet evades review. <em>Common Cause v. Statutory Committee, </em>263 Mont. 324, 328, 868 P.2d 604, 606 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b614 We conclude that the issue before this Court is not moot, notwithstanding the 2007 amendments to the basin closure law, because the issue continues to present a controversy due to the nature of water rights applications. The filing date of a water rights application determines both the priority of the claim and the law that applies to that claim and any challenges to the water right. Section 85-2-302(4), MCA. Although the 2007 Legislature changed the law so that a municipal use exception no longer exists for closed basin areas, the new law is not retroactive and the status of outstanding water permit applications-at least two of which are currently in litigation-depends on the outcome of this case. Therefore, we conclude this matter is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u00b615 Second, we examine whether the issue before us presents a justiciable controversy. US argues on appeal that the Lohmeiers\u2019 complaint did not present the District Court with a justiciable controversy because the administrative rule repeal did not abridge any of the Lohmeiers\u2019 rights, and any rights the plaintiffs had under Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(39) (2005) were purely theoretical. If the Lohmeiers\u2019 rights were not impaired after the basin closure but prior to the enactment of the rule, US argues their rights could not be impaired by the repeal of the rule returning them to the prior status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">\u00b616 In response, the Lohmeiers assert that this Court, in <em>Montana Trout Unlimited, </em>specifically held that the basin closure laws are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>intended to protect senior water rights holders from the injury of spending time and money to defend their water rights and assert their objections to new applicants before the DNRC, a time consuming and expensive process. By repealing the narrower municipal use definition, they argue, the DNRC has opened the floodgates of applications, thus compelling the Lohmeiers to spend the time and money to defend their water rights which this Court sought to prevent via the language in <em>Montana Trout Unlimited.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AE9\">\u00b617  We conclude that this case is justiciable, given the Lohmeiers\u2019 statutory right to bring an action under \u00a7 2-4-506, MCA. As plaintiffs who are asserting senior water rights, the Lohmeiers are entitled to bring this action but bear the burden of proving that the repeal of the rule met one of two statutory prongs under \u00a7 2-4-506, MCA, which addresses declaratory judgments on the validity or application of agency rules. They must demonstrate either that the repeal of the rule interferes with or impairs or threatens to interfere with or impair their legal rights or privileges, or that the repeal of the rule was implemented with an arbitrary or capricious disregard for the purpose of the authorizing statute as evidenced by the documented legislative intent. Section 2-4-506, MCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Did the District Court correctly conclude that the repeal was invalid?</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b618 The State, acting through the DNRC, coordinates the development and use of the water resources of the State so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources. Section 85-1-101(3), MCA. A person may only appropriate water upon applying for and receiving a permit from the DNRC. Section 85-2-302(1), MCA. The DNRC may adopt rules necessary to implement and carry out the purposes and provisions of the surface and groundwater laws to \u201cprovide for the administration, control and regulation of water rights and establish a system of centralized records ....\u201d Section 85-2-101(2), MCA. Moreover, the DNRC is authorized to adopt rules that are necessary to determine whether or not an application for water rights is correct and complete. Section 85-2-302(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b619 As noted above, the upper Missouri River basin is closed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-319,85-2-342, and -343, MCA. \u201c \u2018[B]asin closure area\u2019 means a hydrologic drainage basin area within which applications for certain water use permits cannot be accepted. Basin closure areas can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>designated by statute, administrative rule, or in compacts.\u201d Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(9) (2005). The basin closure law provides that the DNRC \u201cmay not process or grant an application for a permit to appropriate water ... within the upper Missouri River basin until the final decrees have been issued ...\u201d unless the applicant\u2019s proposed water use falls within one of the enumerated exceptions. Section 85-2-343, MCA (2005). Municipal use was one of those exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">(1) As provided in 85-2-319 and subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, the department may not process or grant an application for a permit to appropriate water or for a reservation to reserve water within the upper Missouri River basin until the final decrees have been issued in accordance with part 2 of this chapter for all of the subbasins of the upper Missouri River basin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">(2) The provisions of subsection (1) do not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">(c) an application for a permit to appropriate water for domestic, municipal, or stock use ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Section 85-2-343, MCA (2005) (emphasis added). However, the Legislature did not statutorily define \u201cmunicipal use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">\u00b620 Between 1973 when the Water Use Act was enacted and 1993 when the basin closure law for the upper Missouri was enacted, municipal use applications were typically processed one at a time with attention given to the nature of the use-if the water was to be used for a public water supply, it was municipal use. The DNRC granted many municipal use permits to non-municipalities seeking to appropriate water for public supply, such as private entities and water and sewer districts. From 1993 to 2005, the term municipal use remained largely undefined under rule or statute, with one exception. Section 85-2-227(4), MCA (2005), which addresses criteria for presumption of municipal nonabandonment, describes municipal use as \u201cuse by a city, town, or other public or private entity that operates a public water supply system.\u201d Outside of this statute, however, the question of whether a use was municipal was left to the interpretation of the DNRC under the particular facts of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">\u00b621 In its decision granting summary judgment to the Lohmeiers, the District Court identified one issue: whether the DNRC\u2019s repeal of the regulation defining municipal use is a violation of \u00a7 2-4-506, MCA. Section 2-4-506, MCA, provides that an agency rule can be held invalid if (1) it is found that the rule or its threatened application interferes with or impairs or threatens to interfere with or impair the legal rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>or privileges of the plaintiff; or (2) the rule was adopted with an arbitrary or capricious disregard for the purpose of the authorizing statute as evidenced by the documented legislative intent. The District Court concluded as a matter of law that the DNRC\u2019s repeal of Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(39) (2005) was invalid because it violated both of the foregoing subsections of \u00a7 2-4-506, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b622 The DNRC argues on appeal that the Lohmeiers failed to demonstrate either that it repealed the rule with arbitrary or capricious disregard for the purpose of the authorizing statute, or that Lohmeiers\u2019 rights and privileges were impaired by the DNRC decision to repeal and revise the definition of \u201cmunicipal use.\u201d As to the latter matter, the DNRC maintains that the Lohmeiers\u2019 rights were wholly and adequately protected under \u00a7 85-2-311(l)(b), MCA, which requires a new water right applicant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201cthe water rights of a prior appropriator under an existing water right, a certificate, a permit, or a state water reservation will not be adversely affected.\u201d The DNRC further argues that \u00a7 85-2-307(2), MCA, affords the Lohmeiers an opportunity to object to a new water right application and voice objections before the DNRC. Thus, it maintains, no water rights or privileges have been impaired or threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b623 As to the contention that the decision to repeal was made \u201cwith arbitrary and capricious disregard for the purpose of the authorizing statute,\u201d (\u00a7 2-4-506(2), MCA) the DNRC argues that the District Court erred in identifying \u201cthe authorizing statute.\u201d The court appeared to rely upon the upper Missouri River basin closure statute, \u00a7 85-2-343, MCA (2005), as the authorizing statute, in rendering its opinion. However, this statute does not \u201cauthorize\u201d or even reference rule-making; rather, it addresses the processing and granting of an application to appropriate water. The authorizing statute-the one under which the rule was promulgated-is \u00a7 85-2-302(2), MCA (2005). This statute provides the DNRC with express authority to adopt rules governing the process for approving permit applications and issuing permits for water appropriation. The DNRC argues that Lohmeiers presented no evidence to support the contention that the DNRC\u2019s actions in repealing the recently enacted rule was either arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b624 The Lohmeiers respond that having to challenge permit applications through the administrative process and judicial review process is the impairment suffered by senior water rights holders as a result of the rule repeal. They further argue that the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>correctly held that the DNRC acted with arbitrary or capricious disregard for the authorizing statute because the purpose of the basin closure laws was to protect and preserve existing water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b625 US argues that the repeal or codification of a definition is purely an administrative matter entrusted to the agency, and that the District Court erred in failing to defer to the agency\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b626 The DNRC is empowered to act in both a quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial manner. Section 85-2-112, MCA. Section 85-2-113(2), MCA, delegates authority to the DNRC to \u201cadopt rules necessary to implement and carry out the purposes\u201d of surface and groundwater regulation. Under \u00a7 85-2-302(2), MCA (2005), the DNRC controls the permit application process for new appropriations of water and determines if an applicant meets the DNRC\u2019s criteria for a water use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u00b627 An administrative agency\u2019s quasi-legislative authority may be challenged under \u00a7 2-4-506, MCA. However, where the challenger does not meet the burden of proof, deference to the agency\u2019s decision is appropriate. Additionally, \u201cdeference to agencies is most appropriate when the agency interpretation has stood unchallenged for a considerable length of time, thereby creating reliance in the public and those having an interest in the interpretation of the law.\u201d <em>Montana Trout </em>Unlimited, \u00b6 37. We conclude here that the Lohmeiers failed to demonstrate how they are injured by the agency\u2019s case-by-case interpretation of \u201cmunicipal use,\u201d which was the unchallenged modus operandi of the DNRC for years before the rule was enacted, interrupted by a period of only eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u00b628 In 1993, the upper Missouri River basin closure law was the third basin closure law to be enacted and the second that contained an exception for municipal use. However, the Legislature again declined to define the term. \u201cWhere the Legislature acquiesces in long-standing agency interpretation of a statute and takes no action to inform that interpretation, the court will presume that the Department has properly interpreted the law <em>\u2019\u2019Baitis v. Department of Revenue of State, </em>2004 MT 17, \u00b6 24, 319 Mont. 292, \u00b6 24, 83 P.3d 1278, \u00b6 24. We must conclude that when the Legislature enacted the basin closure law, it was aware of and-declining to define municipal use-acquiesced in the agency\u2019s prior interpretations of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b629 We also presume the Legislature to know the contents of the code. <em>Baitis, </em>\u00b6 24. As noted above, \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, incorporates within the concept use by private entities that operate public water supply systems. Thus, the character of the <em>use </em>rather than the character of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the <em>applicant </em>has been the defining factor in determining whether an application could be considered as one within the municipal use category; historically, therefore, private entities could qualify as municipal users as long as those entities were operating public water supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b630 Only after the DNRC adopted Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(39) (2005) was the interpretation of municipal use called into question. Eighteen months after its adoption, the regulation was repealed and the meaning of municipal use reverted to an agency interpretation, as applications were reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The regulation defining municipal use was not in effect for more than a year and a half. Eighteen months is not enough time for the agency to have instilled reliance in the public, whereas the time between the enactment of the basin closure law in 1993 and the promulgation of the new definition in 2005 is sufficient time to create reliance in the public and those having an interest in the operation of public water supply systems. <em>Montana Trout Unlimited, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b631 We agree with the DNRC that the Lohmeiers failed to demonstrate that their rights or privileges were impaired or threatened to be impaired by the repeal of the definition. The definition had not been in effect long enough for the Lohmeiers to rely on it or suffer from their reliance on it when it was repealed. Moreover, the Lohmeiers had implied notice of the historical interpretation of the term as the DNRC\u2019s public records show that private entities had previously been granted municipal use permits.</p>\n<p id=\"AkB\">\u00b632  Finally, we also agree with the DNRC that the Lohmeiers failed to show that the agency\u2019s decision to repeal Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(39) (2005) was made with arbitrary and capricious disregard for the authorizing statute as evidenced by the legislative intent. It is an agency prerogative to enact rules to aid in the permitting process, and it is also an agency prerogative to repeal rules which are not of assistance, as long as in so doing, the agency does not violate \u00a7 2-4-506, MCA.
