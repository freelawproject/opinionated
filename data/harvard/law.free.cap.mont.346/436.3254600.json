We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err (1) in determining that Libby Placer has no reversionary interest in a previously condemned mineral interest, and (2) in quieting title to Noranda?</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">\u00b64 On June 29, 1933, several individuals acquired a United States Patent by Warranty Deed issued by the Department of Interior, General Land Office, for the mining claims subject to this litigation. These claims were designated as U.S. Mineral Survey No. 10377 and were commonly known as the Comet, Hogum, and Deadwood placer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>mining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b65 In 1951, Paul K. Hennessy and Margaret H. Craik, successors-in-interest to the patented mining claim, obtained a decree quieting title to the property designated within U.S. Mineral Survey No. 10377 and declaring them to be \u201cthe owners against all the world.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b66 Hennessy and Craik thereafter transferred the real property designated within U.S. Mineral Survey No. 10377 to J. Heils Lumber Company \u201cand to its successors heirs and assigns forever,\u201d excepting and reserving from the grant \u201call minerals and ores of whatsoever nature lying within said lands, including coal, iron, gas and oil.\u201d The conveyance severed the mineral interest of the real property from the surface interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b67 Subsequently, Libby Placer acquired 75% of the mineral interest in the property through deeds from various heirs, devisees, and assigns of Hennessy and Craik. Noranda acquired 25% of the mineral interest through deed from an heir of Craik.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u00b68 On June 19, 1989, Champion International Corporation (a successor-in-interest to J. Heils Lumber Company) and Noranda executed an agreement by which Noranda was granted an option to purchase the real property at issue, less the mineral interest which previously had been severed from the surface estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\u00b69 On September 13, 1989, Noranda filed a condemnation action against Libby Placer and other interested persons seeking acquisition by condemnation of all interests, other than those Noranda presently owned or in which it held an option to acquire, in \u201ca parcel of land comprising portions of the DEADWOOD PLACER and HOGUM PLACER of Mineral Survey No. 10377,\u201d consisting of approximately 234 acres, pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-102(5), MCA (1989), for mine tailings impoundments and related facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">\u00b610 In its complaint, Noranda alleged it had the right through eminent domain to acquire the interests in fee simple; stated it sought to take and condemn the outstanding interests in fee simple; and in its prayer, sought an \u201corder and judgment condemning said real property, vesting in Noranda fee simple absolute title to said property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">\u00b611 Libby Placer was the only named defendant to defend against Noranda\u2019s condemnation claim. All other defendants either disclaimed any interest or failed to appear, answer, or otherwise defend and were defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">\u00b612 On March 22, 1991, pursuant to a stipulation between Libby Placer and Noranda, the District Court entered a Final Judgment of Condemnation \u201cfor all relief sought in Noranda\u2019s complaint, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>condemnation of all of defendants\u2019 right, title and interest in the property particularly described as ... [a] parcel of land comprising portions of the DEADWOOD PLACER and HOGUM PLACER of Mineral Survey No. 10377.\u201d The amount of $20,000 was assessed against Noranda in favor of Libby Placer as \u201cfull just compensation.\u201d \u00b613 On September 1, 1993, Champion International Corporation transferred \u201c[a]ll that land enclosed within the boundaries of U.S. Mineral Survey No. 10377, including the Comet, Hogum and Deadwood Placer Mining Claims,\u201d excepting the minerals and ores, to Noranda by warranty deed, subject to a reservation of the timber on the property. This transfer vested Noranda with all surface and mineral rights except for the timber reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b614 On April 29, 1996, Libby Placer filed a \u201cNotice of Reversionary Interest\u201d with the Lincoln County Clerk and Recorder concerning a \u201cparcel of land comprising a portion of the DEADWOOD PLACER and the HOGUM PLACER of Mineral Survey No. 10377.\u201d In its filing, Libby Placer gave notice that whereas Noranda\u2019s title to the mineral interest awarded pursuant to the March 22, 1991 Final Judgment of Condemnation was \u201can interest other than a fee simple interest,\u201d Libby Placer was registering its intent to exercise its reversionary rights (1) in the event Noranda abandons the condemned interest, or (2) in the event that the purpose for which the property interests were acquired by right of eminent domain is terminated, in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 70-30-321(3) and -322(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b615 On August 19, 2002, Noranda issued a news release in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, announcing that it had decided to abandon the Montanore<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> copper-silver project in Montana and had accordingly notified federal and state regulatory agencies. According to the news release, the Montanore project was a proposed underground copper-silver mine located near Libby that was initiated in 1989 and suspended in 1991 due to the economic unfeasibility of its development as a result of depressed metal prices expected to continue into the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\u00b616 On February 28, 2006, Libby Placer filed suit against Noranda seeking a declaratory judgment that the fractional mineral interest that Noranda acquired from it in 1991 through eminent domain had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>reverted to Libby Placer by operation of \u00a7 70-30-321(3), MCA, as a result of Noranda\u2019s abandonment of the mining operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b617 Noranda answered with a general denial and counterclaimed to quiet title to both the surface and the mineral interests of the real property as against Libby Placer and all persons claiming under Libby Placer. Additionally, Noranda denied it has abandoned the mining project or that the issue of abandonment was material to the issue before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b618 The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b619 Libby Placer argued that one cannot own a fee simple interest in a mineral interest separated from the surface estate, and, alternatively, if a mineral interest can be legally classified as a fee simple estate, a fractional interest in the minerals cannot. Libby Placer therefore asserted the District Court could not have condemned a fee simple interest in 1991 without condemning the surface interest, which the court did not do. Libby Placer pointed out, in fact, that Champion International Corporation, the owner of the surface estate at the time of condemnation, was not a party to the condemnation litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b620 Libby Placer further argued that the 1991 Final Judgment of Condemnation failed to award a fee simple interest to Noranda because under the plain language of the judgment, Noranda was granted \u201call relief sought in Noranda\u2019s complaint, including condemnation of all of defendant\u2019s right, title and interest in the [property],\u201d without specifying that such relief constituted a fee simple interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\u00b621 Finally, Libby Placer argued that if its fractional mineral interest was not contemplated by \u00a7 70-30-321(3), MCA, then no condemned mineral rights would ever revert to the original owner and subsection (3) would have been enacted without purpose.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">\u00b622 Noranda countered that in its eminent domain proceeding, it acquired title to Libby Placer\u2019s mineral interests in fee simple, and therefore \u00a7\u00a7 70-30-321(3) and -322(3), MCA, which provide for reversionary interests under limited circumstances for interests other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>than fee simple, do not apply. Noranda further noted that Libby Placer entered into a joint motion for entry of full and final judgment in Noranda\u2019s favor and against Libby Placer for the payment to Libby Placer of $20,000 and, thus, argued that Libby Placer\u2019s claim that its condemned interest was not a fee simple interest is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b623 After a hearing on the issue of whether Noranda had acquired a fee simple interest in Libby Placer\u2019s mineral interest, which would thereby render moot the issue of abandonment on which Libby Placer\u2019s claim rests, the District Court ruled in favor of Noranda. The District Court initially determined that in exchange for payment of $20,000 to Libby Placer, Noranda received everything Libby Placer had owned. The District Court further determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">What is important in the context of this motion is not what interest Libby Placer conveyed to Noranda, but what interest Noranda acquired in the property from whatever source. Even if Libby Placer\u2019s 75% ownership of the mineral estate were not legally classified as a fee simple interest (and Noranda makes a convincing argument that it is properly classified as such), when that 75% interest was consolidated with Noranda\u2019s 25% interest, and the mineral estate was later consolidated with Champion International\u2019s 100% interest in the surface estate, by 1993, there is no part of the fee that Noranda had not acquired and did not own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b624 Concluding that \u201c[i]t is not necessary for the Court to determine whether there can be separate fee simple ownerships of the mineral estate and the surface estate, as by 1993, Noranda owned 100% of both estates[,]\u201d the District Court held that because Noranda owned 100% of both estates in fee simple prior to Libby Placer\u2019s filing of its Notice of Reversionary Interest, Libby Placer had no reversionary interest in the property regardless of whether Noranda abandoned the mining project.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u00b625 We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the standard from M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 331 Mont. 281, \u00b6 11, 130 P.3d 1267, \u00b6 11 (citation omitted). The moving party must establish the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. \u00b626 We review a district court's conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 11. We will affirm a correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>result, even if the district court reached the correct result for the wrong reason. <em>Montana Earth Resources Ltd. Partnership v. North Blaine Estates, Inc., </em>1998 MT 254, \u00b6 29, 291 Mont. 216, \u00b6 29, 967 P.2d 376, \u00b6 29 (citing <em>Bowen v. McDonald, </em>276 Mont. 193, 200, 915 P.2d 201, 206 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b627 Did the District Court err (1) in determining that Libby Placer has no reversionary right to a previously condemned mineral interest taken by Noranda, and (2) in quieting title to Noranda?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">I. WHICH INTEREST IS CONTEMPLATED UNDER \u00a7 70-30-321(3), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u00b628 Libby Placer argues the District Court erred in construing the language of \u00a7 70-30-321(3), MCA, to address the interest Noranda had acquired as of 1993 rather than Libby Placer\u2019s interest at the time of condemnation in 1991. Libby Placer asserts the plain language of the statute refers to the condemnee\u2019s interest, not the after-acquired interest of the condemnor.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\u00b629 The statutory procedure governing eminent domain is codified at Title 70, chapter 30. Section 70-30-321(3), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">When an interest, <em>other than a fee simple interest, </em>in property that has been acquired for a public purpose by right of eminent domain, or otherwise, is abandoned or when the purpose for which it was acquired is terminated, the property reverts to the original owner or the original owner\u2019s successor in interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azq\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">\u00b630 In construing a statute, a court \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">\u00b631 The \u201cinterest in property\u2019 contemplated in \u00a7 70-30-321(3), MCA, that reverts to the original owner or the original owner\u2019s successor in interest is the interest in property <em>\u201cthat has been acquired by right of eminent domain.\u201d </em>The interest that has been acquired by right of eminent domain is the interest that was held by the condemnee prior to condemnation. The interest relevant to this dispute is the fractional mineral interest Libby Placer held that Noranda acquired by condemnation on March 22, 1991, by entry of the Final Judgment of Condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">\u00b632 The District Court, erroneously focusing on the interest Noranda held as of 1993, saw no need to determine whether one may own a fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>simple interest in a fractional mineral interest. Because the correct focus is on the interest Libby Placer held prior to condemnation, the legal nature of that interest must be determined. If Libby Placer\u2019s interest was other than a fee simple interest, then \u00a7 70-30-321(3), MCA, governs and the interest reverts to Libby Placer upon Noranda\u2019s abandonment. If Noranda acquired a fee simple interest from Libby Placer in 1991, then there is no possible reversion, regardless of whether the mining venture was abandoned or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">II. DID LIBBY PLACER HAVE A FEE SIMPLE ESTATE IN ITS FRACTIONAL MINERAL INTEREST?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b633 Libby Placer argues that its fractional mineral interest in the property was not a fee simple interest and, therefore, Noranda could not have acquired a fee simple interest from it as a result of the condemnation proceeding. Because Noranda acquired an interest other than a fee simple interest, Libby Placer asserts its condemned interest reverted to it upon Noranda\u2019s abandonment of the project by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u00b634 Noranda argues that in its condemnation proceeding, it acquired Libby Placer\u2019s 75% mineral interest in fee simple, which, together with Noranda\u2019s 25% mineral interest in fee simple, gave Noranda 100% of the mineral interest in fee simple as a matter of law. Because the reversion provision codified at \u00a7 70-30-321(3), MCA, applies to interests other than fee simple interests, Noranda argues that the District Court properly granted Noranda\u2019s motions for summary judgment on Libby Placer\u2019s claim for a declaratory judgment and on Noranda\u2019s counterclaim for quiet title, and properly denied Libby Placer\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment on its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">A. Characteristics of Real Property Interests</p>\n<p id=\"AMx\">\u00b635 Property interests in land have at least four major characteristics: (1) duration, (2) right to possession, (3) degree of beneficial enjoyment conferred on the owner, and (4) type of ownership. Richard R. Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 11.01 (Michael Allan Wolf ed., Lexis 2007). The <em>duration of </em>a real property interest is denoted by \u201cestate\u201d and (1) may be infinite or perpetual, as in fee simple; (2) may last for a specified period, such as life or a term of years; or (3) may end at any time, as in sufferance. Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property </em>vol. 1 at \u00a7 11.01. A <em>right to possession </em>may take the form of a present right to possession, a future right to possession, or no right to possession at all, such as with an easement or franchise. Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property </em>vol. 1 at \u00a7 11.01. The <em>benefit </em>conferred by an interest to its owner may be an unadulterated benefit, or only a partial or conditional benefit, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>in a security interest. Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property </em>vol. 1 at \u00a7 11.01. Finally, <em>ownership </em>of a real property interest may be by a single person or entity, or by two or more persons or entities in concurrent ownership. Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 11.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">B. Fee Simple Estate</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b636 An \u201cestate\u201d is \u201can interest in land which (a) is or may become possessory; and (b) is ownership measured in terms of duration.\u201d <em>Restatement (First) of Property, </em>\u00a7 9. Freehold estates, which under the common law include fee simple and life estates, are estates of indeterminate duration and are generally characterized by ownership. 28 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Estates </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11, 146 (2000). Nonfreehold estates, which include term, periodic tenancy, tenancy at will, and tenancy at sufferance, are estates of less than freehold and are generally characterized by possession through lease. 28 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Estates </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11,146. Permissible freehold and nonfreehold estates in Montana real property are codified at \u00a7 70-15-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b637 The words \u201cfee simple\u201d indicate \u201can absolute title or estate in lands wholly unqualified by any reversion, reservation, condition or limitation, or possibility of any such thing present or future, or precedent or subsequent.\u201d <em>Thompson on Real Property </em>vol. 2, \u00a7 17.02, 612 (David A. Thomas ed., Matthew Bender 2000). The freehold estate of fee simple absolute is the highest form of ownership that can be held in real property. <em>Thompson on Real Property </em>vol. 2, \u00a7 17.01 at 599. It is \u201cthe estate that never ends but continues into infinity.\u201d <em>Thompson on Real Property </em>vol. 2, \u00a7 17.01 at 599. \u201c[I]t has no restrictions on its use or enjoyment except those imposed by public policy for the common good.\u201d <em>Thompson on Real Property </em>vol. 2, \u00a7 17.01 at 599. \u201c[A] fee-simple title is <em>\u2018a </em>freehold estate of Inheritance absolute and unqualified. It stands at the head of estates as highest in dignity and the most ample in extent; since every other kind of estate is derivable thereout, and mergeable therein.\u2019\u201d <em>Gantt v. Harper, </em>82 Mont. 393, 404, 267 P. 296, 298 (1928) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">C. Division of Real Property Interests</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">\u00b638 Real property interests are generally subject to division. Robert G. Natelson, <em>Modern Law of Deeds to Real Property, </em>\u00a7 2.3.1, 16-17 (Little, Brown and Company 1992). An interest may be divided temporally into present and future estates. Natelson, hereinafter <em>Modern Law of Deeds, </em>\u00a7 2.3.1 at 16. An interest may be divided vertically, by splitting land into smaller tracts, each conveyed to a different grantee; or horizontally, by dividing the air space into blocks as contemplated in condominiums or severing surface interests from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the mineral interests below. Natelson, <em>Modern Law of Deeds, </em>\u00a7 2.3.1 at 16. Finally, an interest may be divided as to ownership, i.e., an interest may be held by one person or entity, or by two or more as tenants in common or joint tenants. Natelson, <em>Modern Law of Deeds, </em>\u00a7 2.3.1 at 16-17, \u00a7 2.7 at 30-31; Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property </em>vol. 1 at \u00a7 11.01.</p>\n<p id=\"A-Le\">\u00b639 A fee simple estate may be had in minerals beneath the surface of the ground separate and apart from the surface. <em>Thompson on Real Property </em>vol. 2, \u00a7 17.02 at 613.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">Since minerals are severable portions of the land, they are proper subjects of an exception or reservation in grants or conveyances.

Toole County, 111 </em>Mont. 426, 432, 159 P.2d 340, 342 (1945) <em>(citing Krutzfeld v. Stevenson, </em>86 Mont. 463, 284 P. 553 (1930); <em>Broderick v. Stevenson Consolidated Oil Co., </em>88 Mont. 34, 290 P. 244 (1930); <em>Hodgkiss v. Northland Petroleum Consolidated, </em>104 Mont. 328, 57 P.2d 811 (1937)). A division of the mineral interest from the surface interest is a horizontal division.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u00b643 We have also recognized that mineral interests, like surface interests, may be divided vertically into fractional interests. The <em>Rist </em>Court cited <em>Broderick, Krutzfeld, </em>and <em>Marias River Syndicate v. Big West Oil Co., </em>98 Mont. 254, 38 P.2d 599 (1934), as examples in which mineral deeds expressly conveyed fractional interests in minerals. <em>Rist, </em>117 Mont. at 437-38, 159 P.2d at 345. \u201cThe extent of the interest conveyed, reserved, or excepted by a grant, reservation, or exception of a fractional interest in minerals or mineral rights depends on the particular terms of the instrument.\u201d 58 C.J.S. <em>Mines and Minerals </em>\u00a7 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">E. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">\u00b644  The deed chain for the real property at issue is part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>record. The language of the 1951 deed whereby Hennessy and Craik transferred the real property designated within U.S. Mineral Survey No. 10377 to J. Heils Lumber Company, excepting and reserving the mineral interest, contains no limitations or restrictions on the reserved mineral interest. A fee simple title is presumed to be intended by every grant of real property from which it does not appear that a lesser estate was intended. <em>R. M. Cobban, </em>51 Mont. at 66, 149 P. at 486-87.</p>\n<p id=\"At5\">\u00b645 The mineral reservation was subsequently acquired by various heirs, devisees, and assigns of Hennessy and Craik, many of whom quit claimed their fractional interests to Libby Placer. Ultimately, Libby Placer acquired 75% of the mineral interest, and Noranda acquired the remaining 25%.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b646 The fact that Libby Placer\u2019s interest was a fractional interest has no bearing on the quality of its estate. Prior to condemnation, Libby Placer had complete ownership and control of its 75% fractional mineral interest. Libby Placer had the freedom to own it forever, develop it, divide it, lease it, or sell it. Its interest was independent of any other interest. We conclude Libby Placer held its 75% fractional mineral interest in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b647 Contrary to Libby Placer\u2019s argument that fee simple refers to a particular quantity (i.e., the whole) of real property, fee simple describes the infinite or perpetual duration of the ownership of the interest, be it an interest in the whole, the surface, a fraction of the surface, the minerals, or a fraction of the minerals. Just as children who inherit or are devised a common parent\u2019s home would each receive concurrent fractional interests in fee simple, Libby Placer and Noranda each held concurrent fractional interests in the mineral estate in fee simple as tenants in common, prior to condemnation. <em>Marias River, </em>98 Mont. at 265, 38 P.2d at 602. Libby Placer\u2019s and Noranda\u2019s interests were each absolute and unqualified, the highest form of ownership that can be held in real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b648 In the Final Judgment of Condemnation, Noranda was granted \u201call relief sought in Noranda\u2019s complaint, including condemnation of all of [Libby Placer\u2019s] right, title and interest in the [property].\u201d Because Noranda acquired all of Libby Placer\u2019s fee simple right, title and interest in the condemnation action, Libby Placer retained no reversionary interest either under the terms of the condemnation decree or by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b649 Section 70-30-321(3), MCA, which provides that an interest in property acquired for a public purpose through condemnation will revert to the original owner upon abandonment or when the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>for which it was acquired is terminated, specifically excludes fee simple interests. Libby Placer\u2019s fee simple interest is excluded by the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b650  We conclude that Libby Placer\u2019s condemned 75% mineral interest was a fee simple interest and, accordingly, has not reverted and can never revert to Libby Placer, pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-321(3), MCA. While the District Court erroneously concluded that what was relevant under \u00a7 70-30-321(3), MCA, was the interest Noranda acquired in the property from whatever source, rather than Libby Placer\u2019s interest condemned by Noranda, we will affirm a court\u2019s decision even if it reaches the right result for the wrong reason. <em>Montana Earth </em>Resources, \u00b6 29 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b651 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b484-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> Noranda is now known as Montanore Minerals Corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b476-10\"> Sponsors of Senate Bill No. 170, enacted in 1983 to amend \u00a7\u00a7 70-30-321 and - 322, MCA, by adding the subsection (3) language to each section, appear to have been primarily motivated to address disposition of condemned right of way easements abandoned by railroads, utilities and public bodies.
