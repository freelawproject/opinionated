R. App. P. 14, on September 2, 2008. In her petition, J.C. alleges that she has been deprived of her right to parent J.R. because of the Amended Petition for Termination of Parental Rights and for Adoption filed by G.R. and P.R., J.R.\u2019s aunt and uncle. J.C. further alleges that Respondent has issued unlawful and unconstitutional <em>ex parte </em>and other orders adversely affecting her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b62 On September 3,2008, we ordered Respondent to prepare, file and serve a summary response to J.C.\u2019s petition. We also granted G.R. and P.R. time to file a summary response should they choose to do so. In addition, we ordered that all proceedings in the underlying District Court cause be stayed pending further order of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b63 Pursuant to our Order, G.R. and P.R. filed a Summary Response to Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control on September 15, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AsO\">\u00b64 J.C. is the sole surviving parent of eight-year-old J.R. J.R.\u2019s birth father was killed in 1999 when J.C. crashed the vehicle in which she, J.R.\u2019s father, and another of J.C.\u2019s children were riding. J.C. was pregnant with J.R. at the time. The wreck killed all but J.C. and her unborn child, J.R. J.C. is now married to M.W. M.W. and J.C. have lived together since J.R. was one month old.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u00b65 In 2005, J.C. drove the getaway car in a botched armed robbery. J.R. and his half-brother were unrestrained in the back seat of the vehicle when J.C. crashed the car into a tree. J.C. was taken to jail and the children were placed in foster care by the Department of Public Health and Human Services. J.C. pled guilty to felony criminal endangerment for her role in the armed robbery. She received a ten-year suspended sentence in Flathead County Cause No. DC 05-090A. The sentencing court warned J.C. that if she violated her probation, she would serve the entire ten years. J.C. ultimately agreed to allow J.R.\u2019s half-brother to move with his father to South Dakota, but J.C. declined to relinquish J.R. to his aunt and uncle despite their offers to assist her.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u00b66 Less than a year after J.C. received her suspended sentence, she admitted to violating her probation by drinking and driving. Her suspended sentence was revoked and she was transported to the women\u2019s prison in Billings to serve her full sentence. Before she went to prison, J.C. executed a Durable Power of Attorney enabling M.W. to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>handle her financial affairs. Although J.C. made no provision for J.R. in the power of attorney, she left J.R. in M.W.\u2019s care. M.W. is himself on probation for failing to register in Montana as a violent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">\u00b67 On November 21, 2007, G.R. and P.R. filed a Petition for Termination of Parental Rights requesting that the court permanently terminate J.C.\u2019s parental rights to J.R. and order the adoption of J.R. by G.R. and P.R. G.R. and P.R. also filed a Motion for Temporary Care pending the disposition of their petition. That same day, Judge Lympus issued an order removing J.R. from M.W.\u2019s care and placing him in the temporary care of G.R. and P.R., who reside in Middleton, Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b68 On December 11, 2007, J.C. filed a motion to dismiss the petition to terminate her parental rights alleging that G.R. and P.R. do not qualify as persons entitled by the adoption statutes to file such a petition as they do not meet any of the standing requirements. However, the following day, J.C. signed an agreement wherein she \u201cvoluntarily and unequivocally\u201d relinquished her parental rights to J.C. and consented \u201cto both the permanent transfer of legal and physical custody to, and the adoption of\u2019 J.R. by G.R. and P.R. J.C. was represented by counsel at the time she entered into this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"Aap\">\u00b69 Eight days later, on December 20,2007, J.C. revoked her consent and moved to dismiss the Order for Temporary Care. She also requested that the court impose sanctions against G.R., P.R. and their counsel on the grounds that the Motion for Temporary Care \u201cwas not warranted by existing law and was filed for the improper purpose of depriving a parent of her constitutionally protected right to parent her child.\u201d That same day, M.W. filed a Cross-Petition for Step-Parent Adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b610 A hearing on the issue of temporary care took place on March 25, 2008. J.C. testified from prison via videoconference. G.R., P.R., and M.W. testified as well. At the time of the hearing, G.R. and P.R. filed a motion to amend their Petition for Termination of Parental Rights to add a reference to \u00a7 40-6-233, MCA (2007), giving relatives within the third degree the right to bring an action alleging abuse of parental authority. The court allowed the filing of the amended petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">On May 5, 2008, J.C. filed a motion to dismiss the amended petition arguing that a parental abuse action is a distinct and separate action which does not confer standing under the adoption statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"A8k\">\u00b611 The District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order on June 11, 2008, wherein the court determined that G.R. and P.R. had standing to bring the petition. The court ordered that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>J.R. remain in the temporary care of G.R. and P.R. pending a hearing on the termination of J.C.\u2019s parental rights. The court also denied J.C.\u2019s motion for sanctions. Thereafter, J.C. filed her Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control with this Court. A hearing on the termination of J.C.\u2019s parental rights was to be conducted by the District Court on September 10, 2008, but that action has been stayed pending the outcome of J.C.\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b612 Article VII, Section 2(2) of the Montana Constitution gives this Court general supervisory control over all other courts. This supervisory control is, however, an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d that is to be exercised only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Miller v. Eighteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 16, 337 Mont. 488, \u00b6 16, 162 P.3d 121, \u00b6 16 (citing <em>Evans v. Montana Eleventh Jud. Dist. Court, </em>2000 MT 38, \u00b6 15, 298 Mont. 279, \u00b6 15, 995 P.2d 455, \u00b6 15; <em>Park v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>1998 MT 164, \u00b6 13, 289 Mont. 367, \u00b6 13, 961 P.2d 1267, \u00b6 13). Consequently, we exercise supervisory control only when a district court is proceeding under a mistake of law and, in so doing, is causing a gross injustice, and where the normal appeal process is not an adequate remedy. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 16. Moreover, we make our determination regarding the exercise of supervisory control on a case-by-case basis. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Inter-Fluve v. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Court, </em>2005 MT 103, \u00b6 17, 327 Mont. 14, \u00b6 17, 112 P.3d 258, \u00b6 17; <em>Dusek v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2003 MT 303, \u00b6 6, 318 Mont. 166, \u00b66, 79 P.3d 292, \u00b6 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b613 We hold that the case <em>sub judice </em>meets the requirements for the exercise of supervisory control on the following bases. First, had the lower court proceedings in this matter not been stayed pending our determination of J.C.\u2019s petition, J.C.\u2019s fundamental right to parent her child may well have been terminated. Second, the issue of whether G.R. and P.R. have standing to bring their petition is a purely legal one. Third, the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law regarding G.R. and P.R.\u2019s standing in this matter resulting in a gross injustice to J.C. and J.R. Finally, this case presents constitutional issues of statewide importance-i.e., a parent\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to parent her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b614 Accordingly, we assume supervisory control over this matter to consider the issue raised by J.C.\u2019s petition: Whether G.R. and P.R. have standing to bring their Amended Petition to Terminate Parental Rights and for Adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">\u00b615 Standing refers to the threshold justiciability requirement that a plaintiff have a personal stake in a particular case. <em>Ballas v. Missoula City Bd. of Adjustment, </em>2007 MT 299, \u00b6 14, 340 Mont. 56, \u00b6 14, 172 P.3d 1232, \u00b6 14 <em>(citing Bowen v. McDonald, </em>276 Mont. 193, 201-02, 915 P.2d 201, 206 (1996)). If a plaintiff lacks standing, a court cannot grant relief because a justiciable controversy does not exist. <em>Ballas, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Powder River County v. State, </em>2002 MT 259, \u00b6 101, 312 Mont. 198, \u00b6 101, 60 P.3d 357, \u00b6 101).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b616 In her Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control, J.C. argues that G.R. and P.R. lack standing because they are not persons entitled to bring a petition for adoption pursuant to \u00a7 42-1-107, MCA. Instead, this statute provides that a child may be placed for adoption only by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">(a) the department or another agency to which the child has been relinquished for purposes of adoption;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">(b) the department or another agency expressly authorized to place the child for adoption by a court order terminating the relationship between the child and the child\u2019s parent or guardian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">(c) the child\u2019s parents; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">(d) a guardian expressly authorized by the court to place the child for adoption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Section 42-1-107(2), MCA. Clearly, a child\u2019s aunt and uncle are not parties authorized by the statute to place the child for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">\u00b617 Additionally, \u00a7 42-1-107(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[a]n adoption decree may not be entered if the child who is the subject of an adoption proceeding is not legally free for adoption.\u201d And, \u201c[a] child is not legally free for adoption until the parental rights of the birth parent or parents have been terminated by a court: (1) as provided in [Title 42]; [or] (2) pursuant to Title 41, chapter 3 ....\u201d Section 42-2-602, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A1E\">\u00b618 However, Title 42, chapter 2, MCA, specifies that adoption proceedings should be based on the <em>consent </em>of the birth parent and that controversies regarding termination of parental rights should be a separate and distinct action. To that end, the Official Comments to Title 42, chapter 2, MCA, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">It is the theory of this act that the adoption proceedings should be <em>based on consent. </em>Only then can the adoption court devote its entire attention to the inquiry whether the adoptive home will serve the best interests of the child and whether the child is properly placed in the adoptive home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">Under this theory <em>controversies respecting the termination of parental rights should be settled in other proceedings in a court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>with jurisdiction of the parties before the adoption proceedings are brought. </em>Once the parental rights are terminated the adoption court in the adoption proceedings has no other function in this respect except to recognize that the parental rights have been legally terminated by consent or by the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, followed by consent of a person, agency or court having authority to consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">It has been suggested that a procedure should be provided in the adoption act to terminate parental rights where the consent cannot be obtained. Aside from the jurisdictional and procedural difficulties this would entail, it is subject to a basic policy objection. The issues to be tried in a controversy over the termination of parental rights, i.e., the degree of unfitness of a parent, are quite different than the inquiry properly before an adoption court. <em>The two should not be mixed. </em>The trial of controversial issues over parental rights should not cast an influence in the adoption proceedings where the sole inquiry should be the future best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">Consequently, the determination of parental rights is left to be settled under the laws of the various states, and until terminated, by consent or by a court order in a court having jurisdiction of the parties under laws providing therefore, <em>there can be no adoption proceedings. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b619 In this case, the District Court determined that G.R. and P.R. had standing to file their Petition for Termination of Parental Rights as they are prospective adoptive parents pursuant to Title 42, part 6,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u00a7 40-6-233, MCA. However, a petition for termination of parental rights under Title 42, chapter 2, part 6, may only be brought by \u201c[t]he department, a licensed child-placing agency, <em>the prospective adoptive parent to whom the relinquishment is issued, </em>or a guardian with custody of the child.\u201d Section 42-2-603(2), MCA (emphasis added). In this case, G.R. and P.R. are not the department, a licensed child-placing agency or guardians with custody of the child. And, although J.C. originally agreed to relinquish her parental rights to G.R. and P.R., J.C. subsequently revoked that agreement contending that she was not adequately counseled as required by \u00a7 42-2-409, MCA. Hence, contrary to the District Court\u2019s assertions, Title 42, chapter 2, part 6, MCA, does not give G.R. and P.R. standing to file a termination for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>parental rights since they are not \u201cprospective adoptive parent[s] to whom [a] relinquishment [has been] issued.\u201d Section 42-2-603(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AG\">\u00b620 Relying on <em>Girard v. Williams, </em>1998 MT 231, 291 Mont. 49, 966 P.2d 1155, G.R. and P.R. argue that a finding of unfitness under Montana\u2019s Adoption Act (Title 42) presents a statutory exception to the requirement that the natural parents consent to the adoption of their child. However, this Court noted in <em>Girard </em>that a court may properly make a determination that a child is abused, neglected or dependent only in a proceeding instituted pursuant to, and in conformity with, the provisions of Title 41, chapter 3, MCA. <em>Girard, </em>\u00b6 46 (citing <em>In re Guardianship of D.T.N., </em>275 Mont. 480, 485, 914 P.2d 579, 582 (1996); <em>Matter of Guardianship of Aschenbrenner, </em>182 Mont. 540, 551, 597 P.2d 1156, 1163 (1979); <em>Henderson v. Henderson, </em>174 Mont. 1, 9, 568 P.2d 177, 181 (1977)). We stressed in <em>Girard </em>that \u201c[s]uch determinations-or other inteijections of abuse and neglect considerations-are inappropriate and, indeed, erroneous as a matter of law if made in other types of statutory proceedings relating to the custody of children.\u201d <em>Girard, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b621 Moreover, under Title 41, chapter 3, MCA, a petition for termination of parental rights based on abuse or neglect of a child may only be brought by the county attorney, the attorney general, or an attorney hired by the county. Section 41-3-422(2), MCA. Consequently, under the clear wording of this statue, G.R. and P.R. do not have standing to bring a petition for termination of parental rights based on abuse or neglect of J.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b622 In addition, the District Court has wrongly interpreted \u00a7 40-6-233, MCA, as granting standing to G.R. and P.R. Section 40-6-233, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">The <em>abuse of parental authority </em>is the subject of judicial cognizance in a civil action brought by the child or by its relative within the third degree or by the county commissioners of the county where the child resides. When the abuse is established, <em>the child may he freed from the dominion of the parent and the duty of support and education enforced. </em>A parent or guardian of a child has the right to give the child medicine prescribed for the child, and exercise of the right is not an abuse of parental authority. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The District Court interpreted this statute to mean that a \u201crelative within the third degree,\u201d such as G.R. and P.R., could bring an action terminating parental rights when physical abuse or neglect of a child has been established. On the contrary, \u00a7 40-6-233, MCA, refers to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>abuse of \u201cparental authority\u2019 and that the \u201cduty of support and education\u201d may be enforced once the child is freed from the dominion of the parent. Thus, this statute refers to parental authority for making decisions regarding the support and education of a child. This interpretation is supported by the placement of this statute in the Family Law section of the MCA under the part regarding the Obligations of Parents (Title 40, chapter 6, part 2). This interpretation is further buttressed by the statute immediately following \u00a7 40-6-233, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The authority of the parent ceases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">(1) upon the appointment, by a court, of a guardian of the person of a child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">(2) upon the marriage of a child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">(3) upon its attaining majority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Section 40-6-234, MCA. Certainly, if \u00a7 40-6-233, MCA, referred to the physical abuse or neglect of a child, the Legislature would not have contemplated that that abuse could continue until the child marries or attains majority. And, as noted previously, Title 41, chapter 3, MCA, is the proper section of the MCA under which a petition for termination of parental rights should be brought and that code section does not contemplate that relatives of a child may file the petition. Such a petition may only be brought by the county attorney, the attorney general, or an attorney hired by the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u00b623  Based on the foregoing, we hold that the District Court erred in determining that G.R. and P.R. had standing to bring their petition for termination of J.C.\u2019s parental rights to J.R. and in giving temporary care of J.R. to G.R. and P.R. However, since J.C. is currently serving a ten-year sentence in the Montana Women\u2019s Prison and will be unable to care for J.R. for an extended period of time, and since M.W. has had no contact with J.C. or J.R. in several months and his whereabouts are unknown, the court should appoint G.R. and P.R. guardians of J.R. pursuant to \u00a7 72-5-222(1), MCA, and the County Attorney and the Department of Public Health and Human Services should initiate appropriate procedures under Title 41, chapter 3, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">\n<em>Sanctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">\u00b624 The District Court also denied J.C.\u2019s request for sanctions under M. R. Civ. P. 11. which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-12\">The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b625  Based on the facts of this case, we cannot conclude that G.R. and P.R. brought their action for an improper purpose. It appears from the record before us that their only motivation was to provide J.R. with a safe, loving and stable environment in which to live given J.C.\u2019s inability to parent J.R. due to J.C.\u2019s lengthy incarceration. Moreover, we have stated that \u201cto avoid sanctions under [M. R. Civ. P. 11], it is not necessary that a party be correct in his or her interpretation of the law, but only that the party make a good faith argument within his or her view of the law.\u201d <em>In re Custody </em>of R.R.K., 260 Mont. 191, 203, 859 P.2d 998, 1006 (1993) (citing <em>In re Adoption of R.D.T., </em>239 Mont. 33, 36, 778 P.2d 416, 418 (1989). We conclude here that G.R. and P.R. did present a good faith argument, albeit, ultimately, an incorrect one. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b626 IT IS ORDERED that J.C.\u2019s Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b627 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that J.C.\u2019s request for sanctions is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b628 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the District Court\u2019s order granting temporary care of J.R. to G.R. and P.R. is vacated.
