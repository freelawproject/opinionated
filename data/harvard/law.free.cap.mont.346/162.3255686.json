(Axmen) and denying the cross-motion for summary judgment filed by Earl M. Pruyn, who died shortly before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>District Court\u2019s order. The District Court subsequently substituted Pruyn\u2019s estate (Estate) as the plaintiff. The record contains no indication that either party served notice of entry of judgment, as contemplated in M. R. Civ. P. 77(d). On July 25, 2008, the Estate, acting through its personal representative, filed a notice of appeal from the June 27 order and prior orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b62 On August 8, 2008, Axmen moved to dismiss this appeal on grounds that the June 27 order is not a final judgment, as contemplated in M. R. App. P. 4(l)(a), because a determination remained \u201cregarding an award of attorney fees and costs.\u201d Axmen represented it would \u201cbe filing its motion for fees in the District Court contemporaneously\u201d with its motion to dismiss the appeal here. The District Court record-which had not yet been transmitted when Axmen moved to dismiss-contains Axmen\u2019s Motion for Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs. On August 18, 2008, the Estate responded to Axmen\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, asserting the judgment was final and appealable and its notice of appeal divested the District Court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AN3\">\u00b63  A party may appeal from a final judgment. M. R. App. P. 6(1). A final judgment conclusively determines the rights of the parties and settles all claims in controversy in an action or proceeding, including any necessary determination of the amount of costs and attorney fees awarded or sanction imposed. M. R. App. P. 4(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b64 Axmen filed its bill of costs almost seven weeks after the District Court entered its summary judgment order, long after the statutory five-day period for filing and serving a bill of costs had expired. <em>See </em>\u00a7 25-10-501, MCA. Given this untimely filing, we conclude a determination of costs is not \u201cnecessary\u201d-as contemplated in M. R. App. P. 4(l)(a)-and Axmen\u2019s request for costs has no bearing on the finality of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b65 Regarding Axmen\u2019s motion for an award of attorney fees, we treat such a motion filed after entry of judgment as a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59(g). <em>See Chase v. Bearpaw Ranch Assn., </em>2006 MT 67, \u00b6 18, 331 Mont. 421, \u00b6 18, 133 P.3d 190, \u00b6 18 (citing <em>Associated Press v. </em>Crofts, 2004 MT 120, \u00b6 36, 321 Mont. 193, \u00b6 36, 89 P.3d 971, \u00b6 36). As provided in M. R. App. P. 4(5)(a)(iv)(3), if a party files a \u201ctimely motion\u201d in the district court to alter or amend a judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59, the time for appeal for all parties runs from the entry of the order on the motion or, if applicable, from the time the motion is deemed denied after 60 days. A notice of appeal filed before the disposition of such a motion-either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>by entry of an order or by deemed denial-is treated as filed on the date of such entry or deemed denial. The district court is not deprived of jurisdiction to enter its order on such a motion by the premature filing of a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 4(5)(a)(iv)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b66 In light of M. R. App. P. 4(5)(a)(iv)(3), the dispositive questions before us are: (1) whether Axmen\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) rule is \u201ctimely\u201d and, if so, (2) whether the Estate\u2019s notice of appeal divested the District Court of jurisdiction to consider Axmen\u2019s subsequently-filed motion. We address these questions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b67 With respect to whether Axmen\u2019s motion is \u201ctimely,\u201d the period for serving a motion to alter or amend the judgment is 10 days after the service of notice of entry of the judgment. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 59(g). Because neither party served notice of entry of the judgment as contemplated in M. R. Civ. P. 77(d), the 10-day time period in M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) has not yet begun to run. Thus, we conclude Axmen\u2019s motion relating to attorney fees is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b68 We next address whether the Estate\u2019s notice of appeal divested the District Court of jurisdiction to consider Axmen\u2019s subsequently-filed motion. In <em>Shull v. First Interstate Bank, </em>262 Mont. 355,864 P.2d 1268 (1993), we rejected a party\u2019s contention that his notice of appeal divested the trial court of jurisdiction to accept or determine the opposing parties\u2019 M. R. Civ. P. 52(b) and 59(g) motions to alter or amend the judgment, which were filed after the notice of appeal. In doing so, we construed language in former M. R. App. P. 5(a)(4) regarding a \u201cnotice of appeal filed before the disposition\u201d of a timely motion to alter or amend a judgment as including \u201ca notice of appeal filed prior to the expiration of the time allowed\u201d for such a motion. We also reasoned that allowing a party desiring to appeal to negate the opposing party\u2019s ability to file timely motions to alter or amend the judgment would result in a \u201crace to the courthouse\u201d and encourage parties to file such motions automatically, without an objective and unhurried examination of the judgment and its basis. <em>Shull, </em>262 Mont. at 358-59, 864 P.2d at 1270. We have located no authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b69 We acknowledge that the current M. R. App. P. 4(5)(a)(iv)(3) differs from the former M. R. App. P. 5(a)(4) at issue in <em>Shull. </em>This is especially true insofar as the former rule provided that a premature notice of appeal would \u201chave no effect\u201d and the current rule provides that a premature notice of appeal will be treated as filed on the date the district court decides the motion to alter or amend judgment or the motion is deemed denied. We rely on <em>Shull </em>only with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>whether a notice of appeal divests a district court of jurisdiction to consider a timely subsequently-filed M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) motion, in light of the \u201cfiled before the disposition\u201d language in both the former and current appellate rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">\u00b610 Neither party cites to <em>Shull, </em>but both parties advance other authorities. Axmen cites to <em>Harding v. Garcia, </em>2007 MT 120, \u00b6 16, 337 Mont. 274, \u00b6 16, 159 P.3d 1083, \u00b6 16, where we determined a judgment in which a district court awarded attorney fees as a discovery sanction without determining the amount of the fees was not yet final. <em>Harding </em>is distinguishable insofar as the party moved for discovery sanctions and the district court awarded attorney fees before the notice of appeal was filed. Thus, <em>Harding </em>is of little use here.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b611 The Estate relies on <em>ABC Collectors, Inc. v. Birnel, </em>2006 MT 148, \u00b6 9, 332 Mont. 410, \u00b6 9, 138 P.3d 802, \u00b6 9, for our longstanding rule that, when a notice of appeal is filed, jurisdiction passes from the trial court and is vested in this Court. The Estate fails to mention, however, our determination that the \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d in that case was not, in form or substance, a M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) motion to alter or amend the judgment triggering the appellate rule that a notice of appeal would be treated as if filed on the date of disposition of such a motion. <em>ABC Collectors, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-18. Unlike the motion at issue in ABC <em>Collectors, </em>and as discussed above, we construe Axmen\u2019s motion for an award of attorney fees as a M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) motion. <em>See Chase, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"AyU\">\u00b612 We note that either party could have taken action to avoid this situation. For example, before filing its notice of appeal, the Estate could have served notice of entry of judgment, as permitted by M. R. Civ. P. 77(d), to start the 10-day period for M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) motions. Axmen, on the other hand, could have filed its motion for an award of attorney fees earlier. Moreover, either party could have raised the possibility of an attorney fee award, or lack thereof, during the summary judgment hearing at which the District Court stated its intent to enter a final judgment so the parties could appeal. The parties\u2019 inaction has resulted in unnecessary delay and expenditures of resources by their counsel and this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AVF\">\u00b613  We conclude Axmen\u2019s motion for an award of attorney fees is timely. We further conclude the District Court retains jurisdiction to consider the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b614 IT IS ORDERED that the District Court record shall be returned to the Clerk of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u00b615 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this case is REMANDED to the District Court for its determination on Axmen\u2019s motion for an award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>of attorney fees and, if applicable, for a determination of the amount of those fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b616 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Axmen\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal is DENIED, and the Estate\u2019s previously-filed notice of appeal will be treated as filed on whichever of the following dates is applicable in light of the District Court\u2019s action on remand: (1) the date the District Court enters an order denying Axmen\u2019s motion; (2) the date on which the District Court, having decided to award attorney fees, enters its order determining the amount of those fees; or (3) pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59(g), 60 days from the date of this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b617 The Clerk is directed to provide electronic notice of this Order to the Honorable Robert L. Deschamps, III, the Clerk of the Fourth Judicial District Court, all counsel of record, and Edward Kimbrell, followed by notice by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">DATED this 23rd day of September, 2008.</p>\n<author id=\"b202-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY</author>\n<author id=\"ANM\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<author id=\"AgV\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<author id=\"Aka\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<author id=\"AXzk\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
