A later section provided that the park commission, created by the act, should not make any expenditure, or contract for any, \u201c exceeding the amount which shall have been previously appropriated by the town for its use.\u201d At a meeting warned and held for the purpose the town accepted the resolution of the General Assembly and voted \u201c that the selectmen and treasurer are hereby directed to prepare suitable bonds as authorized by said act, not exceeding $200,000, of the tenor, character and terms hereinafter provided, and are authorized to dispose of them in such amounts and at such times as shall be required by the park commission, to provide the sums made necessary by said commission in its proceedings under said act.\u201d Held that this vote constituted an <em>\u201c </em>appropriation \u201d within the meaning of the resolution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b494-7\">And held, upon the suit of parties of whom the park commission had purchased lands for a public park, that it was the duty of the selectmen and treasurer of the town to issue bonds within the limit prescribed, to an amount sufficient for payment for the lands.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b494-8\">[Argued January 24th\u2014</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ACT\">decided March 3d, 1890.]</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-9\">Amicable submission upon an agreed statement of facts ; brought to the Superior Court in New Haven County and reserved for the advice of this court.

Under our statute and according to the decisions of this court such an omission rendered the votes of no legal effect. <em>Hayden </em>v. Noyes, 5 Conn., 391; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>North School District, </em>53 Conn., 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The action of the town then at the annual town meeting, may, so far as the votes in question are concerned, be laid out of the case. It may be claimed, however, that the resolution of the General Assembly itself, in section four, prohibits the commission from making \u201c any expenditure or contract for expenditure involving liability of the town or city of New Haven exceeding the amount which shall have been previously appropriated by the town or city of New Haven for their use; \u201d and it is claimed that at the time of the purchase in question here no such appropriation had been made, and that therefore the commission could not bind the town by such purchase. Just what effect is to be given to the language quoted above from section four of the resolution, it is unnecessary now to decide, for if we give it the utmost effect that can be claimed for it the questions involved in the case at bar are in no wise affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">So far as we know it is not claimed that the commission could not make the purchase in question here so as to bind the town provided a sufficient appropriation had previously been made, but it is denied that such appropriation had been made. Inasmuch as,' if such an appropriation was made at all in the present case, it was made at the special town meeting of the town of New Haven held in June, 1889, it becomes necessary to examine the resolution itself and the action of the town thereunder as shown by its votes passed at that special meeting. Section one of the resolution reads as follows:\u2014\u201cThat the town of New Haven be and it is hereby authorized and empowered to issue its bonds to an amount not exceeding two hundred thousand dollars, payable in not more than fifty years from their dates, and bear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ing interest not exceeding four per centum per annum, payable semi-annually, in such manner and form as shall be voted by a town meeting duly warned and held for that purpose. Such bonds shall be used solely for the extension and improvement of the public part system of New Haven, in the manner hereinafter provided.\u201d Section nine reads as follows:\u2014\u201c This act shall take effect when ratified and accepted at a special town meeting of the town of New Haven, to be called for that purpose by the selectmen of the town within thirty days after the passage and approval of this act; and said meeting shall also have power to take action with respect to the issuing of the bonds herein provided for, and to adopt all suitable regulations respecting the form, terms and ultimate payment of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Pursuant to the provisions of the last resolution a special town meeting was called to meet on the 13th of June, 1889. The warning of the meeting contained among other matters the following:\u2014\u201cAnd also, if said resolution should be accepted, to take action with respect to the issuing of said bonds, and to adopt suitable regulations respecting the form, terms and ultimate payment of the same.\u201d At the meeting held in pursuance of this warning, in connection with a vote prescribing what the tenor, character and terms of the bonds should be, the following vote was passed:\u2014\u201c Voted, That the selectmen and town treasurer be and are hereby directed to prepare and procure suitable engrossed bonds, as authorized by said act, not exceeding two hundred thousand dollars in total amount, bearing interest at a rate not exceeding three and a half per cent per annum, and of the tenor, character and terms hereinafter provided; and are further authorized to dispose of said bonds from time to time at not less than par and accrued interest, in such amounts and at such times as shall be required by the park commission to be constituted under the provisions of said act, in order to provide the sums made necessary by said commission in its proceedings under said act.\u201d Whatever opinion may be held as to the effect of these votes, no question, so far as we know, has been, or indeed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>can be, raised as to the power of the town to pass them. They are within the power conferred by the resolution, and the warning of the meeting contained a sufficient notice that the town would or might take the action indicated by the votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The only question then is, whether these votes constitute an appropriation by the town within the meaning of section four of the resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">To \u201cappropriate,\u201d according to one of the meanings given to the words by Webster, is \u201cto set apart a sum of money for a particular object.\u201d In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bordelon, </em>6 La. Ann., 68, the court asks what is the meaning of the word appropriate,\u201d and answers as follows:\u2014\u201cIt is to allot, assign, set apart, or apply anything to the use of a particular person or thing or for a particular purpose.\u201d How in the case at bar, after the bonds are issued by the town, the resolution itself provides that they shall be used solely for the extension and improvement of the public park system in the manner provided in the resolution. This is in itself an appropriation of the bonds by legislative provision, but it is claimed that it is not the appropriation referred to in the fourth section of the resolution, and obviously it is not. Did the town then by the votes aforesaid make an appropriation within the meaning of section four? We think it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Its agents, appointed for such purpose by the resolution itself, are directed and empowered by the town to procure the bonds provided for in the resolution; the number and amount to be so procured and issued are specified; ample provision is made for their proper execution, authentication, and custody until they shall be issued and used; it is further provided that they shall be disposed of for the purpose of providing a fund for the use of the commission under the resolution ; and finally these agents are fully empowered and directed to issue them from time to time as required for the needs of the commission. In this action of the town it is difficult to see what element or essential of a complete appropriation is wanting. There remained nothing more for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the town to do. If the town had been called together prior to the purchase here in question and after the passage of the votes, to make an appropriation with reference to the purchase of the land, it could only have instructed its agents to do what it had already empowered and. directed them to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The resolution itself provides in section six as follows:\u2014 \u201c The bonds authorized in the first section of this act shall be prepared by the selectmen and town treasurer of New Haven, and shall be issued by them from time to time in such amounts as the park commission shall require. Such bonds shall in no case be sold or disposed of for less than par, and the avails of such as shall be issued shall be kept by the town treasurer as a special fund, subject to the orders of the park commission, and shall be paid by him only on such orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Construing the votes in the light of this language of the resolution, we think they clearly make an appropriation, even within the meaning of section four of the resolution. To construe them otherwise would, we think, defeat the manifest intent and purpose of the town in passing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Upon the facts set forth on the record we advise the Superior Court that it is the duty of the selectmen and town treasurer of the town of New Haven to issue, in accordance with the terms of said resolution of the General Assembly and of the votes of the town of New Haven passed at the special town meeting held in June, 1889, the bonds of said town to an amount sufficient to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and therefore that judgment should be rendered for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
