De Los Rios, the administrator of the estate of Felix De Los Rios (decedent), appeal from the judgment of the trial court declaring that a unicover insurance policy issued by the plaintiff, the Universal Underwriters Insurance Company, does not provide umbrella liability coverage for the named defendant, Eric J. Paradis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendants contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not require the plaintiff to provide umbrella coverage for Paradis with respect to their claims against him in personal injury and wrongful death actions; and (2) interpreted the unicover policy to conclude that it does not extend umbrella coverage to Paradis. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. In October, 2002, the decedent, Lamont and Paradis were employees of Crowley Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc. (Crowley), and were involved in a single vehicle accident while traveling between two of Crowley\u2019s facilities. The accident injured Lamont and killed the decedent. Thereafter, Lamont and the estate of the decedent each brought a civil action against Crowley and Paradis, who had been driving the motor vehicle at the time of the accident (underlying actions). The plaintiff defended Crowley and Paradis pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>to the unicover policy, which the plaintiff had issued to Crowley and was in effect at the time of the accident. The court subsequently granted Crowley\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the action brought by the decedent\u2019s estate, and Lamont thereafter withdrew his action against Crowley.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Although Crowley no longer was a party to the underlying actions, the plaintiff acknowledged its duty to continue to defend and to indemnify Paradis pursuant to the terms of the garage operations and automobile hazard section of the unicover policy, part 500 thereof (garage coverage). The plaintiff denied, however, any obligation to indemnify Paradis pursuant to the umbrella section of the unicover policy, part 980 thereof (umbrella coverage), on the ground that he was neither a \u201cnamed insured\u201d nor a \u201cdesignated person\u201d under that portion of the policy. The distinction between the two different kinds of coverage is significant to the present case because the garage coverage provides automobile liability coverage with a limit of $500,000, while the umbrella coverage would provide liability coverage up to $10 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no duty under the unicover policy\u2019s umbrella coverage to indemnify Par-adis in either of the underlying actions. Subsequently, each of the defendants moved for summary judgment. The plaintiff filed an objection to the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, and also filed its own cross motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The trial court, <em>Bryant, J., </em>denied the motion for summary judgment filed by the administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate and granted the plaintiffs cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>motion for summary judgment. The trial court noted that, because the unicover policy \u201cexplicitly name[d] the individual insureds for each coverage part separately\u201d; <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Paradis, </em>50 Conn. Sup. 486, 493, A.2d (2006); and Paradis was not listed as a designated person under the umbrella coverage, \u201c[t]he definition of an insured for such coverage has a definite and precise meaning concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion. As a consequence, efforts by [the defendants] to assert that Paradis had umbrella coverage must fail.\u201d Id., 495. The trial court also concluded that \u00a7 31-293a; see footnote 3 of this opinion; did not require the extension of umbrella coverage to Paradis, because it \u201coperate [s] to enforce the law requiring the minimum coverage mandated by law, [namely, General Statutes \u00a7 14-112 (a)]<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but not more.\u201d <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Paradis, </em>supra, 499. The court concluded that the \u201c[m]andatory minimum insurance required by \u00a7 14-112 (a) does not abrogate the clear and unambiguous language of [the] unicover policy, which affords different coverages to different classes of Crowley officers and employees. The statutory purpose of the minimum insurance statute is satisfied by Crowley\u2019s automotive coverage and, therefore, the financial responsibility law does not create coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>under the umbrella coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 501. The court then determined that the $500,000 garage coverage limit \u201cmore than satisfied\u201d the financial responsibility provisions of \u00a7 31-293a. Id., 501. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On appeal, the defendants claim, inter alia, that: (1) \u00a7 31-293a mandates umbrella coverage for Paradis in the underlying action because the unicover policy properly is read as a single policy, rather than multiple policies, and the plain language of \u00a7 31-293a thereby precludes the exclusion of Paradis from the umbrella coverage; and (2) the fact that the policy provides the minimum coverage required by the financial responsibility laws does not save it from being nevertheless \u201c \u2018null and void\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 31-293a. The defendants also contend that the trial court improperly construed the terms of the umbrella coverage as not extending to Paradis.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Our examination of the record on appeal and the briefs and arguments of the parties, persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. Because the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in the present appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s concise and well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on these issues. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Paradis, </em>supra, 50 Conn. Sup. 486. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained. See, e.g., <em>Lagassey </em>v. <em>State, </em>281 Conn. 1, 5, 914 A.2d 509 (2007); <em>Cashman </em>v. <em>Tolland, </em>276 Conn. 12, 16, 882 A.2d 1236 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\"> The trial court, granted the plaintiffs motion for a default judgment against Paradis, who failed to appear in either the trial court or in this court.

De Los Rios.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\"> The defendants appealed separately from the judgment of the trial court t,o the Appellate Court, and we transferred their appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. Thereafter, we granted the defendants\u2019 motion to consolidate their appeals for the purpose of briefing and argument. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a provides: \u201cIf an employee or, in case of his death, his dependent has a right to benefits or compensation under this chapter on account of injury or death from injury caused by the negligence or wrong of a fellow employee, such right shall be the exclusive remedy of such injured employee or dependent and no action may be brought against such fellow employee unless such wrong was wilful or malicious or the action is based on the fellow employee\u2019s negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle as defined in section 14-1.
