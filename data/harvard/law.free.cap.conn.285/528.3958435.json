The Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Court concluded that (1) the jury reasonably could not find, on the basis of the defendant\u2019s admission and the testimony of the victim, that a stepfather-stepdaughter relationship existed, and (2) \u00a7 52a-72a (a) (2) violates the equal protection clause of the federal constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because it prohibits sexual intercourse only between individuals of the opposite sex who are related within certain degrees of kinship. See <em>State </em>v. <em>John M., </em>94 Conn. App. 667, 673-74, 694, 894 A.2d 376 (2006). We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction, and that \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) applies equally to sexual intercourse between persons of both the opposite sex and the same sex who are related within certain degrees of kindred. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts, as summarized in part by the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion. On April 22, 2002, the defendant lived with his wife, J, and her daughter from a prior relationship, the victim,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who was seventeen years old. \u201cThe victim, a junior in high school, stayed home from school that day due to sickness. The only other person home that morning was the defendant. While watching a movie together in the defendant\u2019s bedroom, the defendant engaged in oral sex and vaginal intercourse with the victim.\u201d Id., 668-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged with one count of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (4),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>and one count of sexual assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2). At the close of evidence in the defendant\u2019s jury trial, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on both counts. The defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to establish that, at the time the sexual assault had occurred, he was responsible for the general supervision of the victim\u2019s welfare as required by \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (4), or that he was legally married to the victim\u2019s mother as required by \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2). The trial court granted the motion with respect to the first count, but denied the motion with respect to the second count, and submitted the case to the jury for deliberation. Thereafter, the jury found the defendant guilty of sexual assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2), and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court claiming, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the victim\u2019s stepfather.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Appellate Court agreed that, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Roswell, </em>6 Conn. 446 (1827), \u201cin incest cases, the defendant\u2019s admission alone is insufficient to establish either a husband-wife or parent-child relationship.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>John M., </em>supra, 94 Conn. App. 673. The Appellate Court concluded that, pursuant to <em>Roswell, </em>the state must submit written documentation evidencing the legality and validity of the familial relationship, such as a marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>license or a birth certificate or, alternatively, the state must adduce testimony from a witness with firsthand knowledge concerning the legality and validity of the familial relationship, such as a witness to the solemnization of the marriage or the birth. Id., 674. In so concluding, the Appellate Court rejected the state\u2019s claim that <em>Roswell </em>had been overruled sub silentio by \u00a7 8-3 (1) (A) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which provides that the admissions of a party opponent may be admitted into evidence against him or her for substantive purposes, because the Appellate Court knew \u201cof no authority indicating that a decision of the Connecticut Supreme Court may be overruled by the promulgation of rules of evidence. Rather, the overruling of <em>Roswell </em>remains exclusively the province of that court.\u201d Id., 673-74 n.5. Because neither the victim\u2019s birth certificate nor the testimony of a witness with firsthand knowledge concerning the victim\u2019s parentage had been admitted into evidence, the Appellate Court concluded that the evidence was insufficient for the juiy reasonably to find that J was the victim\u2019s mother, despite the defendant\u2019s admission and the victim\u2019s testimony concerning this fact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The Appellate Court further concluded that the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) violates the equal protection clause of the federal constitution because the statute prohibits sexual intercourse between opposite sex individuals, but not same sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>individuals, related within certain degrees of kindred. Id., 676-78. In arriving at this conclusion, the Appellate Court noted that \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) criminalizes sexual intercourse between persons who are prohibited from marrying under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-21, which, in turn, references only male-female unions within certain degrees of kindred. Id., 676-77. Because \u201ckindred persons engaged in homosexual relations are similarly situated to those engaged in heterosexual relations\u201d; id., 678; and because the statute\u2019s prohibition of heterosexual relations alone is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest; id., 685-94; the Appellate Court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional. Id., 694. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">After we granted certification to appeal, we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the following question: \u201c[D]id the Appellate Court properly conclude [with respect to the defendant\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence claim] . . . that the judges of the Superior Court lack the authority to promulgate rules of evidence overruling a decision of the state Supreme Court?\u201d In light of our conclusion in part I of this opinion that the evidentiary rule articulated in <em>Roswell </em>had been overruled sub silentio by subsequent decisions of this court prior to the adoption of the Connecticut Code of Evidence in 1999, we need not and, therefore, do not reach the supplemental question.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The state first claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2). Specifically, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly relied on <em>State </em>v. Roswell, supra, 6 Conn. 446, to conclude that either written documentation or the testimony of a witness with firsthand knowledge of the victim\u2019s parentage is required to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>existence of a familial relationship beyond a reasonable doubt because <em>Roswell </em>has been overruled sub silentio by subsequent decisions of this court. The state further claims that, if we conclude that <em>Roswell </em>no longer is good law, then the defendant\u2019s admission and the victim\u2019s testimony were sufficient to establish the existence of a stepfather-stepdaughter relationship and, therefore, to support the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2). The defendant responds that <em>Roswell </em>remains good law and that the rule articulated therein \u201cis as applicable today as it was nearly two centuries ago.\u201d We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We first address the state\u2019s claim that <em>Roswell </em>has been overruled by subsequent decisions of this court. The continued viability and applicability of the common-law rule announced in <em>Roswell </em>presents this court with a question of law over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 303, 864 A.2d 666 (2004) (interpretation of common law is question of law), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In <em>Roswell, </em>the defendant was charged with the crime of incest for engaging in sexual relations with his legitimate daughter. At trial, the state had offered into evidence \u201cthe [defendant\u2019s] confessions, at various times, that the said [victim] was his daughter; that her mother . . . was his lawful wife; accompanied with evidence that they had cohabited together as husband and wife, uninterruptedly, for more than thirty years last past, and had always been reputed husband and wife; and also, that the said [victim], now about twenty-one years of age, had lived with her reputed parents from the time of her birth.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roswell, </em>supra, 6 Conn. 447. The defendant objected to the admission of this evidence, claiming that the state must prove the existence of a marriage <em>in fact </em>and that \u201cneither reputation, cohabitation nor the confession of the [defendant] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>he was married, could be received.\u201d Id. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, and the jury found the defendant guilty of the crime charged. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">On appeal to this court, the defendant claimed that, \u201cwhenever a marriage is alleged in an indictment or information, and a marriage is essential to constitute the act a crime, a marriage in fact must be proved; and that the proof must be either by a copy of the record of the marriage, or the testimony of a witness who was present at its celebration: and that at least proof of cohabitation, reputation or confession of the [defendant], of the fact, is not sufficient.\u201d Id., 448-49. After reviewing the common law of England and of our sister states, this court agreed with the defendant that, because marriage in fact was an element of the crime charged, in that the defendant had been charged with engaging in unlawful sexual relations with his <em>legitimate </em>daughter; id., 450; the challenged testimony was \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cwholly insufficient\u201d to support his conviction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 451. This court acknowledged that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>most other cases, evidence of this nature is admissible \u201cwhere a marriage is in question.\u201d Id., 450. In criminal cases, however, such evidence is inadmissible and insufficient because \u201c[t]he cohabitation of persons as husband and wife, without any marriage, is too frequent to need comment,\u201d and many individuals falsely represent themselves to be married \u201cto justify [their] conduct and screen [themselves] from censure and punishment.\u201d Id., 451. Thus, \u201c[u]nlike confessions of facts in ordinary cases, made against one\u2019s interest, these are not unfrequently prompted from the most selfish motives. Besides, a man or woman may verily suppose a marriage to have been consummated, when no lawful marriage ever took place. Ignorance of the law on this subject may be presumed, in many cases . . . .\u201d Id. Accordingly, this court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Our review of this court\u2019s jurisprudence over the past 180 years compels us to conclude that <em>Roswell </em>has been overruled sub silentio by subsequent decisions of this court and, therefore, that the admissions of a criminal defendant not only are admissible, but often are suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>cient, although not conclusive, evidence of a legal and valid familial relationship for purposes of a criminal prosecution. The erosion of <em>Roswell </em>first began with <em>State </em>v. <em>Schweitzer, </em>57 Conn. 532, 537, 18 A. 787 (1889), wherein this court addressed the admissibility and sufficiency of evidence admitted to support the defendant\u2019s conviction for \u201cunlawfully neglecting and refusing to support his wife . . . .\u201d The defendant claimed, inter alia, that pursuant to <em>Roswell, </em>his admissions concerning his marital status, and evidence of his cohabitation with his alleged wife, improperly were admitted at trial and, moreover, were insufficient for the jury reasonably to find a husband-wife relationship.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 534. This court concluded that the evidence of cohabitation was admissible because \u201c[t]he fact of cohabitation as man and wife raises a presumption of a legal marriage\u201d and, although \u201c[c]ohabitation does not make a marriage . . . it is evidence from which a jury [has] a right to find an actual marriage.\u201d Id., 538. Additionally, this court could \u201csee no reason why the confession of the defendant that he had been married to [his alleged wife] was not admissible against him\u201d since \u201c[i]t was a fact peculiarly within his knowledge.\u201d Id. Accordingly, this evidence, combined with the testimony of the defendant\u2019s wife and a marriage certificate; see footnote 11 of this opinion; was admissible and sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Thus, despite our conclusion <em>in Roswell </em>that evidence of cohabitation is inadmissible and insufficient to support a finding of marriage in fact in a criminal action, in <em>Schweitzer </em>we concluded that such evidence is the type \u201cfrom which [the jury has] the <em>right to find a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>marriage in </em>fact\u201d because \u201c[b]y the law of England, and [presumably] all other Christian countries, where a man and a woman have long lived together as man and wife, and have been so treated by their friends and neighbors, there is a prima facie presumption that they really are and have been what they profess to be.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Schweitzer, </em>supra, 57 Conn. 538. Indeed, since <em>Schweitzer </em>was decided, this court repeatedly has reaffirmed the principle that, \u201ccohabitation as husband and wife is [admissible] evidence, and <em>often sufficient evidence, </em>that the parties have been validly married, but does not in itself constitute a marriage.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Felson </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>129 Conn. 427, 432, 29 A.2d 306 (1942); see also <em>Kowalczyk </em>v. <em>Kleszczynski, </em>152 Conn. 575, 577, 210 A.2d 444 (1965); <em>Eva </em>v. <em>Gough, </em>93 Conn. 38, 48, 104 A. 238 (1918); 29 Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence \u00a7 215 (1994) (\u201c[w]hen a couple cohabits together and are reputedly husband and wife, the law has traditionally recognized a presumption that they are in fact married\u201d). Thus, although cohabitation, which generally is defined as \u201cliving together as husband and wife\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>181 Conn. 426, 432, 435 A.2d 967 (1980); \u201cneither grants to nor imposes upon [a couple] marital status\u201d; <em>McAnerney </em>v. <em>McAnerney, </em>165 Conn. 277, 285, 334 A.2d 437 (1973); it often is sufficient evidence from which the trier of fact reasonably can find the existence of a valid and legal marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Likewise, our conclusion in <em>Roswell </em>that a defendant\u2019s admissions concerning his or her marital status are inadmissible and insufficient as a matter of law to establish marriage in fact in a criminal action is inconsistent with <em>Schweitzer, </em>as well as our subsequent case law. First, with respect to the admissibility of the admissions of party opponents, \u201c[i]t is an elementary rule of evidence that [such admissions] may be entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>into evidence .... In the criminal context, an admission is the avowal or acknowledgment of a fact or of circumstances from which guilt <em>may </em>be inferred, and only <em>tending </em>to prove the offense charged, but not amounting to a confession of guilt. . . . [Statements made out of court by a party-opponent are universally deemed admissible when offered against him ... so long as they are relevant and material to issues in the case. . . . [T]he vast weight of authority, judicial, legislative, and scholarly, supports the admissibility <em>without restriction </em>of <em>any </em>statement of a party offered against that party at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>260 Conn. 339, 357-58, 796 A.2d 1118 (2002); see also <em>Tappan </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>115 Conn. 508, 517, 162 A. 7 (1932) (\u201c[a]n admission by a party of a material fact, whether made in court or elsewhere, is admissible against him\u201d); Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (\u201c[t]he following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness ... (1) ... [a] statement that is being offered against a party and is [A] the party\u2019s own statement, in either an individual or a representative capacity\u201d). Moreover, \u201c[t]here is no requirement that the statement of a party necessarily be against the party\u2019s interest either when made or offered in order to be admissible.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>218 Conn. 239, 251, 588 A.2d 1066 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 251, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984). Indeed, \u201c[a] statement is admissible as an admission even if it: (1) is conclusory; (2) contains a legal or factual conclusion beyond the competence of the person who made the admission; or (3) is not based on personal knowledge.\u201d <em>Willow Funding Co., L.P. </em>v. <em>Grencom Associates, </em>246 Conn. 615, 620, 717 A.2d 1211 (1998); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Markeveys, </em>56 Conn. App. 716, 720, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>745 A.2d 212 (\u201c[t]he admission need not even be wholly reliable or trustworthy\u201d to be admissible), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 952, 749 A.2d 1203 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Second, with respect to the sufficiency of the admissions of a party opponent concerning his or her marital status, it is axiomatic that such out-of-court admissions are sufficient, but not conclusive, evidence of the truth of the matter asserted. <em>Perrelli </em>v. <em>Savas, </em>115 Conn. 42, 44, 160 A. 311 (1932); see also <em>Remkiewicz </em>v. <em>Remkiewicz, </em>180 Conn. 114, 118, 429 A.2d 833 (1980); <em>Edgerton </em>v. <em>Edgerton, </em>8 Conn. 6, 10 (1830). Indeed, it is the exclusive province of the trier of fact to consider this evidence in connection with all of the other evidence adduced at trial and to determine what weight, if any, to afford it. See, e.g., <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Goodspeed, </em>180 Conn. 415, 418-19, 429 A.2d 915 (1980); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Torrington, </em>79 Conn. 42, 45, 63 A. 657 (1906). In performing its fact-finding function, the trier is free to consider whether the party opponent had firsthand knowledge of the truth of the matter asserted; see, e.g., <em>Dreier </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co., </em>196 Conn. 242, 249, 492 A.2d 164 (1985); and whether the circumstances under which the admission was made, including the interest of the party opponent, render it worthy of belief. See, e.g., <em>Stitham v. LeWare, </em>134 Conn. 681, 684, 60 A.2d 658 (1948); see also C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 8.16.3 (c), p. 590 (\u201cThe probative force of an admission depends on the surrounding circumstances. It may have little if any weight, or in connection with other evidence it may amount to convincing proof.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Our review of this court\u2019s jurisprudence compels us to conclude that our determination in <em>Roswell </em>that, as a matter of law, the legality and validity of a marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>relationship in a criminal action may be proven only via documentary evidence or the testimony of a firsthand witness, has been overruled by subsequent decisions of this court and, therefore, no longer is good law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A fortiori, the Appellate Court improperly extended the rule articulated in <em>Roswell </em>to include parental, as well as marital, relationships.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>John M., </em>supra, 94 Conn. App. 674 <em>(Roswell </em>rule applies to parentage because \u201c[j]ust as a person may suppose and confess to a marriage that in actuality is invalid, so, too, may a person suppose and confess to equally invalid parent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>age\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly relied on <em>Roswell </em>to conclude that the state\u2019s failure to produce documentary evidence or testimony from a firsthand witness concerning the victim\u2019s parentage rendered the evidence in the present case legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Having determined that the type of evidence adduced by the state was not insufficient as a matter of law, we next address the state\u2019s claim that the evidence of the victim\u2019s parentage in this case was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction. At trial, the victim testified that J was her mother and that the defendant was her stepfather. Additionally, the state introduced into evidence the defendant\u2019s admission that, at the time of the sexual assault, he had been married legally to the victim\u2019s mother, J, for fourteen years.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Construing this evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>jury\u2019s verdict, as we are required to do,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we conclude that the jury reasonably found that the defendant and the victim had a stepfather-stepdaughter relationship at the time the sexual assault occurred. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The state next claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) violates the equal protection clause of the federal constitution. Specifically, the state claims that because the statute plainly applies to all individuals, regardless of sex or sexual orientation, the Appellate Court improperly determined that \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) prohibits sexual intercourse only between opposite sex individuals who are related within certain degrees of kindred. In support of the Appellate Court\u2019s determination, the defendant responds that \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) plainly prohibits sexual intercourse between opposite sex individuals only because it incorporates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>by reference the specific male-female unions enumerated in \u00a7 46b-21. Moreover, the defendant points out that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-38cc,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which prohibits civil unions between same sex individuals related within certain degrees of kindred, is not incorporated by reference into \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) and, furthermore, does not include stepparents and stepchildren within its ambit. Lastly, the defendant claims that the exclusion of same sex sexual intercourse from the purview of \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) rationally is not related to a legitimate government interest and, therefore, violates the equal protection clause of the federal constitution. We conclude that \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) does not violate the equal protection clause of the federal constitution because it applies equally to both opposite sex and same sex sexual intercourse when individuals are related within certain degrees of kindred.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">As a preliminary matter, we must determine whether \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) treats sexual intercourse between individuals of the opposite sex who are related within certain degrees of kindred differently from sexual intercourse between individuals of the same sex who are related within the same degrees of kindred. In other words, we first must determine whether the statute creates the allegedly unconstitutional classification. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>268 Conn. 508, 534, 847 A.2d 862 (\u201c[t]o implicate the equal protection [clause] under the . . . federal [constitution] ... it is necessary that the state statute [or statutory scheme] in question, either on its face or in practice, treat persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>standing in the same relation to it differently\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 969, 125 S. Ct. 424, 160 L. Ed. 2d 340 (2004). This presents an issue of statutory construction over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Aloi, </em>280 Conn. 824, 832, 911 A.2d 1086 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>283 Conn. 644, 650, 931 A.2d 142 (2007). \u201cFurthermore, we presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . and that [statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v.

The United States Supreme Court has said: That criminal statutes are to be construed strictly is a proposition which calls for the citation of no authority. But this does not mean that every criminal statute must be given the narrowest possible meaning in complete disregard of the purpose of the legislature. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bramblett, </em>348 U.S. 503, 509-10, 75 S. Ct. 504, 99 L. Ed. 594 (1955). The same court also said: No rule of construction, however, requires that a penal statute be strained and distorted in order to exclude conduct clearly intended to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>within its scope \u2014 nor does any rule require that the act be given the narrowest meaning. It is sufficient if the words are given their fair meaning in accord with the evident intent of [the legislature]. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Raynor, </em>302 U.S. 540, 552, 58 S. Ct. 353, 82 L. Ed. 413 (1937). We have said: Strict construction does not mean that a statute must be read in isolation. In construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result. . . . The rule of strict construction does not require that the narrowest technical meaning be given to the words employed in a criminal statute in disregard of their context and in frustration of the obvious legislative intent. <em>... In re Luis R., </em>204 Conn. 630, 635, 528 A.2d 1146 (1987). Such authority demonstrates that the rule of strict construction of penal statutes is not without limitation; the doctrine of strict construction is only one of the aids which is to be used in the construction of penal statutes. See 3 J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. 1986) \u00a7 59.06.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Singh </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>213 Conn. 637, 646-47, 569 A.2d 1112 (1990); id., 656 (degrees of kindred enumerated in \u00a7 46b-21 includes uncle and niece related by half blood).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">We begin our analysis with the text of \u00a7 53a-72a (a), which provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of sexual assault in the third degree when such person ... (2) engages in sexual intercourse with another person whom the actor knows to be related to him or her within any of the <em>degrees of kindred </em>specified in section 46b-21.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 46b-21, in turn, provides that \u201c[n]o man may mariy his mother, grandmother, daughter, granddaughter, sister, aunt, niece, stepmother or stepdaughter, and no woman may many her father, grandfather, son, grandson, brother, uncle, nephew, stepfather or stepson. Any marriage within these degrees is void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>To resolve the state\u2019s claim, we must determine whether the phrase \u201cdegrees of kindred\u201d in \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) incorporates by reference the precise male-female unions enumerated in \u00a7 46b-21. Because the phrase \u201cdegrees of kindred\u201d is not defined in the governing statutory scheme, we turn to the dictionary definitions of the words included therein to ascertain its meaning. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (\u201c[i]n the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d); see also <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Gailno, </em>275 Conn. 290, 298, 880 A.2d 127 (2005) (common usage and ordinary meaning of statutory terms \u201care determined appropriately by review of [their] dictionary definitionfs]\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The Random House Dictionary of the English Language defines the word \u201cdegree\u201d in relevant part as \u201ca certain distance or remove in the line of descent, determining the proximity of a relationship . . . .\u201d The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (1966). It further defines the word \u201ckindred\u201d in relevant part as a \u201crelationship by birth or descent, or sometimes by marriage; kinship.\u201d Id. The phrase \u201cdegrees of kindred\u201d therefore plainly refers to the proximity of relation between family members related by birth or marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We next turn to the definition of the phrase \u201csexual intercourse\u201d as used in \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2), which is defined by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as \u201cvaginal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus between persons <em>regardless of sex. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By its express terms, \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) therefore prohibits individuals related within the proximity of relation demarcated in \u00a7 46b-21 from engaging in vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus, <em>regardless of their sex or sexual orientation. </em>To conclude otherwise would require us to read the phrase \u201cregardless of sex\u201d out of the statutory scheme, which we are not permitted to do. See, e.g., <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>279 Conn. 207, 217, 901 A.2d 673 (2006). Accordingly, \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) plainly does not incoiporate the precise male-female unions enumerated in \u00a7 46b-21 but, rather, incorporates only the proximity of relation specified therein, namely, parent-child, grandparent-grandchild, sibling-sibling, aunt/uncle-niece/nephew and stepparent-stepchild. Because \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) applies equally to both same sex and opposite sex sexual intercourse between individuals who are related within the degrees of kinship specified in \u00a7 46b-21, it does not create the allegedly unconstitutional classification and, therefore, does not violate the equal protection clause of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The defendant claims, however, that our construction of \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) creates absurd and unworkable results because a stepparent and stepchild legally may enter into a civil union under \u00a7 46b-38cc, but are prohibited from consummating that union under \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2). We are not persuaded. \u201cWhere, as here, more than one statute is involved, we presume that the legislature intended them to be read together to create a harmonious body of law. . . . The legislature is presumed to be aware and to have knowledge of all existing statutes and the effect which its own action or nonaction may have on them.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>George B., </em>258 Conn. 779, 795, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>785 A.2d 573 (2001). A comparison of the degrees of kindred specified in \u00a7 46b-38cc with those specified in \u00a7 46b-21 reveals that they are the same, with the exception of the stepparent-stepchild relationship. We conclude that the omission of the stepparent-stepchild relationship from \u00a7 46b-38cc merely reflects the fact that a stepparent is not eligible to enter into a civil union with a stepchild because he or she necessarily already is married to, or has entered into a civil union with, the stepchild\u2019s parent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-38aa (\u201c \u2018[cjivil union\u2019 means a union established pursuant to sections 46b-38aa to 46b-38oo, inclusive, between two eligible persons\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-38bb (\u201c[a] person is eligible to enter into a civil union if such person is . . . [1] [n]ot a party to another civil union or a marriage\u201d). Moreover, it would have been unnecessary and superfluous for the legislature to include the stepparent-stepchild relationship within the degrees of kindred specified in \u00a7 46b-38cc, and to cross-reference that statute in \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) to criminalize same sex sexual intercourse between stepparents and stepchildren because, as previously explained, \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) already plainly and unambiguously criminalizes such sexual intercourse. See generally <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 659 (\u201c [i] t is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature [does] not intend to enact meaningless provisions\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The defendant claims, however, that the stepparent-stepchild relationship survives the demise of the civil union or marriage that creates it and, as a result, a stepparent may be eligible to enter into a civil union with his or her stepchild under \u00a7 46b-38aa et seq. but, paradoxically, unable to consummate that union under our construction of \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2). We reject this claim in light of this court\u2019s conclusion, as reflected in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>State, </em>6 Law Rptr. 452 (Conn. 1843), that the stepparent-stepchild relationship does not survive the dissolution of the marriage by which it was created for purposes of the crime of incest.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See id., 456 (trial court determined, consistent with this court\u2019s resolution of reserved question of law, that for purposes of crime of incest, stepparent-stepchild relationship ends with dissolution of marriage).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Pursuant to <em>Wilson, </em>the affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>nal relationship between a stepparent and a stepchild terminates with the dissolution of the stepparent\u2019s marriage and, consequently, a former stepparent legally may enter into a civil union or a marital relationship with his or her former stepchild under \u00a7\u00a7 46b-21 or 46b-38cc, and legally may consummate that union under \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, our construction of \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (2) is neither absurd nor unworkable, but, rather, comports with the intent of the legislature as manifested by the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\"> We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issues: \u201c1.

We conclude, however, that whereas \u00a7 46b-38ec only delineates the degrees of kindred within which a civil union is void, \u00a7 46b-21 serves a dual purpose in that it delineates the degrees of kindred within which a marriage is void and, also, by virtue of its incorporation into \u00a7 53a-72a (2), the degrees of kindred within which sexual intercourse is prohibited. Accordingly, the stepparent and stepchild relationship explicitly is included in \u00a7 46b-21, even though a stepparent and stepchild legally may not marry given the stepparent\u2019s preexisting marriage, because it is a degree of kindred within which sexual intercourse is prohibited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b571-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-40 (a) provides: \u201cA marriage is dissolved only by (1) the death of one of the parties or (2) a decree of annulment or dissolution of the marriage by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d Additionally, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-38oo provides in relevant part that \u201c[w]herever in the general statutes . . . the term \u2018marriage\u2019 is used or defined, a civil union shall be included in such use or definition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b571-6\"> In <em>Wilson, </em>the defendant was charged and convicted of the crime of incest for cohabiting with the daughter of his deceased wife. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 6 L. Eptr. 452. The defendant filed a writ of error and a bill of exceptions in the Superior Court challenging his conviction, claiming that \u201c[t]he affinity with [his stepdaughter] ceased on the death of [his] wife. It <em>came </em>by marriage, and <em>went </em>with the marriage.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 454. Following oral argument, the trial court, \u201creserved the cause for the advise of the other judges of the supreme court, at their annual meeting in November . . . .\u201d Id., 456. Thereafter, the trial court issued its memorandum of decision: \u201cI have consulted with my brethren of Hie supreme court; and we are of opinion that . . . [t]he affinity between the [defendant] and [his stepdaughter] was dissolved by the death of her mother. The judgment of the court below must therefore be reversed on the ground that the acts charged do not constitute the crime of incest.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The defendant claims that this court overruled <em>Wilson </em>in <em>Lavieri </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>184 Conn. 380, 383-86, 439 A.2d 1012 (1981), wherein we concluded that, for purposes of the succession tax; see General Statutes \u00a7 12-344; the stepparent-stepchild relationship survives the dissolution of the marriage by which it was created. We reject this claim. In <em>Lavieri, </em>we noted that \u201cthe context in which the \u2018step\u2019 relationship is involved is crucial\u201d and, therefore, explicitly \u201climit[ed] our holding to questions involving the succession tax and stepchildren.\u201d <em>Lavieri </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Reve</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>nue Services, </em>supra, 384. Indeed, we observed that, \u201c[i]n other contexts the \u2018step\u2019 relationship may or may not continue after the termination of the marriage which created it\u201d and, as an example, pointed to <em>Wilson, </em>wherein \u201c[t]he court held that the affinity between the defendant and the stepdaughter was dissolved by the death of her mother.\u201d Id.; see also <em>Remington </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>35 Conn. App. 581, 587, 646 A.2d 266 (1994) (\u201cthe survival of affinal relationships depends on the context in which they are asserted\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\"> We need not reconsider this conclusion to resolve the present appeal and, therefore, we do not do so. We note, however, that various scholarly commentators have criticized the conclusion that the affinal relationship between a stepparent and a stepchild conclusively terminates with the dissolution of the stepparent\u2019s marriage because a dependency relationship between the stepparent and stepchild may continue to exist. See, e.g., C. Bratt, \u201cIncest Statutes and the Fundamental Right of Marriage: Is Oedipus Free to Many?\u201d 18 Fam. L.Q. 257, 290-91 (1984) (arguing that prohibition on incest should not be based on marital status, but, rather, on whether family members are part of same household unit); note, \u201cInbred Obscurity: Improving Incest Laws in the Shadow of the \u2018Sexual Family,\u2019 \u201d 119 Harv. L. Rev. 2464, 2475 (2006) (arguing that prohibition on incest should not be based on marital status, but, rather \u201con a more straightforward inquiry into whether a dependency relationship [persists between the stepparent and the stepchild] regardless of technical family status\u201d). We point out that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1) (D) addresses the concern of these scholarly commentators, at least in part, because it prohibits an actor from engaging in sexual contact with an individual who is less than eighteen years old if the actor is \u201csuch other person\u2019s guardian or otherwise responsible for the general supervision of such other person\u2019s welfare . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
