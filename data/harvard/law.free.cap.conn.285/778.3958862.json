The named defendant, the city of New Haven (city),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied the plaintiff, Martha Vincent, health insurance coverage after her husband, Edwin Vincent (decedent), died of a work-related injury to his heart. The plaintiff contested the city\u2019s denial of coverage, claiming that, because she had been entitled to and was receiving health insurance coverage at the city\u2019s expense prior to the decedent\u2019s death pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-284b,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> she also was entitled to such coverage after the decedent\u2019s death. The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the third district (commissioner) agreed with the plaintiff that, under General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>31-306,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the city was required to provide her with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>same health insurance coverage to which she had been entitled prior to the decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision, and the city appealed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the plaintiff is not entitled to health insurance benefits under \u00a7 31-306, and, therefore, we reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The relevant facts and procedural history are undisputed. The decedent was employed by the city as a police officer. On October 10, 1990, the decedent suffered an injury to his heart<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and filed a claim for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c. The city accepted the claim and, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 31-284b, provided the decedent and the plaintiff with group health insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">On September 3, 1991, the decedent died as a result of his heart injury. The plaintiff, the decedent\u2019s sole dependent, entered into an agreement with the city pursuant to which the city accepted the plaintiffs claim for survivor\u2019s benefits under \u00a7 31-306. The city, however, contested liability for continuing health insurance coverage, claiming that, under the plain language of \u00a7 31-306, an employer is not required to provide health insurance coverage to the surviving dependent of a deceased employee. Concluding that he was bound by prior precedent of the board; see <em>Weymouth </em>v. <em>Police Dept., </em>No. 4550, CRB-1-02-7 (April 3, 2003) (holding that \u00a7 31-306 applies to surviving dependents of deceased employees); <em>Sansone </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>No. 3885, CRB-01-98-9 (November 18, 1999) (same); the commissioner ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The city appealed from the decision of the commissioner to the board, which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">On appeal from the decision of the board, the city maintains that its obligation under \u00a7 31-284b to provide the plaintiff with health insurance coverage terminated upon the decedent\u2019s death because \u00a7 31-306 plainly and unambiguously limits a surviving dependent\u2019s benefits to burial expenses and weekly compensation calculated as a percentage of the deceased employee\u2019s earnings. We agree with the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">We note preliminarily that the issue raised in this appeal, namely, whether the plaintiff is entitled to continued health insurance coverage under \u00a7 31-306 following the death of the decedent, \u201cis one of statutory construction. . . . Because the relevant aspects of this statute have been subjected neither to previous judicial scrutiny nor to a time-tested interpretation by the board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>we afford no special deference to the conclusion of the board.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> . . . Instead, we exercise the plenary review [that] we otherwise apply to such questions of law. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter ....</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">\u201cMoreover, [i]n applying these general principles, we are mindful that the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.] indisputably is areme-dial statute that should be construed generously to accomplish its purpose. . . . The humanitarian and remedial purposes of the act counsel against an overly narrow construction that unduly limits eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation. . . . Accordingly, [i]n construing workers\u2019 compensation law, we must resolve statutory ambiguities or lacunae in a manner that will further the remedial purpose of the act. . . . [T]he purposes of the act itself are best served by allowing the remedial legislation a reasonable sphere of operation considering those purposes.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pizzuto </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mental Retardation, </em>283 Conn. 257, 264-65, 927 A.2d 811 (2007). With these principles in mind, we turn to the relevant statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Under General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-306 (b), \u201c [compensation shall be paid [to dependents] on account of death resulting from an accident arising out of and in the course of employment or from an occupational disease <em>as follows: </em>(1) . . . four thousand dollars for burial expenses . . . [and] (2) [t]o those wholly dependent upon the deceased employee at the time of his injury, a weekly compensation equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the average weekly earnings of the deceased at the time of injury . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) These two payments \u2014 a payment for burial expenses and a weekly payment based on a percentage of the deceased employee\u2019s average weekly earnings \u2014 represent the only compensation to which a surviving dependent is entitled under the express language of \u00a7 31-306. The statute makes no mention of an entitlement to any other benefits, including health insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The plaintiff nevertheless claims that \u00a7 31-306 is ambiguous and that the ambiguity must be resolved in her favor in light of the beneficent purposes of the act. The plaintiff relies on two separate but related arguments to support her claim of ambiguity. First, the plaintiff refers to General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (4),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>defines \u201c \u2018[c]ompensation\u2019 \u201d for purposes of the act as \u201cbenefits or payments mandated by the provisions of [the act], including, but not limited to . . . payments made under the provisions of section 31-284b . . . .\u201d The plaintiff contends that, because \u201cpayments made under the provisions of [\u00a7] 31-284b\u201d include health insurance benefits for dependents; see <em>Tufaro </em>v. <em>Pep-peridge Farm, Inc., </em>24 Conn. App. 234, 239, 587 A.2d 1044 (1991) (\u00a7 31-284b includes benefits for dependents); the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201ccompensation\u201d in \u00a7 31-306 reasonably may be interpreted as signifying an intent to include health insurance benefits within the purview of that statutory provision. Second, the plaintiff relies on General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-284b (a), which provides that an employer who provides health insurance coverage to its employees must continue to provide such coverage to injured employees \u201c[i]n order to maintain, as nearly as possible, the income of employees who suffer employment-related injuries . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In essence, the plaintiff maintains that it is reasonable to read the remedial purpose of \u00a7 31-284b, which refers only to <em>employees, </em>into \u00a7 31-306, which refers only to <em>surviving dependents </em>of employees, and that doing so imports ambiguity into \u00a7 31-306. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>plaintiff notes, since the board\u2019s decision in <em>Sansone,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the board has relied on this rationale in concluding that \u201cthe ambiguous interplay\u201d of these statutory provisions \u201cshould be construed to allow the [surviving dependent] to receive . . . health insurance coverage as part of her survivor\u2019s benefits.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Vincent <em>v. New Haven, </em>No. 4919, CRB-3-05-1 (January 13, 2006), quoting <em>Sansone </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>supra, No. 3885. We conclude that neither \u00a7 31-275 nor \u00a7 31-284b supports the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 31-306 reasonably may be construed to require an employer to provide health insurance coverage to a surviving dependent of a deceased employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">First, we reject the plaintiffs contention that \u00a7 31-275 (4), which defines \u201ccompensation\u201d to include health insurance coverage, affords a basis for concluding that \u00a7 31-306 requires the city to continue to provide the plaintiff with such coverage following the death of the decedent. General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 expressly provides that its definition of compensation shall apply throughout the act \u201cunless the context otherwise provides . . . .\u201d \u201cBy adding the phrase \u2018unless the context otherwise provides,\u2019 the legislature recognized that in some cases the circumstances under which the statute is being applied control the meaning of the term \u2018compensation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 352, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992) <em>(Covello, J., </em>dissenting). Section 31-306 presents one such example: for purposes of that section, the term \u201ccompensation\u201d is expressly limited to payments for burial expenses and weekly payments that represent a percentage of the deceased employee\u2019s average weekly earnings. To construe \u00a7 31-306 otherwise would require us to ignore the express statutory directive regarding the specific compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>to be paid under that provision. See <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 101, 653 A.2d 782 (1995) (\u201c[ujnless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended the list to be exclusive\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Indeed, when the legislature intends for a list to be illustrative rather than exhaustive, it knows how to express that intent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 31-284b (a) (defining \u201c \u2018income\u2019 \u201d as \u201call forms of remuneration . . . <em>including </em>wages\u201d [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (4) (defining \u201c \u2018[compensation\u2019 \u201d as \u201cbenefits or payments mandated by the provisions of [the act], <em>including, but not limited to, </em>indemnity, medical and surgical aid\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">We also disagree with the plaintiff that \u00a7 31-306 is ambiguous in light of \u00a7 31-284b, which provides that an injured employee who is receiving compensation under the act is entitled to the same health insurance benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>to which he was entitled prior to the injury. The plaintiff claims that the legislature\u2019s <em>reason </em>for that requirement, that is, \u201cto maintain, as nearly as possible, the income of employees who suffer employment-related injuries\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-284b (a); applies with equal force to the surviving dependents of deceased employees, and, therefore, \u00a7 31-306 should be construed to include the continued health coverage that is required under \u00a7 31-284b (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The plaintiffs contention, however, is contrary to the straightforward language of both of those statutory provisions. Section 31-284b provides that an employer shall continue to \u201cprovide to [the] <em>employee </em>equivalent insurance coverage . . . while the <em>employee </em>is eligible to receive or is receiving . . . compensation . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-284b (a); see <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>61 Conn. App. 9, 16-17, 762 A.2d 480 (2000) (\u00a7 31-284b requires employer \u201cto continue insurance benefits only while an employee is receiving \u2018compensation payments\u2019 for disability under the [act]\u201d), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 933, 767 A.2d 104 (2001). Thus, \u00a7 31-284b (a) refers only to \u201cemployees\u201d and contains no reference either to deceased employees or to their surviving dependents.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although \u00a7 31-306 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>does pertain to the surviving dependents of deceased employees, it does not mention or refer to health insurance. The plaintiffs claim, therefore, derives no support from the statutoiy language on which that claim is predicated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">The plaintiff contends that construing \u00a7 31-306 to deny her the right to continued health insurance following the decedent\u2019s death leads to a harsh result that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>inconsistent with the humanitarian purposes of the act. We agree, of course, that the act is remedial in nature and must be construed broadly to that end. We also agree that any ambiguities should be resolved in a manner that furthers, rather than thwarts, the act\u2019s remedial purposes. We are not free, however, to create ambiguity when none exists; in other words, we cannot \u201caccomplish a result that is contrary to the intent of the legislature as expressed in the act\u2019s plain language.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>247 Conn. 126, 137 n.16, 717 A.2d 747 (1998). As we recently have reiterated, \u201ca court must construe a statute as written. . . . Courts may not by construction supply omissions ... or add exceptions merely because it appears that good reasons exist for adding them. . . . The intent of the legislature, as this court has repeatedly observed, is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. ... It is axiomatic that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is a function of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>279 Conn. 207, 216, 901 A.2d 673 (2006); see also <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>241 Conn. 692, 697, 699 A.2d 52 (1997) (\u201c [although the parties . . . called . . . attention to the public policy implications of [the] case, the issue presented [was], at bottom, a matter of statutory construction\u201d). Thus, no matter how sympathetic or deserving the plaintiff may appear to be, it is the province of the legislature, not this court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>to determine whether \u00a7 31-306 ought to include health insurance coverage.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The decision of the board is reversed and the case is remanded to the board with direction to reverse the decision of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">In this opinion KATZ, VERTEFEUILLE and ZARE-LLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\"> Connecticut Interlocal Risk Management Agency, the city\u2019s heart and hypertension administrator, also is a defendant.

It is undisputed that whether \u00a7 31-306 entitles a surviving dependent to continued health insurance coverage is an issue that previously has not been the subject of judicial review.

To satisfy the time-tested requirement of the rule according deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, that interpretation must formally have been articulated and applied \u201cover a long period of time . . . .\u201d <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>208 Conn. 709, 719, 546 A.2d 830 (1988); see also <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Municipal Employees Assn., </em>259 Conn. 251, 262, 788 A.2d 60 (2002) (deference accorded agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of statute only when agency has followed that interpretation \u201cfor an extended period of time\u201d). Because <em>Sansone </em>is a relatively recent decision, we cannot say that the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 31-306 is sufficiently long-standing to warrant judicial deference, especially in view of the fact that the board has applied this interpretation only in two previous cases. See <em>Christopher R. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mental Retardation, </em>277 Conn. 594, 603 n.9, 893 A.2d 431 (2006) (two \u201cisolated\u201d agency decisions over twenty-three year period is not \u201ca time-tested interpretation\u201d); cf. <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>244 Conn. 378, 390 n.18, 709 A.2d 1116 (1998) (observing that agency interpretation of \u201c[f]our years hardly constitutes a \u2018time-tested\u2019 agency interpretation\u201d). Moreover, because we conclude that the statute is not ambiguous, the board\u2019s interpretation would not prevail in any event. See <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, 719 (rule of deference applies only when agency \u201chas consistently followed its construction over a long period of time, <em>the statutory language is ambiguous, </em>and the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.

In <em>Cappellino, </em>we held that the surviving dependent spouse was entitled to receive the unpaid balance of certain permanent partial disability benefits that had been awarded to her husband prior to his death from a cause unrelated to his employment. Id., 571-72, 574. <em>Cappellino </em>is distinguishable from the present case because it did not involve surviving dependent benefits under \u00a7 31-306. More importantly, in <em>Cappellino, </em>we concluded that the surviving spouse was entitled to her husband\u2019s unpaid disability benefits, despite the absence of any provision expressly mandating the payment of those benefits to a surviving dependent, because, under General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-302, \u201cpermanent partial disability awards may be commuted into lump sums and placed in trust for the benefit of the employee and his or her dependents.\u201d Id., 575-76. We reasoned that, \u201c[i]f, upon commutation, the right of survivorship in the award . . . would pass to dependents, it would be a wholly unreasonable construction of the [a]ct to hold that if commutation were not made, survivorship would not pass to the dependents.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 576. In light of the different statutory provisions at issue in <em>Cappellino, </em>our decision and analysis in that case have no bearing on our resolution of the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\"> The plaintiff contends that <em>Tufaro </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farm, Inc., </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 234, supports her claim that she is entitled to health insurance benefits notwithstanding that the relevant statutory provisions contain no reference to dependents of employees. In <em>Tufaro, </em>the Appellate Court concluded that, under General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-284b, which is identical to the version of \u00a7 31-284b applicable in the present case, i.e., the revision of 1989, an employer must continue to provide insurance not only to the injured employee but also to that employee\u2019s dependents, even though \u00a7 31-284b refers only to employees. <em>Tufaro </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farm, Inc., </em>supra, 239. The court\u2019s conclusion was predicated on the fact that the express \u201cobjective of [\u00a7 31-284b] is to maintain all forms of an employee\u2019s income\u201d; id.; and that, under General Statutes \u00a7 31-284b (a), \u201c \u2018income\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201call forms of remuneration,\u201d including health insurance coverage and contributions to an employee welfare plan \u201cestablished or maintained for employees or their families or dependents ... for medical . . . benefits.\u201d <em>Tufaro </em>is inapposite to the present case because the employee in <em>Tufaro </em>clearly fell within the purview of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-284b, and the task of the Appellate Court was to determine, in light of the ambiguous statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>language, whether payments for dependent\u2019s benefits constituted \u201cincome\u201d of an employee under that statute. The decedent in the present case, however, is not an employee within the meaning of \u00a7 31-284b, and, therefore, the ambiguity that the court in <em>Tufaro </em>resolved in favor of the employee is not relevant to the present case. More fundamentally, <em>Tufaro </em>did not involve the statutory provision at issue in this case, namely, \u00a7 31-306, which unambiguously delimits the benefits to which the surviving dependent of a deceased employee is entitled. As we have explained, the benefits identified in \u00a7 31-306 do not include health insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\"> The plaintiff urges us to apply the doctrine of legislative acquiescence to the decisions of the board that the surviving dependent of a deceased employee is entitled to health insurance benefits. See <em>Weymouth </em>v. <em>Police Dept., </em>supra, No. 4550; <em>Sansone </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>supra, No. 3885. Under that doctrine, the legislature\u2019s failure to amend a statutory provision in response to a definitive interpretation of the provision may be viewed as evidence of legislative agreement with that interpretation. E.g., <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Sullivan Associates, 250 </em>Conn. 763, 783, 739 A.2d 238 (1999) (\u201c[t]he legislature is presumed to be aware of the interpretation of a statute and ... its subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that interpretation\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Although, normally, the doctrine is applicable when the legislature fails to amend a statute within a reasonable period of time following this court\u2019s interpretation of the provision at issue; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. <em>338, </em>427-28, 857 A.2d 808 (2004) (legislative inaction following this court\u2019s interpretation of statute may be viewed as legislative acquiescence in that interpretation), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005); we also have applied the rule of legislative acquiescence to administrative interpretations of statutes. E.g., <em>Berkley </em>v. <em>Gavin, </em>253 Conn. 761, 780, 756 A.2d 248 (2000). We decline to do so in the present case, however, for the same reason that we have concluded that the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 31-306 is not entitled to judicial deference, that is, because that interpretation is of relatively recent vintage and of relatively infrequent application. See footnote 8 of this opinion. Accordingly, we believe that it is too soon to draw any firm conclusion from legislative inaction, especially in view of the possibility that the pendency of this appeal itself may have provided the legislature with a reason to refrain from taking any action in response to the decisions of the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\"> Thus, the principle of statutory construction that instructs us to construe the act broadly to achieve its remedial purpose does not guide us in the present case because that principle is applicable only when the statutory language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation or when the text of the statute, although plain and unambiguous, yields absurd or unworkable results. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z. In the present case, the governing statutory language is neither ambiguous nor leads to an absurd or unworkable result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b813-9\"> The plaintiff also maintains that construing \u00a7 31-306 to deprive her of the right to continued health insurance coverage would place that provision in constitutional jeopardy under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. Specifically, she claims that there is no rational justification for denying health insurance benefits to the surviving dependents of deceased employees when the dependents of living employees are entitled to receive the same benefits. \u201cThis court has held, in accordance with the federal constitutional framework of analysis, that in areas of social and economic policy that neither proceed along suspect lines nor infringe fundamental constitutional rights, the [e]qual [protection [cjlause is satisfied [as] long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification . . . the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the governmental decisionmaker . . . and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim </em>Co., 263 Conn. 328, 342, 819 A.2d 803 (2003). Under the act, the weekly compensation payment made to an employee who is unable to work is the same as the weekly compensation payment made to the surviving dependent of the employee upon his death. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7\u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) and 31-307 (a). Thus, we may presume that, before his death, the employee used that payment to support <em>both </em>himself <em>and </em>his dependent; following the employee\u2019s death, the dependent would have that same weekly payment to support <em>herself only. </em>In such circumstances, the legislature reasonably could have concluded that the payment received by the surviving dependent \u2014 in addition to any life insurance benefits that the dependent may have received in accordance with \u00a7 31-284b (a) \u2014 is sufficient to meet the dependent\u2019s needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b813-8\">BORDEN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Av4\">concurring.

Therefore, the statutory language is ambiguous. <em>Viera </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>283 Conn. 412, 421, 927 A.2d 843 (2007) (\u201c[t]he test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Genesky </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>275 Conn. 246, 278, 881 A.2d 114 (2005) <em>(Borden, J., </em>concurring) (\u201cif the text of the statute at issue, considering its relationship to other statutes, as applied to the facts of the case, would permit more than one likely or plausible meaning, its meaning cannot be said to be \u2018plain and unambiguous\u2019 \u201d). Nonetheless, I would also conclude that, despite this ambiguity, the extratextual source of the meaning of the language on which the plaintiff relies, namely, the statutory scheme\u2019s remedial purpose, is not enough to overcome the strong suggestion of the text that, as the majority opinion aptly demonstrates, health benefits are not included in \u00a7 31-306. I therefore agree that the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
