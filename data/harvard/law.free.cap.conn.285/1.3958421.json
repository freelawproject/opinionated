On appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in this action alleging breach of contract and violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., because, inter alia: (1) grounds did not exist to terminate the plaintiff \u201cfor cause\u201d under the relevant provisions of the physician agreement that governed the parties\u2019 relationship (agreement), regardless of the fact that it also contains a separate \u201cwithout cause\u201d termination provision; and (2) the termination of the plaintiff violated CUTPA in that it unfairly deprived the greater Bridgeport area of one of its few bilingual physicians, despite the fact that the medical care provided by the plaintiff was deemed appropriate. We disagree with these claims, and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and procedural history. The defendant is a health maintenance organization that has established a network of health care providers available to render medical services to its enrollees (network). A physician who applies to become a \u201cparticipating physician\u201d in the network must meet the defendant\u2019s credentials criteria for participating and covering physicians (credentials criteria) and be approved by its credentialing committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">In 1998, the plaintiff applied to join the network of Physicians Health Services, Inc., the defendant\u2019s corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>rate predecessor. After the credentialing committee for Physicians Health Services, Inc., approved the plaintiffs application to join the network, the parties executed the agreement, which had been predrafted and was not subject to further negotiation, to govern their relationship. Among other provisions governing the parties\u2019 relationship, \u00a7 2.2 of the agreement required the plaintiff to \u201ccooperate in and be bound and abide by all the programs, protocols, rules and regulations\u201d prescribed in the Office Manual (manual).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant distributes the manual, which it revises at its sole discretion from time to time, to all participating physicians, and it provides procedures for billing, referrals and authorizations, utilization review, quality assessment, medical policies and coding guidelines. The manual states further that participating physicians may be sanctioned for breaches of \u201c[q]uality and/or [a]dministrative standards,\u201d and that the available sanctions may include termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The agreement also includes provisions governing the termination of the parties\u2019 relationship, both \u201c[w]ithout [c]ause\u201d and \u201c[f]or [c]ause.\u201d The \u201c[without [cjause\u201d provision states that the agreement may be terminated \u201cat any time, by either party by written notice to the other party [ninety] days in advance of the date of termination stated in the notice. It is expressly understood that this provision may apply and that [the defendant] may terminate this [agreement upon [ninety] days\u2019 written notice for any reason, including <em>without limitation, </em>restructuring the network of providers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>failure of [the] [p]hysician to be recredentialed by [the defendant] in accordance with its credentialing criteria . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) In contrast, the \u201c[f]or [c]ause\u201d provision states that the agreement may be terminated pursuant to that section with sixty days notice for a variety of enumerated reasons, including, for example, the physician\u2019s absence from the defendant\u2019s service area for a \u201cmaterial\u201d period of time, the physician\u2019s insolvency or failure to maintain adequate licensure or liability insurance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>provisions include \u201c[d]ue [p]rocess [protocols\u201d that provide for an \u201cappeal [of] the termination decision in accordance with the due process procedures set forth in the [manual].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">In 2000, following allegations that he had behaved in an inappropriate manner during the examinations and treatment of three different female patients on multiple occasions during 1997, the plaintiff entered into a consent order with the department that placed his license on probationary status for three years, until April, 2003.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The consent order recited that the plaintiff, although admitting no guilt or wrongdoing, nevertheless had \u201cchosen not to contest\u201d those allegations, and thus the department never was required to prove them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The consent order did not \u201crestrict or impair\u201d the plaintiffs ability to practice medicine, other than to require him to have a female present \u201cduring any examination or treatment of a disrobed or partially disrobed female patient.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The department subsequently notified the defendant that it had placed the plaintiffs license on probationary status.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Thereafter, in August, 2001, Mike Oesau, the defendant\u2019s medical director, sent a letter to the plaintiff terminating his membership in the network, effective ninety days from the receipt of that letter. The letter informed the plaintiff that \u201cyou no longer meet the credentials criteria for participation\u201d since \u201cyou have a probationary status on your medical license and your license is permanently restricted . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The letter advised the plaintiff that he could appeal the termina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>tion in writing pursuant to procedures set forth in the manual.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Thereafter, the plaintiff took an internal appeal from the defendant\u2019s decision to terminate him from the network, and the defendant notified the plaintiff that his appeal would be heard by a panel of three physicians, specifically Robert Willig, a medical director for the defendant, and two out-of-state physicians, Scott Breidbart and Stephen Friedhoff. The plaintiff did not know that Breidbart and Friedhoff, who resided out of state, were employees of the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">In November, 2001, the panel heard the appeal at the defendant\u2019s office in Shelton. Willig was physically present at the hearing, but Breidbart and Friedhoff participated by telephone without objection from the plaintiff.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff testified before the panel, and his counsel addressed the panel and submitted documentary evidence. The plaintiff described his reasons for entering into the consent order with the department, the factual circumstances giving rise to those cases, and the nature and scope of his practice. The panel then deliberated over two days, and voted unanimously to uphold the defendant\u2019s decision to terminate the plaintiff.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this action alleging that the defendant had breached the agreement when it terminated his network participation, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive relief and attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The plaintiff also alleged that, because the defendant\u2019s policies and credentials criteria were silent about the effect of probationary status, and the appeals process was a sham, the defendant had violated CUTPA by terminating him. After the trial court, <em>Thim, J., </em>denied the plaintiffs motion for a temporary injunction, the defendant moved, and the plaintiff cross moved, for summary judgment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-44 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The trial court, <em>Hiller, J., </em>concluded that the defendant properly had terminated the plaintiffs network membership pursuant to the unambiguous language of the agreement\u2019s \u201c \u2018without cause\u2019 \u201d provision because it had given the plaintiff the requisite ninety days notice, and the clause permits termination for \u201c \u2018any reason.\u2019 \u201d The trial court also concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact with respect to the plaintiffs CUTPA claim because the defendant had followed all of its appeal procedures and the appeal process was not \u201cunfair, deceptive, immoral or unethical.\u201d Accordingly, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and denied the plaintiffs cross motion for summary judgment. The trial court then denied the plaintiffs motion for reargument, and rendered judgment accordingly. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u201cAs a preliminary matter, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. In seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>nonexistence of any issue of fact. The courts are in entire agreement that the moving party for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law. The courts hold the movant to a strict standard. To satisfy his burden the movant must make a showing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that excludes any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact. ... As the burden of proof is on the movant, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opponent. . . . When documents submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment fail to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact, the non-moving party has no obligation to submit documents establishing the existence of such an issue. . . . Once the moving party has met its burden, however, the opposing patty must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue. ... It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact . . . are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court under Practice Book \u00a7 [17-45]. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant [a] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Zielinski </em>v. <em>Kotsoris, </em>279 Conn. 312, 318-19, 901 A.2d 1207 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">We begin with the plaintiffs claim that the defendant breached the agreement by terminating him in violation of the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision. The plaintiff contends that the availability of the appeal process indicates that his termination had to have occurred under that clause, rather than the \u201cwithout cause\u201d provision because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>under the agreement, a terminated physician has no right to appeal unless the termination is \u201cfor cause.\u201d Thus, the plaintiff argues that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendant had not breached the agreement because \u201cfor cause\u201d terminations are available only for certain enumerated reasons, none of which includes the physician\u2019s license having been placed on probationary status.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In sum, the plaintiff contends that the defendant\u2019s interpretation renders the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision meaningless because the defendant\u2019s rationale would give it \u201cthe absolute right to terminate any physician from its network, upon [ninety] days notice, and . . . the physician would have no recourse.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In response, the defendant contends that the \u201cplain language of the . . . agreement permitted termination \u2018for any reason,\u2019 \u201d with the requisite ninety days notice under the \u201c \u2018without cause\u2019 \u201d provision. The defendant argues that it is undisputed that the plaintiff received ninety days notice, and that \u201cno facts support the contention that [it] terminated [the plaintiff] under the \u2018for cause\u2019 provision . . . .\u201d It emphasizes that there is a difference between having a \u201creason\u201d to terminate the agreement, as opposed to terminating the agreement \u201c \u2018for cause.\u2019 \u201d Indeed, the defendant notes that the plaintiffs construction \u201cdefies common sense,\u201d and that the \u201c \u2018without cause\u2019 \u201d provision itself gives specific reasons for such termination, which makes clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>its applicability is not limited only to terminations for no reason at all. Moreover, the defendant notes that an appeal is available for termination under either provision, and that the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision is not surplusage because, in comparison, it: (1) may only be invoked by the defendant; (2) permits the defendant to provide less notice to the physician; and (3) permits the defendant to suspend a physician immediately in certain circumstances. We agree with the defendant\u2019s construction of the agreement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The law governing the construction of contracts is well settled. \u201cWhen a party asserts a claim that challenges the trial court\u2019s construction of a contract, we must first ascertain whether the relevant language in the agreement is ambiguous. ... A contract is ambiguous if the intent of the parties is not clear and certain from the language of the contract itself. . . . Accordingly, any ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms. . . . When the language of a contract is ambiguous, the determination of the parties\u2019 intent is a question of fact . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>David M. Somers &amp; Associates, P. C. </em>v. <em>Busch, </em>283 Conn. 396, 402-403, 927 A.2d 832 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Similarly, \u201c[w]e accord the language employed in the contract a rational construction based on its common, natural and ordinary meaning and usage as applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language is unambiguous, we must give the contract effect according to its terms. . . . Where the language is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ambiguous, however, we must construe those ambiguities against the drafter.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Can-tonbury Heights Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Local Land Development, LLC, </em>273 Conn. 724, 735, 873 A.2d 898 (2005). Moreover, in construing contracts, we give effect to all the language included therein, as \u201cthe law of contract interpretation . . . militates against interpreting a contract in a way that renders a provision superfluous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wesley </em>v. <em>Schaller Subaru, Inc., </em>277 Conn. 526, 546, 893 A.2d 389 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the defendant properly terminated the plaintiffs membership pursuant to the agreement\u2019s \u201cwithout cause\u201d provision. This provision is plain and unambiguous, and permits the defendant to terminate the agreement \u201cupon [ninety] days\u2019 written notice for <em>any reason, </em>including <em>without limitation, </em>restructuring the network of providers and failure of [p]hysician to be recredentialed by [the defendant] in accordance with its credentialing criteria, and even though grievance, discipline or termination proceedings of any kind may then be pending against [p]hysician.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This broad and inclusive language, specifically the use of the word \u201cany,\u201d gives the defendant expansive rights with respect to the membership status of its network physicians. See, e.g., <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Golenbock, </em>238 Conn. 183, 196, 680 A.2d 1243 (1996) (describing arbitration clause governing \u201c \u2018[a]ny disputes arising under [the employment agreement]\u2019 \u201d as having language that is \u201call-embracing, all-encompassing and broad\u201d); cf. <em>Beizer v. Goepfert, </em>28 Conn. App. 693, 699, 613 A.2d 1336 (quoting dictionary definition of \u201c \u2018[a]ny\u2019 \u201d in concluding that \u201cphrase \u2018any contract action\u2019 also lends itself to a broad construction of what claims are included\u201d under attorney trial referee statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-549n), cert. denied, 224 Conn. 901, 615 A.2d 1044 (1992), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>cert. denied, 507 U.S. 973, 113 S. Ct. 1416, 122 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Indeed, this reading of the agreement does not render the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision superfluous. That section is far more draconian for the physician than is the \u201cwithout cause\u201d provision, and is more limited in its applicability. It is available only in nine discrete factual situations, including when a physician \u201cfail[s] to maintain adequate licensure, certification, qualification or liability insurance,\u201d is \u201cconvicted of or pleads nolo con-tendere to a criminal offense,\u201d or that the physician\u2019s continued participation \u201cmay pose an imminent threat to the health or well-being of any [m]ember . . . .\u201d See footnote 5 of this opinion. This clause also permits the defendant to remove a physician from its network far more expediently than the \u201cwithout cause\u201d provision because it allows termination with thirty days fewer notice, and also provides for the immediate suspension of a physician for certain specified violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Moreover, the fact that the plaintiff was offered an appeal does not render the termination one \u201cfor cause,\u201d because the appeals provisions set forth in both the agreement and the manual are triggered by \u201ctermination decisionfs],\u201d not \u201ctermination decisions <em>for cause.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) See footnotes 6 and 11 of this opinion. Indeed, under the manual, there is no entitlement to an appeal for all of the \u201cfor cause\u201d terminations, as the appeals procedure, incoiporated by reference into the agreement, provides that \u201c[t]ermination shall be immediate upon notice, and this Appeals process will NOT apply in cases involving: Breach of contract for reasons other than (i) failure to follow quality standards, or (ii) failure to meet credentialing criteria . . . Risk of imminent harm to patient ... A determination of fraud ... A final disciplinary action by State licensing board or other governmental agency that impairs the Provider\u2019s ability to practice.\u201d Accordingly, we disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>with the plaintiffs arguments with respect to the significance of the appeals process provision because it is well settled that we \u201cwill not import terms into [an] agreement . . . that are not reflected in the contract.\u201d <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Capano, </em>241 Conn. 725, 732, 699 A.2d 68 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Finally, that the defendant had, and stated, a reason to terminate the plaintiff did not \u201ctransform\u201d the nature of the termination or otherwise deprive the defendant of the use of the \u201cwithout cause\u201d provision. \u201cThe ordinary meaning of a without cause provision is that it includes cause, no cause, or even a reason morally indefensible.\u201d <em>Biber </em>v. <em>Duplicator Sales &amp; Service, Inc., </em>155 S.W.3d 732, 735 (Ky. App. 2004) (concluding that \u201ctermination without cause\u201d provision in computer network consulting contract \u201cis not transformed into a \u2018for cause only\u2019 provision because the party terminating the contract notifies the other party that the contract is being terminated for cause\u201d); cf. <em>Wisehart </em>v. <em>Meganck, </em>66 P.3d 124, 129 (Colo. App. 2002) (rejecting argument that \u201calthough the bank had the right to terminate [the plaintiff] with or without cause and for any reason, the fact that it claimed to have terminated him with cause and for a specific reason transformed the employment relationship from at will to one in which he could only be terminated for good cause\u201d), cert. denied, 2003 Colo. LEXIS 265 (March 24, 2003). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to the plaintiffs breach of contract claims.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The plaintiff next contends that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to his CUTPA claim because the defendant\u2019s conduct during his termination, specifically the appeal process, was unfair and deceptive.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>defendant\u2019s \u201critualistic observance of the procedural niceties in terminating [him] (e.g., notice by registered mail, [ninety] days notice, etc.) does not cure the fundamental unfairness of its termination on grounds not recognized by the agreement and rubber-stamped by its own managerial employees. [The defendant] celebrates form over substance.\u201d The plaintiff further relies on our decision in <em>Owens </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>229 Conn. 592, 643 A.2d 233 (1994), a hospital privileges case, in support of the proposition that public policy favors fairness in the termination of physicians from insurers\u2019 provider networks, and maintains that public policy does not support his termination because the appeals panel concluded that he had provided appropriate medical care. The plaintiff contends further that these actions by the defendant caused \u201csubstantial injur[ies]\u201d to him and his patients because he is \u201cone of the few bilingual physicians in the [g]reater Bridgeport area, and the only Hispanic [physician] in the entire city of Stratford. Many of [the plaintiffs] former patients can no longer treat with [him], because their health care plans afford coverage only by physicians who are in [the defendant\u2019s] network of providers.\u201d In response, the defendant argues that, even if <em>Owens </em>is applicable in this context, the termination did not violate public policy because the defendant adhered to the plain and unambiguous terms of the agreement and the termination was founded on concerns for patient safety, given the events that led to the consent agreement with the department. The defendant also argues that, for the same reasons, the termination was not unfair or deceptive. We agree with the defendant, and conclude that the plaintiffs CUTPA claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u201c[General Statutes \u00a7] 42-110b (a) provides that [n]o person shall engage in unfair methods of competition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce. It is well settled that in determining whether a practice violates CUTPA we have adopted the criteria set out in the cigarette rule by the federal trade commission for determining when a practice is unfair: (1) [W]hether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise \u2014 in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers, [competitors or other businesspersons], ... All three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness. A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ventres </em>v. <em>Goodspeed Airport, LLC, </em>275 Conn. 105, 154-55, 881 A.2d 937 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1111, 126 S. Ct. 1913, 164 L. Ed. 2d 664 (2006). \u201cThus a violation of CUTPA may be established by showing either an actual deceptive practice ... or a practice amounting to a violation of public policy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Glazer </em>v. <em>Dress Barn, Inc., </em>274 Conn. 33, 82-83, 873 A.2d 929 (2005). \u201cIn order to enforce this prohibition, CUTPA provides a private cause of action to [a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a [prohibited] method, act or practice . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stevenson Lumber Co.-Suffield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chase Associates, Inc., </em>284 Conn. 205, 213-14, 932 A.2d 401 (2007), quoting General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s first CUTPA argument, namely, that the termination violated public policy as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>expressed in our decision in <em>Owens </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 592. In <em>Owens, </em>we concluded that \u201ca substantial compliance test ... is the proper test by which to measure whether a hospital has sufficiently complied with its bylaws in terminating a physician\u2019s medical staff privileges\u201d because of the \u201coverarching function that medical staff bylaws are designed to serve \u2014 the provision of quality medical care to the surrounding public community. . . . Medical staff bylaws reflect what the medical community considers to be crucial to the effective administration of the hospital and the provision of quality medical care by physicians whose performance has earned them privileges. At the same time, the procedural protocol of the bylaws provide, outside of the judicial system, a fair method for making decisions concerning staff privileges.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 604. We stated that \u201cthe obligation to follow medical staff bylaws is paramount and that a hospital must afford its medical staff all the process and protections encompassed by its bylaws,\u201d because that obligation \u201ccan stem from a contractual relationship between the hospital and the physician,\u201d \u201capreexisting legal duty imposed by our state department of health regulations,\u201d and \u201cthe public\u2019s substantial interest in the operation of hospitals, public or private.\u201d Id., 604-605. We emphasized that the \u201cpublic has an interest that staff decisions are not made arbitrarily. By requiring hospitals to adhere to their bylaws, the risk of arbitrary decisions is reduced.\u201d Id., 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Even if we were to assume, without deciding, that there is a public interest inherent in a health maintenance organization\u2019s decisions with respect to credentialing physicians and, therefore, that the agreement is analogous to the hospital bylaws contemplated in <em>Owens, </em>the plaintiffs claim fails.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We already have con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>eluded that the defendant did not breach the agreement in its termination of the plaintiff. See part I of this opinion. Thus, the defendant already has, at the very least, \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with its procedures under that agreement, and we will not interfere with the reviewing panel\u2019s exercise of discretion. See <em>Owens </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 606-607 (Noting that hospital \u201cdecisions concerning whether a physician is entitled to staff privileges should be left to the expertise of the hospital\u2019s staff and administration. The exercise of their discretion should be subject only to limited judicial surveillance to deteimine if the hospital substantially complied with its applicable bylaw procedures.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The plaintiff next argues that the termination was \u201c \u2018immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous\u2019 \u201d because the defendant cited the probationary status of his license as its reason and the appeals panel upheld the termination, despite the fact that the defendant had not terminated the membership of other physicians whose licenses had been placed on probation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>plaintiff states further that this action was as immoral and unethical as the breach of the agreement in the first place.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Ordinarily, \u201c[w]hether a practice is unfair and thus violates CUTPA is an issue of fact. . . .

Co., </em>269 Conn. 424, 434, 849 A.2d 382 (2004). In the present case, however, the plaintiffs claims fail as a matter of law because he has alleged nothing more than that, in terminating his membership, the defendant had availed itself of the rights afforded under the plain and unambiguous terms of the agreement, none of which was hidden or otherwise withheld from the plaintiff. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s appeals panel distinguished the plaintiffs case from that of other physicians whose licenses had been placed on probation because those other cases did not implicate patient safety.

Specifically, the plaintiff did not provide any information beyond a bald assertion in his brief that he is the only Spanish speaking physician in the city of Stratford, and that his removal from the defendant\u2019s network will leave significant numbers of Spanish speaking patients without access to medical care. Accordingly, because the plaintiff has failed to satisfy any criteria under the cigarette rule, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing his CUTPA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b23-7\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b23-8\"> At the request of the trial court, <em>Hiller, J., </em>the parties filed a joint statement of facts not in dispute, including the applicable contractual provisions, in connection with their summary judgment motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b24-6\"> Section 2.2 of the agreement requires the physician \u201cto cooperate in and be bound and abide by all the programs, protocols, rules and regulations set forth in the [manual] including, <em>without limitation, </em>[the defendant\u2019s] quality assurance program, <em>credentialing process, </em>[m] ember grievance system and utilization management program.

The covenant of good faith and fair dealing presupposes that the terms and purpose of the contract are agreed upon by the parties and that what is in dispute is a party\u2019s discretionary application or interpretation of a contract term. . . . To constitute a breach of [the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing], the acts by which a defendant allegedly impedes the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>right to receive benefits that he or she reasonably expected to receive under the contract must have been taken in bad faith.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Renaissance Management Co. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, </em>281 Conn. 227, 240, 915 A.2d 290 (2007). The trial court acknowledged, but did not address this claim, which the plaintiff renewed in his motion to reargue. Even if we were to assume that the plenary scope of review applicable to motions for summary judgment allows us t,o review the claim, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s failure to rale on it; see, e.g., <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>New London, </em>273 Conn. 786, 815 n.27, 873 A.2d 965 (2005); we nevertheless decline to address it because the plaintiffs brief is inadequate on this point. Specifically, the plaintiffs brief lacks any analysis beyond a single citation to the boilerplate law of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. There is no citation or discussion of any evidence in the record that would purport to support the plaintiffs claim of bad faith. See, e.g., <em>Rocque </em>v. <em>Northeast Utilities Service Co., </em>254 Conn. 78, 86-87, 755 A.2d 196 (2000) (claim lacking legal analysis or discussion of relevant \u201cfacts or evidence in the record\u201d is \u201cquintessential example of inadequate briefing of an appellate claim\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\"> The plaintiff also argues that the trial court improperly concluded that he had failed to \u201c[provide] any competent evidence that may be considered in opposition to [the defendant\u2019s] motion for summary judgment nor in support of [his] own cross motion for summary judgment because none of his submissions are authenticated.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Cogswell </em>v. <em>American Transit Ins.

The plaintiff argues that the trial court, therefore, dismissed his CUTPA claim sua sponte, \u201con technical grounds, without any substantive consideration of the documents supporting the motion,\u201d particularly because the defendant \u201cnever objected that the documents submitted by [the plaintiff] with his motion were not authenticated,\u201d and those same documents already had been submitted to the trial court in certified or authenticated form by the defendant. In response, the defendant contends that the trial court considered all of this evidence because \u201c1he relevant information contained in the documents that the trial court excluded already lay before the trial court through the parties\u2019 joint submission. Hence, the exclusion of the exhibits offered by [the plaintiff] was necessarily irrelevant.\u201d Because the trial court reached the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the plaintiffs CUTPA claim, and the plaintiff has not addressed any evidence that the trial court failed to consider that would otherwise have affected the outcome in this case, we decline to reach this claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\"> In his brief, the plaintiff cites several cases in support of the proposition that there is a public interest in the relationship between health maintenance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>organizations and their member physicians.
