The plaintiff, Jim\u2019s Auto Body, a sole proprietorship in Southington, appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court dismissing its administrative appeal from the decision of the defendant, the commissioner of the department, wherein the department concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>American Express Property Casualty Company (AMEX) was a customer of the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 14-63, and that the plaintiff had violated General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-65g (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 14-65i (b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 14-65j (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that AMEX was a customer entitled to file a complaint under \u00a7 14-63, and that the remainder of the department\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. On June 9, 2003, a 1999 Toyota Avalon XLS (vehicle), owned by Byron Speckmann and insured by AMEX, was damaged in an accident. Speck-mann chose the plaintiff to repair the vehicle, and on June 9, 2003, the plaintiff issued a \u201cvisible damage quotation\u201d estimating the repair costs to be $13,572.63. Speckmann brought the vehicle to the plaintiff for repair on June 17, 2003, and, on that date, signed a \u201cmotor vehicle repair estimate/waiver\u201d that was drafted by the plaintiff and contained both a \u201cwaiver of advance estimate\u201d (waiver) and an \u201cauthorization of additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>repairs\u201d (authorization). The waiver permitted the plaintiff to work on the vehicle without providing an advance estimate of repair costs, and authorized \u201creasonable and necessary cost[s] to remedy the problems complained of up to a maximum of $8,000. \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In contrast, the authorization allowed the plaintiff to negotiate directly with AMEX for more money \u201cif additional damage beyond the waiver estimate [was] discovered and related to the problem complained of . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">On June 20, 2003, AMEX appraised the vehicle through its agent, Complete Appraisal Service, LLC (Complete), which estimated the cost of the repairs to be $3954.21. The plaintiff and AMEX subsequently failed to reach an agreement about the necessary cost of repairs. On June 27, 2003, the plaintiff sent AMEX a \u201cNotice of Temporary Termination of Repairs,\u201d and halted repair of the vehicle, without Speckmann\u2019s consent, due to numerous unsuccessful attempts to contact Complete for a supplemental appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Thereafter, Complete issued a supplemental appraisal of the vehicle on July 1,2003, which estimated the cost of repairs to be $7929.48.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On July 28, 2003, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>plaintiff sent AMEX a \u201cNotice of Deficiency in Insurance Estimate,\u201d outlining alleged deficiencies in Complete\u2019s supplemental appraisal and requesting a further supplement from AMEX. On July 29, 2003, AMEX informed the plaintiff that it deemed the vehicle a total loss,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and requested that it halt all repairs on the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">On July 31, 2003, the plaintiff provided AMEX with a document entitled \u201cWork Bay/Outside Storage Options,\u201d which indicated that it had halted all repairs to the vehicle, and outlined storage options and fees pending retrieval of the vehicle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On August 1, 2003, AMEX requested that the plaintiff store the vehicle outside, at a rate of $24 per day. The plaintiff released the vehicle to AMEX\u2019s agent, Copart Salvage Auto Auctions (Copart), on August 7, 2003, after Copart had tendered payment to the plaintiff in the amount of $8449.47. The payment to the plaintiff also was accompanied by a letter from AMEX, which indicated that the payment was being made under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The plaintiff generated two invoices, both dated August 7,2003, outlining the charges to AMEX concerning the vehicle. One invoice detailed the total cost of parts and labor for repairs that had been done to the vehicle, in the amount of $2697.85.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The second invoice outlined additional charges, not involving the physical repair of the vehicle, in the amount of $5315.86. The plaintiff, therefore, charged AMEX a total of $8013.71 for work performed on, and relating to, the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>On November 24, 2003, AMEX filed a complaint with the department, claiming that the plaintiff had: (1) overcharged for repairs; (2) failed to obtain an authorization to perform repairs on the vehicle; (3) overcharged for towing and storage; and (4) refused to provide an invoice in which all charges were accounted for. The complaint resulted in an investigation by the dealers and repair division of the department. In the complaint investigation report (report), dated August 31, 2004, the department investigator referenced \u00a7 14-65g (a), and wrote that the department \u201cis questioning the charges that are not related to remedy the problems complained of.\u201d The report specifically focused on the plaintiffs invoice for additional charges.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Based upon the findings of the report, an administrative hearing was recommended, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 14-65g (a) and 14-65j (a), \u201cto address the charges that were not related to remedy the problems complained of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">On February 10, 2005, the department sent the plaintiffs attorney a notice<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> summoning the plaintiff to appear at a department hearing on February 24, 2005. In the notice, the department alleged that the plaintiff violated: (1) \u00a7 14-65g (a), by charging for items not necessary to repair the vehicle; and (2) \u00a7 14-65j (a), by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>making a false statement with regard to the posted rate for bay tie-up charges, namely, that a sign posted in the plaintiffs facility listed a bay tie-up charge as $120 per day, when, in fact, it actually charged $160 per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">At the department hearing held on February 24, 2005, the plaintiff argued, as a preliminary jurisdictional matter, that an insurance company should be precluded from filing a complaint as a customer, under \u00a7 14-63 (b), when the licensee\u2019s actions giving rise to the complaint concern a vehicle that the insurance company does not own. Specifically, the plaintiff argued that, in such a circumstance, an insurance company should not be considered a customer under \u00a7 14-63, because absent ownership of the vehicle, there is no contract between the licensee and the insurance company and, therefore, no consumer relationship. The attorney representing the department indicated that insurance companies previously have filed complaints with the department under \u00a7 14-63, and that the department has heard matters arising from those complaints. The department attorney further asserted that, in the present matter, it was the department\u2019s contention that AMEX was permitted to file a complaint under \u00a7 14-63 as a customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">On March 17, 2005, the department\u2019s hearing officer issued a written decision outlining her findings of fact and conclusions of law. The hearing officer determined that \u201ca written contract is not required for one to be a customer\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 14-64,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and that AMEX was, in fact, a customer. Regarding the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>substantive violations, the hearing officer concluded that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7 14-65g because \u201cit charged for items that were not necessary or reasonable to repair the problems complained of, as contemplated by the waiver of advanced estimate.\u201d The hearing officer also determined that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7 14-65i because \u201csome of the charges on the invoice are not contemplated on any sign that is posted on the premises, and there are no criteria for the imposition of bay tie-up charges as opposed to storage charges . . . .\u201d The hearing officer further concluded that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7 14-65j because \u201cit misstated in writing and charged more for bay tie up charges than the amount posted on its sign on the premises.\u201d The hearing officer ordered: (1) suspension of the plaintiffs license for one week; (2) payment of a $1000 civil penalty, or $500 for each violation;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (3) filing a $1000 forfeiture bond with the department; and (4) payment of restitution to AMEX in the amount of $5145.86.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the department to the trial court, claiming that the hearing officer improperly concluded that AMEX was a customer under \u00a7 14-63, and that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7\u00a7 14-65g, 14-65i and 14-65j. Specifically, the plaintiff argued that AMEX cannot be a customer because it had no privity of contract with the plaintiff, and that the department\u2019s determination with regard to the substantive violations was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The trial court concluded that \u201can insurance company that pays for, or arranges for, services provided to an insured or claimant by a licensee is a customer permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ted to file a complaint under \u00a7 14-63,\u201d and that the department did not violate any law or exceed its statutory authority in deciding that AMEX was a customer for purposes of \u00a7 14-63.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The trial court further concluded that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the department\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7\u00a7 14-65g, 14-65\u00cd and 14-65j. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the appeal. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff renews substantially the same claims that the trial court had rejected, namely, that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) the department\u2019s determination that AMEX was a customer under \u00a7 14-63 was permissible; and (2) substantial evidence existed in the record to justify the department\u2019s conclusions that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7\u00a7 14-65g, 14-65i and 14-65j. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201c[J]udicial review of the commissioner\u2019s action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act [(UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189], and the scope of that review is very restricted. . . . [R]eview of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or questions of fact. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sengchanthong </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>281 Conn. 604, 609, 917 A.2d 942 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">\u201cA reviewing court, however, is not required to defer to an improper application of the law. ... It is the function of the courts to expound and apply governing principles of law. . . . We previously have recognized that the construction and interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the courts, where the administrative decision is not entitled to special deference .... Questions of law [invoke] a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Because this case forces us to examine a question of law, namely, [statutory] construction and interpretation . . . our review is de novo. . . . We are also compelled to conduct a de novo review because the issue of statutory construction before this court has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>283 Conn. 644, 649-50, 931 A.2d 142 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The plaintiffs first claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly concluded that AMEX was a customer under \u00a7 14-63. The plaintiff asserts that, although the legislative history of \u00a7 14-63 is not dispositive about who constitutes a customer under the statute, a review of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-65a through 14-65k demonstrates that a customer is a person who has privity of contract with a repair shop. The plaintiff further asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>that, according to the term\u2019s common usage,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> involvement in a \u201c \u2018business dealing\u2019 \u201d is a prerequisite to being a \u201c \u2018customer,\u2019 \u201d and claims that an insurance company cannot be a customer under \u00a7 14-63 unless its business dealings with a dealer or repairer constitute the \u201c \u2018business of insurance,\u2019 \u201d as contemplated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Group Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Royal Drug Co., </em>440 U.S. 205, 99 S. Ct. 1067, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1979).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In addition, the plaintiff proffers a three part test it asserts we should utilize in determining whether one is a customer under \u00a7 14-63, and it further argues that AMEX failed to meet the elements of the proposed test.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">In response, the defendant claims that the text of \u00a7 14-63 and its relationship to other statutes demonstrates that \u201can insurance company that purchases services from a repairer licensee and falls victim to activities prohibited by the dealer/repairer statutes is a \u2018customer\u2019 entitled to file a complaint with the [department] . . . .\u201d Although the defendant agrees that the term \u201ccustomer\u201d is not defined by the relevant statutes and department regulations, it argues that, based on common usage of the term \u201ccustomer,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> a \u201crational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>reading of the word \u2018customer\u2019 in \u00a7 14-63 includes any person that purchases a service from a licensed dealer or repairer.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The defendant also contends that \u201c[t]here is no explicit limitation in either ... \u00a7 14-63 or . . . \u00a7 14-63-65 [of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies] that the term \u2018customers\u2019 or \u2018complainants\u2019 excludes insurance companies or only includes owners of motor vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The defendant further asserts that construing AMEX to be a customer under \u00a7 14-63 is consistent with the purpose of the statute, namely, \u201cto expose wrongdoing by dealer and repairer licensees and to authorize the [department] to punish and correct such wrongdoing with administrative penalties, including restitution.\u201d In addition, the defendant claims that \u201c[i]t would be irrational for the [department] to withhold restitution to a person who actually paid an improper amount for services rendered to a vehicle for lack of ownership because that is precisely the person who has the incentive to file a complaint and expose wrongdoing in the first place.\u201d The defendant also contends that, since \u00a7 14-65k gives the department the unilateral authority to investigate \u201cany matter under the provisions of sections 14-51 to 14-65j, inclusive,\u201d the department \u201cmay also take action against any offending licensee based on a complaint filed by an insurance company or any other non-owner of a motor vehicle.\u201d We agree with the defendant that the trial court properly concluded that AMEX was a customer under \u00a7 14-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">\u201cThe principles that govern statutory construction are well established. When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 650-51. \u201cThe test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alexson </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>276 Conn. 599, 605, 887 A.2d 872 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We begin by examining the language of the statute. Section 14-63 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, establishing (1) a procedure whereby <em>customers of dealers and repairers </em>may file complaints with the Department of Motor Vehicles concerning the operations of and services provided by any such licensees . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>sis added.) As the term \u201ccustomer\u201d is not defined in the statute, General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) requires that we construe the term \u201cin accordance with \u2018the commonly approved usage of the language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>281 Conn. 656, 665, 916 A.2d 803 (2007). \u201cIf a statute or regulation does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 656. \u201cCustomer\u201d is defined with substantial similarity in a variety of popular dictionaries, each providing that the fundamental characteristic of a customer is the purchase of a service or commodity from another.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Neither the dictionary definitions nor the text of \u00a7 14-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>63, however, provide definitive guidance as to the legislature\u2019s intended breadth of the term \u201ccustomer,\u201d namely, whether insurance companies may constitute customers for purposes of filing a complaint under \u00a714-63. Accordingly, we now examine the related statutes to ascertain whether they provide assistance in our construction of the term. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-65f through 14-65j, all of which relate to the repair of motor vehicles, each use the term \u201ccustomer.\u201d Relying on three of those statutes\u2014 specifically, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-65f, 14-65g and 14-65h \u2014 the plaintiff claims that, under the facts of this case, AMEX is not a customer because it did not have privity of contract with the plaintiff. The plaintiff argues, rather, that since Speckmann, the vehicle\u2019s owner, was the only person listed on the repair contract, only Speckmann had privity of contract with the plaintiff, and, therefore, only Speckmann qualified as a customer under \u00a7 14-63. In response, the defendant claims that <em>anyone </em>who pays for a licensee\u2019s services should be considered a customer under \u00a7\u00a7 14-63 through 14-65k, and contends that this is particularly true for insurance companies when, as in this case, the owner of the vehicle authorized the insurance company to pay for all repairs, thereby giving the insurance company a direct pecuniary interest in ensuring that the licensee follows the relevant statutory provisions. We find both parties\u2019 interpretations to be reasonable, thereby demonstrating the ambiguity of the term \u201ccustomer\u201d under \u00a7 14-63, and we are, therefore, permitted to consider extratextual sources in construing it. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z; <em>Alexson </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">With respect to extratextual sources, the legislative history of \u00a7 14-63 (b), which was enacted in 1986 as Public Acts 1986, No. 86-114, does not provide a definitive indication of the intended scope of the term \u201ccustomer.\u201d Similarly, the legislative history for \u00a7\u00a7 14-65f <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>through 14-65j provides no meaningful guidance about the intended breadth of the term \u201ccustomer,\u201d as used in those sections and \u00a7 14-63 (b). What the legislative history does show, however, is that the purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 14-63 through 14-65k is to regulate the industry of dealers and repairers, while simultaneously protecting customers of those licensees from unscrupulous business practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The legislative history concerning the enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 14-65f, 14-65h and 14-65i, for example, which were enacted in 1975 as Public Acts 1975, No. 75-550, shows that the legislature\u2019s concern was regulating the automobile repair industiy, protecting consumers, and reducing the overall number of complaints filed with the department. Speaking before the House of Representatives, Representative Robert J. Vicino remarked: \u201c[T]his bill is a first in an effort to try to resolve some of the problems that now exist in the area of automobile repairs.\u201d 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1975 Sess., p. 4231. In addition, Representative Vicino commented that the bill \u201cwill go a long way toward probably reducing complaints in the [department; that most people will know after they deal or before they deal with their repairer as to where they stand\u201d; 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1975 Sess., p. 4568; while Representative Abraham Glassman characterized it as \u201ca good consumer [b]ill . . . .\u201d Id., p. 4569. Senator Anthony M. Ciarlone remarked that \u201cwe are trying to tighten up an industry here and eliminate some problems\u201d; 18 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1975 Sess., p. 3351; and Senator Joseph J. Fauliso stated that \u201cwhat we are trying to establish here is some integrity in the relationship between the repairer and the customer.\u201d Id., p. 3353.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This history demonstrates that \u00a7\u00a7 14-63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>through 14-65k are remedial in nature, and we must, therefore, construe them broadly to accomplish their purpose and \u201cliberally ... in favor of those the legislature intended to benefit.\u201d <em>Small </em>v. <em>Going Forward, Inc., </em>281 Conn. 417, 424, 915 A.2d 298 (2007); id. (General Statutes \u00a7 14-62, which provides disclosure requirements for motor vehicle dealers, is remedial consumer protection statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">Broadly interpreting the term \u201ccustomer\u201d under \u00a7 14-63 to include insurance companies, which are contractually obligated to pay for repairs made by licensees, better serves the purpose of the statute than narrowly construing the term not to include such companies. When an insurance company is obligated to pay for repairs to a vehicle under the terms of a policy, that company has a direct pecuniary interest in ensuring that a repairer licensee complies with its statutory obligations set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 14-65f through 14-65j, as those provisions are aimed, in large part, at preventing unwarranted or hidden costs to licensees\u2019 customers. An insurance company, therefore, has an incentive to file a complaint under \u00a7 14-63 when it discovers a licensee\u2019s violation of \u00a7\u00a7 14-65f through 14-65j. In contrast, the vehicle\u2019s actual owner has minimal incentive to file a complaint under \u00a7 14-63, because the insured is not paying for the cost of repairs made to the vehicle.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As a result, concluding that an insurance company is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>a customer under \u00a7 14-63 would lead to an absurd result, specifically, discouraging the filing of complaints by the entity that actually has the incentive to do so. That construction would thwart the purpose of the statutory scheme, namely, to promote licensees\u2019 compliance with the statutory provisions, and to protect customers from the unscrupulous business practices of licensees.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">A broad interpretation of the term \u201ccustomer\u201d under \u00a7 14-63 is further buttressed by the fact that it is harmonious with various dictionary definitions of the term, which, as discussed previously in this opinion,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> similarly define \u201ccustomer\u201d as one who purchases a service or commodity from another. An insurance company that furnishes payment for the repair of a vehicle by a licensee, pursuant to the terms of an insurance policy, is effectively purchasing a service from, and thereby becomes a customer of, the repairer licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Moreover, we presume that the legislature was aware of the fact that licensees often conduct business dealings with insurance companies when repairing vehicles. \u201c[I]t is now well settled that testimony before legislative committees may be considered in determining the particular problem or issue that the legislature sought to address by the legislation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 314, 819 A.2d 260 (2003). While testifying before the joint standing general law committee concerning House Bill No. 8187, which led to the enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 14-65f, 14-65h and 14-65i, George Emanuel, who represented the Service Councils of Connecticut and the Auto Body Association of Greater Hartford, testified: \u201cWe deal mostly with insurance companies as far as automobile body repairing.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 3, 1975 Sess., p. 1256. On the basis of this testimony, it is reasonable to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>sume that the legislature not only was aware of this fact, but also that insurance companies may, therefore, be subjected to the same unscrupulous practices as would the owner of a vehicle or any other customer of a repairer licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Finally, although not entitled to any special deference in the present case, the past practice of the department also provides support for a broad construction of the term \u201ccustomer\u201d under \u00a7 14-63.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> During the department hearing in the present matter, an attorney from the department\u2019s bureau of safety enforcement asserted that: (1) it is the department\u2019s position that insurance companies can be customers under \u00a7 14-63; (2) the department has previously allowed insurance companies to file complaints under \u00a7 14-63; (3) the department has previously heard matters filed by insurance companies; and (4) AMEX was permitted to file a complaint as a customer under \u00a7 14-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We are not persuaded by the plaintiffs arguments for why insurance companies generally, and AMEX specifically, do not constitute customers under \u00a7 14-63. First, there is nothing in the language of \u00a7\u00a7 14-65f (a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>14-65g (a) and (e), and 14-65h (b) that expressly <em>prohibits </em>an insurance company from fulfilling the duties of a customer under those provisions, especially if so authorized by the company\u2019s insured. Had the legislature intended to limit the breadth of the term to vehicle owners, or to exclude insurance companies, it could have easily and expressly done so. See, e.g., <em>Windels </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Commission, </em>284 Conn. 268, 299, 933 A.2d 256 (2007). Further, the plaintiffs contention that an insurance company must be engaged in the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d with a licensee in order to be a customer under \u00a7 14-63 is not supported by fact or law.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Finally, the plaintiff promulgates a three part test in its brief, based on the definition of \u201ccustomer\u201d in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary and the plaintiffs own notion of what constitutes \u201ccharacteristics inherent in any customer,\u201d and it urges this court to utilize this test when determining whether one qualifies as a customer under \u00a7 14-63.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We are not persuaded and, accordingly, we decline to adopt the plaintiffs proffered test.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">As we have explained, an insurance company\u2019s dealings with a licensee need not constitute the business of insurance in order for the company to be a customer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>under \u00a7 14-63. Next, the plaintiff properly asserts that an insurance company is precluded, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-354 (b),<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> from <em>requiring </em>an insured to use a specific repair shop. The plaintiff incorrectly claims, however, that an insurance company\u2019s ability to choose a licensee is a prerequisite to being a customer under \u00a7 14-63, because an insurance company <em>may </em>choose a licensee, under \u00a7 38a-354 (b), if the company first obtains the insured\u2019s express written consent. Finally, the plaintiff asserts that an insurance company must have privity of contract with a licensee in order to be a customer under \u00a7 14-63, while at the same time acknowledging in its brief that \u201cthe absence of privity as a defense in actions for damages in contract and tort actions is generally no longer viable . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> A customer\u2019s statutory rights under \u00a7 14-63 are not, however, limited to filing complaints based solely on a licensee\u2019s breach of a particular provision in a repair contract. Put differently, a customer may file a complaint against a licensee for violating any statutory provision pertaining to the operations of or services provided by a licensee, regardless of whether such alleged violation constitutes a breach of an individual repair contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We conclude, therefore, that when an insurance company is obligated under the terms of an insurance policy to pay for the cost of a licensee\u2019s repairs to a vehicle, the company does not need to have privity of contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>with the licensee in order to be a customer under \u00a7 14-63.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In the present matter, we conclude that AMEX was a customer under \u00a7 14-63 because AMEX was obligated to pay for the repairs to Speckmann\u2019s vehicle under the terms of an insurance policy. Accordingly, the trial court properly upheld the department\u2019s determination that AMEX was a customer under \u00a7 14-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly concluded that substantial evidence in the record supported the department hearing officer\u2019s determination that the plaintiff violated \u00a7\u00a7 14-65g, 14-65\u00cd and 14-65j. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions were clearly erroneous based on the evidence presented at the hearing. We address the plaintiffs claim with respect to each statutory violation in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">As a preliminary matter, we revisit the appropriate standard governing judicial review of an agency\u2019s decision. \u201c[Jjudicial review of the commissioner\u2019s action is governed by the [UAPA] and the scope of that review is very restricted. . . . [Rjeview of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or questions of fact. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sengchanthong </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">\u201cThe substantial evidence rule governs judicial review of administrative fact-finding under the UAPA. [See] General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) (5) and (6). An administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . The substantial evidence rule imposes an important limitation on the power of the courts to overturn a decision of an administrative agency .... It is fundamental that a plaintiff has the burden of proving that the commissioner, on the facts before him, acted contrary to law and in abuse of his discretion .... The law is also well established that if the decision of the commissioner is reasonably supported by the evidence it must be sustained.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>254 Conn. 333, 343-44, 757 A.2d 561 (2000). \u201cThis substantial evidence standard is highly deferential and permits less judicial scrutiny than a clearly erroneous or weight of the evidence standard of review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 124, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The plaintiff first contends that the department hearing officer improperly concluded that it violated \u00a7 14-65g, based on a determination that the plaintiff \u201ccharged for items that were not necessary or reasonable to repair the problems complained of, as contemplated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>by the waiver of advance estimate.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the terms \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201creasonable\u201d in \u00a7 14-65g (a) are vague, and, therefore, that a licensee\u2019s charges are not limited to parts and labor related directly to the repair of the vehicle. The plaintiff further asserts that the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation of the terms \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201creasonable\u201d was unwarranted, because they have never been subject to judicial or administrative scrutiny. Finally, the plaintiff claims that there is no provision in \u00a7 14-65g (a) that limits charges to parts and repairs on a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">In response, the defendant contends that a licensee is permitted to charge only for <em>repairs </em>that are reasonable and necessary after obtaining a waiver pursuant to \u00a7 14-65g (a). The defendant further claims that the decisions of the department hearing officer and the trial court were proper, as there was substantial evidence that the plaintiff had charged for various storage and administrative items that were not necessary to repair the vehicle. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Section 14-65g (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA customer may waive his right to the estimate of the <em>costs of parts and labor </em>required by section 14-65f, only in writing in accordance with this section. Such a waiver shall include an authorization to perform reasonable and necessary <em>repairs </em>to remedy the problems complained of . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs vagueness claim lacks merit because the text of the statute is plain and unambiguous in providing that a licensee may charge only for reasonable and necessary <em>repairs </em>to the vehicle, thereby restricting charges to the parts and labor required to make such repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The trial court concluded that substantial evidence supported the department\u2019s determination that the plaintiff violated \u00a7 14-65g (a), based on the plaintiff having charged for: (1) forty-three days of bay tie-up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>charges after it had stopped working on the vehicle; and (2) various administrative and miscellaneous duties that did not involve actual repair to the vehicle, including, inter alia, charges for faxing documents, removing the license plate and personal belongings from the vehicle, and driving to the post office.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Since all of these charges did not involve repair to the vehicle, this evidence more than reasonably supported the department\u2019s determination that the plaintiff violated \u00a7 14-65g (a), and we, accordingly, conclude that the department\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the department improperly concluded that it had violated \u00a7 14-65\u00cd because \u201cthe evidence produced at the [department] [h] earing clearly demonstrates that the [p]laintiff maintains signs for every expense charged and has, at all times, complied with the requirements of . . . [\u00a7] 14-65\u00cd.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff contends that a sign was posted outlining the conditions under which storage charges may be imposed, and that \u00a7 14-65i does not require a licensee to post criteria for when storage charges, as opposed to bay tie-up charges, will be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The trial court concluded that substantial evidence supported the department\u2019s determination that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>plaintiff violated \u00a7 14-65i, based on: (1) the plaintiff not having posted \u201ccriteria for the imposition of bay tie-up charges as opposed to storage charges\u201d; and (2) the plaintiffs owner having conceded, during the department hearing, that the plaintiff \u201cdoes not have a consistent policy as to the imposition of bay tie-up charges.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Section 14-65i (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cEach motor vehicle repair shop shall post a sign, as required by this subsection, in each area of its premises where work orders are placed by customers. The sign shall state: (1) The hourly charge for labor; (2) the <em>conditions, </em>if any, under which the shop may impose charges for storage, and the <em>amount </em>of any such charges . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute clearly provides that if a licensee imposes storage charges, it must also inform its customers of when, and in what amount, such charges will be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The plaintiff asserts that it did, in fact, satisfy the conditions requirement of \u00a7 14-65\u00cd by having the following sign posted: \u201cSTORAGE CHARGES: If Any Delays Beyond Our Control Or If Not Picked Up Within 48 Hrs. Of Completion.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The plaintiff further contends that this sign provides the conditions for the imposition of storage charges <em>and </em>bay tie-up charges. Both the department investigator\u2019s report and the department\u2019s decision, however, indicate that the plaintiff charged different rates for storage and bay tie-up. See footnote 12 of this opinion. As a result, while the plaintiffs sign may provide the conditions under which either storage or bay tie-up charges may be imposed, the sign does not inform customers of the conditions in which storage charges will be imposed <em>as opposed to </em>the more costly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>bay tie-up charges, and vice versa. The sign, therefore, does not inform customers of a definitive amount they will be charged if the conditions do, in fact, come to fruition. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that there was substantial evidence to support the department\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff violated \u00a7 14-65L</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Finally, the plaintiff contends that the department improperly concluded that \u201cit misstated in writing and charged more for bay tie-up charges than the amount posted on its sign on the premises\u201d in violation of \u00a7 14-65J.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Section 14-65j (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo repair shop shall make any statement to a customer which it knows <em>or should know </em>to be false or misleading. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The plaintiff specifically claims that it never made a false statement to Speckmann, since it posted a sign listing bay tie-up charges as $20 per hour, and, therefore, charged \u201c$160 for bay tie-up charges per day, computed by multiplying eight hours (a typical workday) . . . .\u201d In making this claim, however, the plaintiff failed to mention in its brief that the sign also listed bay tie-up charges as $120 per day, despite the plaintiffs owner admitting this fact while testifying at the department hearing.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The evidence on the record indicates, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>fore, that the plaintiff charged AMEX $160 per day for bay tie-up, despite the fact that the plaintiffs owner knew, or <em>should have known, </em>that it had a sign posted that listed bay tie-up charges as $20 per hour or $120 per day. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly decided that substantial evidence supported the department\u2019s determination that the plaintiff violated \u00a7 14-65j.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-63 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, establishing (1) a procedure whereby <em>customers of dealers and repairers </em>may file complaints with the Department of Motor Vehicles concerning the operations of and services provided by any such licensees . . .

See footnote 18 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b826-8\"> In making this assertion, the defendant uses the term \u201cperson\u201d as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (65), which provides that any corporation or company is a person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b827-6\"> Section 14-63-45 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, the regulation promulgated by the department outlining the procedure for customers of dealers and repairers to file complaints under \u00a7 14-63, provides: \u201cAll complaints Sled with the Department of Motor Vehicles concerning <em>motor </em>vehicle dealers or repairers licensed pursuant to section 14-52 of the general statutes shall be made on a form prescribed by the commissioner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>The form will include, but not be limited to, the following information which must be answered by the complainant to the extent that he or she is aware of such information: (1) Name of complainant, (2) Address of complainant, (3) Name of licensee against whom the complaint is being made, (4) Address of licensee against whom the complaint is being made, (5) Year of motor vehicle, (6) Make of motor vehicle, (7) Identification number of motor vehicle, (8) Description of work or service performed or which was to be performed, (9) When work was done or to be done including time period motor vehicle was in the custody of the licensee, (10) Reason for complaint. If the complaint concerns repairs to a motor vehicle questions (11) and (12) as follows should be answered: (11) Was a written repair estimate made available to the complainant prior to the work being done on the motor vehicle, (12) Were any parts which were replaced returned to the complainant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\"> See, e.g., American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th Ed. 2004) (customer is \u201c[o]ne that buys goods or services\u201d as well as \u201c[a]n individual with whom one must deal\u201d); Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993) (customer is \u201cone that purchases a commodity or service\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) (A customer is \u201c[o]ne who regularly or repeatedly malees purchases of, or has business dealings with, a tradesman or business. Ordinarily, one who has repeated business dealings with another. A buyer, purchaser, consumer or patron.\u201d); Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969) (A customer is, \u201c[i]n common usage, a person who buys the merchandise or engages the services of another person. In some contexts, the term has the more extensive connotation of a person who comes to the place of business of another for any purpose of concern to the latter.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b830-6\"> The legislative history concerning Senate Bill No. 265, which was later enacted, in part, in 1980 as Public Acts 1980, No. 80-425 \u2014 and which, in turn, enacted General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-65e, 14-65g and 14-65j, while also amending \u00a7\u00a7 14-65f, 14-65h and 14-65i \u2014 also clearly demonstrates the legislature\u2019s emphasis on consumer protection. Senator Steven C. Casey remarked: \u201cThis bill would give the customer when he goes into a repair shop a free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>ability to know exactly what work is going to be done and how much he will be responsible for.\u201d 23 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1980 Sess., p. 1338. One proposed amendment of Senate Bill No. 265, which was subsequently not enacted as part, of Public Act 80-425, was the exclusion of collision or repair shops from the scope of the motor vehicle repair bill. Commenting on this amendment, Representative Eugene A. Migliaro stated: \u201c[T]he main reason [repair shops should be included] is to make sure that the consumer is getting what he paid for . . . .\u201d 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 20, 1980 Sess., pp. 5800-5801.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b831-6\"> Indeed, the plaintiffs attorney conceded, during oral argument before this court, that an insured would have little incentive to file a complaint under \u00a7 14-63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\"> See footnote 23 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\"> The department\u2019s past practice and determination of who constitutes a customer under \u00a7 14-63 is not entitled to special deference because the interpretation of the term \u201ccustomer\u201d is a question of law for the courts. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 649. In addition, although its past practice indicates that the department has interpreted the term \u201ccustomer\u201d to include insurance companies, special deference is still not warranted because the proffered evidence fails to show that: (X) tire department has <em>formally articulated </em>its interpretation of the term; and (2) the department has allowed insurance companies to file complaints under \u00a7 14-63 for an <em>extended period of time. </em>See <em>Longley </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>284 Conn. 149, 164, 931 A.2d 890 (2007) (\u201can agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is accorded deference when the agency\u2019s interpretation has been formally articulated and applied for an extended period of time, and that interpretation is reasonable\u201d). We nevertheless find the department\u2019s practice and construction of the term to be reasonable and <em>persuasive support </em>for our conclusion that insurance companies may be customers for purposes of filing a complaint under \u00a7 14-63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b834-6\"> The plaintiff claims that an insurance company must engage in the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d \u2014 as contemplated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Croup Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Royal Drug Co., </em>supra, 440 U.S. 205 \u2014 in order to be a customer under \u00a7 14-63. In <em>Royal Drug Co., </em>the sole issue was whether the actions of an insurance company constituted the \u201c \u2018business of insurance,\u2019 \u201d whereby the actions would be exempt from antitrust laws pursuant to \u00a7 2 (b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Id., 207-10. We agree with the defendant in concluding that <em>Royal Drug Co. </em>is clearly inapposite to the present matter, and, therefore, provides neither binding nor persuasive authority for the proposition that an insurance company\u2019s business dealings with a repairer licensee must constitute the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d in order to be a customer under \u00a7 14-63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b834-7\"> Specifically, the plaintiff proposes that an insurance company should be considered a customer under \u00a7 14-63 only if: (1) its dealings with a licensee constitute the business of insurance; (2) it is able to choose a licensee to perform repair work on an insured\u2019s vehicle; and (3) it has privity of contract with its chosen licensee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b835-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-354 (b) provides: \u201cNo insurance company doing business in this state, or agent or acUuster for such company <em>shall require </em>any insured to use a specific person for the provision of automobile physical damage repairs, automobile glass replacement, glass repair service or glass products <em>unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the insured.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\"> While the plaintiff correctly contends that the absence of privity as a defense in a tort action is generally no longer viable; see, e.g., <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Lenox Homes, Inc., </em>186 Conn. 370, 375, 441 A.2d 620 (1982) (lack of privity not fatal to plaintiffs negligence recovery); we are unable to locate authority that allows an action for contract damages absent privity of contract between the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b836-9\"> An insurance company is also considered to be a customer under \u00a7 14-63 if it owns a vehicle being repaired by a licensee, regardless of whether it: (1) owned the vehicle prior to the commencement of repairs; or (2) obtained title to the vehicle after a licensee had initiated repairs. Referring to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-63 and 14-65e through 14-65k, the amicus curiae Auto Body Association of Connecticut concedes that \u201c[o]nce an insurance company does take title, it too, can avail itself of the protections afforded by these statutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\"> The additional charges on the plaintiffs invoice included: (a) $3840 for bay tie-up, at a rate of $160 per day for 24 working days; (b) $741 for bay tie-up, at a rate of $39 per day for 19 nonworking days; (c) $20 for 1 day of outside storage; (d) $72 for outside fenced storage, at a rate of $24 per day for 3 days; (e) $68 for preparing an estimate; (f) $78 for writing a damage report; (g) $78 for preparing a supplement; (h) $68 for an appointment regarding the supplemental appraisal; (i) $66 for facsimile charges; Q) $2 for moving the vehicle outside for inspection; (k) a $125 administrative fee; (Z) $19.13 for removing personal belongings from the vehicle; (m) $7.80 for removing the license plate; (n) $0.50 for a key tag; (o) a $10 photograph fee; (p) $40 for driving to the post office and preparing for a wrecker service; (q) $9.07 for certified mail; (r) $20 for rotating automobiles to allow access for the vehicle to be picked up; and (s) $15 for moving parts outside to be picked up.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\"> This sign was not mentioned, as the plaintiff claims in its brief, in the complaint investigation report prepared by the department investigator. The plaintiffs owner did mention the sign, however, during the department hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\"> During the department hearing, the following exchange took place between the department hearing officer and the plaintiffs owner:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">\u201cQ. . . . The bay tie-up charge. This is a regular charge that you charge people?</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">\u201cQ. So, it isn\u2019t just this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">\u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">\u201cQ. You charge this on a regular basis?</p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">\u201cA. Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">\u201cQ. And you have a sign?</p>\n<p id=\"b841-17\">\u201cA. I have t[w]o signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-18\">\u201cQ. What is the amount o[n] the sign?</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>\u201cA. Twenty dollars per hour or one hundred sixtjy] dollars per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">\u201cQ. What was the sign up at the time that this person was a customer? Or the time that the inspector went in?</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">\u201cA. Well, that\u2019s where the confusion comes in.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">\u201cQ. What was the sign that was up at the time that the inspector went in?</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\">\u201cA. When the inspector came in it was one hundred twenty dollars per day, twenty dollars per hour. Those two signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">\u201cQ. Then why did you charge them one hundred sixty dollars?</p>\n<p id=\"b842-19\">\u201cA. Because it was on the framing machine. It was twenty dollars per hour. I work ten hour days. It should have been two hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
