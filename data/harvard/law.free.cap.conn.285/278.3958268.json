The defendant, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>of America, Connecticut Independent Police Union, Local 14, appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court granting the application of the plaintiff, the town of Bloomfield, to vacate an arbitration award that had reinstated the employment of Donald Rajtar, a police officer, on the ground that the award violated this state\u2019s public policy requiring law enforcement officers to be honest. We agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs application because it was not filed within the thirty day limitations period of \u00a7 52-420 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The defendant is the exclusive bargaining agent for all of the plaintiffs police officers below the rank of captain, including Rajtar, and the parties are signatories to a collective bargaining agreement (agreement). In March, 2004, Betsy Hard, the plaintiffs chief of police, notified Rajtar of her intent to terminate his employment for failing to perform a complete investigation and fabricating false witness statements with respect to a February, 2004 incident at Lee\u2019s Famous Recipe Chicken Restaurant (restaurant), as well as lying during the subsequent departmental internal affairs inquiry. In June, 2004, Louie Chapman, Jr., the plaintiffs town manager, sustained Hard\u2019s recommendation to terminate Rajtar\u2019s employment. After exhaustion of the grievance procedures set forth by the agreement, the defendant subsequently filed a demand for arbitration, pursuant to General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>utes \u00a7 31-97 et seq., with the state board of mediation and arbitration (board) to challenge Rajtar\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Following several days of hearings, on December 28, 2005, a three member panel of the board issued a written award that concluded that Rajtar \u201cwas not terminated for cause consistent with the collective bargaining agreement and applicable [personnel [rJules and [rjeg-ulations.\u201d The board stated that it agreed with the plaintiff that Rajtar\u2019s conduct with respect to the investigation was \u201cso detrimental [that] it justified immediate termination,\u201d but nevertheless reduced the penalty to a suspension of 200 workdays because termination was inconsistent with disciplinary actions that the plaintiff previously had imposed on two other officers. The plaintiff received notice of the award on December 30, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Subsequently, the plaintiff brought this application to vacate the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418. The plaintiff claimed that the award violated: (1) the \u201cclear public policy regarding the necessity of truthfulness and honesty in law enforcement as enunciated by the United States Supreme Court and the Connecticut [sjtate [ljegislature\u201d; and (2) \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because the board had \u201cexceeded its powers or so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter was not made,\u201d since the award was internally inconsistent due to the panel\u2019s finding that Rajtar had lied both to the plaintiff and the panel. The plaintiff served the defendant with the application to vacate the award on January 27, 2006, and filed it with the trial court on February 2, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The defendant moved to dismiss the application to vacate the award, claiming that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider it because the plaintiff had failed to file the application within thirty days of the issuance of the award in accordance with \u00a7 52-420 (b). The trial court, <em>Keller, J., </em>granted the motion to dismiss, in part, following the plaintiffs concession that its \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) claim was untimely under \u00a7 52-420 (b) because the plaintiff did not file the application within thirty days from receiving notice of the award. Judge Keller concluded, however, that despite the untimeliness of the \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) claim, the plaintiffs claim that the award violated public policy was a separate common-law action existing independently of \u201cany specific statutory authority,\u201d and was not, therefore, governed by the arbitration statutes. Judge Keller then followed another trial court decision, <em>Shrader </em>v. <em>Zeldes, Needle &amp; Cooper, </em>45 Conn. Sup. 130, 702 A.2d 1214 (1997),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> concluding that \u201ccourts are required to review claims that an arbitration decision should not be confirmed because the award violates public policy even when these claims are not asserted within the thirty day time limitation period or other procedural requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 52-418 and 52-420 (b).\u201d Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to the plaintiffs public policy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The plaintiff thereafter filed an amended application to vacate the award that alleged only the common-law public policy claim. In deciding the application, the trial court, <em>Hon. Richard M. Rittenband, </em>judge trial referee, called the logic of the board\u2019s decision \u201cabsurd\u201d because \u201c[i]f the [plaintiff] were to be held to this conclusion, all police officers in the future could lie with impunity. The termination of Rajtar may be disparate in view of precedent, but the lying by a police officer has to stop here.\u201d Judge Rittenband then concluded that Rajtar had \u201cviolate [d] a public policy based upon a statute and/or case law,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that \u201cthere is a clear public policy in Connecticut . . . that it is against public policy for a police officer to lie. The statute and case law aforementioned is the clearly discemable public source of the public policy. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u201cThis court also concludes that the record substantiates by substantial evidence that Rajtar did lie in the performance of his duties, and therefore, violated public policy. Further, [the board], in reinstating . . . Rajtar violated this public policy prohibiting police officers from lying.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment granting the plaintiffs application to vacate the award. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that: (1) Judge Keller improperly concluded that the plaintiffs public policy claim was not time barred by the thirty day limitations period of \u00a7 52-420 (b); and (2) Judge Rittenband improperly concluded that the board\u2019s award reducing Rajtar\u2019s termination to a 200 day suspension violated the clearly expressed public policy of this state. With respect to the second claim, the defendant also raises the related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>arguments that the trial court improperly found facts beyond those found by the panel, and that the plaintiff was estopped from arguing against the reinstatement of Rajtar. Because we agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim on appeal, we do not reach the second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s timeliness claim under \u00a7 52-420 (b) because it implicates the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs application to vacate the award. See, e.g., <em>Middlesex Ins. Co. </em>v. Castellano, 225 Conn. 339, 344, 623 A.2d 55 (1993). Specifically, the defendant relies on <em>Wu </em>v. <em>Chang, </em>264 Conn. 307, 823 A.2d 1197 (2003), and contends that \u00a7 52-420 (b) encompasses all applications to vacate arbitration awards, not just those based on the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 52-418 (a). The defendant argues that acceptance of the plaintiffs position, namely, that the thirty day time limitation is inapplicable to applications that are based on public policy grounds because they are \u201cindependent actions,\u201d is \u201cillogical and inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s desire to support expeditious resolution of disputes through arbitration . . . .\u201d Finally, the defendant relies on <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Meader, </em>208 Conn. 352, 545 A.2d 553 (1988), and contends that, because the trial court\u2019s decision under the common law is inconsistent with the arbitration statutes, the \u201clegislation will govern, because it is the latest expression of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In response, the plaintiff cites this court\u2019s decision in <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 612 A.2d 742 (1992), and argues that \u00a7 52-420 (b) does not apply to common-law remedies, such as public policy claims, which existed prior to the enactment of the arbitration statutes in 1929, because \u201c[c]ase law is clear that the provisions of \u00a7 52-418 are in addition to the common-law causes of action to vacate an arbitration award.\u201d The plaintiff further contends that, because the \u201clegislature added statutory provisions to modify arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>awards but did not displace the non-contradictory portions of the existing common-law scheme,\u201d the procedural requirements of the arbitration act do not apply to actions to vacate arbitration awards on public policy grounds. The plaintiff also emphasizes that objections to the enforcement of arbitration awards on public policy grounds would not be without time limits, as such objections still would be subject to the one year' period that General Statutes \u00a7 52-417<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides for the filing of an application to confirm an award.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the defendant, and conclude that the thirty day limitations period of \u00a7 52-420 (b) applies to applications to vacate arbitration awards on public policy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we address our standard of review. We have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> . . . Moreover, [i]t is a fundamental rule that a court may raise and review the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time. . . . Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction ....</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u201cThe issue before this court involves a question of statutory interpretation that also requires our plenary review. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutoiy language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for inteipretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fedus </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>278 Conn. 751, 755-56, 900 A.2d 1 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We begin, of course, with the language of \u00a7 52-420 (b), which provides: \u201cNo motion to vacate, modify or correct an award may be made after thirty days from the notice of the award to the party to the arbitration who makes the motion.\u201d This broad language plainly states that the limitations period applies regardless of the grounds for the motion to vacate. It is neither qualified by, nor limited to, any particular grounds for the application and is not, therefore, ambiguous because, \u201cwhen read in context, [it] is [not] susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alexson </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>276 Conn. 599, 605, 887 A.2d 872 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Indeed, the meaning of \u00a7 52-420 (b) is particularly clear when viewed in the context of the statute\u2019s other subsections, as well as other statutes in the arbitration chapter. See <em>Remax Right Choice </em>v. <em>Aryeh, </em>100 Conn. App. 373, 388, 918 A.2d 976 (2007) (\u201cas [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-416 is found in the same statutory arbitration scheme as \u00a7\u00a7 52-418 and 52-420 [b], we therefore consider the relationship between those statutes\u201d); see also, e.g., <em>Broadnax </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>284 Conn. 237, 245, 932 A.2d 1063 (2007) (\u201c[t]he meaning of the relevant terms of [General Statutes] \u00a7 7-474 [f] becomes apparent when we view them, as we must, under our established rules of statutory construction, in context with the statutory scheme of which they are a part\u201d). Like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u00a7 52-420 (b), the terms of other procedural statutes in the arbitration chapter, including subsection (c) of \u00a7 52-420, apply broadly to proceedings to confirm, vacate, modify or correct awards, without reference to any particular enabling statute or grounds for the application. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-420 (c) (\u201c[f] or the purpose of a motion to vacate, modify or correct an award, such an order staying any proceedings of the adverse party to enforce the award shall be made as may be deemed necessary\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-421 (a) (\u201c[a]ny party applying for an order confirming, modifying or correcting an award shall, at the time the order is filed with the clerk for the entry of judgment thereon, file the following papers with the clerk ... [6] each notice and other paper used upon an application to confirm, modify or correct the award, and [7] a copy of each order of the court upon such an application\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-421 (b) (\u201c[t]he judgment or decree confirming, modifying or correcting an award shall be docketed as if it were rendered in a civil action\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-423 (\u201c[a]n appeal may be taken from an order confirming, vacating, modifying or correcting an award, or from a judgment or decree upon an award, as in ordinary civil actions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The breadth of the language used by the legislature in drafting these statutes is underscored by a comparison to subsection (a) of \u00a7 52-420, which refers specifically to proceedings under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-417, 52-418 and 52-419. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-420 (a) (\u201c[a]ny application under section 52-417, 52-418 or 52-419 shall be heard in the manner provided by law for hearing written motions at a short calendar session, or otherwise as the court or judge may direct, in order to dispose of the case with the least possible delay\u201d). This language indicates that, had the legislature wished to qualify the applicability of \u00a7 52-420 (b) by referring specifically to \u00a7 52-418, it could have done so. It is well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>settled that \u201c[w]e are not permitted to supply statutory language that the legislature may have chosen to omit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ventres </em>v. <em>Goodspeed Airport, LLC, </em>275 Conn. 105, 160, 881 A.2d 937 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1111, 126 S. Ct. 1913, 164 L. Ed. 2d 664 (2006). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is a principle of statutory construction that a court must construe a statute as written. . . . Courts may not by construction supply omissions ... or add exceptions merely because it appears that good reasons exist for adding them. . . . The intent of the legislature, as this court has repeatedly observed, is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. ... It is axiomatic that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is a function of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>279 Conn. 207, 216, 901 A.2d 673 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We acknowledge that we recently stated that a defendant\u2019s untimely objection to the confirmation of an arbitration award on the ground that there was no arbitration agreement between the parties was not barred by \u00a7 52-420 (b) because \u201c[t]his basis is not enumerated in \u00a7 52-418 .... Thus, because the defendant\u2019s objection is not contemplated by \u00a7 52-418, it is not subject to the timeliness provisions of \u00a7 52-420 (b).\u201d <em>MBNA America Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Boata, </em>283 Conn. 381, 395, 926 A.2d 1035 (2007). Although this language, viewed superficially and in isolation, appears to support the plaintiffs position in the present case, our decision in <em>Boata </em>is readily distinguishable and, therefore, not controlling herein. <em>Boata </em>did not involve a public policy challenge to an otherwise validly entered award, but rather, involved a claim that the arbitrator lacked authority over the dispute based on the alleged nonexistence of an arbitration agreement between the parties to a credit card contract. Id., 394-95. We concluded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Boata </em>that, \u201cbecause a trial court cannot confirm an arbitration award unless the parties expressly have agreed to arbitrate the matter, it follows that a defendant must be allowed to object to the confirmation of that award if he properly has preserved a claim as to the existence of an arbitration agreement.\u201d Id., 395; see also id., 396 (\u201ca challenge to the existence of an arbitration agreement is appropriate at any stage before the court renders judgment confirming the award if the issue was not waived during the arbitration proceedings\u201d). Put differently, <em>Boata </em>stands only for the proposition that \u00a7 52-420 (b) will not preclude an otherwise untimely objection to the confirmation of an award on the gromd that the parties had not conferred upon the arbitrator the legal authority to issue that award in the first place.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>MBNA America Bank N.A. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>104 Com. App. 457, 463, 934 A.2d 316 (2007) (discussing <em>Boata </em>and stating that \u201c[o]ur Supreme Court has clarified that the issue of whether an agreement to arbitrate exists, as opposed to whether an arbitrator has disregarded the limits of an arbitration agreement, is not one of the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 52-418 and, thus, is not subject to the timeliness provision codified in \u00a7 52-420 [b]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Indeed, a conclusion that public policy claims are not subject to the thirty day limitations period would undermine the legislature\u2019s well established support of arbitration as a mechanism for the inexpensive and expedient resolution of private disputes. See, e.g., <em>Hart</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>ford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s &amp; Cos. Collective, </em>271 Conn. 474, 493, 857 A.2d 893 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 974, 125 S. Ct. 1826, 161 L. Ed. 2d 723 (2005). Our recent decision in <em>Wu </em>v. <em>Chang, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 307, emphasized the significance of \u00a7 52-420 (b) with respect to the efficiency of arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. In <em>Wu, </em>the plaintiff brought an action to confirm an arbitration award pursuant to \u00a7 52-417, and the defendant objected to the confirmation of the award on the ground of fraud. Id., 309. Accepting as unchallenged the trial court\u2019s decision to treat the defendant\u2019s objection as a motion to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (1), which encompasses fraud; see id., 310-11 and n.4; we concluded that the thirty day limitations period of \u00a7 52-420 (b) was not tolled by the defendant\u2019s claim of fraud, noting that the \u201cstatutory arbitration scheme encompasses many aspects of the arbitration process .... Thus, it is evident that the legislature\u2019s puipose in enacting the statutoiy scheme was to displace many [common-law] rules. . . . The statutory framework governing the arbitration process expressly covers claims of fraud.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 313. We stated that, \u201c[t]o conclude otherwise would be contrary not only to the clear intent of the legislature as expressed in \u00a7\u00a7 52-417, 52-418 and 52-420 (b), but also to a primary goal of arbitration, namely, the efficient, economical and expeditious resolution of private disputes.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Our conclusion in <em>Wu </em>that claims of fraud do not toll the running of \u00a7 52-420 (b) is indicative of the importance of the thirty day filing period to the statutory scheme governing arbitration, which is intended to facilitate the economical and rapid resolution of disputes. Indeed, in contrast to fraud claims, which are predicated upon a party\u2019s surreptitious conduct, public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>policy claims instead require that the award \u201cviolate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>C. R. Klewin Northeast, LLC </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>282 Conn. 54, 93, 919 A.2d 1002 (2007). To conclude that the thirty day time limitation applicable to \u00a7 52-418 (a) claims does not apply to motions to vacate arbitration awards that are based on public policy grounds would be inconsistent with our recent decision in <em>Wu, </em>and would frustrate the legislative purpose of facilitating the expedient resolution of private disputes. Accordingly, we conclude that the thirty day filing period set forth by \u00a7 52-420 (b) applies to an application to vacate an arbitration award on the ground that it violates public policy. Thus, because the plaintiff did not file its application to vacate the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>award within that thirty day period, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the application to vacate the award.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-420 (b) provides: \u201cNo motion to vacate, modify or correct an award may be made after thirty days from the notice of the award to the party to the arbitration who makes the motion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\"> The defendant also claims, inter alia, that the trial court improperly concluded that the arbitration award violated this state\u2019s public policy that requires police officers to be honest. We do not reach these claims because of our conclusion that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction as a result of the plaintiffs untimely application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) provides: \u201cUpon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides or, in a controversy concerning land, for the judicial district in which the land is situated or, when the court is not in session, any judge thereof, shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects: (1) If the award has been procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; (2) if there has been evident partiality or corruption on the part of any arbitrator; (3) if the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\"> The trial court did, however, note a split in Superior Court authority on this issue, and cited <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Litchfield, Docket No. CV 9900749420 (August 23, 1999), in support of the contrary position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\"> As sources for this public policy, the trial court relied on General Statutes \u00a7 54-86c, which requires prosecutors to disclose exculpatory information or material, and numerous decisions by both this court and the United States Supreme Court, including <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>253 Conn. 700, 756 A.2d 799 (2000), and <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.

We disagree, and note simply that the plaintiffs concession before the trial court was consistent with our prior \u00a7 52-420 (b) jurisprudence, which requires filing, rather than service, to satisfy the limitations period. We have stated that a \u201cproceeding to vacate an arbitration award is not a civil action, but is rather a special statutory proceeding. ... As a special statutory proceeding, it is not controlled by the formal requirements for service of process. . . . Section 52-420 (b) requires that a motion to vacate an arbitration award be <em>filed </em>within thirty days of the notice of the award to the moving party. If the motion is not <em>filed </em>within tire thirty day time limit, the trial court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the motion.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Middlesex Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Castellano, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 344; id., 345 (Concluding that \u201cthe plaintiffs failure to serve the defendant within [the thirty day] time period did not remove the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over the proceedings. The only jurisdictional requirement in filing a motion to vacate an arbitration award is that it be filed with the trial court within thirty days of the moving party\u2019s notice of the arbitration award. Because the plaintiff complied with this requirement, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d); see also, e.g., <em>Wu v. Chang, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 312 (\u00a7 52-420 [b] \u201crequires that amotion to vacate an arbitration award be filed within thirty days of the notice of the award to the moving party\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\"> Furthermore, it is well settled that a \u201cmotion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. ... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [0]ur review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [decision to] grant . . . the motion to dismiss will be de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gerlt </em>v. <em>South Windsor, </em>284 Conn. 178, 188-89, 931 A.2d 907 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\"> Thus, we similarly disagree with the plaintiffs reliance on <em>Remax Right Choice </em>v. <em>Aryeh, </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 388, wherein the Appellate Court recently concluded that the trial court improperly failed to consider an objection to an award, which was untimely under \u00a7 52-420 (b), because \u201cthe award had no legal effect as a result of the failure of the arbitrator to render an award within the time limit of \u00a7 52-416 and the absence of any waiver by the parties.\u201d Like <em>Boata, </em>the Appellate Court decision in <em>Remax Right Choice </em>directly addresses the existence of the arbitrator\u2019s authority over a particular controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b312-5\"> We address briefly the plaintiffs reliance on <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 1. In <em>Garrity, </em>we declined to recognize the arbitrators\u2019 \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d as a common-law ground for vacating an award, but concluded that \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) appropriately could be construed as encompassing that ground. Id., 6. In so concluding, we stated that, \u201c[w]e have historically construed narrowly the two common law grounds for vacating an arbitration award. We denominate the constitutionality and public policy exceptions as common law grounds although we have, on occasion, implied that the basis for these grounds is to be found within the statutory scheme of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). ... It is more appropriate to recognize that the power to determine the constitutionality of a statute and the power to strike an arbitration ruling as violative of public policy exist apart from any particular grant of authority from the legislative branch. Because of the multiple sources authorizing judicial review of arbitration awards, we therefore deem inaccurate the implication in these earlier cases that \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) is the sole source of the court\u2019s power of review.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. Although <em>Garrity </em>emphasizes that a public policy violation is a separate common-law ground for the vacatur of an arbitration award, that decision does not stand for the proposition that a separate body of procedural law must apply to such claims. Accord <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Meader, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 355 (concluding that \u201cour comprehensive statutory scheme regarding arbitration, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-408 through 52-424, controls arbitration in this state where the common law is inconsistent with our statutory scheme\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\"> Finally, the plaintiff relies on the well established proposition that a \u201cchallenge that an award is in contravention of public policy is premised on the fact that the parties cannot expect an arbitration award approving conduct which is illegal or contrary to public policy to receive judicial endorsement any more than parties can expect a court to enforce such a contract between them. . . . When a challenge to the arbitrator\u2019s authority is made on public policy grounds, however, the court is not concerned with the correctness of the arbitrator\u2019s decision but with the lawfulness of enforcing the award.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>New England Health Care Employees Union, </em>271 Conn. 127, 135, 855 A.2d 964 (2004). The plaintiff contends that the issue in the present case \u201cconcerns the protection of the court,\u201d which will be \u201cforce[d] . . . into the role of enforcing awards which are against public policy ... if [it] accepts the argument that public policy concerns cannot be addressed more than thirty days after notice of an arbitration decision.\u201d We disagree with the plaintiffs arguments because the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 52-420 (b), like other statutes of limitation, reflects alegislative balancing of two potentially competing public policies, namely, the need to assure the finality of arbitration awards rendered in an efficient private dispute resolution process, versus leaving intact awards that potentially may violate public policy. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 682, 888 A.2d 985 (\u201cThe fundamental purpose and effect of criminal statutes of limitation are the same as civil statutes of limitation .... [T]hey both represent a legislative judgment about the balance of equities in a situation involving the tardy assertion of otherwise valid rights: [t]he theory is that even if one has a just claim it is unjust not to put the adversary on notice to defend within the period of limitation and that the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S.
