The state appeals, following our grant of certification,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the Appellate Court reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment, rendered after a jury trial, convicting the defendant, Andre D. Martin, of attempt to possess one kilogram or more of marijuana with the intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 (b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 53a-49 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> possession of four ounces or more of a cannabis-type substance in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and conspiracy to possess one kilogram or more of marijuana with the intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 2 la-278 (b) and 53a-48 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>98 Conn. App. 458, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>459-60, 909 A.2d 547 (2006). On appeal, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict that the defendant was guilty of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree with the state. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court for consideration of the defendant\u2019s remaining claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found, and the relevant procedural history. \u201cAt the end of May, 2003, Donahue Hibbert, a special agent assigned to the Bridgeport office of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was contacted by Thomas Barbee, an agent with the Tucson, Arizona, office of the DEA. Barbee contacted Hibbert regarding a suspicious package that had been left at the Yellow Freight Company (Yellow Freight) in Tucson to mail to an address in Bridgeport. Although the address to which the package was to be mailed existed, a background investigation revealed that the name to whom the package was addressed was fictitious. On either May 31 or June 1, 2003, the DEA agreed to allow the package to be routed to Connecticut, but with delivery at the Yellow Freight facility in Middletown. No surveillance was conducted on the package in route.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u201cWhen the package arrived at the Middletown facility on June 9, 2003, Yellow Freight informed Hibbert, who had obtained a federal search warrant for the package prior to its arrival. Hibbert brought the package to the state police building located in Meriden, which is approximately five to ten miles from Yellow Freight. Together with state police, Hibbert opened the package, which was found to be a wooden crate. Inside were four white buckets that resembled five gallon paint buckets. Each bucket contained one or more large bun-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>dies heavily wrapped in plastic. Upon examining the material packed in the bundles, Hibbert believed the substance was marijuana on the basis of his extensive previous experience, but he did not perform a field test on the substance. Later laboratory tests confirmed that the substance in the package was marijuana, and the total weight of the material was approximately eighteen pounds. The marijuana, at the point of entry into the country, would sell wholesale for $400 to $500 per pound and would sell retail for $1000 to $1200 per pound. In the Bridgeport area, the marijuana would have a markup of three to four times the original retail price per pound.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u201cBecause the total weight of marijuana did not meet the threshold for federal prosecution, it was decided that the high intensity drug trafficking area task force, comprised of federal, state and local officials, would seek state prosecution of any violation of the state drug dependency laws. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office decided that all but 4.4 ounces of the marijuana would be removed from the package. The package then was filled to approximate its original weight. Jeremy DiPietro, a detective with the Bridgeport police department, and a state trooper took over the investigation and, on the evening of June 9, 2003, the state trooper, working undercover, telephoned the person Yellow Freight was to contact to pick up the package. He told the person to pick up the package at approximately noon the following day. On June 10, 2003, the trooper and DiPietro transferred the package from the state police office back to Yellow Freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u201cOn June 10,2003, police setup surveillance of Yellow Freight and the immediate surrounding area. Hibbert and DiPietro were at \u2018point of contact\u2019 in the Yellow Freight parking lot, approximately 2000 feet from the loading dock. William Brooks, a detective with the Bridgeport police department, was located in the load<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ing dock area conducting video surveillance. Edwin Kohl, a state detective assigned to the statewide cooperative crime control task force with the DEA in Bridgeport, conducted aerial surveillance from a DEA plane using binoculars and a camera. The surveillance operation of the Yellow Freight facility on June 10, 2003, revealed the following scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u201cAt approximately 12:15 p.m., a tan Mitsubishi Galant entered the lower parking lot of the Yellow Freight complex with a man driving and a woman in the front passenger seat. The woman, later identified as Janine Crockett, got out of the car and spoke with a Yellow Freight representative. The man in the car [Keith Man-gan] appeared to be talking on a cellular telephone as Crockett reappeared, spoke to him and then got back into the car. The car left the lot and turned onto Country Club Road, where it rendezvoused with another vehicle, a maroon Chevrolet, for approximately one to two minutes. The tan Mitsubishi then returned, and Crockett again got out of the vehicle, this time holding an unidentifiable object in her left hand. When she again returned to the vehicle, it backed up to the loading dock, and [Mangan] made a call on [a] telephone. A Yellow Freight employee brought the package to the individuals in the vehicle. The package at first was too large to maneuver into the vehicle, and Crockett had to move up her seat in order to fit the package in the backseat. The Yellow Freight employee handed [Mangan] a signature receipt, and he, in turn, gave it to Crockett. Crockett refused to sign the receipt and handed it back to [Mangan], who signed it himself and returned it to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u201cSome time after the tan Mitsubishi completed its first trip into the Yellow Freight parking lot, but before its second trip, during which its occupants picked up the package, the maroon Chevrolet entered the lot and drove into the lower parking lot where Hibbert and DiPietro were located. The vehicle, which was occupied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>by two men, one of whom later was identified as the defendant,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> drove slowly around the lot. It then stopped, and the defendant, who was a passenger in the vehicle, got out of the car. The defendant was out of the vehicle for fewer than five minutes, during which time he walked around the lot, casually looking at the vehicles in the lot as he passed them. He then returned to the vehicle, and the Chevrolet left the lot.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, the tan Mitsubishi returned, and the package was picked up.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u201cWhen the tan Mitsubishi left the lot after the package was picked up, it was driven away from the entrance ramp to Interstate 91 and again rendezvoused with the maroon Chevrolet.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Then both vehicles merged onto Interstate 91 southbound and together traveled to 98 Holly Street in Bridgeport.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As they traveled, the two vehicles maintained a consistent distance from each other, remained primarily in the right lane and traveled within the speed limit; the vehicles did not make any quick lane changes or do anything else to attract atten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tion. The surveillance team maintained sight of the vehicles until they reached their destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u201cAfter the vehicles reached the Holly Street residence, an individual, later identified as . . . Mangan, was seen bringing the package into the house. The defendant testified that he helped Mangan carry the crate up the stairs in front of the house. The maroon Chevrolet was not seen in front of the house again after the defendant left it and entered the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u201cThe surveillance team waited several minutes after seeing the package brought into the house before executing the search and seizure warrant. It was understood by the officers executing the warrant that all people involved were to be arrested. When Hibbert, who was the first officer at the front door of the house, approached, a woman identified as Diana York was on the porch. Hibbert identified himself, and York ran inside and slammed the front door shut. An officer behind Hibbert opened the door with a breach tool, and Hibbert entered the apartment. York was just inside the front door, and the defendant was approximately twelve feet from the door, in the living room. Mangan was in the bedroom, which was off to the left. Hibbert told everyone to get on the floor, and everyone, including the defendant, was compliant. Hibbert located the crate, still sealed, in the bathroom, inside a freestanding tub and concealed by a shower curtain. The defendant and Mangan were equidistant from the bathroom where the package was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\u201cHibbert conducted a patdown search of the defendant. The defendant was in possession of a wallet, a cellular telephone, an $800 check and $1291 in cash.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The cash was comprised of a few fifty dollar bills, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>mostly twenty, ten and five dollar bills. The defendant told Hibbert that the cash was for a car payment he had to make on his Mercedes Benz, which was being repaired that day. The defendant did not have any weapons, drugs, or drug paraphernalia on his person. After the defendant was arrested, Hibbert checked his name with the narcotic and dangerous drugs information systems, which revealed that the defendant had no past drug related offenses and was not the subject of a current drug related investigation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 98 Conn. App. 460-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Judge Schaller dissented from the majority opinion of the Appellate Court, and his separate opinion sets forth the following testimony that was elicited from the defendant on cross-examination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant \u201cstated that he believed the crate contained a transmission<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and claimed essentially that he was doing a favor for a friend.\u201d Id., 486 <em>(Schaller, J., </em>dissenting). \u201cAlthough he had been living in Connecticut for at least four years prior to the trial, the defendant did not have a Connecticut driver\u2019s license. He initially had a New York driver\u2019s license and then obtained a Florida driver\u2019s license in March, 2003. The defendant never resided at the addresses listed on either of his driver\u2019s licenses, and his personal vehicle was registered to a post office box in New Rochelle, New York. The defendant used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>his false Florida address to rent the Chevrolet that was used on June 10, 2003.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant admitted that he never had paid taxes to either the state or federal government, although he indicated that he believed he paid taxes to the government when making car insurance payments. The defendant was unable to account for the origin of money he used to pay for rent, food for himself and his family, car payments and jewelry, especially during periods of time when he claimed not to have had a job and was receiving welfare payments from the state. The defendant could not indicate clearly the dates during which he was employed, and evidence was presented that he had lied to Hibbert about his job, stating that he was unemployed on June 10, 2003, but that his prior job was as a graphic designer when, in fact, he worked in a hair salon.\u201d Id., 465-66. \u201cThe defendant admitted that he had a prior felony conviction for assaulting his girlfriend in 1999. Due to his immigration status, another felony conviction likely would result in his deportation to Jamaica.\u201d Id., 486 (Schaller, <em>J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The state charged the defendant with attempt to possess one kilogram or more of marijuana with the intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 (b) and 53a-49 (count one), possession of four ounces or more of a cannabis-type substance in violation of \u00a7 21a-279 (b) (count two), and conspiracy to possess one kilogram or more of marijuana with the intent to sell in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 2 1a-278 (b), 21a-277 (b) and 53a-48 (a) (count three). <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 98 Conn. App. 459-60. After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted on all counts, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of twelve years imprisonment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that \u201cthe state presented insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he (1) had dominion and control over the marijuana and (2) had knowledge that marijuana was contained in the package.\u201d Id., 466. The Appellate Court issued a divided opinion, and the majority determined that the state had failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had knowledge that the package contained marijuana, a necessary element of all three counts. Id., 469-70, 473. Specifically, the Appellate Court concluded that, although the evidence presented by the state \u201cmay show that the defendant knew he was engaging in some type of illicit activity ... [it does] not show that he knew the precise nature of the contents of the package. \u201d Id., 470. Accordingly, the Appellate Court majority \u201cagree [d] with the defendant that the state presented insufficient evidence that he knew the contents of the package.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 466. The Appellate Court, therefore, reversed the judgment of the trial court, without reaching the rest of the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>it remanded the case with direction to render a judgment of not guilty. Id., 473. This certified appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On appeal to this court, the state relies largely on Judge Schaller\u2019s dissent in claiming that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove an essential element of all three charges \u2014 namely, the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the package contained marijuana \u2014 and that reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction was, therefore, required.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Specifically, the state agrees with the dissent\u2019s determination that sufficient circumstantial evidence has been presented which, in the aggregate, allowed the jury reasonably to find that the defendant was an active participant in a conspiracy to possess with the intent to sell one kilogram or more of marijuana, and, as a result, there was also sufficient evidence to convict the defendant of the other charges under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine. See <em>Pinkerton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>U.S. 640, 647-48, 66 S. Ct. 1180, 90 L. Ed. 1489 (1946) (if evidence is sufficient to show that one member of conspiracy committed substantive offense within scope of and in furtherance of conspiracy, then all coconspira-tors are responsible for committing substantive offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In response, the defendant argues that the state presented neither direct nor circumstantial evidence that he knew the package contained marijuana. In addition, the defendant argues that the case law relied on by the state is inapposite because: (1) the defendant was not in exclusive possession of the apartment wherein the package was discovered, nor did he rent or live in the apartment; (2) the marijuana within the package was not in plain view; (3) the law enforcement officers never witnessed an illegal drug transaction take place; and (4) the evidence in cases wherein the defendants were found to have knowledge of a package\u2019s narcotic contents were substantially stronger than in the present case. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u201cThe standard of review we apply to a claim of insufficient evidence is well established. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\u201cWe note that the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u201cMoreover, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. . . . It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. ... In evaluating evidence, the [finder] of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The [finder of fact] may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u201cFinally, [a]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [finder of fact], would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [finder of fact\u2019s] verdict of guilty. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>275 Conn. 534, 542-43, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1082, 126 S.

The state must also show intent on the part of the accused that conduct constituting a crime be performed. . . .' The existence of a formal agreement between the parties need not be proved; it is sufficient to show that they are knowingly engaged in a mutual plan to do a forbidden act. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u201c[I]t is not necessary to establish that the defendant and his coconspirators signed papers, shook hands, or uttered the words we have an agreement. . . .

App. 481 <em>(Schaller, J., </em>dissenting). \u201c[T]o prove illegal possession of a narcotic substance, it is necessary to establish that the defendant knew the character of the substance, knew of its presence and exercised dominion and control over it. . . . Where . . . the [narcotics were] not found on the defendant\u2019s person, the state must proceed on the theory of constructive possession, that is, possession without direct physical contact. . . . One factor that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>be considered in determining whether a defendant is in constructive possession of narcotics is whether he is in possession of the premises where the narcotics are found. . . . Where the defendant is not in exclusive possession of the premises where the narcotics are found, it may not be inferred that [the defendant] knew of the presence of the narcotics and had control of them, unless there are other incriminating statements or circumstances tending to buttress such an inference.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>249 Conn. 218, 225, 733 A.2d 156 (1999). \u201cWhile mere presence is not enough to support an inference of dominion or control, where there are other pieces of evidence tying the defendant to dominion and control, the [finder of fact is] entitled to consider the fact of [the defendant\u2019s] presence and to draw inferences from that presence and the other circumstances linking [the defendant] to the crime.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>94 Conn.

The defendant claims that he was <em>not part of that conspiracy </em>because he did not know the package contained marijuana, but rather thought that he merely was helping a friend pick up and deliver a vehicle transmission. We conclude that the following evidence, outlined by Judge Schaller in his dissenting opinion, more than adequately highlights why a jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant was an active member of the conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201c[T]he defendant participated in extensive maneuvers involving the acceptance of the delivery of marijuana. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>amount of contraband involved exceeded the amount for personal use<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and could be sold for a substantial profit.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant actively contributed to the plan by scouting the parking lot of the Yellow Freight location,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> by providing a cellular telephone to help with communication,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and by participating in safely trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>porting the marijuana from Middletown to Bridgeport.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> These activities were described by law enforcement witnesses as <em>countersurveillance </em>techniques.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The state adduced testimony that when large quantities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>of drags are transported, greater precautions are taken to prevent discovery by law enforcement.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In other words, the jury heard evidence that the use of countersurveillance is integrally related to the transportation of larger quantities of drags. Additionally, the defendant lied to the arresting officer about his employment as a graphic designer.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> He had sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>cash<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> on his person at the time of arrest to purchase approximately one pound of marijuana, which could in turn be sold for a significant profit.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> His explanations for his unverified employment history, the source of income that permitted him to possess two expensive automobiles<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> were weak, at best. Moreover, his attempt to explain the suspicious activities regarding his fraudulent car registration,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> multiple driver\u2019s licenses<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the maimer in which he rented the maroon vehicle were unconvincing. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s assertion that the crate contained a transmission was unavailing in light of the evidence that there were no tools or equipment for installing the transmission and that the box was stored in a bathtub with the shower curtain drawn.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Finally, the credibility of the defendant was subject to severe scrutiny on the basis not only of his prior felony conviction,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> but on the basis of the fact that he faced likely deportation.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> (Emphasis in origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>nal.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 98 Conn. 487-88 <em>(Schaller, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"AE7\">After careful review of the cumulative evidence adduced at trial, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we conclude that there was ample circumstantial evidence for the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was an active participant in the conspiracy to possess one kilogram or more of marijuana with the intent to sell in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 (b) and 53a-48. As stated by Judge Schaller in his dissent, \u201cconsidering the evidence presented by the state, it was the jury\u2019s province to determine whether the defendant was an innocent bystander or an active participant in the criminal conspiracy.

We therefore conclude that sufficient evidence existed to convict the defendant of conspiracy to possess one kilogram or more of marijuana with the intent to sell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>and, accordingly, the jury\u2019s verdict must stand with respect to count three.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">We next address the Appellate Court majority\u2019s concern about the potential deleterious impact a decision affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction would have on future cases. Specifically, the Appellate Court majority concluded: \u201cTo hold that these facts are sufficient to satisfy the knowledge element in a possession of narcotics charge would expose to criminal culpability the innocent bystanders that this requirement was meant to protect.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 98 Conn. App. 471-72. In reaching that conclusion, the Appellate Court relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Parent, </em>8 Conn. App. 469, 473, 513 A.2d 725 (1986), in which the court determined that \u201cmere acceptance of a package containing narcotics is an insufficient basis for an inference of knowledge of its contents; otherwise the recipient of the package would be liable to conviction, not because of the criminality of his own behavior but because of the wholly unilateral act of the sender.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) We agree with that proposition, but for all the aforementioned reasons, this defendant\u2019s active participation in the conspiracy to possess one kilogram or more of marijuana, with the intent to sell, made him more than simply an \u201cinnocent bystander.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">In this case, the innocent bystander concern was overcome by the cumulative evidence proffered by the state, such that a jury could make a permissible, not necessary, inference of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the contraband. In other words, the substantive impact of the circumstantial evidence, taken as a whole, permits an inference of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the marijuana in the package. This inference is further buttressed by the fact that the defendant in the present case <em>actively participated </em>in the overall acceptance and delivery of the package, including, but not limited to, activity that law enforcement officers testified to as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>being consistent with known countersurveillance techniques. We agree, therefore, with Judge Schaller\u2019s dissent in concluding that \u201c[t]he jury in this case had ample evidence on which to conclude that the defendant was not merely \u2018in the wrong place at the wrong time,\u2019 but was in fact a willing participant in a criminal conspiracy to transport and sell a significant quantity of marijuana.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 98 Conn. App. 491-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">As the jury could have inferred, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was guilty of conspiracy to possess one kilogram or more of marijuana with the intent to sell, we further conclude that sufficient evidence was proffered by the state to convict the defendant, by operation of <em>Pinkerton </em>liability, of the first two counts as well \u2014 specifically, of attempt to possess one kilogram or more of marijuana with the intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 (b) and 53a-49, and of possession of four ounces or more of a cannabis-type substance in violation of \u00a7 21a-279 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u201cThis court first explicitly adopted the <em>Pinkerton </em>principle of vicarious liability for purposes of our state criminal law in <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 630 A.2d 990 (1993). Under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, which, as of the date of our decision in <em>Walton, </em>was a recognized part of federal criminal conspiracy jurisprudence . . . a conspirator may be held liable for criminal offenses committed by a coconspirator that are within the scope of the conspiracy, are in furtherance of it, and are reasonably foreseeable as a necessary or natural consequence of the conspiracy. . . . The rationale for the principle is that, when the conspirator [has] played a necessary part in setting in motion a discrete course of criminal conduct, he should be held responsible, within appropriate limits, for the crimes committed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>a natural and probable result of that course of conduct. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u201cWe concluded in <em>Walton </em>that the <em>Pinkerton </em>principle was applicable in state criminal cases, reasoning, first, that <em>Pinkerton </em>liability is not inconsistent with our penal code and, therefore, that we were not prohibited from recognizing that theory of criminal liability as a matter of state common law. . . . Without foreclosing the use of the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine in other circumstances, we then concluded that application of the doctrine was appropriate in <em>Walton, </em>in which [1] the defendant was a leader of the conspiracy, [2] the offense for which vicarious liability was sought to be imposed was an object of the conspiracy and [3] the offense was proved by one or more of the overt acts alleged in support of the conspiracy charge. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><em>\u201cIn State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>[237 Conn. 518, 679 A.2d 902 (1996)], we were required to decide whether to extend the principle of vicarious liability that we adopted in <em>Walton </em>to a case in which not all of [the three <em>Walton] </em>conditions have been met, a question that we expressly reserved in <em>Walton. </em>... In <em>Diaz, </em>the defendant had been convicted of, inter alia, murder under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine and conspiracy to commit murder. . . . The evidence showed that the defendant, along with several other individuals, had fired multiple gunshots into a motor vehicle occupied by the victim and three others. . . . The victim was struck and killed by a single bullet. . . . The defendant claimed on appeal that the court\u2019s instruction under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine had been improper because, among other reasons, it was broader than the limited version of the doctrine recognized in <em>Walton. . . . </em>This court acknowledged that the state had not proved that the defendant was the leader of the conspiracy to ambush the vehicle and its occupants and, thus, had not established the first condition for <em>Pinkerton </em>liability set forth in <em>Walton. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>. . . We noted, however, that the evidence reasonably established that the defendant was a fully engaged member of the conspiracy who had actively participated in the shooting and that he, along with his coconspirators, intended to kill one or more of the vehicle\u2019s passengers. . . . We concluded that where . . . the defendant was a full partner in the illicit venture and the coconspirator conduct for which the state has sought to hold him responsible was integral to the achievement of the conspiracy\u2019s objectives, the defendant cannot reasonably complain that it is unfair to hold him vicariously liable, under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, for such criminal conduct. . . . We further concluded that <em>Pinkerton </em>liability may be imposed even if none of the three <em>Walton </em>conditions is present. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u201cWe also acknowledged, however, that there may be occasions when it would be unreasonable to hold a defendant criminally liable for offenses committed by his coconspirators even though the state has demonstrated technical compliance with the <em>Pinkerton </em>rule. . . . For example, a factual scenario may be envisioned in which the nexus between the defendant\u2019s role in the conspiracy and the illegal conduct of a coconspirator is so attenuated or remote, notwithstanding the fact that the latter\u2019s actions were a natural consequence of the unlawful agreement, that it would be unjust to hold the defendant responsible for the criminal conduct of his coconspirator. In such a case, a <em>Pinkerton </em>charge would not be appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>263 Conn. 478, 491-93, 820 A.2d 1024 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">As discussed previously, the defendant\u2019s role in the present case was neither too attenuated, nor too remote, from the illegal conduct of his coconspirators to preclude <em>Pinkerton </em>liability, because sufficient evidence shows that he actively participated in the overall acceptance and delivery of the package containing marijuana. Thus, after review of the cumulative evidence adduced at trial, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we conclude that there is also ample evidence to support a jury\u2019s conclusion that the defendant is guilty \u2014 beyond a reasonable doubt and by operation of <em>Pinkerton </em>liability\u2014 of counts one and two, namely, of (1) attempt to possess one kilogram or more of marijuana with the intent to sell in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 (b) and 53a-49, and (2) possession of four ounces or more of a cannabis-type substance in violation of \u00a7 2la-279 (b).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We conclude, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>therefore, that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict with respect to all three counts.
