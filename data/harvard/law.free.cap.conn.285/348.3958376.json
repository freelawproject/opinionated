See <em>Evanuska </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>281 Conn. 923, 918 A.2d 270 (2007). The plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to compensation because they were injured while performing actions that fell within the definition of \u201c \u2018fire duties\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany other duty ordered to be performed by a superior or commanding officer in the fire department . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 (a). We conclude that the commissioner applied an incorrect interpretation of the statute to the facts at hand, and, therefore, the case must be remanded to the commissioner. Accordingly, we reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">By way of background, we note the following undisputed facts. The Danbury fire department is comprised of two components: a paid fire department and volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>teer fire companies. Danbury Code \u00a7 8-1 (b). There are twelve volunteer fire companies, each of which consists of such officers and firefighters as prescribed by that company\u2019s charter or bylaws. Id., \u00a7 8-3. The Germantown hose company (fire company), housed in the Germantown firehouse in Danbury, is one such volunteer company. Id. It has a two part management structure: a board of managers and a set of officers (chief, assistant chief, captain and lieutenants). The board of managers is responsible for the administrative and business functions of the fire company. The board of managers has no responsibility for the fire fighting activities of the fire company; the officers are responsible for overseeing those activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The commissioner\u2019s decision reflects the following findings of fact. The roof facade of the Germantown firehouse was in need of repair. In October, 2002, at the regular monthly meeting of the fire company\u2019s board of managers, \u201ca \u2018work party\u2019 . . . was invited to volunteer their time and to assemble on [Friday] October 18, and [Saturday] October 19, 2002. No one was ordered to be at the work party.\u201d On October 19, 2002, the plaintiffs . . . were active Germantown volunteer firefighters. On that day, while the plaintiffs, \u201cboth of whom had agreed to donate their time, were on a scaffold erected for the purpose of facilitating the repairs to the roof shingles, the scaffold collapsed causing the two men to fall to the ground some [fifteen] feet below .... Both suffered serious injuries requiring hospital and medical treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u201cJames LaClair, [vice chairman of the fire company\u2019s board of managers at the time of the incident] stated that active members were obligated to attend work parties such as the one in effect on October 19, 2002, unless the member\u2019s primary job or some family obligation prevented their attending. . . . The application for membership in the [fire company] . . . listed participa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>tion in company \u2018work nights\u2019 as a duty expected of a volunteer firefighter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> . . . LaClair stated that disciplinary action could be taken against active members for their failure to appear at work parties. . . . The [b]oard of [m]anagers required that [fire fighting] officers be in charge of work parties in order to reinforce the chain of command in place when fighting fires. . . . Karl Leach [chief of the fire company at the time of the incident] gave direction[s] or orders to the members of the work party as to just what he wanted them to do with regard to the re-roofing of the building, notwithstanding that all volunteers of the work party each had a working knowledge, if not an expertise, in construction or in a related field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In light of, or despite, these facts, the commissioner determined that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that they sustained their injuries while performing \u201c \u2018fire duties,\u2019 \u201d as defined by \u00a7 7-314 (a), the necessary predicate for compensation under General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commissioner concluded that, \u201c[w]hile the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>[plaintiffs] allege and rely on the sentence of [\u00a7] 7-314 (a) \u2018any other duty ordered to be performed by a superior or commanding officer in the fire department\u2019 as the basis for establishing a claim, they fail to produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>evidence that this statute was intended to cover injuries sustained in other than training or firefighting situations. ... No member of the work party was ever ordered to be at the work site. It was truly a noble gesture on the part of all who participated in the volunteer effort, but it was voluntary. . . . The \u2018orders\u2019 or \u2018directions\u2019 given by [Leach] at the work site were no more nor less than what a project manager or foreman would do on any construction job.\u201d The commissioner therefore dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the plaintiffs appealed from the decision to the board, which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b, the plaintiffs then appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the decision. <em>Evanuska </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>99 Conn. App. 42, 912 A.2d 545 (2007). The Appellate Court reasoned that, \u201c[b]ecause the legislature specifically requires that the activities covered be \u2018fire duties\u2019 and enumerates a list of particular duties that are included within the definition of that phrase, we conclude that the legislature did not intend that all duties expected of volunteer firefighters be covered under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.]. The definition of fire duties under [\u00a7 7-314 (a)], as opposed to activities firefighters are expected to perform pursuant to the [fire] company\u2019s application for membership, is determinative of which duties entitle the volunteer firefighters to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Thus, whether the plaintiffs were <em>ordered, </em>meaning commanded or required, to attend and participate in the event is controlling, not whether they were merely <em>expected </em>to be there.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 48-49. The Appellate Court concluded that it was bound by the commissioner\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs were not ordered to attend the work party, citing as support for that finding a written statement in the record from Leach that \u201c[participation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>event] was all voluntary, at no time were the men who showed up ordered to be there. . . . My understanding was that no one felt obligated to do it. Again, I never told any of the volunteers they had to be there. . . . [T]he [b]oard of [m]anagers have no authority to order volunteers to do anything. The only place we can order someone is at the scene of an emergency.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Judge Gruendel wrote separately to emphasize that the commissioner\u2019s findings were inconsistent with respect to whether the plaintiffs had been ordered to participate in work nights. Id., 51 (Gruendel, <em>J., </em>concurring). He noted: \u201cThe majority reconciles the incongruity between those findings and the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that \u2018[n]o member of the work [night] was ever ordered to be at the work site\u2019 by stating that there is \u2018a distinction between an expectation and a command.\u2019 . . . To my mind, the commissioner\u2019s factual findings indicate that, although the chief of the [fire] company never expressly commanded their participation, the plaintiffs and other members nevertheless were required to take part in work nights if they wanted to remain with the [fire] company. In the face of that reality, the argument that the participation merely was expected fails.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 52-53 <em>(Gruendel, J., </em>concurring). Judge Gruendel nonetheless agreed that the board\u2019s decision should be affirmed in light of the commissioner\u2019s finding, which was supported by Leach\u2019s statement, that no one had been \u201cordered\u201d to participate in the work party. Id., 53 <em>(Gruendel, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In their certified appeal to this court, the plaintiffs claim that, because Germantown volunteer firefighters were obligated to participate in work parties, were subject to potential discipline for failing to participate in such activities and were under the direction and supervision of Leach, the fire company\u2019s chief, while per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>forming the particular activity at issue here, then-actions fell within the definition of \u201c \u2018fire duties\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany other duty ordered to be performed by a superior or commanding officer in the fire department . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 (a). We conclude that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the decision of the board because the commissioner applied an incorrect interpretation of \u00a7 7-314 (a) to the facts at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">It is well settled that \u201c[t]he conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coppola v. Logistec Connecticut, Inc., </em>283 Conn. 1, 6, 925 A.2d 257 (2007). \u201cBecause the relevant aspects of [\u00a7 7-314 (a)] have been subjected neither to previous judicial scrutiny nor to a time-tested interpretation by the board, [however] we afford no special deference to the [interpretation] of the board. . . . Instead, we exercise the plenary review we otherwise apply to such questions of law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pizzuto </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mental Retardation, </em>283 Conn. 257, 264, 927 A.2d 811 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 264-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>In considering the meaning of the term fire duties, we also must be mindful that the crux of the issue is whether the plaintiffs are entitled to receive compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. See General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a (a). Indeed, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-314a and 7-314b<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are the only procedural vehicles available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>for volunteer firefighters to obtain workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries sustained while performing fire duties, even when such injuries prevent them from performing at their regular, paid employment. Therefore, just as we do when construing the predicates to compensation for claims brought directly under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, we similarly construe any ambiguities in the predicate to compensation under \u00a7 7-314 (a) liberally, mindful of the statute\u2019s remedial purpose. See <em>Gartrell v. Dept. of Correction, </em>259 Conn. 29, 41, 787 A.2d 541 (2002) (citing humanitarian purpose and broad construction of workers\u2019 compensation scheme in context of appeal addressing whether injury arose out of employment); <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 557, 573 A.2d 1 (1990) (noting with respect to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 7-433b [b], which provide survivors\u2019 benefits and heart and hypertension disease benefits for police officers and firefighters, \u201c[w]e can . . . look for guidance to the proposition that all workers\u2019 compensation legislation, because of its remedial nature, should be broadly construed in favor of disabled employees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In order to determine whether the facts found by the commissioner resulted from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts, we first turn to the meaning of the phrase \u201cany other duty ordered to be performed by a superior or commanding officer . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 (a). We recognize, as did the Appellate Court, that the pertinent terms are not defined by statute. See <em>Evanuska </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>supra, 99 Conn. App. 46-47. Accordingly, we turn to the common meaning of those terms, as directed by General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). <em>See Hummel v. Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>282 Conn. 477, 498, 923 A.2d 657 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">A \u201cduty\u201d is defined as \u201cconduct due to . . . superiors . . . obligatory tasks, conduct, service, or functions that arise from one\u2019s position\u201d; Webster\u2019s Ninth New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Collegiate Dictionary (1983); or \u201c[a]n act or a course of action that is exacted of one by position, social custom, law or religion ... [a] service assigned or demanded of one . . . .\u201d American Heritage Dictionary (New College Ed. 1978). To \u201corder\u201d means to \u201cgive a command or instruction that (something) be done . . . .\u201d American Heritage Dictionary, supra; see also Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, supra (\u201cto give an order for . . . COMMAND\u201d). A \u201csuperior\u201d is a person \u201chigher in rank, station, or authority: a superior officer\u201d; American Heritage Dictionary, supra; accord Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, supra (\u201cof higher rank, quality or importance\u201d). To be an officer in \u201ccommand\u201d means \u201c[t]o direct with authority; give orders to\u201d; American Heritage Dictionary, supra; or \u201cto have or exercise direct authority: GOVERN . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, supra. Thus, in order to obtain compensation, the plaintiffs must have had an obligation, due to their position as volunteer firefighters, to perform firehouse repairs; they must have been commanded or instructed to make the repairs; and that instruction must have come from a person or persons of higher rank or authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In contrast to this inquiiy, the commissioner indicated that he construed the statute to require that the injuries must have been sustained in a training or fire fighting situation, stating: \u201cWhile the [plaintiffs] allege and rely on the sentence of [\u00a7] 7-314 (a) \u2018any other duty ordered to be performed by a superior or commanding officer in the fire department\u2019 as the basis for establishing a claim, they fail to produce evidence that this statute was intended to cover injuries sustained in other than training or [fire fighting] situations.\u201d Indeed, the commissioner determined that the statute must be read narrowly and equated \u201c \u2018fire duties\u2019 \u201d with fire fighting: \u201c[Section] 7-314 (a) is a very specific statute enacted by the legislature to provide relief from a shortfall wherein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>volunteer firefighters had previously been denied the benefits of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] if they suffered an injury while performing volunteer <em>[fire fighting] services </em>to the municipality. Its provisions must be adhered to without expansion or interpretation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This limited construction, however, is unsupported by the text of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Had the legislature intended the construction applied by the commissioner, it expressly could have limited the phrase included in \u00a7 7-314 (a) \u2014 \u201cany other duty ordered to be performed\u201d \u2014 by adding the language <em>\u201cwhile fire fighting or </em>training.\u201d Indeed, such duties would appear to be subsumed within the enumerated fire duties of \u201cduties performed while at fires, while answering alarms of fire, while answering calls for mutual aid assistance, while returning from calls for mutual aid assistance, while directly returning from fires, while at fire drills . . . [or] while instructing or being instructed in fire duties . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 (a). To the extent that some training exercise arguably might fall outside the scope of fire drills or instruction in fire duties, \u00a7 7-314a (a) already addresses any such situation by providing compensation for injuries \u201cincurred while in training for . . . volunteer fire duty. . . .\u201d Thus, the commissioner\u2019s construction fails to give independent meaning to the phrase at issue\u2014 \u201cany other duty ordered to be performed by a superior or commanding officer,\u201d a result that we cannot counte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>nance. See <em>Interlude, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skurat, </em>266 Conn. 130, 147, 831 A.2d 235 (2003) (\u201c[w]e generally reject a construction that renders any portion of a statute superfluous\u201d). We also note that the legislature could have limited the scope of the phrase by providing that fire duties include any other duty <em>\u201cperformed in connection with the aforementioned </em>duties\u201d or any other duty <em>\u201crelated to the aforementioned </em>duties.\u201d It did not do so. Rather, the legislature added a catch-all provision for \u201cany other duty\u201d to the already expansive list of \u201cfire duties\u201d in \u00a7 7-314 (a), limited only by the requirement that a superior or commanding officer order the duty to be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Notable by contrast, one of the two possible procedural routes to obtain workers\u2019 compensation benefits for volunteer firefighters has a narrower definition of \u201c \u2018lire duties\u2019 \u201d that is more in concert with the commissioner\u2019s construction. Under \u00a7 7-314b, if active volunteer firefighters both have been injured while performing \u201cfire duties\u201d <em>and </em>are unable to perform regular employment duties, they may collect workers\u2019 compensation benefits based on either the salary of their employment or the amount that otherwise applies under \u00a7 7-314a, the average production wage in the state, whichever is greater. See footnotes 4 and 6 of this opinion for the full text of \u00a7\u00a7 7-314a and 7-314b. \u201c \u2018[F]ire duties\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 7-314b (b) is defined as \u201cduties performed while at fires, answering alarms of fire, answering calls for mutual aid assistance, returning from calls for mutual aid assistance, at fire drills or training exercises, and directly returning from fires . . . .\u201d The legislature\u2019s failure similarly to limit the definition of \u201cfire duties\u201d under \u00a7 7-314 (a) when they enacted \u00a7 7-314b in 1995; see Public Acts 1995, No. 95-243, \u00a7 2; reinforces our conclusion that it did not intend for the scope of \u00a7 7-314 (a) to be limited to fire fighting or training situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>We emphasize, however, that a duty ordered to be performed under \u00a7 7-314 (a) necessarily is limited to tasks related to the job of being a volunteer <em>firefighter </em>both because a superior or commanding officer would lack authority (and hence the requisite superior or commanding status) to issue orders unrelated to the performance of that job and because a firefighter would lack any duty to perform tasks unrelated to his or her position as a firefighter. Thus, for example, if Leach had told the plaintiffs that they had to fix the roof on his house, that instruction could not constitute a duty ordered by the plaintiffs\u2019 commanding officer because Leach would have had no authority to order the plaintiffs to do so and they would have had no duty to fix Leach\u2019s roof. Tasks that a volunteer firefighter performs because of his or her position are not necessarily limited, however, to fire fighting or training. It is common knowledge that volunteer firefighters have been called on to perform community service calls, such as rescuing a cat stranded in a tree or providing fire safety lessons at a local school or to participate in fundraising activities necessary to support firehouse needs, to name but a few tasks that firefighters might be obligated to perform.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Indeed, as recognized in other jurisdictions, repairs and maintenance of the firehouse reasonably may be considered within the scope of a firefighter\u2019s duties. See, e.g., N.Y. Vol. Fire. Ben. Law \u00a7 3 (3) (McKinney Sup. 2008) (\u2018\u201c[ljine of duty\u2019 means the performance by a volunteer firefighter as a volunteer firefighter of the duties and activities described in subdivision one of section five of this chapter\u201d); N.Y. Vol. Fire. Ben. Law \u00a7 5 (1) (g) (McKinney Sup. 2008) (providing compensation for injuries sustained by volunteer firefighters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u201c[wjhile, within the state and pursuant to orders or authorization, working in connection with the construction, testing, inspection, repair or maintenance of . . . the firehouse and the fixtures, furnishings and equipment thereof\u2019); 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 1031 (a) (1) (2002) (providing supplemental definition of employee under Pennsylvania\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute to include \u201cmembers of volunteer fire departments or volunteer fire companies . . . who shall be entitled to receive compensation in case of injuries received while actively engaged as firemen ... or while repairing or doing other work about or on the fire apparatus or buildings and grounds of the fire company or fire department upon the authorization of the chief of the fire company or fire department or other person in charge\u201d). Undoubtedly, the legislature expressly could have listed firehouse maintenance as a fire duty, but it did not need to do so in light of its choice of the more expansive phrase \u201cany other duty ordered to be performed . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Even if we were to view the catch-all provision to require activities of like kind to the more specific enumerated activities; see <em>24 Leggett Street Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Beacon Industries, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 284, 297, 685 A.2d 305 (1996); that process would not yield a result limiting fire duties exclusively to fire fighting or training situations. Specifically, the legislature\u2019s inclusion of participation in parades as a fire duty is evidence that it intended for compensation to extend beyond injuries sustained in fire fighting or training situations. In the absence of any textual or extratextual evidence that the legislature intended to limit the terms under which compensation is available to volunteer firefighters other than to require that their injury was sustained when performing a duty ordered to be performed by a superior or commanding officer; see footnote 5 of this opinion; we lack authority to engraft such a limitation. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Laliberte </em>v. <em>United Security, Inc., </em>261 Conn. 181, 186, 801 A.2d 783 (2002) (\u201c[i]n the absence of any indication of the legislature\u2019s intent concerning this issue, we cannot engraft language onto the statute\u201d); <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>212 Conn. 727, 736, 563 A.2d 1347 (1989) (\u201c[a]bsent such language by the legislature, this court cannot \u2018engraft amendments into the statutory language\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Therefore, the commissioner improperly limited the meaning of \u201cany other duty ordered to be performed by a superior or commanding officer in the fire department\u201d under \u00a7 7-314 (a) to fire fighting or training situations. We are mindful that the commissioner expressly found that \u201c[n]o one was ordered to be at the work party\u201d; that the plaintiffs \u201chad agreed to donate their time\u201d; and that participation in the work party was \u201cvoluntary.\u201d We cannot ignore the fact, however, that the commissioner made these findings after viewing the evidence through an incorrect legal lens. Facts cannot stand if \u201cthey result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Logistec Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 283 Conn. 6. In light of the commissioner\u2019s improper conclusion that \u201c \u2018fire duties\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 7-314 (a) means fire fighting or training situations, it appears that he concluded that the plaintiffs could not, as a matter of law, have been ordered to perform a duty within the meaning of \u00a7 7-314 (a) because the roof repair was neither of those activities. Thus, the commissioner may not have credited testimony simply because it did not tend to prove that the plaintiffs were engaged in fire fighting or training activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">For example, the commissioner noted that LaClair had \u201cstated\u201d that the board of managers required active firefighters to attend work parties and that disciplinary action could be taken against the plaintiffs for failing to appear at work parties. The commissioner neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>expressly credited nor discredited that testimony; rather, he expressly found that the board of managers \u201chas no responsibility for <em>firefighting </em>activities of the fire company.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, it appears that the commissioner may not have considered whether any actions by the board of managers could have given rise to a \u201cduty ordered to be performed by a superior or commanding officer\u201d under \u00a7 7-314 (a) simply because that body had no authority regarding fire fighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The commissioner did make a finding crediting LaClair\u2019s testimony that \u201c[t]he [b]oard of [m]anagers required that [fire fighting] officers be in charge of work parties in order to reinforce the chain of command,\u201d but then he further concluded that the orders given by Leach at the work party \u201cwere no more nor less than what a project manager or foreman would do on any construction job.\u201d Although Leach\u2019s orders may have been of the same ilk as those that a project manager might issue, the pertinent questions in applying \u00a7 7-314 (a) were whether Leach was issuing such orders or instructions because of his position as a superior or commanding officer and whether the plaintiffs would have been obligated to obey orders or instructions issued due to Leach\u2019s position. To the extent that the commissioner suggested that a dispositive fact is whether persons other than firefighters could perform the task, we reject such a view because the same could be said for many activities performed by firefighters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>In light of our conclusion that the commissioner applied an improper interpretation of \u00a7 7-314 (a) to the evidence before him, the commissioner must review the evidence anew, applying the proper interpretation. See <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Courthouse One, </em>239 Conn. 676, 693, 687 A.2d 146 (1997); <em>Shimko </em>v. <em>Ferro </em>Corp., 40 Conn. App. 409, 415, 671 A.2d 376, cert. denied, 236 Conn. 916, 673 A.2d 1143 (1996). We caution the commissioner in reviewing the evidence de novo that he should apply the catch-all provision \u201cany other duty ordered to be performed\u201d mindful of the unique nature, in the realm of workers\u2019 compensation, of volunteer fire fighting. Every time a volunteer firefighter responds to a fire or emergency call or undertakes any action in his or her capacity as a firefighter, he or she is volunteering or donating time. Unlike a paid employee, a volunteer firefighter cannot be docked pay or deprived of employment benefits if he or she fails to meet attendance or other job requirements. Rather, as the evidence in the present case suggests, firefighters may be subject to disciplinary action or dismissal for failure to meet such requirements. Indeed, the Germantown fire company\u2019s application indicates that a volunteer firefighter cannot be <em>required </em>to attend any specific activity, including answering a fire call, because, for example, that task may conflict with regular employment obligations. Thus, when applying \u00a7 7-314 (a), the commissioner carefully must assess testimony stating that volunteer firefighters \u201cdonated\u201d or \u201cvolunteered\u201d time or were \u201cordered\u201d to attend an event. For example, although Leach indicated that he construes the term \u201cordered\u201d to encompass only commands issued at the scene of a fire, the commissioner was bound to apply a broader meaning of \u201cordered\u201d under \u00a7 7-314 (a), because, as we previously have explained herein, the specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>enumerated fire duty of \u201cduties performed while at fires\u201d already encompasses the narrow classification of orders to which Leach referred.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, when examining the record to determine if a \u201cduty [was] ordered to be performed by a superior or commanding officer\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 7-314 (a), the commissioner should consider whether the firefighter could decline the assignment without cause and without the possibility of adverse consequences rather than whether the firefighter \u201cvolunteered\u201d or \u201cdonated\u201d time. Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the board\u2019s decision affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claims must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the decision of the board and to order the board to remand the case to the commissioner for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\"> The commissioner\u2019s decision also addressed a claim by a third volunteer firefighter, David Evanuska, alleging injuries arising from the same incident. The commissioner dismissed David Evanuska\u2019s claim for failure to adduce evidence of any injury. David Evanuska apparently withdrew from the appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision and is not a party to this appeal.
