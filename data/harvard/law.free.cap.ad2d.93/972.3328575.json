Memorandum: From our review of the entire record, including the evidence submitted by the defense, we conclude that there is sufficient proof to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction of resisting arrest (Penal Law, \u00a7 205.30). His arrest was authorized since the police had reasonable cause to believe that he had committed the crime of reckless endangerment (see GPL 140.10, subd 1, par [b]; Penal Law, \u00a7 120.20). His later acquittal of this charge is of no consequence (see <em>People v Williams, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>25 NY2d 86, 89-90). Defendant\u2019s own testimony established that he was informed of the reason for his arrest (CPL 140.15, subd 2) \"and supplied any alleged deficiency in the People\u2019s proof (see <em>People v Kirkpatrick, </em>32 NY2d 17, 21, app dsmd 414 US 948; <em>People v Farina, </em>290 NY 272, 274). Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. (Appeal from judgment of Ontario County Court, Reed, J. \u2014 criminal mischief, third degree, and resisting arrest.)
