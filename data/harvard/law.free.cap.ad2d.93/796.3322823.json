Defendants appeal from so much of an order of the same court, dated July 27,1982, as denied that branch of their cross motion which sought dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s first cause of action for failure to state a cause of action. Appeal from the judgment entered July 27,1982 dismissed as academic. That judgment was superseded by the order dated October 18, 1982, made upon renewal. Order dated October 18, 1982 reversed, insofar as appealed from, judgment dated July 27, 1982 vacated, and upon renewal plaintiff\u2019s second and third causes of action reinstated. Order dated July 27,1982 affirmed insofar as appealed from. Plaintiff is awarded one bill of costs. It was error to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s second and third causes of action on the ground of <em>res judicata. </em>The second cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>action asserts a claim premised on the inconsistency between Local Law No. 3, as applied, and State laws and policies. That is a different cause of action than the pre-emption claim which was asserted and disposed of in a prior Federal action. The third cause of action is premised on State due process concerns, and asserts a cause of action that was not addressed by the Federal courts in disposing of plaintiff\u2019s Federal due process claim. The allegations of plaintiff\u2019s first cause of action adequately state a cause of action. Finally, we note that in light of our reinstatement of the second and third causes of action, plaintiff is free to once again seek preliminary injunctive relief from Special Term of the Supreme Court, Orange County, in the first instance. Damiani, J. P., Thompson, O\u2019Connor and Niehoff, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
