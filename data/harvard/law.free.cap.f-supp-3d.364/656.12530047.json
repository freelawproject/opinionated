The Motion argues that Plaintiff Beverly Smith's sole remaining claim for First Amendment retaliation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   should be dismissed because she has failed to establish either 1) a violation of a clearly established constitutional right or 2) that any city policy was the moving force before behind any such constitutional violation. The parties have fully briefed the Motion. Having considered the submissions of the parties, the record, and relevant law, the Court finds that Mayor Butler is entitled to qualified immunity, but the plaintiff has stated a cognizable \"cat's paw\" claim against the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Defendants' [46] Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case, which is brought pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , was removed from the Circuit Court of Madison County, Mississippi on January 8, 2018. Plaintiff Beverly Smith claims that she was unlawfully terminated from her position as office manager for the Department of Public Works for the City of Madison, Mississippi. According to Smith Mayor Mary Hawkins Butler fired her because the Mayor believed that Smith was campaigning for, or otherwise publicly supporting Gerald Steen, a Supervisor on the Madison County Board of Supervisors and a political rival of the Mayor. Smith says that, although she did not actually support or campaign for Gerald Steen, the Mayor believed she did and fired her because of it. Smith asserts that her termination violated her right to free speech under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 12, 2018, Defendants the City and Mayor Butler filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment. The Motion argues that Defendants are entitled to summary\n   judgment for several reasons: 1) Smith has failed to allege that she engaged in speech, 2) any speech in which Smith engaged was unprotected, 3) Smith fails to identify a City policy or practice that served as the moving force behind any alleged constitutional violation, and 4) Mayor Butler is entitled to qualified immunity from the claim against her individually. Smith contests each of these suppositions, maintaining that the law recognizes her claim and that she has put forward sufficient competent evidence of her claims to defeat summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.

Managerial discipline is certainly an important employer interest, but this interest is not reflected in the basis for termination Smith alleges. Smith testified at her deposition that Mayor Butler accused her of supporting Gerald Steen and campaigning against the Mayor in a conversation had at city hall on the day after the mayoral election in 2016. The Mayor, in her testimony, denied that she made this specific accusation, but acknowledged that the same referenced conversation occurred. Smith also testified that the Mayor and Gerald Steen were political rivals and that the Mayor disliked Gerald Steen. These statements find support in the Mayor's own deposition testimony. The Mayor testified that she thought Gerald Steen and Smith were trying to sabotage her campaign for mayor in order to strengthen Gerald Steen's future reelection campaign for county supervisor by damaging the Mayor's political goodwill. But the Mayor's testimony explicitly denied that any sabotage by Smith was the reason for her firing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Whether the basis for Smith's termination was in fact the Mayor's mistaken perception that Smith was publicly supporting Gerald Steen is a disputed issue of fact that the Court may not resolve on summary judgment. If Smith's testimony\n   is accepted as true, the Mayor believed that Smith had spoken as a citizen (expressing public support for another public figure was entirely unrelated to Smith's job at the Department of Public Works) and on matters of public concern (the merits of the positions expressed by public figures and political candidates is of quintessential public concern).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, the City argues that Smith has failed to identify any policy or custom that was the moving force behind the alleged violation of her First Amendment rights. Municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 may not be found on a theory of respondeat superior, but instead must be premised upon \"some official action or imprimatur.\"\n   <em>\n    Valle v.
