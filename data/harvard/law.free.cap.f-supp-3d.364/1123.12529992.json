Drozd, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the court on plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. (Doc. No. 18.) A hearing on the motion was held on November 20, 2018. Attorney Brian M. Weiss appeared telephonically on behalf of plaintiff Atlantic Casualty Insurance Company (\"ACIC\"), and Attorney Linda J. DeVore appeared in person on behalf of defendant Sam Crum Water Well Drilling, Inc. (\"WDI\"). Having considered the parties' briefs and oral arguments, and for the reasons set forth below, the court will grant plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this declaratory relief action ACIC seeks a declaration from this court that, as a matter of law, the damages sought against WDI in an underlying state court action are not covered under the insurance policy it issued WDI (the \"ACIC policy\") and that ACIC therefore has no duty to defend or indemnify WDI with respect to the underlying state court action. (Doc. No. 5 at 2, 13-14.) ACIC also seeks a declaration that it is entitled to reimbursement for the fees and costs it has incurred in defending WDI in that state court action to date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 14-15.) WDI counters that ACIC has a duty to defend and indemnify WDI in the underlying action pursuant to the ACIC policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The material facts of this case are undisputed and, as relevant to the pending motion, are set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Underlying State Court Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 10, 2016, Paul E. Parreira\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Parreira\") filed a complaint in the Merced County Superior Court naming Sam Crum\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and WDI as the defendants. (Doc. No. 18 at 13.) Parreira's complaint sought the award of damages for breach of contract, common counts, and negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.) That complaint alleges the following. On or around March 22, 2014, Parreira and WDI entered into a contract whereby WDI agreed to drill, case, and preliminarily develop two water wells (the \"Arroya well\" and the \"Cozzi well\") in rural Merced County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In exchange, Parreira agreed to pay $ 78,845 for the Arroya well and $ 81,970 for the Cozzi well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Each well was to produce between 1400 and 1800 gallons of water per minute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around June 2014, WDI \"breached the contract by failing to deliver working wells as agreed upon, and failing to report the accurate location of [the Arroya well], thus rendering the County permit null and void and rendering the [Arroya] well unusable.\" (Doc. No. 5 at 11.) In addition to the contract prices for both wells, in his action pending in state court, Parreira seeks $ 25,549 in damages for remediation costs, for a total breach amount sought of $ 188,364 on the breach of contract claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the common counts cause of action, Parreira alleges that WDI \"became indebted to [Parreira] for money paid, laid out[,] and expended to or for defendant at defendant's special instance and request in the amount of $ 188,364.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Parreira also contends that WDI negligently built the wells because they produced one-half of their expected water output. (Doc. No. 18 at 14-15.) Lastly, Parreira claims that WDI \"negligently and carelessly measured the distance of [the Arroya well] from an existing residential water well such that the [Arroya] well had to be destroyed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   WDI tendered the underlying action to ACIC for a defense and indemnification under the ACIC policy. (Doc. No. 5 at 12.) On March 16, 2016, ACIC issued a reservation of rights letter to WDI advising that it agreed to provide WDI with a defense in the underlying action subject to the reservation of rights letter and to the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the ACIC policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) ACIC retained defense counsel on behalf of WDI, which defense remains in place to date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The ACIC Insurance Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ACIC issued Commercial General Liability (\"CGL\") insurance policy number L214000157 to WDI for the policy period of March 2, 2014 to March 2, 2015. (Doc. No. 18 at 7.) The ACIC policy states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking damages for \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any \"occurrence\" and settle any claim or \"suit\" that may result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Doc. No. 18 at 8.) The ACIC policy \"applies to 'bodily injury' and 'property damage' only if (1) [t]he 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' is caused by an 'occurrence' that takes place in the 'coverage territory'; [and] (2) [t]he 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' occurs during the policy period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Property damage is defined by the policy as \"[p]hysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property\" or \"[l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) The policy explicitly excludes breach of contract damages from the definition of property damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) In addition, an \"occurrence\" is defined in the policy as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party \"shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

(Doc. No. 25 at 17.) WDI does not argue that the damage resulting from the construction of the Cozzi well was caused by an occurrence, nor does WDI argue that the damage\n   caused by the failure of the Arroya and Cozzi wells to produce the expected output of water was caused by an occurrence. Consequently, the court concludes based upon the evidence before it on summary judgment that Parreira's causes of action for (1) breach of contract relating to the \"[f]ailure to deliver wells as agreed upon\" as that cause of action relates to water output (Doc. No. 23-2 at 4); (2) common counts relating to the \"money paid, laid out, and expended to\" WDI (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5); and (3) negligence claims relating to the construction of the wells (but not the misplacement of the Arroya well) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7) are clearly not covered by the ACIC policy because these causes of action in no sense seek damages caused by an \"occurrence\" as defined by the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Turning to the misplacement of the Arroya well, ACIC contends that the acts giving rise to Parreira's claims in the underlying state court action were not caused by an occurrence because WDI intended to and did drill the Arroya well exactly where it did. (Doc. No. 18 at 21.) WDI counters that, unbeknownst to it, on the morning that the Arroya well was to be drilled, Parreira's agent noticed that the markers for the original drilling location had been displaced by an earlier clearing of trees and that the agent subsequently moved the markers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 25 at 17-20.) In effect, WDI's argument is that, because it did not know the drilling markers had been moved prior to drilling the Arroya well, any subsequent damage was caused by an \"occurrence\" as defined in the policy. This argument misses the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First, the \"additional, unexpected, independent, and unforeseen happening must be a subsequent, not prior, event to the volitional activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Alco Iron &amp; Metal Co. v.

Cal. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Parreira's agent moving the markers is not an occurrence as defined by the ACIC policy because the displacement of the markers happened prior to WDI's intentional and volitional act of drilling the Arroya well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, \"it is the unexpected, undesigned, and unforeseen nature of the injury-causing event that determines whether there is an accident within the policy's coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899435\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/47/302/#p308\">\n    47 Cal. 4th at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20298\">\n    97 Cal.Rptr.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=211%20P.3d%201083\">\n    211 P.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the injury-causing event was the drilling of the Arroya well, not the displacement of its markers. Indeed, had WDI not drilled the Arroya well but Parreira's agent still moved the markers, the damages claimed by Parreira relating to the destruction of the Arroya well would not even exist. Moreover, it is undisputed that the drilling of the Arroya well was intentional. (Doc. No. 25 at 17.) The court\n   recognizes that the displacement of the markers was not expected by WDI, but WDI \"cites no case that supports its contention that its mistaken belief that\" it was drilling in the right location, \"which w[as] caused by another, constitute[s] an unexpected, independent, and unforeseen circumstance that would make its action accidental.\"\n   <em>\n    Alco Iron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4291163\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/911/844/#p851\">\n    911 F.Supp.2d at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the markers were moved without WDI's knowledge, the volitional act that gave rise to the claim for damages-the drilling of the Arroya well (albeit in the wrong location)-was intended by WDI, and there is no evidence before the court on summary judgment of any unexpected or unintended event transpiring between the intentional drilling of the Arroya well and the subsequent damage claimed by Parreira.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court concludes as a matter of law, based on the evidence presented on summary judgment, that any damage claimed in the state court action relating to the misplacement of the Arroya well was not caused by an occurrence as defined by the ACIC policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The State Court Action Does Not Seek Damages for \"Property Damage.\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The ACIC policy defines property damage as \"[p]hysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property\" or \"[l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\" (Doc.

However, the issue before the court in this action is a narrow one, unrelated to the merits of the underlying state court action: Does the ACIC policy require ACIC to defend and indemnify WDI in the underlying action? In determining that it does not, the court has compared the allegations of the complaint in the underlying action with the terms of the ACIC policy and has considered the evidence before it on summary judgment. In doing so, the court has not been called upon to make factual determinations about whether a contract between Parreira and WDI was formed, whether WDI breached the contract, or whether WDI constructed the Arroya and Cozzi wells negligently. Moreover, WDI has not pointed the court to any factual dispute remaining in the underlying action pending in state court that affects the coverage question at issue here. To the contrary, the court finds that the facts in dispute in the underlying action are completely unrelated to whether the ACIC policy provides WDI with coverage for the claims brought by Parreira in the underlying action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=861%20P.2d%201153\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[W]hen the coverage question is unrelated to the issues of consequence in the underlying case, the declaratory relief action may properly proceed to judgment.\").

(Doc. No. 18 at 15.) The reservation letter provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   ACIC expressly reserves its right ... to be reimbursed our defense costs and fees incurred in the event that it is subsequently determined that there is no coverage under our policy for the acts alleged by [Parreira] or that no duty to defend existed under the terms and conditions of the ACIC policy.

No. 25 at 1, 7).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    WDI has adduced the following documents to establish that Parreira's agent moved those markers: (1) the deposition testimony of Parreira's agent stating that he was present on the morning of the drilling to make sure the markers were placed (Doc. No. 25-2, Ex. C); (2) a separate statement of undisputed facts demonstrating WDI filed a cross-complaint against Parreira's agent in the underlying state court action (Doc. No. 25-4 at 3); (3) Crum's declaration stating that Parreira's agent \"re-did the marking stakes on the morning hours before\" WDI began drilling and without Crum's knowledge (Doc. No. 25-1 at 4); and (4) the application for the permit for the Arroya well indicating that WDI applied for a permit to place the well in a different location than where the markers were located at the time of the drilling (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    , Ex. G). In its reply, ACIC does not dispute this evidence or the conclusions that WDI draws from it. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 26.) The court has reviewed the evidence, and solely for the purposes of the pending motion, the court considers it to be undisputed fact that, unbeknownst to WDI, Parreira's agent moved the markers on the morning the Arroya well was to be drilled.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The court's conclusion that none of the causes of action in the underlying state court action seek damages caused by an \"occurrence\" is in and of itself a sufficient basis upon which to grant ACIC's motion for summary judgment on its first two claims.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Fire Ins.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 18 at 5, 29.) WDI did not address this issue in its opposition. Because the court will permit ACIC to file supplemental briefing to detail the costs it has incurred in defending WDI in the underlying action, the court will also permit WDI to file a response thereto. Those supplemental briefs shall be limited solely to whether ACIC is entitled to reimbursement and whether the reimbursement ACIC seeks is reasonable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
