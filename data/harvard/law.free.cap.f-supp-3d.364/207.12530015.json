FURMAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action emerges from the soured relationship between celebrity vegan chef Chloe Coscarelli and her former partner. Coscarelli and three LLCs of which she is sole owner or member - Chef Chloe LLC, CC Hospitality Holdings LLC, and CKC Sales, LLC - bring twenty-one claims against ESquared Hospitality LLC and BC Hospitality Group LLC (formerly known as CCSW LLC).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1\n   (\"Compl.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint alleges everything from breach of contract and unjust enrichment to federal trademark and cyber piracy violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Now pending are a slew of motions and cross-motions. First, Coscarelli and Chef Chloe LLC seek a preliminary injunction preventing Defendants from launching or participating in retail food sales under the \"by Chloe\" name and a declaration that Chef Chloe LLC holds a fifty-percent membership interest in BC Hospitality Group. Docket No. 22 (\"Pls.' PI Mem.\"). For their part, Defendants move to dismiss all twenty-one claims on the ground that they are subject to a mandatory arbitration agreement or, in the alternative, five claims pleaded under California law on the ground that New York law applies. Docket No. 28. Finally, Plaintiffs move to strike various declarations filed with Defendants' motion papers. Docket Nos. 39, 46, 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court (1) denies Defendants' motion to dismiss to the extent it seek to compel arbitration of all Plaintiffs' claims in advance of the Court's ruling on Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, but (2) grants it the extent that it seeks dismissal of Coscarelli's California-law claims (albeit with leave to replead those claims); (3) denies Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief and motions to strike; and (4) stays further proceedings as to Counts 2, 5, and 6 of the Complaint pending arbitration, while reserving judgment on whether the remaining claims should also be stayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Coscarelli is a well-known vegan chef and culinary author and the sole owner of Chef Chloe LLC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-28. In 2014, Chef Chloe LLC and ESquared entered into a partnership with the goal of opening a \"fast casual\" vegan restaurant and collaborating on other food-related \"Approved Projects.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 39-40, 82. Through an Operating Agreement, the two entities formed CCSW LLC (since renamed BC Hospitality Group).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1-3 (\"Operating Agreement\" or \"OA\"), at 1. Coscarelli signed the Operating Agreement three times - once on behalf of Chef Chloe LLC; a second time as a \"Manager\" of the newly-formed entity, CCSW; and finally underneath a line of text reading \"Acknowledged and Agreed as to the Rights and Obligations Set Forth Herein.\" OA 53. The same day, CCSW entered into a \"Name, Face and Likeness Agreement\" with Coscarelli in her individual capacity; as its name suggests, that Agreement governs the use of Coscarelli's name and publicity rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1-2 (\"NFL Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Operating Agreement establishes the basic operating rules for CCSW and spells out the rights and duties of the two members, originally ESquared and Chef Chloe LLC. Five provisions of the Operating Agreement are particularly relevant here. First, Section 4.1 of the Agreement identifies the \"Business\" of CCSW as being\n   (1) the management of fast-casual vegan restaurants and (2) so-called \"Approved Projects.\" OA \u00a7 4.1. An \"Approved Project\" is defined, in turn, as \"any project related to the food and beverage industry that utilizes one or more of the NFL Rights\n   <em>\n    or the By Chloe Mark\n   </em>\n   , and which has been\n   <em>\n    pre-approved in writing by\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Chef Chloe LLC\n   </em>\n   ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Second, the Agreement defines the \"By Chloe Mark\" to mean the \"By Chloe Word Mark,\" which is the \"standard character mark 'BY CHLOE' in connection with the goods and services of the Business,\" and the \"By Chloe Design Mark,\" which is \"any logo ... incorporating the By Chloe Word Mark in stylized font ... and used in connection with the goods and services of the Business.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.1, at 3-4. Third, under the Agreement, \"[t]he parties acknowledge and agree that the By Chloe Mark incorporates [Coscarelli's] first name, and that nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to bestow upon [CCSW] any rights to [Coscarelli's] NFL Rights (as defined in the NFL License Agreement).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.4. CCSW, however, \"own[s] all right, title and interest in and to the By Chloe Mark.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.4(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Fourth, the Operating Agreement named Chef Chloe LLC as the \"Service Member\" and laid out certain duties to be performed by Chef Chloe LLC through Coscarelli, including developing the fast-casual vegan restaurant \"concept\" and helping to run the restaurant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 19.1, 19.2. The Agreement provided, however, that Chef Chloe LLC could be terminated as the Service Member \"for Cause or upon the occurrence of a Termination Event.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19.3(a). Should Chef Chloe LLC be so terminated, CCSW retained the right to use Coscarelli's pre-existing intellectual property and her name, face, and likeness rights \"in the operation of the Restaurants (including New Restaurants) and Approved Projects (including new Approved Projects approved as set forth in the NFL License Agreement).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19.3(c). Finally, the Operating Agreement also included an arbitration provision stating in relevant part as follows: \"All claims, disputes, deadlocks and other matters in question between the parties arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement or the breach hereof ... shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with this Section 20.19 unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties.\" OA \u00a7 20.19(a). The provision, however, contains an explicit carve-out for disputes involving claims for \"immediate injunctive relief\": \"Notwithstanding the foregoing [arbitration clause], in the event the Dispute involves a claim for which immediate injunctive relief is being sought, a party shall have the right to bring an action for such relief in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to commencing an arbitration action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20.19(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As noted, the NFL Agreement - executed on the same day as the Operating Agreement - governs the use of Coscarelli's name and publicity rights. Specifically, the Agreement bestowed upon CCSW the right to use Coscarelli's \"full and formal name, nickname or variations of her name\" and \"versions of her image, signature, voice, likeness and other elements or attributes of her persona, identity, or personality.\" NFL Agreement 1. Those rights were not unlimited, however. Under the terms of the Agreement, CCSW is entitled to use them \"solely in connection with the operation, marketing and promotion of the Restaurants, and ... solely in connection with the manufacturing, distribution, advertising and promotion ... of products and services bearing the company IP and associated with the Approved Projects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(a). Moreover, Coscarelli \"retain[ed] the right to use the NFL Rights in any whatsoever\n   <em>\n    except in connection with the By Chloe Mark\n   </em>\n   , including but not limited\n   to ... packaged foods and beverages.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(b) (emphasis added). The NFL Agreement emphasized that \"[a]ll rights in and to the By Chloe Mark are reserved by [CCSW] as stated in the Operating Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In contrast to the Operating Agreement, the NFL Agreement does not contain an arbitration clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In July 2015, the restaurant - \"by Chloe\" - opened to positive reviews.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. But the relationship between the two partners soon soured. In 2016, Chef Chloe LLC sought injunctive relief in New York state court to prevent ESquared from abusing the \"Deadlock Rule\" contained in the Operating Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111. In turn, ESquared commenced arbitration proceedings against Chef Chloe LLC, seeking a declaration that various financing deals Esquared had arranged were valid and alleging that Coscarelli and Chef Chloe LLC had breached the Operating Agreement and fiduciary duties owed to CCSW.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 42;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 22-15 (\"Arbitration Award\"), at 26. In a final award entered on March 21, 2017, the arbitrator approved the financing agreements in dispute, ruled that Coscarelli and Chef Chloe LLC had breached their duties under the Operating Agreement and common law, and held that Chef Chloe LLC was \"terminated\" as a member of CCSW \"for Cause.\" Arbitration Award 33-40, 43-49. The following day, ESquared - on behalf of CCSW - sent a letter to Coscarelli purporting to exercise its right under the Operating Agreement to repurchase Chef Chloe LLC's membership interest in CCSW for an amount equal to the value of that membership interest, which ESquared asserted was zero dollars.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 102. The Supreme Court, New York County confirmed the arbitrator's award in all relevant parts, and the First Department affirmed that judgment earlier this week.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chef Chloe, LLC v. Wasser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20N.Y.S.3d%2015\">\n    93 N.Y.S.3d 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=168%20A.D.3d%20610\">\n    168 A.D.3d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Since the initial arbitral award, Defendants have continued to operate a number of \"by Chloe\" restaurants in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44, 48. They have also sold various packaged foods under the \"by Chloe\" name, including cookie dough, chewing gum, push pops, and cupcakes.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-60. In April 2018, Bain Capital issued a press release announcing that \"by CHLOE, the popular plant based, fast-casual restaurant startup,\" had secured an investment \"to support the brand's growth and expansion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 125-26. Less than a week later, three of the Plaintiffs here - all except Chef Chloe LLC - filed a fourteen-count complaint against Esquared and BC Hospitality Group in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint,\n   <em>\n    Coscarelli v. ESquared Hosp. Grp. LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-CV-02945 (GW) (C.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2018), ECF No. 1. On June 29, 2018, after Esquared filed a motion to dismiss, Coscarelli voluntarily dismissed that case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 37. The same day, she and the other Plaintiffs filed this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.; Docket No. 29 (\"Defs.'

Mem. 18-19; Docket No. 64 (\"Defs.' Reply\"), at 1-5, 8-10 - the Court treats as a motion to compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nicosia v. Amazon.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055481\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/220/\">\n    834 F.3d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230 &amp; n.3 (2d Cir. 2016) (noting that a district court may treat a motion to dismiss as a motion to compel arbitration where the moving party manifests \"an intent ... to compel arbitration\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Begonja v.

The Court then turns to Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, to Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, and to Plaintiffs' motions to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Motion to Compel Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants contend that all four Plaintiffs, and all twenty-one of their claims, fall within the scope of the Operating Agreement's arbitration clause. Defs.' Mem. 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs concede that the arbitration clause ultimately requires arbitration of Chef Chloe LLC's claims, but they contend that it does not bind the three other Plaintiffs and does not apply yet because Chef Chloe LLC seeks preliminary injunctive relief. Docket No. 42 (\"Pls.' Opp'n\"), at 9-10. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that Chef Chloe LLC need not arbitrate its claims with Defendants until after its motion for injunctive relief is resolved and that none of the three other Plaintiffs are required to arbitrate at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Applicable Legal Principles\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The FAA reflects \"a strong federal policy favoring arbitration as an alternative means of dispute resolution.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartford Accident &amp; Indem.

Relying on Section 20.19(e) of the Operating Agreement, however, they contend that Chef Chloe LLC is entitled to seek preliminary injunctive relief in this Court \"prior to commencing an arbitration action.\" OA \u00a7 20.19(e). Defendants counter that Chef Chloe LLC cannot avail itself of Section 20.19(e) because (1) the LLC did not seek such relief \"immediate[ly]\" and (2) in this case, New York state courts are the \"court[s] of competent jurisdiction.\" Defs.' Reply 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants' arguments do not withstand scrutiny. To begin, Section 20.19(e) does not limit a party's judicial recourse to claims for relief brought\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   , but rather to \"claim[s] for which immediate injunctive relief\n   <em>\n    is being sought.\n   </em>\n   \" OA \u00a7 20.19(e) (emphasis added). Here, Chef Chloe LLC indisputably seeks \"immediate injunctive relief\" for the claims arising out of the Operating Agreement.

Reply 2, does not change that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In short, the Operating Agreement does not yet subject Chef Chloe LLC's claims to arbitration. Instead, it provides that this Court should first decide Chef Chloe LLC's claims for preliminary injunctive relief. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss those claims (Counts 2, 5, and 6) outright is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

As support for their contention, Defendants point to Section 20.14 of the Operating Agreement, which provides in relevant part that, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement is binding upon, and inures to the benefit of, the Members and their transferees, successors and assigns.\" OA \u00a7 20.14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply 5. Defendants provide no evidence, however, that CC Hospitality Holdings LLC or CKC Sales LLC is a transferee, successor, or assign of Chef Chloe LLC's rights or obligations under the Operating Agreement. At most, they show that CKC Sales LLC\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   be the assignee of the copyright in one of Coscarelli's cookbooks,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply 5, but that is irrelevant to whether the\n   <em>\n    Operating Agreement\n   </em>\n   binds either CC Hospitality Holdings LLC or CKC Sales LLC.

Chloe Coscarelli\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The final question is whether Coscarelli must arbitrate the claims she brings in her individual capacity. Defendants argue that Coscarelli is individually bound because she signed the Operating Agreement in her individual capacity. Defs.' Reply 4. There is no dispute that two of Coscarelli's three signatures on the Operating Agreement were in a representative capacity - one on behalf of Chef Chloe LLC, a party to the Operating Agreement; and the other as Manager of CCSW, the entity brought into existence by the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n 12; Defs.' Reply 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   OA 53. Defendants argue, however, that Coscarelli's third signature\n   on the Operating Agreement - above which is written, \"Acknowledged and Agreed as to the Rights and Obligations Set Forth Herein\" - binds her personally. Defendants' argument appears to be that those words, in conjunction with the\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of an entity name over the third signature indicating that Coscarelli was signing in a representative capacity, shows that she was signing in a personal capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply 4. According to Defendants, \"[t]he true question ... is not whether Coscarelli is technically a 'party' to the Operating Agreement ...

Even if Coscarelli were somehow \"bound by\" the Operating Agreement - which, as noted below, she is likely not - she would still not be obligated to arbitrate her claims against ESquared because the arbitration clause is limited by its terms to \"[a]ll claims, disputes, deadlocks and other matters in question between\n   <em>\n    the parties.\n   </em>\n   \" OA \u00a7 20.19(a) (emphasis added). The other arbitration provisions (discussing, for example, the governing rules, notice procedure, and treatment of related claims) also use the terms \"party\" and \"parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525604\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/314/487/#p496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20.19(b)-(e).

By contrast to the Operating Agreement, the NFL Agreement was \"made and entered into ... by and among\n   <em>\n    Chloe Coscarelli\n   </em>\n   ... and CCSW LLC.\" NFL Agreement 1 (emphasis added). Moreover, on the NFL Agreement, above Coscarelli's name and signature, it says in boldface type \"CHLOE COSCARELLI,\" indicating that she - rather than one of her LLCs - was a party to the contract. NFL Agreement 7-8. Those provisions make plain that the drafters of the two agreements knew how to distinguish between an LLC owned by Coscarelli and Coscarelli herself and knew how to make plain if Coscarelli herself was party to an agreement. That is, reading the two agreements together, the Court is compelled to conclude that Coscarelli is not a \"party\" to the Operating Agreement and, thus, outside the scope of its arbitration clause.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    This Is Me, Inc. v.

Chef Chloe LLC's motion is premised on its ongoing inability to veto \"Major Decisions,\" as contemplated by the Operating Agreement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   OA \u00a7 7.4, and its worry that BC Hospitality Group will enter into \"dilutive financing arrangements\" that will further water down Chef Chloe's interest in the concern, Pls.'

But the risk that ESquared would, without Chef Chloe LLC's say-so, make \"Major Decisions\" and enter into equity financing arrangements with outside investors was manifest as soon as the disputed repurchase occurred in May 2017. In fact, Coscarelli's own declaration in support of the preliminary injunction alleges that ESquared (and its principal, Jimmy Haber) attempted to make \"Major Decisions\" and to enter \"dilutive\" financing arrangements without Coscarelli's approval even while Chef Chloe LLC was still a member of CCSW.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 22-2 (\"Coscarelli PI Decl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 17-22. Thus, Chef Chloe LLC unjustifiably waited at least eight months (May to December 2017 and May to June 29, 2018) before seeking injunctive relief regarding Chef Chloe LLC's membership interest in CCSW.

PI Mem. 8-15. To establish a breach of contract under New York law, a plaintiff must establish \"(1) an agreement, (2) adequate performance by the plaintiff, (3) breach by the defendant, and (4) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Fischer &amp; Mandell, LLP v. Citibank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089098\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/793/#p799\">\n    632 F.3d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799 (2d Cir. 2011). Plaintiffs' claims here founder on the third element: proof of a breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court begins with the NFL Agreement. Coscarelli contends that Defendants have breached the NFL Agreement because it permits CCSW to use the rights to her \"full and formal name, nickname or variations of her name\" \"\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   in connection with\" fast casual vegan restaurants\n   or Approved Projects, of which she argues there are none. NFL Agreement 1 (emphasis added). The problem with that argument is that, by virtue of the Operating Agreement, CCSW owns the By Chloe Mark (or, more specifically, the \"By Chloe Word Mark\"), and thus its use, for whatever purpose, does not implicate Coscarelli's rights under the NFL Agreement. Under the Operating Agreement, \"[t]he parties acknowledge and agree that the By Chloe Mark incorporates [Coscarelli's] first name, and ... nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to bestow upon [CCSW] any rights to [Coscarelli's] NFL Rights.\" OA \u00a7 4.4. The Operating Agreement therefore draws a distinction between the By Chloe Mark - in which CCSW \"own[s] all right, title and interest\" - and Coscarelli's \"NFL Rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089098\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/793/#p799\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The NFL Agreement recapitulates this division: \"[Coscarelli] shall retain the rights to use the NFL Rights in any way whatsoever\n   <em>\n    except in connection with the By Chloe Mark\n   </em>\n   , including ... packaged foods and services....\n   <em>\n    All rights in and to the By Chloe Mark are reserved by\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    CCSW\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    as stated in the Operating Agreement.\n   </em>\n   \" NFL Agreement 1 (emphasis added). In sum, then, CCSW received limited rights to use Coscarelli's name, face, and likeness; Coscarelli retained the rest; and separate from these NFL Rights was the By Chloe Mark, which CCSW owns outright. It follows that Defendants' allegedly infringing activity - the sale of desserts under the \"by Chloe\" brand, which is identical to the By Chloe Word Mark,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   OA \u00a7 1.1, at 3-4; Docket No. 1-5 - does not exceed CCSW's rights under the NFL Agreement because it does not concern Coscarelli's NFL Rights at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Whether Defendants have breached the Operating Agreement presents a closer question. Plaintiffs argue that the Operating Agreement limits CCSW to running fast casual vegan restaurants and other \"Approved Projects.\" OA \u00a7 4.1. Engaging in sales of retail packaged foods is plainly not the former, and - Plaintiffs claim - it cannot be the latter, as Chef Chloe LLC never signed off on CCSW's participation in packaged food sales, as required by the Operating Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' PI Mem. 14; OA \u00a7 4.1; Coscarelli PI Decl. \u00b6 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   For their part, Defendants do not dispute that Coscarelli never approved the sale of retail packaged foods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 38 (\"Defs.' PI Opp'n\"), at 10-12. Instead, they argue that the \"Approved Projects\" requirement \"was\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   applicable when [Chef] Chloe LLC was a Member of CCSW.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Following termination of Chef Chloe LLC as Service Member and Defendants' purported repurchase of its membership interest, they contend, they were entitled to use the By Chloe Mark in the retail domain because \"[n]either the Operating Agreement nor the NFL Agreement provided any ...

In a section titled \"Surviving Rights,\" the Agreement expressly provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   the Company's right to continue using ... [Chef Chloe LLC's] Pre-Existing IP and the NFL Rights in the operation of the Restaurants (including New Restaurants) and Approved Projects (including new Approved Projects approved as set forth in the NFL License Agreement) shall survive any termination of [Chef Chloe LLC] as the Service Member and any Membership Interest Recapture....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   OA \u00a7 19.3(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, as the parties more or less acknowledge, the Operating Agreement is silent with respect to whether Chef Chloe LLC would still need to approve an \"Approved Project\" if it was no longer the Service Member or a member of the LLC at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' PI Opp'n 12; Pls.' PI Reply 4. Put differently, the Agreement does not explicitly address CCSW's ability to undertake a new \"Approved Project\" in the event that the designated \"approver,\" Chef Chloe LLC, is no longer in a position to approve CCSW decisions because it has been terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On the present record, the Court cannot resolve whether the approval requirement still applies if Chef Chloe LLC is terminated as the Service Member or its interest is repurchased. On the one hand, the \"Approved Projects\" provision requires Chef Chloe LLC's approval, and does not appear to allow for exceptions. On the other hand, the \"Surviving Rights\" language makes plain that the parties intended for CCSW to be able to engage in \"new Approved Projects\" even if Chef Chloe LLC no longer had a role in the company. And construing the provision to apply even if Chef Chloe LLC was terminated for cause would arguably be an absurd result.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    AAR Allen Servs. Inc. v.
