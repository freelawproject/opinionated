It was not until December 2012, nearly fourteen months after his initial diagnosis, that he received a follow-up appointment with a dentist at the Metropolitan Detention Center (\"MDC\"). He alleges that the gap in his treatment was caused by an unconstitutional BOP policy of denying necessary dental care to pretrial detainees.

BOP's Dental Care Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During the time that plaintiff was incarcerated at MDC, BOP's dental care policy was set forth in Program Statement 6400.02, dated January 15, 2005.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Suppl. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 3; Castiglione Aff., Ex. A (\"BOP Policy\"), ECF No. 85-1. The BOP Policy began by declaring that its \"purpose and scope\" was \"[t]o stabilize and maintain the inmate population's oral health\" by providing \"conservative\" dental care, balancing the provision of \"necessary treatment\" with \"available resources.\" BOP Policy at US00532. Its objective was to provide \"quality care consistent with professional standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In service of these goals, the policy directed that \"[e]mergency dental care will be available to all inmates on a 24-hour basis,\" including to inmates serving sentences of one year or less.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US00542. The policy\n   provides a non-exhaustive list of treatment needs that constitute \"emergency care,\" including \"relief of severe dental pain, ... acute infections, ... [and] extraction of non-restorable teeth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Non-emergency or routine care, by contrast, would be prioritized and provided on a tiered basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at US00543. Inmates with \"special designations,\" including those who were housed in \"jail units for less than a 12 month period,\" would \"have access to dental triage and emergency care only.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Barring an exception to the BOP Policy approved by the Chief Dentist, inmates would not be eligible to receive routine care until the conclusion of this twelve-month period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For sentenced inmates serving over twelve months in BOP custody, the BOP Policy provided for elective non-emergency dental care as long as \"resources of staff, time, and materials are available, and commensurate with the inmate's ability to maintain good oral health.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Non-emergency or routine care includes hygiene appointments and radiographs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to the BOP Policy represented in Program Statement 6400.02, plaintiff alleges that MDC maintained a second, unwritten policy that required pretrial detainees to wait for twelve months to receive even emergency dental treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Suppl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 3, ECF No. 90.

Furthermore, they note that plaintiff's summary of Dr. Hamilton's statement-in which he alleges that she told him that he would have to wait for twelve months to receive\n   <em>\n    routine\n   </em>\n   care-\"is nothing more than an accurate statement of Program Statement 6400.02.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
