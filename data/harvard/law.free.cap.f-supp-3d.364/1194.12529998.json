Dkt. 39. The Court has considered the pleadings filed in support of and in opposition to the motion and the remainder of the file and hereby denies the motion in part, grants the motion in part, and reserves ruling and requests supplemental briefing in part for the reasons stated herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This suit arises from copyright and trademark disputes between Plaintiff Clean Crawl, Inc. (\"CCI\") and CSCP, two businesses which clean attic and crawls spaces and provide pest exclusion services for homes in the Western Washington area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 48 at 7, 39 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CCI began doing business in its current iteration in 2001 when its president, Charles Henrichsen (\"Henrichsen\"), transferred his Bio Bug Pest Management, Inc. business to CCI, Dkt. 48 at 6, and began using the trade name CLEAN CRAWLS, Dkt. 49, Declaration of Charles Henrichsen (\"Henrichsen Decl.\") at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   CSCP, using the trade name Crawl Pros, began operations on January 9, 2013 under founder and owner Richard Herron (\"Herron\"). Dkt. 39 (citing Dkt. 40, Declaration of Richard Herron (\"Herron Decl.\"), at 1). CCI provides \"air duct cleaning services, animal contamination cleaning and disposal services, pest control for commercial and residential buildings, and environmental containment.\" Dkt. 48 at 7 (citing Henrichsen Decl. at 2-3, 6-7). CSCP provides \"crawlspace and attic cleaning and restoration, insulation installation, crawl space encapsulation and sealing, rodent exclusion, duct sealing, and water mediation and flooding.\" Dkt. 39 at 2 (citing Herron Decl. at 1). CSCP characterizes the nature of the two companies' businesses as \"substantially similar.\" Dkt. 39 at 2. CCI confirms this, stating that \"[i]t is undisputed that both companies provide identical, directly competing services.\" Dkt. 48 at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Henrichsen declares that he met Herron in 2008 through an insulation and energy efficiency industry association and mentored Herron in starting a business, Sustainable Building and Insulation (\"SBI\"). Henrichsen Decl. at 3-4. Henrichsen declares that he made SBI a CCI subcontractor, and one of his employees, CCI sales representative Jared Pullen (\"Pullen\"), referred \"many jobs\" to SBI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Henrichsen declares that these referrals allowed Pullen and Herron to be \"heavily exposed\" to CCI's \"family of trademarks and copyrights\" between 2010 and 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Henrichsen also declares that all of CCI's copyrighted materials at issue \"were\n   substantially completed in the form registered in the 2008-2009 time frame.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Finally, Henrichsen declares that CCI has used its trademarks and copyrights with customers in fourteen western Washington counties since 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. CCI registered a service mark for \"a gold amorphous dirt blot to the left of a slightly superimposed by the blue capitalized words 'CLEAN CRAWLS' \" on August 31, 2010 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\"). Dkt. 57-1 at 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Henrichsen specifically declares that by 2012, Herron and Pullen \"knew and had used repeatedly in association with [CCI] its family of trademarks,\" including the CLEAN CRAWLS trade name, WE GO WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO (\"Slogan One\"), and WE DO THE WORK YOU DON'T WANT TO (\"Slogan Two\") (collectively \"the family of marks\"). Henrichsen Decl. at 4. Henrichsen declares that CCI typically has not used its slogans in printed advertising or on company vehicles or other items, \"instead using them primarily on the Internet and verbally with customers, associates, and the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Henrichsen and others at CCI declare that CCI has used the Slogans extensively dating back to at least 2010.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Henrichsen Decl. at 4; Dkt. 50 Declaration of Vice President of CCI Dale Gjerness (\"Gjerness Decl.\") at 4-5; Dkt. 52, Declaration of Patrick J. Smith (\"Smith Decl.\"), at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   CSCP began operations in early 2013, using Slogan One extensively to brand its business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Herron Decl. at 6-41. In 2013, CSCP placed the slogan in advertising, on company cars and trucks, and on its company headquarters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-24. Between 2014 and 2017, CSCP expanded its use of Slogan One to include business cards, customer giveaways, a domain name, advertising, its payment authorization form, and company jackets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-41. On April 15, 2014, CCI registered a service mark for \"an amorphous water blot to the left of and slightly superimposed by the capitalized words 'CLEAN CRAWLS' \" with the USTPO. Dkt. 57-1 at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 20, 2017, CSCP applied to register Slogan One with Washington as a trademark in class 37, registering it for use with \"[c]leanup of crawl spaces and attics and insulation installation services.\" Dkt. 41, Declaration of Emilia L. Sweeney (\"Sweeney Decl.\"), at 5-14. Also in March 2017, Herron declares that CSCP \"learned that CCI had begun using [Slogan One] on CCI's website,\" and so asked CCI to cease and desist. Herron Decl. at 3-4. Herron declares that CSCP received a favorable response, but later found the CCI \"had added a TM to the end of [Slogan One] and was also using the confusingly similar [Slogan Two] on its website.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CCI alleges that it first became aware of CSCP's infringement in 2017 \"after investigation prompted by [CSCP's] accusation of trademark infringement against [CCI].\" Dkt. 48 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CCI submitted an application for protection of Slogan One on July 6, 2017 with the USPTO. Dkt. 57-1 at 51. CSCP also filed for protection of Slogan One with the USPTO, which issued a Notice of Publication on July 12, 2017, announcing its intent to register Slogan One to CSCP. Sweeney Decl. at 15-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 14, 2017, CSCP filed a complaint against CCI in the Pierce County Superior Court for violation of Washington's Trademark Registration Act, RCW Chapter 19.77\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , common law trademark infringement, and violation of Washington's Consumer Protection Act (\"CPA\"), RCW Chapter 19.86. Dkt. 39 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 6, 2017, CCI filed this lawsuit against CSCP, alleging copyright infringement, trademark infringement, false designation of origin and unfair competition,\n   and violation of the CPA, and seeking a permanent injunction against infringement of the copyrighted materials and the trademarked materials, destruction of all infringing materials, damages, and other relief. Dkt. 1. On October 10, 2017, CCI registered Slogan Two as a service mark with the USPTO. Dkt. 57-1 at 53. On November 28, 2017, CCI filed a Notice of Opposition to CSCP's application for protection of Slogan One with the federal Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Sweeney Decl. at 26-31. This Notice cites CCI's July 6 application for protection of Slogan One.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 57-1 at 51.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 27, 2018, CCI registered a service mark which \"consists of the wording 'Clean Crawls' in white and outlined in navy blue ... centered upon a blue splash, which is centered on a blue background....\" with the USPTO. Dkt. 57-1 at 55. On March 19, 2018, CSCP filed an amended answer in the instant case, asserting counterclaims and affirmative defenses. Dkt. 32. On March 27, 2018, CCI registered a service mark consisting of the words CLEAN CRAWLS with the USPTO, and registered another service mark consisting of the words CLEAN CRAWLS in blue next to a splash image in grey on June 12, 2018. Dkt. 57-1 at 57-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 6, 2018, CSCP filed the instant motion for summary judgment. Dkt. 39. On October 8, 2018, CCI responded. Dkt. 48. On October 19, 2018, CSCP replied. Dkt. 60. On October 22, 2018, CCI filed a surreply. Dkt. 61.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Summary judgment is proper only if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Visually, CSCP describes its mark as CRAWL SPACE CLEANING PROS, which \"consistently includes the house and leaf design feature, and uses a green and orange color scheme,\" and describes CCI's mark as CLEAN CRAWLS, with \"[t]he word 'CLEAN' stacked on top of the word 'CRAWL,' with the 'splat' image to the left of the literal elements\" in blue, grey, and white, arguing that consumers see \"very different marketplace representations of these two marks.\" Dkt. 39 at 16.

Dkt. 49-1 at 55-57, 68. Henrichsen's accompanying declaration explains that CCI has \"maintained a website at [www.cleancrawls.com] consistently for most of the company's existence, including prior to 2013.\" Henrichsen Decl. at 7. Notably, neither Henrichsen's declaration nor the printouts themselves establish when either slogan appeared on the website, or when Slogan Two appeared on the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   CCI provides five declarations from its officers and employees attesting to the history of CCI's use of the slogans in commerce. Henrichsen declares that he \"first started using the slogans and similar variations with customers throughout the Pacific Northwest\" in 1993, and transferred the rights to CCI in 2001. Henrichsen Decl. at 2. He further declares that CCI has \"consistently trained our employees to use\" the family of marks including CLEAN CRAWLS and Slogans One and Two \"when interacting with the public and our customers,\" and that \"I have personally used or observed the family of marks used with the public to indicate the source of [CCI] services literally thousands of times prior to 2013.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6081821,3663678\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/150/580/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, he declares that \"[w]hile use of the marks has taken various written forms over the years, including business cards, brochures, flyers, advertisements and the Internet, the vast majority of our advertising and customer association comes verbally from our sales teams and work crews\" who use the family of marks \"and similar slogan variations with customers on a daily basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.

R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Dkt. 60 at 12. CSCP separately refers to the declarations of CCI's officers and employees and to the challenged witnesses,\n   leading the Court to infer that CSCP believes Steve Bodine and Ken Harris of Bodine Construction are the undisclosed witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 60 at 11-12; Dkt. 55, Declaration of Steve Bodine; Dkt. 56, Declaration of Ken Harris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Even if the Court disregards these last two declarations, upon consideration of the remainder of the record presented, the Court concludes that there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude CCI has priority of use in Slogan One. CSCP does not argue that verbal use of a slogan with customers in home cleaning services can never be \"commercial use of the type common to the particular industry in question,\"\n   <em>\n    Chance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11129313\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/1151/#p1156\">\n    242 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1157 (citing\n   <em>\n    Paramount Pictures\n   </em>\n   , 31 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1774 ), only that testimony verifying that use is self-serving and has little probative value as to the understanding of the consuming public.

Though the declarations are not particularly detailed and contain similar or identical language, CCI presents five employees with a history of employment starting at least three years before 2013, who could potentially testify as to CCI's regular use of the Slogans with customers so as to \"identify [the] ... services in an appropriate segment of the public mind as belonging to the owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Rearden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894099\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/1190/#p1202\">\n    683 F.3d at 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Henrichsen declares that CCI has made 40,000 sales between 2010 and present, based on an average of more than 8,000 leads per year. Henrichsen Decl. at 6-7. CSCP does not contest this sales data. Combining substantial sales with declarations attesting to regular use of the Slogans in the context of those sales and construing all evidence in favor of CCI, the Court finds CCI has met its burden to raise a question of material fact as to priority of use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Regarding Slogan Two, CSCP argues that CCI \"cannot establish that [CSCP] has made commercial use of [Slogan Two] because it hasn't.\" Dkt. 39 at 22. In the alternative, CSCP argues that if CCI believes Slogan Two is confusingly similar to Slogan One, then Slogan Two would be unprotectable based on CSCP's priority of use in Slogan One. Dkt. 39 at 22. The Court finds a dispute of material fact exists as to ownership of Slogan One, and the resolution of ownership of Slogan One may drive the resolution of ownership of Slogan Two. CSCP is correct that if it won at trial on its claim of priority for Slogan One, it is possible that the jury could also conclude CCI's claims regarding Slogan Two are invalid because it is confusingly similar to Slogan One. Conversely, if CCI won at trial on its claim of priority for Slogan One, a jury could conclude that CSCP's use of Slogan One infringes CCI's rights in both Slogan One and Slogan Two, without CCI's having to prove CSCP used Slogan Two, due to confusing similarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, CSCP argues that all of CCI's trademark claims are barred by laches, reading the Henrichsen and Gjerness declarations to \"state that they have known of [CSCP's] alleged trademark infringement since 2012.\" Dkt. 60 at 10-11 (citing Henrichsen Decl. at 4; Gjerness Decl. at 3). The Court agrees with CCI that CSCP's argument \"is based on a misreading of the declarations submitted.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 61 at 2. Both declarations state that Herron and Pullen were exposed to CCI's trademarks starting in 2012, not that CCI was aware of use by CSCP of the trademarks at that time. Henrichsen Decl. at 4; Gjerness Decl. at 3. On this issue, there is also a dispute of a material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Therefore, the Court denies summary judgment for CSCP on CCI's claims of trademark infringement for both Slogan One and Slogan Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
