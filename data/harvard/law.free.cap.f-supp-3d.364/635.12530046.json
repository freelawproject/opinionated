Plaintiff alleges that in each of the first three tests, Kelly responded promptly to the female testers and arranged for them to view an available unit.

And an \"ordinary listener\" could construe Kelly's alleged statement as an indication that he preferred to rent to women because he explicitly stated that his sense of B.C.'s attractiveness was the only reason he returned her call. Courts have found that statements that are far less explicit about the speaker's preference can violate \u00a7 3604(c).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ragin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546277\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/995/#p999\">\n    923 F.2d at 1000-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying motion to dismiss because a trier of fact could conclude that housing advertisement using only white models may be read by an ordinary reader as indicating preference for white renters).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Second, Kelly's alleged statements to female tester # 4 during her tour of an apartment at 7927 Birch Street can also support a claim under \u00a7 3604(c).
