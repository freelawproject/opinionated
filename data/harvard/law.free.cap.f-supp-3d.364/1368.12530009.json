Before the Court is Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. Dkt No. 33. After the parties submitted supplemental briefing on this complex case, this Motion has been fully briefed and is ripe for review. For the reasons stated below, Defendants' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hush a/k/a Peaches Sports Bar (\"Peaches\") is a business located in Waycross, Georgia. Dkt. No. 38-11 \u00b6 1. Peaches is owned by Ohshy, Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Rupesh Patel is the president and general manager of Ohshy, Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ngwebifor Fobi worked at Peaches as a manager, employee, bartender, and marketing and promotions person.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Fobi was not paid on a salary basis, but was paid by the tips she made, except that she sometimes received a bonus. Dkt. No. 38-6 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff, J &amp; J Sports Productions, Inc., is a distributor of sports and entertainment programming. Dkt. No. 38-1 \u00b6 3. Plaintiff purchased and retained the exclusive commercial exhibition licensing rights to\n   <em>\n    Miguel Cotto v. Sergio Martinez, SBC Middleweight Championship Fight Program\n   </em>\n   (the \"Program\"), which was telecast nationwide on June 7, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-16. The Program included the main event fight between Cotto and Martinez and many \"undercard\" fights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.

The internet connection was provided by Great Lakes Data Vyve Broadband.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Patel testified that Peaches did not have telephone lines, that Peaches had cable television, and that the internet connection was provided by the same cable company that provided Peaches with cable television. Dkt. No. 38-7 at 13, 21, 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Neither Fobi nor Patel paid a commercial licensing fee to show the Program at Peaches. Dkt. No. 38-8 at 4; Dkt. No. 38-7 at 6. Fobi testified that it was likely her idea to show the Program. Dkt. No. 38-6 at 5. Nevertheless, Fobi had authorization from Patel to show the Program without a commercial licensing fee, dkt. no. 38-8 at 4, and she would not have shown the Program without Patel's approval. Dkt. No. 38-6 at 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to showing the Program, Fobi had talked with Patel about using a website to receive the Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Fobi advertised on Facebook and Twitter that Peaches would be showing the Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. No. 38-6 at 6. Fobi tagged potential customers on the Facebook post advertising the Program. Dkt. No. 38-6 at 7.

Based on this record, a reasonable jury can because it is reasonable to infer that Defendants received the Program by means of cables that are also used to transmit cable television. Notably, to violate \u00a7 553, the unauthorized communications do not need to be part of a cable service, rather what matters is whether the unauthorized communications were sent over a \"facility ...\n   <em>\n    designed\n   </em>\n   to provide cable service.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7) (emphasis added).

This fact, Defendants argue, shows that they were \"authorized by the internet provider and website to receive the signal for the subject TV program.\" Dkt. No. 33 at 8. First, under \u00a7 553 Defendants must have been specifically authorized by a cable operator, not an internet provider or a website. No party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this issue at this point in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, even if Defendants argued that they were authorized by a cable operator that was acting as their ISP, Defendants have not shown as a matter of law that the simple act of accessing a website means that the cable operator that was acting as their ISP specifically authorized those communications. Defendants set forth two cases in support of the proposition that they were specifically authorized by their ISP, but these cases are materially distinguishable\n   because they all dealt with defendants that\n   <em>\n    purchased\n   </em>\n   television programming from a cable operator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J &amp; J Sports Prods., Inc. v.

This distinction is important because under \u00a7 553 the communications must be\n   <em>\n    specifically\n   </em>\n   authorized; a purchase of a communication from the entity that then sends the communication directly to the purchaser shows that the entity sending the communication specifically authorized the purchaser's reception of the communication. Here, the ISP merely provided access to the internet. The ISP did not undertake any conscious actions to send the Program to Defendants, unlike the cable operators in\n   <em>\n    Schmalz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mandell\n   </em>\n   , which made the conscious effort to send the communications directly to the purchasers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In stark contrast to Defendants, Plaintiff has shown evidence in the record showing that Defendants were not authorized by their cable operator to receive the Program. The Acceptable Use policy of Defendants' internet provider states that \"Customer will not use, nor allow others to use, the Service to send or receive any information which infringes the ... proprietary rights of any other person, entity or business organization.\" Dkt. No. 38-10 at 3. Plaintiff has provided the licensing agreement giving it the exclusive license to exhibit the Program at commercial establishments such as Peaches. And Defendants have admitted that they did not purchase from Plaintiff a sublicense to exhibit the Program in Peaches. Thus, a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff had a proprietary right in the exhibition of the Program in commercial establishments that included Peaches, that Defendants infringed on this right when it showed the Program in Peaches without a sublicense from Plaintiff, that Defendants violated the Acceptable Use policy of its internet provider, and, finally, that Defendants were not specifically authorized by a cable operator to show the Program in Peaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For these reasons, a reasonable jury could find that Defendants received the Program over a cable system without specific authorization from a cable operator or by law.

Here, Fobi received the Program when she accessed the website showing the Program from her computer. A reasonable jury could find that the Program was a communications service, which is undefined in the statute, offered over a cable system.

Thus, a reasonable jury could find Fobi liable for violating \u00a7 553.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Patel's liability, however, can only be established under a vicarious liability theory because Patel was not present at Peaches on the night the Program was shown, so he could not have received the Program directly (unlike Fobi). Nevertheless, courts in this circuit and this district have consistently found that an individual officer of a corporation can be found guilty for violating \u00a7 553 under a vicarious liability theory.

Regarding the first requirement, Fobi testified that Patel authorized the showing of the Program at Peaches, that Fobi would not have shown the Program without Patel's authorization, and that Fobi talked with Patel about using a website to receive and show the Program. A reasonable jury could find that Patel had a right and ability to supervise the violation, i.e., the showing of the Program at Peaches, based on these facts. Turning to the second requirement, a reasonable jury could find that Patel had a strong financial interest in the showing of the Program at Peaches. Patel was and still is the president and general manager of the entity that owned Peaches. Thus, he had a strong financial incentive to increase the sales numbers on the night the Program was shown and to increase the customer base by showing and advertising the Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For these reasons, Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to Defendant Fobi and Patel is due to be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Here, Fobi consciously chose to use the internet to access a free website to show the Program at a commercial establishment. Patel, under this record, also expressly authorized the showing of the Program, and implicitly authorized the advertisement of the Program. Further, Fobi's compensation for working at Peaches was tip money, so she had an incentive to maximize the number of customers at Peaches. By advertising that Peaches would be showing the Program, Fobi could be shown to have attempted to increase foot traffic at Peaches and thus increase her tip money. Finally, Patel, as the president and general manager of the entity that owned Peaches, could be shown to have sought commercial advantage and private gain when he authorized the Program to be shown at Peaches without a license from Plaintiff.
