Legal Standard\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Section 1782 of Title 28 of the United States Code, entitled \"Assistance to Foreign and International Tribunals and to Litigants before such Tribunals,\" provides that \"[t]he district court of the district in which a person resides or is found may order him to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201782\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The statute authorizes district courts to grant such relief only where (1) the person from whom discovery is sought resides or is found in the district of the district court where the application is made; (2) the discovery is for use in a proceeding before a foreign tribunal; and (3) the application is made by the foreign tribunal or \"any interested person.\"\n   <em>\n    Schmitz v.

Statutory Requirements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties do not contest that two of the three statutory prerequisites - that the respondents reside in or are found in the Southern District of New York, and that the application is made by an interested person - are satisfied here. The only statutory requirement in dispute is whether the discovery sought is \"for use in a proceeding before a foreign tribunal.\"\n   <em>\n    Schmitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9373322\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/79/#p83\">\n    376 F.3d at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, Respondents maintain that the Applicants have not established that a foreign proceeding is reasonably contemplated, while Applicants maintain that this prerequisite has been satisfied by the steps they have taken thus far to initiate litigation in Germany.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The \"for use\" standard has undergone considerable evolution in the Second Circuit. After a 1964 amendment eliminated the requirement that the discovery be for use \"in any judicial proceeding\n   <em>\n    pending\n   </em>\n   in any court in a foreign country\" and replaced that language with the modern formulation, courts spawned a range of interpretations of the \"for use in a proceeding\" language. Pub. L. No. 80-773,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Stat.%20869\">\n    62 Stat. 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 949 (1948),\n   <em>\n    as amended by\n   </em>\n   Pub.

The Second Circuit initially adopted a relatively stringent standard, requiring a proceeding to be \"imminent - very likely to occur and very soon to occur.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Int'l Judicial Assistance for the Federative Republic of Brazil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527519\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/936/702/#p706\">\n    936 F.2d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706 (2d Cir. 1991). In contrast, other Circuits implemented a more lenient standard.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Letter of Request from the Crown Prosecution Serv. of the U.K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644989,5676022\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/870/686/\">\n    870 F.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 691 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (requiring only that a proceeding be within reasonable contemplation). In 2004, the Supreme Court resolved the circuit split by rejecting the Second Circuit's approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Intel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    542 U.S. at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Expressly stating that there is no requirement that a proceeding be \"pending\" or \"imminent,\" the Court held \"that [ Section] 1782(a) requires only that a dispositive ruling ... be within reasonable contemplation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court further elaborated that \"[i]t is not necessary ... for the [adjudicative] proceeding to be pending at the time the evidence is sought, but only that the evidence is eventually to be used in such a proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Hans Smit,\n   <em>\n    International Litigation Under the United States Code\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Colum.%20L.%20Rev.%201015\">\n    65 Colum. L. Rev. 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1026(1965) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit has fleshed out the contours of the \"reasonably contemplated\" standard. In\n   <em>\n    Mees v. Buiter\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit took a broad view of\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   when it found that materials sought for use in a reasonably contemplated proceeding need not be necessary to the commencement of that proceeding; rather, they must merely \"be [for] us[e] at some stage of a foreign proceeding that was within reasonable contemplation at the time\" of the application.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278259\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/291/#p301\">\n    793 F.3d 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301 (2d Cir. 2015). Nevertheless, to demonstrate that an action is within reasonable contemplation, \"the applicant must have more than a subjective intent to undertake some legal action, and instead must provide some objective indicium that the action is being contemplated.\"\n   <em>\n    Certain Funds, Accounts and/or Inv. Vehicles v. KPMG LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331825\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/113/#p123\">\n    798 F.3d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123 (2d Cir. 2015). The Second Circuit reasoned that \"the Supreme Court's inclusion of the word 'reasonable' in the 'within reasonable contemplation' formulation indicates that the proceedings cannot be merely speculative. At a minimum, a [ Section] 1782 applicant must present to the district court some concrete basis from which it can determine that the contemplated proceeding is more than just a twinkle in counsel's eye.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331825\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/113/#p123\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331825\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/113/#p123\">\n    at 123-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, Applicants have set forth numerous indicia that litigation is contemplated, including hiring German litigation counsel, retaining experts, and sending a detailed demand letter to HSH, among others. (Doc. No. 4 (\"Applicants' Br.\") at 11, Doc. No. 28 (\"Applicants' Reply Br.\") at 1-2.) And, critically, Applicants' counsel made an affirmative representation at oral argument that the Applicants would file their litigation before the end of the year - an assertion that Respondents have not rebutted. (Doc. No. 34 (Transcript of Oral Argument) at 31:6.) While Respondents have attempted to frame the Application as a \"fishing expedition\" of the sort frequently denied by judges in this district,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ayyash v. Crowe Horwath LLP\n   </em>\n   , 17-mc-482 (AJN),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202976017\">\n    2018 WL 2976017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 13, 2018), the Court finds that, in light of the foregoing, this case does not fit the profile of a fishing expedition. If anything, Respondents' arguments suggest a \"bluff\" more than a \"fishing expedition,\" given that the contours of the potential litigation are already well-defined. However, in light of Applicants' affirmative representation at oral argument of their intent to file the German action, Respondents can no longer maintain that the action is a mere bluff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that representation and the objective indicia of contemplated litigation demonstrated by Applicants, the Court is persuaded that Applicants have demonstrated the concrete basis required to show that the German litigation is \"more than just a twinkle in counsel's eye,\" and that therefore\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   's\"reasonable contemplation\" standard has been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because the statutory prerequisites have been satisfied, the Court now turns to the discretionary factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C. Discretionary Factors\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1. Foreign Tribunal's Jurisdictional Reach\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The First discretionary factor asks the Court to evaluate whether the documents or testimony sought by the Application are within the foreign tribunal's jurisdictional reach, and thus accessible absent resort to Section 1782.\n   <em>\n    Microsoft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5431565\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/428/188/#p192\">\n    428 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   192-93 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    542 U.S. at 264-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Respondents are currently not parties to the contemplated proceeding. Accordingly, since \"nonparticipants in the foreign proceeding may be outside the foreign tribunal's jurisdictional reach ... their evidence, available in the United States, may be unobtainable absent [ Section] 1782(a) aid.\"\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    542 U.S. at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, while it is possible that Respondents could become parties to the proceeding in the future,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Applicant's Br. at 13 n.12, that possibility is characteristic of virtually all Section 1782 applications involving a reasonably contemplated, rather than pending, proceeding. Given the Supreme Court's interpretation of the reasonably contemplated standard, the mere possibility that a third party may ultimately be named in the litigation does not justify denying a third-party subpoena pursuant to Section 1782.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mees\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278259\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/291/#p301\">\n    793 F.3d at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the Second Circuit \"and the Supreme Court have declined to read into [ Section 1782 ] requirements that are not rooted in its text.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Furthermore, \"the weight of authority in this district\" supports the view that \"the relevant inquiry is whether the foreign tribunal has the ability to control the evidence sought and order production, not whether the tribunal has control over the party targeted by\" the application.\n   <em>\n    In re Ex Parte Application of Porsche Automobil Holding SE\n   </em>\n   , 15-mc-417 (LAK),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20702327\">\n    2016 WL 702327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 18, 2016). Thus, even if - as Respondents contend - many of the documents sought are in the possession of HSH, which will be a party in the contemplated litigation, the limitations of German discovery would nevertheless counsel in favor of providing Section 1782 assistance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8.

Thus, this factor is either neutral or - in light of the willingness of courts to grant Section 1782 applications for purposes of German litigation - cuts in favor of granting the Application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   3. Circumvention of Foreign Proof-Gathering Restrictions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The third discretionary factor seeks to identify \"attempt[s] to circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions or other policies of a foreign country or the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Microsoft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5431565\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/428/188/#p192\">\n    428 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   192-93 (citing\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    542 U.S. at 264-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). However, Section 1782\"contains no foreign-discoverability requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Mees\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278259\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/291/#p301\">\n    793 F.3d at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2015). Indeed, \"nothing in the text of [ Section] 1782 limits a district court's production-order authority to materials that could be discovered in the foreign jurisdiction if the materials were located there.\"\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    542 U.S. at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, to demonstrate circumvention, Respondents must illustrate not merely that the requested documents are not obtainable through German procedures, but that Applicants are engaged in a bad faith endeavor to misuse Section 1782.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Respondents primarily rely on the fact that the \"locus\" of this action is in Germany to suggest that Applicants are engaged in an end run around German law. (Doc. No. 19 (\"J.C. Flowers Br.\") at 16 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Application of Kreke Immobilien KG\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-mc-110,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205966916\">\n    2013 WL 5966916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 8, 2013).) ) However, Section 1782 contains neither a foreign-discoverability nor an exhaustion requirement, and such requirements would seem to undermine the statute's very purpose. Actions like the German lawsuit anticipated here are precisely the types of proceedings contemplated by the statute, which is designed to promote the \"twin aims\" of \"providing efficient means of assistance to participants in international litigation in our federal courts\" and \"encouraging foreign countries by example to provide similar means of assistance to our courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Schmitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9373322\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/79/#p83\">\n    376 F.3d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Metallgesellschaft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285200\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/77/#p78\">\n    121 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   79 ). In light of those \"twin aims,\" the fact that litigation is primarily foreign in nature cannot, standing alone, justify denial of a Section 1782 application. Put simply, the Court is not persuaded that Applicants have engaged in any improper or bad faith evasion of German procedures. Accordingly, the third factor supports granting the Application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   4. Burdensomeness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The final discretionary factor asks courts to be mindful of overly intrusive or burdensome discovery requests.\n   <em>\n    Microsoft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5431565\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/428/188/#p192\">\n    428 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   192-93 (citing\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    542 U.S. at 264-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). \"[A] district court evaluating a [ Section] 1782 discovery request should assess whether the discovery sought is overbroad or unduly burdensome by applying the familiar standards of Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Mees\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278259\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/291/#p301\">\n    793 F.3d at 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the Second Circuit has instructed that \"it is far preferable\n   for a district court to reconcile whatever misgivings it may have about the impact of its participation in the foreign litigation by issuing a closely tailored discovery order rather than by simply denying relief outright.\"\n   <em>\n    Euromepa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11363166\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/51/1095/#p1100\">\n    51 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1101 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malev Hungarian Airlines v. United Techs. Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"42498\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/964/97/#p102\">\n    964 F.2d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102 (2d Cir. 1992) (observing that Section 1782 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 furnish district courts with broad discretion to impose reasonable limitations upon discovery).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, Respondents raise a host of objections to the scope of the Application, arguing that it is unduly burdensome because Applicants seek broad discovery on a wide range of topics across a significant time period and because many of the documents are located in Europe, entailing logistical difficulties and exposure to foreign data privacy laws. (J.C. Flowers Br. at 17-24, Doc. No. 22 (\"Cerberus Capital Br.\") at 2-3, Doc. No. 18 (\"Goldentree Asset Management Br.\") at 3.) Applicants maintain that the proposed subpoenas are narrowly tailored to specific claims, with any specific objections to breadth better addressed through request-by-request conferral rather than by denying the Application at the outset. (Applicants' Reply Br. at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court agrees with Applicants and rejects Respondents' assertion that the contemplated status of the German litigation \"renders [Applicants] unable to narrowly tailor their requests, as they must.\" (J.C. Flowers Br. at 19.) Because the Supreme Court has upheld Section 1782 applications for reasonably contemplated, and not necessarily imminent, proceedings, it simply cannot be required that Applicants must bring their claims prior to their application. And while the Court is sensitive to the significant costs entailed by the requested discovery here, the Court - mindful of the Second Circuit's guidance regarding the undesirability of wholesale denials of Section 1782 applications on the basis of burdensomeness - draws upon its broad discretion to place limitations on that discovery and thereby mitigate any burdensomeness concerns. Therefore, while the application is granted in its entirety with respect to documents held by U.S. custodians, the Court grants the application with respect to documents held by\n   <em>\n    foreign\n   </em>\n   custodians only to the extent that the Applicants (1) assume the costs of the document production, including the costs of compliance with the GDPR or other applicable European data privacy laws and (2) indemnify Respondents against any potential breaches of European data privacy laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, nothing in the Court's ruling precludes Respondents from filing overbreadth objections to subpoenas, which would permit further tailoring on a per-request basis. The Court is persuaded that this targeted approach will further the \"twin aims\" of the statute while encouraging a surgical approach to discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the statutory requirements of Section 1782 have been satisfied and that the discretionary factors weigh in favor of Applicants. Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Application is GRANTED, with the limitations delineated above. The Clerk of Court is respectfully\n   directed to terminate the motion pending at Doc.
