Wright, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In this consolidated putative class action litigation, Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6) for failure to plead fraud with particularity and failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. (Dkt. 42.) For the reasons addressed below, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs are eleven individuals who reside in eleven states throughout the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Polaris Industries, Inc., is a Delaware corporation based in Minnesota and Defendant Polaris Sales Inc., a subsidiary of Polaris Industries, is a Minnesota corporation also based in Minnesota. Defendants design and manufacture off-road vehicles and their component parts, including engines. In the past five years, Plaintiffs each purchased an off-road vehicle manufactured by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Between 2013 and 2018, Defendants recalled more than one dozen off-road vehicle models (collectively, the \"class vehicles\"), including the vehicles purchased by Plaintiffs. These recalls occurred because of a design defect that creates a significant risk of overheating and catching fire. This design defect has caused more than 250 fires, more than 30 severe injuries, and at least three deaths. According to Plaintiffs, the design defect is common to all the class vehicles, which are equipped with an unusually high-powered \"ProStar\" engine. Three of the eleven Plaintiffs, Jose Luna, Clint Halvorsrod, and Chad Rogers, allege that the off-road vehicles that they purchased caught fire while operating, which resulted in a total loss of the vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced multiple putative class-action lawsuits against Defendants in or about April 2018 arising from the defects and fire hazards associated with the class vehicles. Subsequently, United States Magistrate Judge David T. Schultz consolidated these cases and appointed interim counsel to act on behalf of the putative class, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(g)(3) and 42(a). Magistrate Judge Schultz also ordered Plaintiffs to file a consolidated amended complaint, which Plaintiffs filed on June 15, 2018. The amended complaint alleges 54 counts against Defendants. Count 1 alleges that Defendants breached a written warranty and an implied warranty of merchantability, in violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (MMWA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202301\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Counts 2 through 54 allege violations of state laws in the eleven states in which Plaintiffs purchased defective off-road vehicles. These claims allege violations of state consumer fraud laws, breaches of express and implied warranties, fraudulent iomission, and unjust enrichment. As a result of the engine defects, Plaintffs allege, their vehicles have diminished in value. Plaintiffs either would not have purchased their vehicles or they would have paid significantly less for their vehicles had they known about the engine defects. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and monetary relief. But they expressly do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seek damages for any personal injuries resulting from the engine defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss each count except Counts 7, 8, 9, and 12, which allege violations of California law with respect to Plaintiff Jose Luna. Advancing several alternative arguments, Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs claims must be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6) for failure to plead fraud with particularity and failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. First, Defendants contend that most of Plaintiffs' state-law claims must be dismissed because they do not allege that the defect manifested in their vehicles. Second, Defendants argue that most of Plaintiffs' warranty claims must be dismissed in light of Defendants' limited warranty because Plaintiffs do not allege pre-suit notice and the viability of Plaintiffs' MMWA claim depends on Plaintiffs' state-law warranty claims. Third, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims must be dismissed because Plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law and Plaintiffs did not directly confer a benefit on Defendants. Fourth, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' fraudulent omission and consumer fraud claims must be dismissed because Plaintiffs either fail to plead fraud with particularity or the claims are barred by the applicable state laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A complaint must allege sufficient facts such that, when accepted as true, a facially plausible claim to relief is stated.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

This argument also is unavailing. The amended complaint alleges that Plaintiffs Luna, Halvorsrod, and Rogers researched Defendants' products before purchasing their vehicles.

The only purported omissions that Plaintiff Rogers identifies in the amended complaint pertain to the quality of the vehicle he purchased.

Second, to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III, an injury need not be\n    <em>\n     catastrophic.\n    </em>\n    But there must be an injury in fact. The pleading deficiency here exists as to eight of the Plaintiffs because the amended complaint does not allege that\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    malfunctions occurred.
