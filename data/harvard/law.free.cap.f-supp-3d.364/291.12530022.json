After a trilogy of decisions resolved the parties' various motions to dismiss, this litigation progressed to discovery and, now, to cross-motions for summary judgment. Additionally, the Court has been asked to resolve the parties'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   disputes as to the admissibility of expert testimony provided by the Estate of Marilyn Monroe, LLC (the \"Monroe Estate\" or the \"Estate\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its first opinion,\n   <em>\n    A.V.E.L.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Marilyn Monroe, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152909\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/131/196/\">\n    131 F.Supp.3d 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   \"), this Court granted in part and denied in part the motions of X One X Movie Archives, Inc. (\"X One X\") and V. International Fine Arts Publishing, Inc. (\"VIFA,\" and together with X One X, Leo Valencia, IPL, Inc., and A.V.E.L.A., INC., the \"AVELA Parties\") to dismiss the First Amended Counterclaim filed by the Monroe Estate. After the Court issued\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   , the AVELA Parties filed their respective answers to the First Amended Counterclaim. They also brought counterclaims of their own against the Monroe Estate and related parties Authentic Brands Group LLC (\"ABG\"), and James Salter (\"Salter,\" and together with the Monroe Estate and ABG, the \"Estate Parties\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response, the Estate Parties moved to dismiss X One X's and VIFA's counterclaims. In\n   <em>\n    A.V.E.L.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Marilyn Monroe, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267690\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/461/\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    AVELA II\n   </em>\n   \"), the Court dismissed without prejudice several of X One X's and VIFA's claims. X One X and VIFA then elected to replead several of their dismissed counterclaims. These efforts begat\n   <em>\n    A.V.E.L.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Marilyn Monroe, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 12 Civ. 4828 (KPF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201273343\">\n    2018 WL 1273343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2018) ( \"\n   <em>\n    AVELA III\n   </em>\n   \"), where the Court dismissed the amended counterclaims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The upshot of the three decisions is that all parties to this action have some claims remaining. The Estate Parties' remaining claims are Counts I, II, III, IV, and VII of the Estate's First Amended Counterclaim, which encompass claims for trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. The AVELA Parties' remaining claims are Counts II, III, V, and VI of A.V.E.L.A.'s Complaint; Counts I, II, and V of VIFA's Answer to the First Amended Counterclaim and First Amended Counterclaims; and Counts I and II of X One X's Answer to the First Amended Counterclaim and Related Second Amended Counterclaims, which in the aggregate encompass requests for a declaration of non-infringement as well as claims for trademark cancellation, tortious interference with a contractual relationship, and intentional interference with a prospective economic advantage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As detailed in the remainder of this Opinion, the Estate Parties are successful in part in their motion, and the AVELA Parties are unsuccessful. The Court concludes easily that genuine disputes of material fact remain as to the Estate Parties' federal and state trademark claims, as well as their claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. However, the Court finds that the Estate Parties are entitled to summary judgment on their claim that two of the AVELA Parties are in fact alter egos. Further, the Court finds that the Estate Parties are entitled to summary judgment as to the AVELA Parties' claims for trademark cancellation, tortious interference with contract, and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. Conversely, the Court finds that the AVELA Parties are not entitled to summary judgment as to the remaining claims of laches, copyright law, the First Amendment, or the fair use doctrine. Finally, the Court denies the AVELA Parties' motion to exclude expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court discusses the underlying facts only to the extent necessary to resolve the instant motions, as the Court has engaged in a disquisition of this case's history in its prior opinions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AVELA III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201273343\">\n    2018 WL 1273343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3,\n   <em>\n    AVELA II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267690\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/461/\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   468-70 ;\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152909\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/131/196/\">\n    131 F.Supp.3d at 200-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Valencia owns a collection of entities, including two Nevada-based companies, A.V.E.L.A., Inc. (\"AVELA\") and X One X. (AVELA 56.1 \u00b6 5). The Estate Parties claim that he also has an interest in IPL, Inc. (\"IPL\"), a Delaware limited liability company (\"LLC\"). (Estate 56.1 \u00b6 142).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   VIFA is \"a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of California with its principal place of business ... [in] Carlsbad, California[.]\" (AVELA 56.1 \u00b6 3). It operates as a licensing agent for AVELA. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 133-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Estate Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Monroe Estate is a Delaware LLC with its principal place of business in New York City. (AVELA 56.1 \u00b6 6). The Monroe Estate is a brand development and licensing company that maintains what it claims to be an exclusive portfolio of intellectual property rights related to Marilyn Monroe and, more specifically, a number of federal trademark registrations that are claimed to be valid and subsisting in full force, incorporating the words \"Marilyn\" or \"Marilyn Monroe\" (collectively, the \"Monroe Marks\").\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152909\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/131/196/\">\n    131 F.Supp.3d at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . ABG is a separate Delaware LLC, and Salter is the Chief Executive Officer of both ABG and the Monroe Estate.\n   <em>\n    AVELA II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267690\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/461/\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Estate's Marks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In its prior opinions, the Court has provided an exhaustive list of the trademarks,\n   including some that the Monroe Estate alleges have become statutorily incontestable (the \"Incontestable Marks\").\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152909\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/131/196/\">\n    131 F.Supp.3d at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). The Estate owns twelve separate trademark registrations, including design marks for stylized versions of Monroe's signature in perfume; watches; posters and greeting cards; clothing; eyewear; collector plates; towels; porcelain dolls; and wine. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 48-56). The Estate owns wordmarks in \"Marilyn Monroe\" that apply to a broader class of goods including all clothing items. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 61-65). The Estate also owns a wordmark to \"Marilyn\" for wine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 69-73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As this Court previously observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Aside from the registered marks, the Monroe Estate has applied for a number of trademarks and service marks incorporating the words \"Marilyn Monroe\" or the design of a lip print. The Monroe Estate also claims substantial common law rights in the \"Marilyn,\" \"Marilyn Monroe,\" and lip print design marks (together with the registered marks, the \"MONROE Marks\"). Separately, the Monroe Estate asserts that it is \"the exclusive owner of those rights in and to Marilyn Monroe's identity, persona, name and likeness arising under common law and/or statute[.]\" The First Amended Counterclaim collectively refers to the MONROE Marks and the Monroe Estate's interests in Monroe's identity, persona, name, and likeness as the \"Marilyn Monroe Intellectual Property,\" a convention the Court adopts for purposes of this Opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152909\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/131/196/\">\n    131 F.Supp.3d at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Alleged Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While the procedural background of this case evokes the most abstruse law school examinations, the core factual dispute is quite simple: The parties contest the validity of the Estate's claim to the Marilyn Monroe Intellectual Property. In their amended pleadings, the Estate Parties claim that the AVELA Parties have no rights to any of the Marilyn Monroe Intellectual Property, and yet continue to license, design, manufacture, and distribute merchandise, including t-shirts, glassware, and posters, that incorporates said Intellectual Property. (Estate Br. 2-3). These products compete with the products designed and distributed by the Monroe Estate and its licensees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, in the Monroe Estate's telling, the case is a simple story of a legitimate trademark holder forced to defend its rights against an intellectual property pirate and his armada of sham companies. The Monroe Estate asks the Court to recognize its trademarks and to hold the AVELA Parties responsible for stealing its intellectual property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The AVELA Parties tell a different story: They allege that the Monroe Estate's trademarks are invalid; that the claims to the Marilyn Monroe Intellectual Property are frivolous; and that Estate has interfered with their business relationships through the strategic use of litigation. In particular, the AVELA Parties allege that the Estate has no connection to the actual person of Marilyn Monroe (AVELA 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 7-30), and that the trademarks are mere litigation stratagems designed to prevent competing businesses from entering the market for Marilyn Monroe products. (AVELA Br. 1-2). Rather than a trademark holder fighting to protect its property, the AVELA Parties portray the Monroe Estate as a pretender to the throne that has hoodwinked companies, consumers, and the Court. The Court is left to determine whether a reasonable jury would credit either of these accounts on the record developed during discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Expert Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Though the parties' expert reports are the subject of a separate motion to exclude,\n   the results of the reports are also relevant to the issues implicated by the cross-motions for summary judgment. Each side commissioned expert reports to test the possibility of consumer confusion. The Estate Parties hired Hal Poret, a survey expert, to examine whether consumers believed that Marilyn Monroe or the Estate endorsed a shirt made by AVELA. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 248-49). The resulting Poret Report analyzes survey responses from consumers in a mall about one of three shirts: an AVELA shirt depicting Marilyn Monroe, a shirt depicting a non-famous woman, and a shirt depicting Benjamin Franklin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 249). Respondents were asked to assess who produced the shirt and whether permission was required. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 250).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Those respondents who were asked about the shirts with a non-famous woman and with Benjamin Franklin were considered control groups. (Dkt. # 338-15 (Poret Report) at 9). These control groups measured how many respondents wrongly believed that the non-Monroe shirt implied Monroe's endorsement, and how many respondents wrongly believed that the Franklin shirt had been endorsed by Franklin or his successors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-12). The Poret Report concluded that when the former control group was taken into account the level of confusion was 23.4%, and when both control groups were taken into account the level of confusion was 20.5%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The AVELA Parties hired their own survey expert, Howard Marylander, to produce a report on the subject of consumer confusion. (AVELA 56.1 \u00b6 108). The resulting Marylander Report uses a similar survey method to examine the likelihood of consumer confusion. (Dkt. # 371-17 (Marylander Report) ). However, Marylander used a different garment for the control group, a shirt with a picture of a woman posed in a similar position to Monroe with the name \"Nichole\" written near her photo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). The shirts also contained tags (called \"hangtags\" throughout the Report) with the brand name \"Radio Days,\" which AVELA claims licensees are required to place on their shirts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Marylander Report found that 8% of respondents believed the Monroe shirts carried an endorsement or were affiliated with the holders of her rights, and 8% of the control group respondents believed the same about \"Nichole\" for the Nichole shirts. (Marylander Report 11-12). From this, Marylander concluded that total consumer confusion was accurately measured as zero. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Each side has also produced a rebuttal report, in which it has identified purported flaws and errors in the other side's survey methodology. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 338-18 (Rebuttal Expert Report of Hal Poret); Dkt. # 355-2 (Rebuttal Expert Report of Howard Marylander) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Procedural Developments After\n    <em>\n     AVELA III\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On March 13, 2018, the Court issued\n   <em>\n    AVELA III\n   </em>\n   , which recounts the case's procedural history through that date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201273343\">\n    2018 WL 1273343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3.

The Court held in\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   that the Estate Parties had adequately alleged ownership of rights to the Monroe persona.\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152909\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/131/196/\">\n    131 F.Supp.3d at 206-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given the procedural context, however, the Court made no findings as a matter of law. The Court now concludes on this record that the Estate has established that it owns the rights to the Monroe persona. In so doing, the Court rejects the AVELA Parties' arguments that (i) the rights do not exist and (ii) the Estate's decades of removal from Ms. Monroe prevents it from bringing these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court begins with a discussion of why these rights exist. The AVELA Parties claim first that the Estate Parties cannot own rights to Ms. Monroe's persona under the Lanham Act, because \"\u00a7 43(a) 'persona' rights did not exist at the time of Monroe's death.\" (VIFA Br. 7). As the Estate Parties point out, this claim makes little sense, given that the Lanham Act came into existence in 1946. (Estate Opp. 7).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beastie Boys\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178389\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/66/424/#p448\">\n    66 F.Supp.3d at 445-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The AVELA Parties counter with several cases suggesting the inability of deceased celebrities to pass on unrecognized rights of publicity, including two involving Ms. Monroe herself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Milton H. Greene Archives, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marilyn Monroe LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514791\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/983/\">\n    692 F.3d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2012) ;\n   <em>\n    Shaw Family Archives, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    CMG Worldwide, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4084326\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/486/309/\">\n    486 F.Supp.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2007). Much of their discussion, however, covers the same path the Court traversed in\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   , where it held that a false endorsement claim under the Lanham Act was distinct from a claim for violation of a right of publicity.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152909\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/131/196/\">\n    131 F.Supp.3d at 204-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   , the Court rejected the notion that the viability of a false\n   endorsement claim on behalf of a deceased celebrity is \"questionable,\" and followed the precedent of\n   <em>\n    Bruce Lee Enterprises, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    A.V.E.L.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Bruce Lee I\n   </em>\n   \"), and its predecessors in determining that the Lanham Act could cover claims regarding false endorsement involving deceased celebrities. No. 10 Civ. 2333 (LTS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201327137\">\n    2011 WL 1327137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2011) (collecting cases). The Court reaffirms its prior holding that the Lanham Act covers false endorsement claims and the owner of rights can assert them against infringing parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The AVELA Parties next suggest that the lack of a secondary meaning associated with the Monroe persona forecloses the possibility that the Estate Parties could hold rights under the Lanham Act. (VIFA Br. 8-15). This argument again misperceives the underlying issue: Secondary meaning concerns whether a mark has acquired meaning that is primarily identified with the maker of the product rather than its use.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeSportsac, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    K mart Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288730\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/754/71/#p78\">\n    754 F.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78 (2d Cir. 1985) (holding that secondary meaning exists \"when the purchasing public associates a [product's design] with a single producer or source rather than just with the product itself\"). A plaintiff must demonstrate secondary meaning to prove trademark infringement in certain contexts, but such proof is not necessary for a false endorsement claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kregos\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Associated Press\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525813\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/937/700/#p710\">\n    937 F.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 710 (2d Cir. 1991) (\"The fact that a proprietor fails to show sufficient secondary meaning in a mark to establish an infringement claim does not preclude his assertion of some other Lanham Act claim such as false designation of origin or false description.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Notably, a false endorsement claim is an argument that the specific products in question falsely indicate endorsement by, or association with, an individual who has not granted this permission.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trump\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pavion, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , No. 89 Civ. 5453 (TPG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20WL%20167964\">\n    1991 WL 167964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 1991) (\"[T]he specific question is whether consumers will be confused into believing that a lipstick labelled IVANA is endorsed by, or otherwise associated with, Ivana Trump.\"). The secondary meaning analysis is inapt. The AVELA Parties raise arguments related to the widespread use of Monroe's image during her lifetime and after her death, and the correlative absence of false endorsement claims during those periods. (VIFA Br. 10-15). But while it is true that third-party usage may have relevance in determining whether a consumer is likely to be confused as to whether a product depicting Marilyn Monroe suggests endorsement by or association with Ms. Monroe or the Estate, such usage does not foreclose the possibility that such rights exist or that the Estate owns them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In the alternative, the AVELA Parties suggest that, even if trademark rights to the Monroe persona could exist, the Estate does not own them. Here, the AVELA Parties argue that the Estate \"is not Monroe's family, heir, estate, or assignee - the only entities courts have ever allowed to bring a \u00a7 43(a) claim on behalf of a deceased celebrity.\" (AVELA Reply 4 (internal citations omitted) ). They argue that because there is no evidence that Ms. Monroe's will explicitly passed any intellectual property rights to anyone, the Estate cannot claim ownership now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The AVELA Parties cite heavily to the\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   decisions, which held that the Estate's predecessor, Marilyn Monroe LLC, held no state-law right of publicity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514791\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/983/\">\n    692 F.3d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4084326\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/486/309/\">\n    486 F.Supp.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the Court has already addressed these issues, along with the broader issue of the distinction between a right of publicity and a claim for\n   false endorsement, in\n   <em>\n    AVELA I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152909\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/131/196/\">\n    131 F. Supp. 3d at 206-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Seeking a different answer than the one this Court previously gave, the AVELA Parties recount that a sister court has held that an action for false endorsement cannot succeed absent a right of publicity. (AVELA Opp. 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Avalos\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    IAC/Interactivecorp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13 Civ. 8351 (JMF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205493242\">\n    2014 WL 5493242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 2014) ) ). However, in\n   <em>\n    Avalos\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff raised not a false endorsement claim, but rather a \"reverse passing off\" claim related to the plaintiff's photos of a model who was not a party to the litigation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205493242\">\n    2014 WL 5493242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. The court there held that even if the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Avalos\n   </em>\n   were \"read to plead a claim for false endorsement,\" such a claim could not succeed, as the plaintiff did not make a claim to any ownership of the model's rights to her image and persona.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205493242\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While some language in the opinion suggests there is a connection between rights of publicity and a false endorsement claim,\n   <em>\n    Avalos\n   </em>\n   nowhere holds that the false endorsement claim requires a right of publicity. The Court will not revisit its holding in\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   that a false endorsement claim is distinct from a right of publicity claim and can survive in the absence of one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Estate's argument for ownership is straightforward. The rights to Marilyn Monroe's persona began with her. At her death, 75% of the residue of her estate was passed down to her acting teacher, Lee Strasberg, which then passed to his wife, Anna Strasberg, upon his death. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 27-28). The remaining 25% went to Marianna Kris, the late actress's psychiatrist, who passed her portion to the Anna Freud Center when she died in 1980. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-31). Ms. Strasberg became the administrator of the Monroe estate in 1989, and the estate closed in 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At that point, the New York Surrogate Court authorized the transfer of all remaining assets of the estate to Marilyn Monroe LLC, a company formed to manage the intellectual property belonging to Ms. Monroe that divided ownership between Ms. Strasberg and the Freud Center in accordance with the divisions in Ms. Monroe's will. (Dkt. # 355-6 (Declaration of Anna Strasberg), Ex. C). The Estate Plaintiff here acquired a controlling interest in Marilyn Monroe LLC, including Ms. Monroe's name, likeness, voice, and rights of publicity, in an Asset Purchase Agreement dated December 30, 2010. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6 24). Therefore, an unbroken chain of title extends from the decedent to the Estate.

They cite complaints from consumers to the Estate regarding products that the Estate Parties believe were created by AVELA. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6 244). They point to the Poret Report, which found consumer confusion in excess of 20%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 251). They point out that a number of the allegedly infringing images also include the name Marilyn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 213). These factors strongly suggest that the AVELA shirts are using a very similar likeness of Ms. Monroe and selected her image with the intention of profiting from her celebrity. Moreover, the Estate Parties argue that the quality of the AVELA products is inferior, as they contain images of Ms. Monroe with tattoos, deceased, or with sexually suggestive slogans, images of which the Estate would not have approved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 258). Finally, they argue that the t-shirt market is a casual one, where customers are unlikely to be particularly discerning in examining the shirts to determine whether the AVELA shirts have the Estate's endorsement. (Estate Br. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The AVELA Parties proffer their own expert report, the Marylander Report, which, they argue, better simulated market conditions by using hangtags on the t-shirts with the term \"Radio Days.\" (AVELA 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 67, 111). The AVELA Parties state that they require licensees selling their shirts to use these tags prominently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68). The Marylander Survey found that a baseline of about 8% of individuals think that any shirt with an image is endorsed by the depicted person, and that only 8% of the Monroe respondents thought AVELA's shirts carried an endorsement from Monroe or her estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 113-17). Therefore, they argue, there was\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   consumer confusion as to whether AVELA's shirts were falsely suggesting Monroe's endorsement, let alone the Estate's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The AVELA Parties' discussion of secondary meaning is more relevant here. The AVELA Parties point to precedents, including a much-discussed case involving Princess Diana, where a court rejected the idea that the unlicensed use of a celebrity's name and image could, on its own, violate the Lanham Act. (AVELA Opp. 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cairns\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Franklin Mint Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11246788\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/107/1212/\">\n    107 F.Supp.2d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. 2000) ) ). In the\n   <em>\n    Cairns\n   </em>\n   case, the court relied in part on the extensive use of Princess Diana's image during her lifetime in rejecting a \u00a7 43(a) claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11246788\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/107/1212/\">\n    107 F.Supp.2d at 1217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is clear that Princess Diana knew of the vast commercial uses of her image.... Although Princess Diana was selective in choosing charities to endorse, there is no evidence to suggest that she attempted to curb the sale of consumer products bearing her likeness.\"). The court reasoned that the ubiquity of Princess Diana's image in her lifetime suggested that customers could not reasonably believe that images of her could serve a source-identifying function. The AVELA Parties raise similar claims regarding the extensive publication of Monroe's image during her lifetime and after her death to suggest that it is unreasonable for the Estate to claim that her\n   image implies her endorsement. (AVELA 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 32-40). As for the Estate Parties' other claims, the AVELA Parties contend that the quality differences are a matter of opinion: \"Arguing that such artwork diminishes a product's quality is merely a judgment that people who have tattoos or smoke are inferior.\" (AVELA Opp. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Estate Parties reply with criticism of the Marylander Report, noting, among other points, that evidence produced by the Estate shows that the hangtags were not prominently affixed to the shirts. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6 254.d). The Estate Parties also suggest that\n   <em>\n    Cairns\n   </em>\n   is not relevant, as they have more vigorously pursued claims regarding the unlicensed use of Ms. Monroe's image than Diana's estate. (Estate Opp. 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The parties' debates over expert reports, the ubiquity of Ms. Monroe's image, and the relative merits of tattoos, hammer home the point that the reasonable consumer standard is a fact-intensive one. The Court cannot wholly credit the facts as either side presents them. Viewing both the surveys and the products that each side has identified, the Court concludes that a reasonable jury could find that AVELA's products confuse consumers into believing they were endorsed by Ms. Monroe or the Estate, and that it could find that Ms. Monroe's ubiquity and the passage of time would lead consumers to conclude that neither Monroe nor the Estate were in any way connected to the items. Summary judgment is thus not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Genuine Disputes of Material Fact Remain Regarding the Estate Parties' Claim for Unfair Competition Under New York Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As the Court discussed in\n   <em>\n    AVELA I\n   </em>\n   , the standard for unfair competition under New York law is the same as the standard for a false endorsement claim under the Lanham Act, but it contains an additional requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate bad faith on the part of the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152909\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/131/196/\">\n    131 F.Supp.3d at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Just as summary judgment is not appropriate on the Estate Parties' false endorsement claim because of the disputes over customer confusion, so too is summary judgment inappropriate on their claim for unfair competition under New York law. To be clear, the Estate Parties provide ample evidence of bad faith, pointing to the web of companies that Mr. Valencia has created to evade scrutiny, the judicial sanctions against Mr. Valencia, and the awareness by Mr. Valencia and those around him of the Estate's claim to rights in Monroe. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 218-34). And the AVELA Parties response rings hollow: They argue principally that Mr. Valencia and AVELA began using Ms. Monroe's image before the creation of the Estate, with products dating back to 1985. (AVELA Opp. 18). As the Estate Parties note, the AVELA Parties have produced no support for Mr. Valencia's statement that his companies' sales go that far back. (Estate Reply 4). Indeed, a court in the United Kingdom examining AVELA's filings in similar infringement litigation regarding the image of Betty Boop, addressed this issue and found: \"The 1985 date is untrue, and Mr. Valencia knows he cannot justify it.\"\n   <em>\n    Hearst Holdings Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    AVELA Inc.\n   </em>\n   , [2014] EWHC (Ch) 439,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20640415\">\n    2014 WL 640415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The bad-faith behavior of the AVELA Parties is clear from their conduct throughout the litigation, extending to the present filings that repeat the unsupported statements regarding a 1985 commencement date. However, absent a showing\n   that the products actually infringe on the Estate Parties' rights by creating consumer confusion as to the sponsorship of AVELA's products, AVELA's actions cannot constitute unfair competition. The Estate Parties' motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The cited examples of generic marks - shampoo, automobile, and aspirin - are terms that clearly indicate a type of item rather than a source or producer. There is no indication in the evidence presented by AVELA that the marks at issue here \"identify the type or species of goods or services to which they apply, [or] are totally lacking in distinctive quality.\"\n   <em>\n    KatiRoll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205671881\">\n    2015 WL 5671881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Indeed, the image and likeness of Monroe quite clearly refers not to a type of good (e.g., t-shirts, shot glasses, etc.), but to the woman depicted on the good. The AVELA Parties' response is a feeble assertion that, \"[i]f a customer walks into a store and asks for a 'Marilyn Monroe t-shirt,' it is likely they want a t-shirt with a picture of Monroe on it, not a t-shirt manufactured or endorsed by the legal fiction which is [the Estate].\" (AVELA Opp. 31). However, this point goes to the question of consumer confusion, as it addresses what a purchaser of a Marilyn Monroe t-shirt might understand that mark to suggest. It does not demonstrate that the mark is generic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court noted in\n   <em>\n    AVELA II\n   </em>\n   that it held \"serious doubts that [the AVELA Parties] will be able to establish that the Contested Marks are generic.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267690\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/461/\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Estate Parties note, where trademarks are registered, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating the marks are not protectable. (Estate Reply 14-15). Here, the AVELA Parties offer no evidence to demonstrate that consumers consider Marilyn Monroe's signature or likeness to be a generic mark that refers to a class of products. With discovery now closed and a factual record established, the Court finds nothing to suggest that the AVELA Parties can establish that the marks are generic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As for functionality, the Court offered a similar warning in\n   <em>\n    AVELA II\n   </em>\n   that, absent further factual support, it was not inclined to find the marks were functional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267690\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/461/\">\n    241 F.Supp.3d at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, the AVELA Parties present nothing that alters the Court's opinion. The AVELA Parties suggest that they have a claim for aesthetic functionality, as allowing the trademarks would undermine competitors' ability to compete in the relevant marketplace. (AVELA Opp. 32). For this, they cite the Federal Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    International Order of Job's Daughters\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lindeburg and Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1934476\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/727/1087/\">\n    727 F.2d 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed.

However, the titular organization had only minimally policed the use of the name and emblem, and had provided no evidence that consumers complained about third-party use or believed any connection existed between the organization and jewelry bearing the name and emblem.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1934476\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/727/1087/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1934476\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/727/1087/\">\n    at 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Here, by contrast, the Estate Parties point to significant activity in protecting the name and image of Monroe (Estate 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 32-47), and have presented evidence of both consumer complaints and consumer confusion (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 242-45). Furthermore, at other points the AVELA Parties have suggested that other commercial actors make use of Marilyn Monroe's image, name, and likeness; those arguments undercut their present argument that no competitors to the Estate exist. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AVELA 56.1 \u00b6 33).

The Estate's Marks Are Entitled to Protection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Here as well, the AVELA Parties' arguments for cancellation of the marks are predicated on the argument that the Estate cannot possibly own the marks, because the Estate is not the creation of Ms. Monroe herself. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   VIFA Br. 22 (\"[The Estate's] registered trademarks are invalid where they unlawfully and falsely suggest a connection between [the Estate] and Monroe.\") ). As the Court has already noted, the connection between the Estate and Monroe is not false or fraudulent, and the AVELA Parties' incantations that Ms. Monroe did not register these trademarks herself, however frequently repeated, are not relevant. As the Estate Parties note, the Lanham Act provides that the registration of the marks constitutes prima facie evidence of validity. (Estate Reply 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In an attempt to contest the validity of the marks, the AVELA Parties cite to a decision of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that a restaurant could not trademark the term Margaritaville. (VIFA Br. 22 (citing\n   <em>\n    Buffett\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chi-Chi's, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=226%20U.S.P.Q.%20%28BNA%29%20428\">\n    226 U.S.P.Q. 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429 (T.T.A.B. 1985) ) ). In that decision, Jimmy Buffet, the composer of the famous song by that name, successfully challenged the registration, as he believed it would falsely imply a connection with him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=226%20U.S.P.Q.%20%28BNA%29%20428\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is difficult for the Court to understand what relevance this decision has to a case where there is no dispute as to whom Marilyn Monroe's name refers, and the Estate is not attempting to trademark the claim in the face of a challenge from Ms. Monroe. Throughout their extensive briefing, the AVELA Parties offer no clear evidence to suggest that there are any issues with the trademarks that would warrant their cancelation. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Estate holds a valid trademark in the Marilyn Monroe name and signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Genuine Disputes of Material Fact Remain as to Consumer Confusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   While the Estate has established that it owns the rights to Ms. Monroe's signature and holds a wordmark in the name \"Marilyn Monroe,\" the issue of consumer confusion forecloses the Estate Parties' application for summary judgment for largely the same reasons the Court discussed in its analysis of \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act. The AVELA Parties' use of the name \"Marilyn\" may cause confusion as to whether it is endorsed by Ms. Monroe or her estate, but the evidence presented does not foreclose\n   the possibility that a reasonable juror could find differently. The Estate Parties insist that the use of Marilyn Monroe's first name \"in a signature-style font does not evoke a random artist - it clearly evokes the signature of Marilyn Monroe in a way that suggests endorsement.\" (Estate Reply 12). However, the AVELA Parties suggest that the name is merely intended to describe the actress depicted. (AVELA Opp. 21). Neither interpretation of the usage is so obviously unreasonable as to indicate a lack of genuine dispute as to material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   While the Estate has demonstrated that AVELA's use of the word \"Marilyn\" in a signature style font is suggestive of the Estate's protected marks, the Second Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Pirone\n   </em>\n   decision makes clear the difficulty of establishing consumer confusion with regards to trademarks in celebrities' names. As the AVELA Parties point out,\n   <em>\n    Pirone\n   </em>\n   recognized that the use of a deceased celebrity's name, even where trademarked, does not necessarily indicate trademark infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pirone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534364\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/894/579/#p584\">\n    894 F.2d at 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Whatever rights Pirone may have in the mark 'Babe Ruth,' MacMillan's use of Ruth's name ... can infringe those rights only if that use was a 'trademark use,' that is, one indicating source or origin.\").

This argument is undercut by the signature style font, which does not aid in description, but\n   <em>\n    Pirone\n   </em>\n   provides further support for AVELA's argument by holding that even if a plaintiff could establish trademark use, this alone would not prove consumer confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pirone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534364\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/894/579/#p584\">\n    894 F.2d at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[E]ven if Pirone could demonstrate that the photographs indicated origin or made a representation of sponsorship, its trademark claims would founder on the critical issue under the Lanham Act: likelihood of confusion.\").

(Estate Br. 23). Given the discussion above, the Court has already concluded that consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factors does not entitle either party to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Estate Parties attempt to differentiate this claim by pointing to\n   <em>\n    Savin Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Savin Group\n   </em>\n   , which held that \"an identity of marks creates a presumption of actual dilution.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140553\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/439/#p456\">\n    391 F.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 453 (2d Cir. 2004). However, demonstrating the identity of marks requires more than a substantial similarity: \"It cannot be overstated, however, that for the presumption of dilution to apply, the marks must be identical.

The parties' briefings on these points cover largely the same ground as other aspects of the case. The AVELA Parties return to the point that the marks held by the Estate do not hold a meaning beyond identifying Marilyn Monroe as the person depicted, and they suggest that there is no evidence that the AVELA products are of inferior quality. (VIFA Br. 23-24). The Estate Parties point to their federally registered marks and state that they have received complaints regarding shirts depicting Ms. Monroe with tattoos. (Estate Opp. 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As the Court has observed throughout, the parties' intellectual property claims are fact-intensive, and neither party has demonstrated the absence of a genuine dispute of fact. The AVELA Parties are entitled to present evidence that consumers will not find their products inferior or that the marks themselves are not famous. The Estate Parties are entitled to present evidence that customers expect the products to carry the Estate's endorsement and that the products produced by AVELA risk damaging the Estate's brand by tarnishing the Monroe persona in which they hold ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    7.

(Estate Br. 27-28). The Estate Parties offer a number of factors that, they claim, reflect IPL's status as AVELA's alter ego, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   \u2022 IPL and AVELA share a director, officer, and shareholder in Mr. Valencia.

(AVELA Opp. 27-28). Such a defense, however, overlooks the fact that the most relevant factor in the\n   <em>\n    NetJets\n   </em>\n   inquiry is whether the entity simply functioned as a facade for the dominant shareholder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NetJets\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129333\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/168/#p176\">\n    537 F.3d at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Stated generally, the inquiry initially focuses on whether 'those in control of a corporation' did not 'treat[ ] the corporation as a distinct entity.' \"). From the facts presented, it is quite clear that Mr. Valencia and his business partners treated IPL and AVELA as a single unit. AVELA has offered no suggestion that IPL has any independent existence outside its role receiving payments for Valencia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The Estate Parties allege that the injustice occasioned by the involvement of IPL is the deliberate hiding of money to escape court judgments. The Estate Parties point out that Mr. Valencia attempted to hide the existence of IPL, which was only discovered through third-party subpoenas. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6 147). Furthermore, Mr. Valencia denied any knowledge of IPL or connection to it in sworn deposition testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 176). The AVELA Parties suggest that these arguments are merely variations on the theme of the Estate Parties' underlying claims. (AVELA Opp. 28). The Court disagrees. The Estate Parties have clearly demonstrated that AVELA and Mr. Valencia have attempted to hide the existence of IPL, despite using it to receive money from their licensees. These unrebutted facts demonstrate that IPL exists as a mechanism to evade judicial process.

(Estate 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 238-39). The Estate Parties claim that VIFA has offered no factual support for its contention that an economic relationship between VIFA and Duke ever existed; that VIFA has demonstrated no injury; and that VIFA has presented no evidence that any actions taken by the Estate Parties were taken for the sole purpose of inflicting harm on VIFA. (Estate Br. 30-31). The AVELA Parties state that factual disputes exist, because VIFA's sole officer, Liza Acuna (Estate 56.1 \u00b6 129), stated that the Estate Parties \"intimidated and threatened\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Duke to prevent it from doing business with VIFA (AVELA Opp. 29). Having examined the deposition of Ms. Acuna, the Court notes that the \"intimidation\" and \"threats\" identified by Ms. Acuna consisted of the Estate Parties' refusal to do business with Duke if it did business with AVELA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 338-26 (Deposition of Liza Acuna of August 10, 2017) at 140:17-21 (\"[I]f your livelihood is only Elvis Presley [licensing] and that person says if you go in business with this person I'm going to stop your Elvis Presley license or you're not going to be able to renew it, that's a threat.\") ). Ms. Acuna also acknowledges that she was uncertain whether the Estate Parties ever suggested they would sue Duke for contracting with AVELA. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6 240).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The Court does not consider the Estate Parties' \"pressure\" on prospective licensees not to do business with AVELA to be the sort of wrongful conduct that could satisfy the requirement for an intentional interference claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carvel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456434\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/182/#p189\">\n    3 N.Y.3d at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456434\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/182/#p189\">\n    785 N.Y.S.2d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456434\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/182/#p189\">\n    818 N.E.2d 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Most ...

And there is no evidence that the Estate Parties took any action with the intent to harm VIFA, since the Estate Parties took this action to protect their purported rights to the Marilyn Monroe Intellectual Property. In short, the Court finds no genuine issue of material fact remain regarding VIFA's claim for intentional interference and grants summary judgment to the Estate Parties on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    10.

As a result, [the Estate's] claims for tortious interference with existing contractual relationships and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage also fail as a matter of law[.]\" (VIFA Br. 24). The fact remains that the Estate Parties' claim is grounded in arguments that this Court has concluded require factual determinations. There are genuine disputes of material fact, among other things, with respect to the Estate's claims regarding interference with its potential relationship with Spencer's.

(AVELA 56.1 \u00b6 77). As the Estate points out, the cease and desist letter contains no mention of AVELA, and no indication that the Estate was aware of AVELA's role as a supplier to Dave Grossman Creations. (Estate Opp. 30-31). If anything, this cease and desist letter suggests that AVELA should have become aware of the Estate or its predecessors in 2006, rather than the reverse.

(AVELA Br. 22-23). The Estate Parties respond that the\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   test is not designed to protect commercial products and, further, that any First Amendment concerns are already addressed by the consumer confusion test applicable to commercial products. (Estate Opp. 33-34). The Court agrees with the Estate Parties and notes that the AVELA Parties' arguments elsewhere suggest that their products are commercial goods that make use of Ms. Monroe to draw customer attention. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AVELA Opp. 31 (\"If a customer walks into a store and asks for a 'Marilyn Monroe t-shirt,' it is likely they want a t-shirt with a picture of Monroe on it.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Furthermore, even if AVELA's artwork had some artistic value, it is not clear that such value could save it from an infringement claim. The Estate Parties argue that AVELA tricks licensees into a belief that its products are officially endorsed by the individuals holding the rights to the Monroe persona. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6 242 (\"Patricia Timsawat [an AVELA licensee] testified that she did not know there was a difference between AVELA and the Estate.\") ). Even in\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit made plain that \"[p]oetic license is not without limits. The purchaser of a book, like the purchaser of a can of peas, has a right not to be misled as to the source of the product.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535529\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/994/#p998\">\n    875 F.2d at 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The crux of this dispute is the Estate Parties' claim that AVELA tricks consumers into believing AVELA's products are genuine, and AVELA's response that it is merely providing shirts that depict a famous celebrity and that no customer would think conveys her endorsement. The Court has already ruled that a trial on this question is necessary; the First Amendment, despite all its power, does not resolve this question. The Court denies summary judgment for the AVELA Parties on this affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    14.

(AVELA Br. 23-25). The remainder of the AVELA Parties' fair use discussion seems to cover the same ground as previous arguments, such as an argument that use of depictions of Ms. Monroe should be considered functional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court can dispense with these fair use arguments quickly, as the AVELA Parties have used the likeness of Monroe to\n   <em>\n    sell\n   </em>\n   their shirts, not to describe them. The image of Marilyn Monroe does not describe a t-shirt; rather, the product being sold is a \"Marilyn Monroe t-shirt.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bruce Lee II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20822173\">\n    2013 WL 822173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *22.

The Court denies in full AVELA's motion for summary judgment.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   The AVELA Parties' motion to exclude the Poret Report does not suggest\n   that Mr. Poret is unqualified, nor does it suggest that his general methodology was unsound. (AVELA Expert Br. 4-25). Indeed, the AVELA Parties' rebuttal expert report relied on the same methodology in his survey. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Estate Expert Opp. 2 (the Motion [does not] challenge Mr. Poret's fundamental use of the\n   <em>\n    Eveready\n   </em>\n   survey format.... \"Indeed, the AVELA Parties' own expert, Howard Marylander, adopted the\n   <em>\n    Eveready\n   </em>\n   methodology in designing his study[.]\") ). Instead, the AVELA Parties attack the specific questions asked, the items used, the sample sizes, and the manner in which various respondents were categorized. Ordinarily, these objections would be understood to attack the weight of the expert report rather than its admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schering Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pfizer Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1733499\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/189/218/#p228\">\n    189 F.3d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding that \"errors in methodology ... properly go only to the weight of the evidence\"). Here, however, the AVELA Parties argue that this is the rare case where errors in methodology make the Report more prejudicial than probative and therefore inadmissible under Rule 403.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Starter Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Converse, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585792\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/286/#p296\">\n    170 F.3d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 296-97 (2d Cir. 1999) (finding survey evidence inadmissible on Rule 403 grounds). The Court does not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   The AVELA Parties' arguments for exclusion focus on disputes that are better addressed through cross-examination. And at least one of the AVELA Parties' arguments is flatly incorrect: The AVELA Parties state that the \"[s]urvey here fail[ed] to instruct respondents against guessing.\" (AVELA Expert Br. 11). And yet the Poret Report's survey contained the explicit instruction, \"Please do not guess.\" (Poret Report 7). What is more, a great deal of the AVELA Parties' briefing argues that the Estate's survey is irrelevant, because respondents did not identify the Estate by name, but rather made statements suggesting Ms. Monroe or people around her endorsed the shirts. (AVELA Expert Br. 18-21). Similar criticism was offered by AVELA in a case involving products that allegedly infringed on the rights of the estate of Bob Marley. Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit rejected the argument that a survey needed to screen explicitly for recognition of the entity claiming the rights to be probative.\n   <em>\n    Fifty-Six Hope Rd. Music, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    A.V.E.L.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5745545\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/1059/#p1070\">\n    778 F.3d 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1070 (9th Cir. 2015) (\"[I]dentifying Marley or whoever holds the rights to his persona in the alternative does not render the survey data useless or irrelevant.\"). This Court agrees with that reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The AVELA Parties further argue that the survey is flawed because the shirt in Mr. Poret's survey did not include the Radio Days hangtag. (AVELA Expert Br. 5-6). The Estate counters that Mr. Poret used an AVELA shirt that was purchased at a Spencer's store. (Estate 56.1 \u00b6 254.d). As with many of the disputes related to dueling expert reports, the question of hangtags is an appropriate subject for the jury, and it provides scant support for an argument that the Poret Report must be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   The parties also clash on the appropriate control group, the sample size, and the mechanism for categorizing responses, but the Court does not believe it is necessary to examine each of these disputes in detail when the Second Circuit has admonished courts that these disputes go to weight rather than admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friesland Brands, B.V.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vietnam Nat'l Milk Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11409960\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/221/457/#p459\">\n    221 F.Supp.2d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (\"The Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Schering\n   </em>\n   made clear that ... a survey's errors in methodology ... properly go only to the weight of the evidence - not to its admissibility.\" (internal quotations omitted) ). The AVELA Parties can vigorously cross-examine Mr. Poret about his purportedly small sample sizes, his choice of control\n   groups, and his manner of categorizing consumer confusion, but the Court will not prevent the jury from hearing his testimony. The AVELA Parties' motion to exclude is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Estate Parties' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
