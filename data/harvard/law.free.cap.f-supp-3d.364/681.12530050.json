Having considered the parties' briefs, the record, and relevant law, the Court finds that it lacks personal jurisdiction over each Defendant. Accordingly, the Court will grant the Defendants' motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Defense Distributed is a Texas corporation whose mission is to \"defend[ ] the American civil liberty of popular access to arms,\" a mission it furthers by \"publishing information regarding the production of arms to the general public.\" (Am. Compl., Dkt. 23 \u00b6 10). Part of what Defense Distributed has published includes \"computer-aided design (CAD) data files that can be used to manufacture a virtually undetectable, untraceable gun with a 3D printer.\" (Feuer Mot., Dkt. 50, at 3). Defense Distributed's primary method of distributing these files is by hosting them on its website, DEFCAD, for visitors to download. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 23 \u00b6 11; Heindorff Decl., Dkt. 65-26 \u00b6 8). Plaintiff Second Amendment Foundation, Inc. (\"Second Amendment Foundation\") is a non-profit organization whose members seek to obtain the information published by Defense Distributed. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 23 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defense Distributed began publishing CAD files related to the 3D printing of firearms in December 2012. (Wilson Decl., Dkt. 65-23 \u00b6 3; Heindorff Decl., Dkt. 65-26 \u00b6 8). In May 2013, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (\"DDTC\"), part of the U.S. State Department, sent a letter to Defense Distributed instructing them to remove certain CAD files from the DEFCAD website. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Dept. Letter, Heindorff Decl., Dkt. 65-26, at 19-21). The letter stated that Defense Distributed was required to seek prior authorization before publishing these files because they may have contained information subject to the Arms Export Control Act (\"AECA\") and the AECA's implementing regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\"ITAR\"). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). Defense Distributed complied with the DDTC's instructions and sought authorization to publish the specified CAD files. (Req. Jud. Not., Dkt. 77, at 7). The DDTC failed to timely rule on Defense Distributed's request, and the matter of\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed, et al., v. U.S. Dept. of State, et al.\n   </em>\n   , 1:15-CV-372-RP (W.D. Tex) (\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   ) followed. In that case, Plaintiffs challenged the ITAR provisions regulating the publication of the CAD files (hereafter, the \"\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   files\") on the Internet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ultimately, the parties settled. The parties' Settlement Agreement provided that the State Department would issue a license permitting the plaintiffs to publish\n   the\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   files on the Internet. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, Heindorff Decl., Dkt. 65-26, at 23-25). This license issued on July 27, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). Three days later, this Court dismissed the\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   action pursuant to the parties' stipulated dismissal with prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Req. Jud. Not., Dkt. 77, at 40). That same day, however, nine Attorneys General from eight States and the District of Columbia filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to enjoin the State Department from performing the terms of the Settlement Agreement (the \"Washington Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am. Compl., Dkt. 23 \u00b6\u00b6 59-60). The Washington Court issued a temporary restraining order on July 31, and a nationwide preliminary injunction on August 27, enjoining the State Department from modifying the ITAR regulations to allow Defense Distributed to publish the\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   files. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-63). The preliminary injunction remains in effect, the Washington Action is currently pending, and Defense Distributed has ceased publishing CAD files on the Internet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The instant action concerns several civil and criminal enforcement actions taken by the Defendant state officials in the wake of the\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement. These actions include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) sending cease-and-desist letters threatening legal action if Defense Distributed does not cease publishing the\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   files;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) sending letters to third-party companies that provide internet security services to Defense Distributed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (3) initiating civil lawsuits against Defense Distributed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (4) threatening to enforce a criminal law against Defense Distributed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (5) issuing press releases regarding commitments and efforts to prevent Defense Distributed from publishing the\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   files;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (6) placing a telephone call with Defense Distributed to demand that Defense Distributed stop publishing the\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   files; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (7) filing a letter with this Court in support of a motion to intervene in\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-115; Mot. Prelim. Inj., Dkt. 67, at 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that these actions are part of a \"coordinated and politically-fueled campaign to censor Defense Distributed.\" (Am. Compl., Dkt. 23 \u00b6 5). As explained below, the Court finds that none of the above actions establish minimum contacts between any of the Defendants and Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD AND DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Each Defendant to this action challenges this Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over him. \"Requiring a court to have personal jurisdiction over a party [is] a matter of constitutional due process\" designed to \"protect[ ] an individual's liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgment of a forum with which he has established no meaningful contacts, ties, or relations.\"\n   <em>\n    First Inv. Corp. v. Fujian Mawei Shipbuilding, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3649581\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/742/#p749\">\n    703 F.3d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 749 (5th Cir. 2012) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), the party invoking the power of the court (here, Plaintiffs) bears the burden of making a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that personal jurisdiction is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Monkton Ins. Servs. v.

To make this showing, \"the plaintiff must show that the nonresident defendant purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of the forum state by establishing 'minimum contacts' with the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265268\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/429/#p431\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted) (cleaned up). \"Sufficient minimum contacts will give rise to either specific or general jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265268\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/429/#p431\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). All Defendants argue, and Plaintiffs do not dispute, that this Court does not have general jurisdiction over them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs must show that the exercise of specific jurisdiction over each Defendant is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to specific jurisdiction, the Fifth Circuit applies a three-step analysis: \"(1) whether the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether it purposely directed its activities toward the forum state or purposefully availed itself of the privileges of conducting activities there; (2) whether the plaintiff's cause of action arises out of or results from the defendant's forum-related contacts; and (3) whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is fair and reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Monkton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265268\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/429/#p431\">\n    768 F.3d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing the first two prongs; only if they are successful in doing so does the burden shift to the Defendants to establish the third prong.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Threshold Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs raise two threshold issues pertinent to the Court's minimum contacts analysis. The Court addresses each in turn before turning to the merits of the parties' personal jurisdiction dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    1. Judicial Estoppel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendants Cuomo, Grewal, Denn, Wolf, and Shapiro are judicially estopped from challenging personal jurisdiction in Texas because of the position they took in the Washington Action. The judicial estoppel doctrine \"prevents a party from asserting a claim in a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with a claim taken by that party in a previous proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire v. Maine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p742\">\n    532 U.S. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 742-43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p742\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p742\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). Plaintiffs assert that these Defendants argued in the Washington Action that (1) \"there is nothing wrong with litigating this kind of controversy away from\" the Defendants' respective states of citizenship, and (2) that \" 'minimum contacts' exist as to Defense Distributed in Washington.\" (Pls. Resp. Cuomo, Grewal &amp; Denn Mot., Dkt. 73, at 9; Pls. Resp. Wolf &amp; Shapiro Mot., Dkt. 86, at 3). But here, Defendants Cuomo, Grewal, and Denn argue that minimum contacts \"for this controversy\" exist only in New York, New Jersey, and Delaware; and Defendants Wolf and Shapiro argue that minimum contacts exist only in Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs claim that these positions are contradictory to the Defendants' positions in the Washington Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs, however, incorrectly focus on \"this controversy\" rather than on the\n   <em>\n    defendants\n   </em>\n   to the controversy. It is foundational that the minimum contacts inquiry focuses not on \"the kind of controversy\" before the court, but on the defendant's contacts with the forum state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    326 U.S. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    66 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    90 L.Ed. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1945) ;\n   <em>\n    Walden v. Fiore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701990\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/277/\">\n    571 U.S. 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The Defendants' argument, in a different case, that Defense Distributed had minimum contacts with Washington, is in no way inconsistent with their argument here that they themselves have no minimum contacts with Texas. Because these positions are not contradictory, Plaintiffs have failed to make a colorable claim for judicial estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    2. Nationwide Contacts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs raise a second threshold matter-that the Court's minimum contacts analysis must look to Defendants' contacts with the nation as a whole, not just Texas. (Pls. Resp. Cuomo, Grewal &amp; Denn Mot., Dkt, 73, at 11 n.6; Pls. Resp. Wolf &amp; Shapiro Mot., Dkt. 86, at 9-11). Plaintiffs point to the Supreme Court's observation in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California, San Francisco County\n   </em>\n   that \"constitutional 'restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court' are not the same as 'the due process limits on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a State.' \" (Pls. Resp. Wolf &amp; Shapiro Mot., Dkt. 86, at 10) (emphasis removed) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v.

As applied to this case, Plaintiffs argue that \"[m]ost or all of the defendants' motions implicate this issue by directly invoking federal due process guarantees,\" and, \"[t]o the extent that this is the case, they should fail because 'minimum contacts' with the Nation as a whole suffice to meet the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause concerns.\" (Pls. Resp. Cuomo, Grewal &amp; Denn Mot., Dkt, 73, at 11 n.6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls. Resp. Wolf &amp; Shapiro Mot., Dkt. 86, at 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs have not shown that the national minimum contacts rule applies in this case.

Jurisdictional Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that if the Court finds it lacks personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, then jurisdictional discovery is warranted to assess the relationship between the Defendants and the three gun control advocacy groups discussed above. (Pls. Resp. Grewal &amp; Denn Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 73, at 14). Plaintiffs' theory is that \"one or more of the defendants\" directed these groups to intervene in\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   , and that the groups' contacts with Texas established in that case can be attributed to the defendants \"for jurisdictional purposes\" in this one. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs' theory is based on Defendant Grewal acknowledging \"some kind of cooperation\" with these groups in a public speech, and the fact that \"representatives from each gun control group have ... tout[ed] their relationship[s] with lawmakers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 n.8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"The district court ... has broad discretion in all discovery matters.\"\n   <em>\n    Wyatt v.

In particular, the district court's discretion to permit jurisdictional discovery on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction \"will not be disturbed ordinarily unless there are unusual circumstances showing a clear abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1457481\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/686/276/#p283\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, \"[w]hen the lack of personal jurisdiction is clear, discovery would serve no purpose and should not be permitted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1457481\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/686/276/#p283\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to base personal jurisdiction on any relationship between Defendants and the three gun control advocacy groups. Plaintiffs wish to base the Defendants' minimum contacts on actions taken by these third parties, who are not parties\n   to this action, who may or may not have any relationship with an unspecified number of the Defendants, whose supposed relationship with the Defendants is not alleged anywhere in Plaintiffs' amended complaint, and which relationship would have arisen, if at all, out of events relating to a separate legal dispute-\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   -to which Defendants were not parties. The Court finds that the lack of personal jurisdiction over Defendants is clear, and that any discovery on the matter would be futile in light of the Court's finding that this case and\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   are not sufficiently related for purposes of exercising personal jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Court will not grant Plaintiffs' request for jurisdictional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
