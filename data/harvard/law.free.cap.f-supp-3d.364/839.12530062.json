Equally at home in cities, forests and fields, they pollinate our plants and compete with us for the food we eat. At times beautiful and benign-at other times annoying, loathsome and destructive-we share with them our homes, workplaces, recreational spaces, and conveyances-in short, our world. By and large, our relationship with our six-legged co-habitants is unwittingly (at least for most of us) symbiotic; however, there are times when humans and insects compete directly. And, at such times, we are reminded that the age-old curse-\"plague of locusts\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -is not just apocryphal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Plaintiffs herein-the Wanamakers-experienced such a \"plague\" first hand when hungry insects devoured the plants in their nursery in 2009. This disaster prompted them to file claims against their insurer, FMH Risk Protection, Inc. (\"FMH\"), under seven different insurance policies. FMH initially denied payment under all of seven policies. The parties then submitted the claims to arbitration, where the arbitrator, through a conditional award, required the Wanamakers to submit\n   additional documentation to FMH. Following receipt of such documentation, the arbitrator directed FMH to re-open its claims process and reconsider the Wanamakers' claims in light of the new documents. FMH determined that the Wanamakers were entitled to recover under one of the seven policies, so FMH paid that claim. The arbitrator then made his final award, finding that FMH paid all amounts properly owed under the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following the arbitrator's final decision, the Wanamakers filed suit, seeking judicial review of the decision [Doc. 1]. In response, FMH filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the Court must uphold the arbitrator's final award under the Federal Arbitration Act [Doc. 19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Wanamakers operate several ornamental plant nurseries in Warren County and Grundy County, Tennessee. To protect their crops, they purchased several crop-insurance policies from FMH, identified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-14\"><strong>Policy No.</strong> <strong>Insured</strong> <strong>Location</strong> 48111-09 Wanamaker Nursery, Inc. Grundy County 48124-09 Timothy Wanamaker Warren County 48125-09 Timothy Wanamaker Grundy County 48128-09 Andrea Wanamaker Grundy County 48129-09 Andrea Wanamaker Warren County 48130-09 Ashley Wanamaker Warren County 48133-09 Wanamaker Nursery, Inc. Warren County</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Federal Crop Insurance Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201501\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and corresponding regulations under Title VII, Chapter IV of the Code of Federal Regulations, govern the insurance policies in this case. Such policies are written on standardized contracts promulgated and regulated by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (\"FCIC\"), a wholly owned government corporation managed by the Risk Management Agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2009, the Wanamakers submitted claims to their insurer, FMH, under the above-referenced policies for losses occasioned by insect infestation. When FMH received those claims, FMH was obligated-under the insurance policies and applicable regulations-to verify that the total inventory value for each category of nursery plants was within 110% of either the actual inventory value of those plants at the time insurance attached or the highest dollar amount of sales of that category of plants over the previous three years. FMH found that the Wanamakers' policies failed to meet either of those threshold requirements, so it denied all of their claims. Each insurance policy contained an arbitration clause. The Wanamakers initiated arbitration to contest FMH's determination that it would not indemnify them for their losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The arbitrator conducted a hearing and issued a conditional award [Doc. 19-5] instructing the Wanamakers to provide FMH with additional documents and directing FMH to re-evaluate the claims after receipt such documentation. After the Wanamakers provided the requisite documents, FMH determined that one of the insurance policies-Policy 48125-09-met the 110% threshold requirement, resulting in a payout to the Wanamakers of $ 133,650. FMH determined that the remaining six policies still did not meet the threshold requirements under the insurance policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The arbitrator then issued his final award [Doc. 19-6] concluding that FMH \"has paid all claim amounts that are proper\n   and no additional indemnity related to the 2009 claim on any policy is owed to the [Wanamakers]. The [Wanamakers'] claims asserted herein ... are hereby denied in their entirety, and dismissed with prejudice.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID #: 105].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Wanamakers then filed suit\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to contest the arbitrator's findings [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1]. They point to Section 20(c) of their insurance policies' Basic Provisions, which states that: \"Any decision rendered in arbitration is binding on you and us unless judicial review is sought ....\" [Doc. 19-2 at PageID #: 78]. Based on that provision, the Wanamakers' claim that Section 20(c) grants the court authority to perform a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the arbitrator's decision. The Wanamakers also brought a bad-faith claim against FMH under Tennessee law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   FMH responded with a summary judgment motion [Doc. 19] asserting that the Court's review is limited under the Federal Arbitration Act; collateral estoppel precludes the Wanamakers' claims; and federal law preempts their bad-faith claim. The Wanamakers countered that they are entitled to\n   <em>\n    vacatur\n   </em>\n   even if the Federal Arbitration Act applies and their bad-faith claim is legally viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Congress enacted the FAA to create a federal policy favoring arbitration\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to \"reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements ....\"\n   <em>\n    Gilmer v.

For the FAA to apply, an arbitration agreement must meet the following two conditions: (1) it must be in writing; and (2) it must be part of \"a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The FAA's first condition is clearly met.

Specifically, section 20(c) of the Basic Provisions states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Any decision rendered in arbitration is binding on you and us unless judicial review is sought ....

This argument ignores the fact that the contractual language relied upon by the Wanamakers does not prescribe a standard of review to be applied by the Court. It simply states that the arbitrator's decision is subject to judicial review.

These arguments will be addressed in the order presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Obligation to Produce Additional Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Following his initial determination, the arbitrator required the Wanamakers to produce additional documents to FMH. Support for this requirement is found in section 6(c)(2) of the Nursery Crop Provisions which states: \"At our option, you will be required to provide documentation in support of your [claim].\" [Doc. 19-3]. And, section 6(c)(2) which states: \"failure to provide documentation when requested or providing inadequate documentation will result in denial of insurance for the crop year for any basic units for which such documentation was not provided.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Under the insurance policies governing the parties' respective obligations, the Wanamakers were obligated to provide sufficient documentation to support any insurance claim. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ]. The Court cannot find that the arbitrator engaged in misconduct or exceeded his powers by directing the Wanamakers to fulfill an obligation required by the very contract upon which their claims are based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Expiration of the Insurance Policies' Document Retention Period\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Wanamakers next contend that the arbitrator engaged in misconduct\n   or exceeded his powers by requiring them to produce documents beyond the expiration of their insurance policies' three-year document-retention period. This argument rests upon section 21 of the insurance policies' Basic Provisions which requires the insured to keep \"[c]omplete records ... of the insured crop on each unit for three years after the end of the crop year ....\" [Doc. 19-2]. The Wanamakers fail to note, however, that the Preamble to the Basic Provisions provides: \"[i]f a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of priority is: (1) the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement, as applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) the Crop Provisions; and (4) these Basic Provisions ....\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. And, under section 6(c)(2) of the Crop Provisions (which take precedence over the Basic Provisions), the Wanamakers were required to keep records for the three years prior to their 2009 claim (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 19-3: \"At our option, you will be required to provide documentation ... for the three previous crop years in the amount of detail we require ....\"). Given that the Crop Provisions control, the Wanamakers were required to keep supporting documents for their claim for the three years preceding 2009. The arbitrator did not engage in misconduct or exceed his powers in making that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Waiver of Insurance Policies' Threshold Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the Wanamakers contend that the arbitrator erred in allowing FMH to deny claims based on the Wanamakers' inability to verify that the total inventory value for each category of nursery plants was within 110% of either the actual inventory value of those plants at the time insurance attached or the highest dollar amount of sales of that category of plants over the previous three years. The Wanamakers assert that, under the Nursery Crop Underwriting Guide Section 13(B)(2) and 14(C)(1)[Doc. 26-4], FMH waived the enforcement of this 110% threshold requirement by issuing them insurance policies following their pre-acceptance inspection. And, according to the Wanamakers, the arbitrator erred by ignoring this so-called requirement. Even if true, the Wanamakers' waiver argument amounts to a factual error on the part of the arbitrator, which is not a basis to overturn the decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solvay Pharm., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063978\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/471/#p476\">\n    442 F.3d at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Courts must refrain from reversing an arbitrator simply because the court disagrees with the result or believes the arbitrator made a serious legal or factual error.\") (brackets, citation, and emphasis omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

The Wanamakers may well believe that the arbitrator's actions prejudiced them. Indeed, he did not rule in their favor. But, the arbitrator's actions appear to be entirely consistent with the FCIA policy requirements and certainly do not suggest any misconduct on his part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For the same reasons, the Court rejects the Wanamakers' contentions under \u00a7 10(a)(4) of the FAA because \"[t]he burden of proving that the arbitrator[ ] exceeded their authority is very great.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063978\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/471/#p476\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The terms of the contract define the powers of the arbitrator, and 'as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the\n   scope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed a serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063978\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/471/#p476\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United Paperworkers Int'l Union v.

Though not mentioned by the parties in this case, some circuits-including our own-recognize \"manifest disregard of the law\" as a further ground for vacatur of an arbitration award; however, the Supreme Court cautioned against treating this \"supposed addition ... as the camel's nose\" for further expansion. Since that time, the Sixth Circuit has, through\n    <em>\n     dicta\n    </em>\n    , stated that \"[w]hether 'manifest disregard of the law' may still supply a basis for vacating an arbitrator's award as 'a judicially created supplement to the enumerated forms of FAA relief ... is an open question.' \"\n    <em>\n     Samaan v.
