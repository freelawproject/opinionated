BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a dispute arising from a contract to provide healthcare services. Plaintiffs Mohamed Shalaby, M.D. and Mohamed Shalaby, M.D.P.A. (collectively, \"Shalaby\") allegedly operated Plaintiff Clear Lake Cardiovascular Care, P.A. (\"CLCC\") as a cardiology practice with Defendant Ahmed Ahmed, M.D. (\"Ahmed\"). Shalaby and CLCC (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") allege CLCC had a contract (the \"CLCC Contract\") with Defendants Universal American Corporation (\"Universal\") and Universal's wholly-owned subsidiary Heritage Physician Network (\"Heritage\") (collectively, the \"Universal Defendants\"). Under the CLCC Contract, Plaintiffs allege Shalaby and Ahmed were to provide healthcare services to patients within the Universal Defendants' network. On May 1, 2017, Plaintiffs allege Ahmed unilaterally effected termination of the CLCC Contract without Plaintiffs' authorization. By August 2017, Plaintiffs allege Ahmed, in a conspiracy with the Universal Defendants, began providing healthcare services to Shalaby's former patients. Plaintiffs further allege the Universal Defendants failed to pay Plaintiffs for all healthcare services provided under the CLCC Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the foregoing, on April 4, 2018, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against Ahmed and the Universal Defendants in the 157th District Court of Harris County, Texas. Plaintiffs bring claims for breach of contract, tortious interference with contract, breach of fiduciary duty,\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   conduct, and conspiracy. On May 9, 2018, the Universal Defendants removed the case to this Court under the federal officer statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). On June 8, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    II. LAW &amp; ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs contend the Court should remand the case to state court and should further award Plaintiffs attorney fees and costs.
