He worked for the City as a parking enforcement officer from February 2012 until the City terminated his employment in August 2014. While working for the City, Mr. Jackson was called to active duty in Afghanistan. When he returned from his military service, Mr. Jackson suffered from PTSD. Mr. Jackson's PTSD made it difficult for him to report to work on time or to complete full shifts. Mr. Jackson asked the City to modify his work schedule to give his doctor time to regulate his PTSD medication. The City did not grant Mr. Jackson's request for an accommodation, and the City terminated Mr. Jackson's employment for violating the City's attendance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Jackson contends that the City violated the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act or USERRA by classifying him as a probationary employee when he returned from his deployment, subjecting him to discipline, and ultimately terminating his employment. Mr. Jackson also contends that the City violated the Americans with Disabilities Act or ADA by failing to accommodate his PTSD and by terminating his employment because of his disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the City has asked the Court to enter judgment in its favor on the following issues: (1) whether the City violated USERRA by requiring Mr. Jackson to complete a probationary training period when he returned from military leave, and (2) whether Mr. Jackson is a qualified individual under the ADA. For the reasons explained below, the\n   Court finds that material questions of fact exist, and the City is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on these issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 17, 2012, the City hired Mr. Jackson as a parking enforcement officer. (Doc. 20-1, p. 18). A parking enforcement officer issues parking citations to motor vehicle operators who violate the City's parking ordinances. (Doc. 23-3, p. 1). According to the job description for the parking enforcement officer position, a parking enforcement officer performs the following essential functions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Patrols assigned area either by foot or vehicle; issues parking citations; informs violators of relevant parking laws and regulations. Assists the public by giving directions and informing them of available parking facilities; may assist the public in locating vehicles. Operates and programs hand held computer units and printers used to issue citations. Performs routine preventative maintenance on three-wheel vehicles. Assists the flow of traffic by asking drivers who are double parked, parked in loading zones, handicapped spaces or no parking zones to move to designated areas. Reports all damaged parking meters, street markers and signs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. 23-3). One parking enforcement officer monitors each of the City's parking zones. (Doc. 20-1, p. 20, tp. 78). The regular work schedule for parking enforcement officers is Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. (Doc. 20-1, p. 23; Doc. 21-1, p. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parking enforcement officer position is a classified position. (Doc. 22-1, p. 16). Pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Supplemental Personnel Policies and Procedures for the City of Birmingham, \"[c]lassified employees shall serve a probationary period of twelve months.\" (Doc. 20-9, p. 6). According to City policy, \"[c]lassified employees accrue sick leave or vacation leave during their probationary period however they may not use sick leave or vacation leave during their probationary period,\" unless their probationary period relates to a promotion. (Doc. 20-9, p. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Jackson's direct supervisor was Parking Enforcement Officer Supervisor Jose Martinez. Mr. Martinez reported to Chief of Traffic Operations Will Goodman. Mr. Goodman reported to Traffic Engineer Greg Dawkins. (Doc. 20-1, p. 18, p. 69; Doc. 21-1, pp. 4-5; Doc. 22-1, p. 7; Doc. 23-1, pp. 5, 8-9; Doc. 23-2, p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During Mr. Jackson's first week of employment, senior parking enforcement officer Tiwana Bailey accompanied Mr. Jackson on his routes and provided him with training on how to use a hand-held set, how to operate the vehicle or buggy that parking enforcement officers drive, and how to write tickets. (Doc. 20-1, p. 20; Doc. 23-24, p. 5; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 2). During the second and third weeks of his employment, Mr. Jackson worked by himself in the field without supervision. (Doc. 20-1, pp. 22-23; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Jackson did not receive direct training on parking ordinances. Instead, his supervisors gave him the book containing the ordinances and told him to read the ordinances. (Doc. 20-1, p. 20). On February 6, 2012, Mr. Jackson attended an orientation class on the City's general employment policies. (Doc. 20-1, p. 19; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 7, 2012, less than one month after the City hired him, Mr. Jackson received a letter from the Alabama Army National Guard to provide to the City. The letter stated that later that month, Mr. Jackson would be deployed to Afghanistan for one year. (Doc. 20-14). Mr. Jackson worked until February 9, 2012, and he reported to active duty on February 13, 2012. (Doc. 20-12; Doc. 20-13). Mr. Jackson completed less than one month of his 12-month probationary training period before he left for active military service. (Doc. 20-1, p. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 14, 2012, while Mr. Jackson was on military leave, the City's Office of Personnel sent him a letter concerning his pay and benefits. (Doc. 20-19). The letter states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   As you may know under the City of Birmingham's\n   <em>\n    Military Leave Resolution 392-08\n   </em>\n   (MLR 392-08) we will continue your pay and benefits while deployed to a \"War Zone\", or DOD specified area of Hostile Fire (HF) or Imminent Danger (ID). Your entitlements under this resolution are set to expire effective\n   <em>\n    February 16, 2013\n   </em>\n   . If for some reason you are maintained on active service past this date please provide this office with qualifying orders prior to the expiration of your current entitlement. In addition, if you are released from service prior to this date it is your responsibility to notify this office so that we may adjust your entitlements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   We must also inform you that the MLR 392-08 is only a resolution and subject to termination by the Mayor/City Coun[cil] at their discretion. As a reminder continuation of your pay and benefits past 30 days are not mandated under the Uniformed\n   Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Again thank you for your SERVICE! YOUR COMMITMENT KNOWS NO BOUNDS, NEITHER SHOULD OURS!\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Doc. 20-19) (emphasis in June 14, 2012 letter). The City's Military Leave Resolution 392-08 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   any permanent employee of the City of Birmingham called to duty in defense of country to be deployed in a military war zone will receive full salary as well as benefits for the entire time of their deployment. Upon which time that employee returns and is available to resume employment by the City of Birmingham, that employee's job or position will be available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Doc. 21-3, p. 1) (italics omitted). Resolution 392-08 defines \"permanent employee\" as a City of Birmingham \"employee who has completed a mandatory twelve (12) month probationary period.\" (Doc. 21-3, p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In January 2013, Mr. Jackson returned from Afghanistan. (Doc. 20-1, p. 24). The National Guard extended Mr. Jackson's military service for another year and assigned him to the Warrior Transition Battalion in Ft. Gordon, Georgia. The Warrior Transition Battalion is known as the Wounded Warrior Program. (Doc. 20-15; Doc. 20-16; Doc. 20-17; Doc. 20-18; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 3). While participating in the program, Mr. Jackson received treatment for PTSD. (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In January of 2014, the City gave Mr. Jackson a merit pay increase based on the amount of time that he had been employed with the City. (Doc. 23-1, p. 20; Doc. 23-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On February 18, 2014, Mr. Goodman emailed Mr. Dawkins, Mr. Martinez, and Assistant Traffic Engineer Sedrick Rutledge. (Doc. 23-5, p. 1). Mr. Goodman attached to the email pictures of Mr. Jackson. (Doc. 23-5, pp. 2-9). The email states: \"Thought these pics of Parking Officer Eric Jackson would be of interest. As far as I know he is still on Traffic Engineering budget receiving his normal pay. Serious abuse of taxpayer dollars. Also see his CD under (Google.....Visionary Alter Ego).\" (Doc. 23-5, p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On February 24, 2014, the Army honorably discharged Mr. Jackson from service for medical reasons. (Doc. 20-1, p. 25; Doc. 20-20). After his discharge, Mr. Jackson received a disability rating because of his PTSD diagnosis. (Sealed Doc. 27-3, p. 8; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On March 10, 2014, in an email to Mr. Goodman, the payroll coordinator for the City's traffic engineering department explained that Mr. Jackson had 90 days from the date of his discharge from the Army to report to work, so Mr. Jackson would return to work in May 2014. (Doc. 22-11). Mr. Goodman responded, \"[n]ot cool with me at all. However, someone else calls the shots on these situations. He's milking it! If he can handle all of his other affairs he should be able to come to work.\" (Doc. 22-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In a message dated March 11, 2014, Mr. Dawkins explained to Mr. Goodman that under federal law, the City must give Mr. Jackson 90 days from the end of his military service to report to work. (Doc. 23-6, p. 1). Mr. Goodman responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   I know the policy allows Mr. Jackson to report 90 days after the end of military duty. I just have a problem with this whole flagrant abuse of the system. Any one who can conduct a business, record rap videos and handle all of the other situations that he is managing has to be somewhat sound. I wish Mrs. Polk would look into this whole policy of paying personnel a full salary while they're in a\n   military status. I think we're creating a loop hole for abusers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Doc. 23-7, p. 1). Mr. Goodman continued to exchange emails with Mr. Dawkins about the rules and policies governing Mr. Jackson's return to work, and Mr. Goodman wrote that he would like to deny Mr. Jackson vacation \"because we need him back asap.\" (Doc. 22-12, p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Consistent with arrangements that he made with the City, Mr. Jackson returned to work on May 27, 2014. (Doc. 20-1, p. 27; Doc. 20-24; Doc. 20-21; Doc. 20-22; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 4). When he returned to work, Mr. Jackson did not consider himself a probationary employee because he had been employed with the City for more than two years, and based on the City's June 14, 2012 letter, he received benefits to which only permanent, non-probationary employees were entitled. (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 20-19; Doc. 21-3, p. 1). For the first week he was back on duty, a supervisor provided instructions to Mr. Jackson, but Mr. Jackson worked in the field independently. (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   When he returned to work, Mr. Jackson was able to issue citations, patrol his assigned zone, and communicate with drivers. (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 6.b-e). Although he could perform his job functions, the medication that Mr. Jackson took to treat his PTSD caused sleeplessness which, in turn, caused Mr. Jackson, once he finally fell asleep, to sleep through alarms. (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6). Mr. Jackson's sleeplessness also made him \"more easily triggered by loud noises and confrontation,\" and \"loud noises or argumentative people increased [his] stress level.\" (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6.d). The effects of Mr. Jackson's PTSD medication caused him to miss work. Between May 27, 2014 and August 6, 2014, Mr. Jackson was absent 8 times; he arrived to work late 11 times, and he left work early 7 times. (Doc. 20-1, pp. 27, 29-33, 37; Doc. 20-24; Doc. 20-27). According to Mr. Jackson, when he was absent or late, he \"always called or texted Jose Martinez or Tiwana Bailey in advance,\" and when he left work early, he \"always obtained permission from a supervisor first.\" (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   When Mr. Jackson began having attendance issues, he talked to Mr. Martinez and Mr. Goodman \"about what [the City] could do to help him out.\" (Doc. 22-1, p. 16). Mr. Jackson explained that he had PTSD, and he \"had problems with loud noises, popping sounds, [and] crowded areas.\" (Doc. 22-1, p. 16, tp. 64). Mr. Jackson also told Mr. Martinez and Mr. Goodman that \"he had problems with confrontations\" (Doc. 22-1, p. 16, tp. 64), and \"he was having a hard time dealing with the public getting in his face.\" (Doc. 21-1, p. 9, tp. 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mr. Jackson requested \"more frequent breaks\" and \"flexibility with [his] schedule to allow [him] and [his] doctor to adjust\" his PTSD medication. (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 5). Mr. Jackson testified that he needed a \"flexible\" start time because the medications that he was taking were \"constantly being switched out to see ... which one worked better,\" and \"it was always a different result after every time.\" (Doc. 20-1, p. 41). According to Mr. Jackson, had the City granted his request for an accommodation, his \"attendance would have ultimately conformed to the traditional work schedule for a Parking Enforcement Officer,\" and his \"stress would have been reduced because it would have allowed [his] doctors time to adjust [his] treatment regime[n].\" (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6\u00b6 6.a., 6.d.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In July 2014, Mr. Jackson again requested flexibility with his schedule while his doctor adjusted his medication. (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 7). Mr. Jackson asked that the City permit him to use leave for this purpose. (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 7). Mr. Martinez indicated that he would speak to Mr. Goodman about the requests for accommodation, but Mr. Jackson did not receive a response. (Doc. 20-1,\n   p. 41). The City did not evaluate whether Mr. Jackson's requests for accommodation were reasonable. (Doc. 21-1, p. 10, tp. 38; Doc. 23-1, pp. 19, 32; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On July 3, 2014, Mr. Martinez emailed Mr. Goodman to tell him that Mr. Jackson called in sick. (Doc. 21-10, p. 1). Mr. Goodman responded: \"Okay. Thanks [this is] his way of cordially saying he does not want the job. Let's go ahead and get our documentation prepared so that we can turn it over to Mr. Dawkins for dismissal.\" (Doc. 21-10, p. 1). On July 7, 2014, Mr. Martinez emailed some notes on Mr. Jackson to Mr. Goodman and explained his (Mr. Martinez's) \"concern [that Mr. Jackson] may have personnel [sic] issues outside of work that he may have to resolve to be able to perform the job safely.\" (Doc. 21-10, p. 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On July 10, 2014, Charles Pinkney from the City's human resources department emailed Mr. Dawkins about a meeting between Mr. Pinkney and Mr. Martinez concerning Mr. Jackson. (Doc. 23-9). Mr. Pinkney's email states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Please see highlighted below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   This is information in reference from my meeting earlier this morning with Mr. Martinez, in reference to Mr. Eric B.

(Doc. 20-32, pp. 1-4). The City placed Mr. Jackson on a corrective observation period through July 10, 2015. (Doc. 20-32, pp. 2, 4). Mr. Martinez and Mr. Goodman signed the reprimands. Mr. Jackson did not sign the reprimands. (Doc. 20-32, pp. 2, 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After receiving the reprimands, Mr. Jackson renewed his request for accommodation, telling Mr. Goodman that he needed flexibility with his schedule. (Doc. 20-1, pp. 41-42). Mr. Jackson does not remember what Mr. Goodman said in response to the particular request, but during one discussion about Mr. Jackson's PTSD, Mr. Goodman told Mr. Jackson that he could \"tell when it's real\" in reference to Mr. Jackson's statements about his PTSD and medication causing him to be late. (Doc. 20-1, p. 42; Doc. 20-1, pp. 54-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On July 14 or 15, 2014, Mr. Jackson gave the City a letter from Dr. Barbara Turner. (Doc. 20-1, pp. 39-40; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 7). Dr. Turner is a VA psychiatrist who treated Mr. Jackson for PTSD. (Doc. 20-1,\n   p. 39). Dr. Turner's letter is dated July 14, 2014. (Doc. 20-1, p. 39). In the letter, Dr. Turner confirmed Mr. Jackson's PTSD diagnosis. Dr. Turner stated that she recommended that Mr. Jackson take FMLA leave, but Mr. Jackson did not believe that FMLA leave was necessary because he had made the City aware of his PTSD diagnosis \"and may have to report off at times due to his current treatment plan.\" (Sealed Doc. 27-1, p. 2). Dr. Turner also explained that she recommended increasing the dosage of certain medication, but Mr. Jackson did not agree because he had \"already missed time from work due to sedation and oversleeping.\" (Sealed Doc. 27-1, p. 2). Dr. Turner invited the City to contact her with questions. (Sealed Doc. 27-1, p. 2). About a week after Mr. Jackson gave the City Dr. Turner's letter, Mr. Jackson again tried to follow up with Mr. Martinez to determine whether Mr. Goodman had responded to his (Mr. Jackson's) requests for accommodation, but Mr. Jackson did not receive a response. (Doc. 20-1, p. 42; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In response to the letter from Dr. Turner, Mr. Dawkins removed Mr. Jackson from the street, assigned him to a desk, and told him to \"read the [City's parking] ordinances until we tell you otherwise.\" (Doc. 20-1, p. 58; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 8). The City required Mr. Jackson to undergo a \"fitness for duty\" psychological examination at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. (Doc. 23-1, p. 35; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 8). On July 22, 2014, Mr. Jackson completed a psychological assessment online at UAB. (Doc. 20-1, pp. 43-44). Mr. Jackson did not meet with a doctor during this visit, and there was no interactive dialogue with a medical provider. (Doc. 20-1, p. 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Also on July 22, 2014, Mr. Jackson received another reprimand for clocking out on July 17, 2014, without his supervisor's approval. (Doc. 20-33, pp. 7-8). Under a section of the report titled \"Future Conditions of Employment,\" the reprimand states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   If you do not report to work or report off to your Supervisor before your designated shift begins, you will be disciplined for lateness or AWOL in accordance with the provisions of the Mayor[']s Administrative Directive WW-1, dated 10-27-75.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   If you accumulate 5 lateness[e]s or 3 AWOLs in one 12 month[ ] period, you will be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (Doc. 20-33, p. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On July 29, 2014, Mr. Dawkins sent Mr. Jackson a Notice of Determination Hearing. (Doc. 23-19, p. 1). The notice explained that the City contemplated personnel action against Mr. Jackson that could result in suspension, demotion, or dismissal. (Doc. 23-19, p. 1). In the notice, the City indicated that Mr. Jackson had violated a number of Jefferson County Personnel Board rules and regulations for missing work, clocking in late, and leaving work early during July 2014. (Doc. 23-19, pp. 2-3). The City set a determination hearing for August 6, 2014, during which Mr. Jackson could respond to the City's statement. (Doc. 23-19, p. 1). The City later postponed the hearing until August 8, 2014. (Doc. 20-1, p. 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On July 30, 2014, the City issued three additional written reprimands to Mr. Jackson for absences or tardiness. (Doc. 20-33, pp. 1-6). Around this time, Mr. Goodman said during a meeting with Mr. Martinez, Ms. Bailey, and Mr. Jackson either \"I don't want to deal with him\" or \"I don't want to deal with that[.]\" (Doc. 20-1, p. 55). The remarks concerned Mr. Jackson's PTSD and Mr. Jackson's employment. (Doc. 20-1, p. 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On August 9, 2014, one day after the determination hearing, Mr. Dawkins issued a final decision terminating Mr. Jackson's employment effective August 11,\n   2014. (Doc. 20-37, p. 1). Before his termination, Mr. Jackson was \"doing pretty good\" in his job. (Doc. 23-24, p. 8, tp. 30). Although he had made some mistakes in writing tickets when he started, he had improved and reduced the mistakes, and he had become one of the City's top performers. (Doc. 20-1, p. 55, tp. 217; Doc. 23-24, p. 8, tpp. 30-31). Mr. Martinez believed that Mr. Jackson was physically and mentally able to work. (Doc. 21-1, p. 26). Ms. Bailey did not observe Mr. Jackson having problems performing his job. (Doc. 23-24, p. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On October 22, 2014, Dr. Adrian Thurstin completed Mr. Jackson's neuropsychological report based on the July 22, 2014 \"fitness for duty\" assessment. Dr. Thurstin confirmed a PTSD diagnosis. Dr. Thurstin recommended intense, consistent management of the PTSD and a review of Mr. Jackson's medications because the current regimen was not effective, and Dr. Thurstin recommended that Mr. Jackson be allowed to take breaks every 90 minutes to reduce stress. (Sealed Doc. 27-22, pp. 2-3). No one at the City discussed Dr. Thurstin's report with Mr. Jackson. (Doc. 20-1, p. 44). Based on the October 22, 2014 date, the record suggests that the City terminated Mr. Jackson before receiving the completed fitness for duty report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In support of its argument that Mr. Jackson is judicially and equitably estopped from asserting his USERRA claim, the City cites one non-binding opinion in which a district court held that a plaintiff was judicially estopped from bringing USERRA claims because the plaintiff had represented to the VA in previous litigation that he was disabled. (Doc. 26, pp. 22-23) (citing\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Here, Mr. Jackson has submitted evidence from which a reasonable jury could decide that the City's one year probationary period was not a bona fide period of observation and training and that Mr. Jackson completed his actual training as a parking enforcement officer and his initial period of evaluation before he was deployed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The City's 12-month probationary period applied to all classified positions across the City. The probationary period was not tailored for the parking enforcement officer position. (Doc. 20-9, p. 6). And unlike the probationary periods in\n   <em>\n    Gipson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Paxton\n   </em>\n   , the evidence here suggests that a parking enforcement officer could satisfy the City's 12-month probationary period merely through time served in the position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Mr. Jackson demonstrates that after his initial week as a parking enforcement officer, he worked without regular supervision until he was deployed. (Doc. 20-1, pp. 22-23; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 2). According to Mr. Martinez, the City usually would spend two or three weeks training a parking enforcement officer before the officer would patrol a parking zone independently, but a senior parking enforcement officer would \"keep[ ] tabs,\" \"check[ ] up on,\" and \"shadow[ ]\" parking enforcement officers \"every once in a while\" after the initial training period. (Doc. 21-1, p. 13). But Mr. Jackson has explained that other than his initial week of training, when he returned from military leave, for one week, a supervisor again provided direction \"on how to write parking tickets, traffic ordinances, and patrol routes,\" but then he (Mr. Jackson) patrolled his parking zones \"without observation.\" (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In addition, Mr. Jackson has presented evidence from which jurors could conclude that the City did not consider the 12-month probationary period a bona fide period of observation and training. First, while Mr. Jackson was on military leave, the City awarded Mr. Jackson pay and benefits consistent with the City's Military Leave Resolution 392-08. (Doc. 20-19). The City provides benefits under Military Leave Resolution 392-08 only to permanent employees who have completed their probationary period. (Doc. 21-1, p. 16; Doc. 21-3, p. 1). Second, while Mr. Jackson was on military leave, the City awarded Mr. Jackson a merit pay increase based on the\n   time that Mr. Jackson had been employed with the City. (Doc. 23-1, p. 20; Doc. 23-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Thus, the evidence concerning the nature of the City's 12-month probationary period for new parking enforcement officers is disputed. Therefore, the City is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Mr. Jackson's claim that the City violated USERRA by extending his probationary period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 23-3). Citing the regulation that permits the Court to consider \"[t]he consequences of not requiring the incumbent to\n   perform the function,\" the City maintains that \"regular and consistent attendance is uniquely essential\" for a parking enforcement officer.

According to supervisors in the City's traffic department, the parking enforcement officer work schedule of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday is based on the time that most businesses are open. (Doc. 22-1, p. 17). One parking enforcement officer monitors one of the City's nine parking zones. (Doc. 20-1, p. 20; Doc. 21-1, p. 6; Doc. 22-1, p. 18). If a parking enforcement officer is unable to monitor his or her zone, \"that area will just go unchecked.\" (Doc. 23-1, p. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Mr. Jackson does not argue that regular and consistent attendance is not an essential function of the parking officer position, and Mr. Jackson has not offered evidence to create a question of fact with respect to the City's judgment that attendance at work is an essential function of the parking enforcement officer position. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32, pp. 14-15). Instead, Mr. Jackson submits that \"this was where [his] request for an accommodation came into play.\" (Doc. 32, p. 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The evidence establishes that Mr. Jackson could perform the essential physical functions of the parking enforcement officer position while he was at work. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 23-24, p. 8; Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 6). Mr. Jackson's supervisors believed that he was physically and mentally able to work, and they did not observe that Mr. Jackson had trouble performing his job. (Doc. 21-1, p. 26; Doc. 23-24, p. 8). To the extent that Mr. Jackson had difficulty arriving on time or completing full shifts because of sleeplessness or because of the anxiety and stress that he experienced when he encountered loud noises, flashing lights, or conflict with citizens, Mr. Jackson requested that the City modify his work schedule in two ways. First, Mr. Jackson requested a flexible start time. (Doc. 20-1, p. 41). Second, Mr. Jackson asked that the City permit him to use \"leave time\" while his doctors regulated his PTSD medication. (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   With respect to the request for leeway with his start time, Mr. Jackson testified that he needed a \"flexible\" start time because the medications that he was taking were \"constantly being switched out to see...which one worked better,\" and \"it was always a different result after every time\" that Mr. Jackson took a different medication. (Doc. 20-1, p. 41). Mr. Jackson did not request to work at a particular time each day because he \"couldn't pin down the time where I knew I would be in the office.\" (Doc. 20-1, p. 41). Mr. Jackson testified that a later start time would \"offset the unpredictability of the sleeping meds,\" and that he could report to work \"with the proper amount of sleep to be able to function and carry on throughout\n   the day the way [he was] supposed to.\" (Doc. 20-1, p. 42). No medical provider indicated that Mr. Jackson needed a flexible work schedule, and Mr. Jackson did not provide the City documentation from a doctor stating that he needed a flexible start time. (Doc. 20-1, p. 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Under the ADA, a reasonable accommodation may include \"part time or modified work schedules.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012111\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9)(B). In this case, Mr. Jackson's request for a modified work schedule is not a reasonable accommodation because in essence, Mr. Jackson asked to arrive at work when he wished, with no consistent start time or predictability in his schedule.

Mr. Jackson asked that the City allow him \"to use leave time while [his] medication was being adjusted[.]\" (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6 7). Mr. Jackson contends that had the City granted his requests for an accommodation, his \"attendance would have ultimately conformed to the traditional work schedule for a Parking Enforcement Officer,\" and his \"stress would have been reduced because it would have allowed [his] doctors time to adjust\" his medication to better treat his PTSD symptoms. (Doc. 31-1, \u00b6\u00b6 6.a, 6.d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As explained above, Mr. Jackson's evidence creates a question of fact about whether the City should have classified him as a probationary or permanent employee upon his return from military leave. As a permanent employee, Mr. Jackson could have taken paid vacation and sick leave consistent with the City's personnel policies and the rules and regulations of the Personnel Board of Jefferson County. (Doc. 20-1, p. 20; Doc. 20-9, p. 6; Doc. 20-11, pp. 55-56).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the City's policies also allow employees to take unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).

Before Mr. Jackson returned from military leave, Mr. Goodman asked why the City still was paying Mr. Jackson. (Doc. 22-11; Doc. 23-5, p. 1; Doc. 23-7, p. 1). Five weeks after Mr. Jackson returned, after he called in sick one day, Mr. Goodman stated that the City needed to get \"documentation prepared\" for dismissal. (Doc. 21-10). Mr. Goodman repeatedly reprimanded Mr. Jackson, stating that he (Mr. Goodman) could tell when PTSD was real and remarking that he did not \"want to deal\" with Mr. Jackson or his PTSD. (Doc. 20-1, p. 41; Doc. 20-1, pp. 54-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Within weeks of Mr. Jackson requesting an accommodation and within days of Mr. Jackson submitting a letter from his VA psychiatrist concerning his condition that suggested FMLA leave as a proper course, the City removed Mr. Jackson from his patrol and sent him to UAB for a \"fitness for duty\" examination. Three weeks later, after additional reprimands for tardiness and absences and before the City received the fitness for duty report from UAB, the City terminated Mr. Jackson's employment. These are the \"more compelling facts\" that the\n   <em>\n    Duckett\n   </em>\n   Court contemplated when it explained that \"ADA regulations may possibly be violated if an employee was terminated immediately upon becoming disabled without a chance to use his leave to recover.\"\n   <em>\n    Duckett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"224498\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/120/1222/\">\n    120 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1226 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Because a question of fact exists concerning the reasonableness of Mr. Jackson's request to take leave while his doctors adjusted his PTSD medication and because successful adjustment of his medication could have enabled Mr. Jackson to maintain the City's regular work hours without accommodation, a question of fact exists concerning Mr. Jackson's status as a qualified individual under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
