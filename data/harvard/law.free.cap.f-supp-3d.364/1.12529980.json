Defendants never appeared, and Dahman successfully moved for a default judgment on liability. Finally arriving on the scene, Defendants now move on several grounds both to vacate the default and to dismiss the case.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As the Court has already treated in detail the facts of this dispute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dahman v.

July 26, 2018), a brief recap suffices here. Seventy-year-old Dahman began working as an accountant for the Embassy of Qatar here in Washington in 1995. He became Director of the Accounting Department the next year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203597660\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   His employment was governed by a contract\n   that provided that it would expire when he reached the age of 64 in February 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16 (Motion for Default Judgment), Exh. 8 (Plaintiff's Employment Contract), \u00b6 7.1. That date came and went, but Plaintiff kept working. Several years later, the Embassy finally terminated him on January 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dahman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203597660\">\n    2018 WL 3597660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 12, 2017, having received a right-to-sue notice from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Dahman brought this action against the Embassy and the State of Qatar (which, for ease of reference, the Court will refer to jointly as \"Qatar\") for age discrimination in his termination in violation of the ADEA and the DCHRA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203597660\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He served both Defendants in February 2018 but received a response from neither.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203597660\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, he obtained the entry of default in April 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 13-14. He then moved the following month for default judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16. Defendants did not challenge that either, and the Court issued a 20-page Opinion on July 26, 2018, addressing a number of issues, including the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dahman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203597660\">\n    2018 WL 3597660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants now so move on three grounds: lack of subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4),\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), and for several additional reasons having to do with immunity for the State of Qatar and whether Dahman exhausted EEOC remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22 (Motion to Vacate Default). Because the Court will vacate the default judgment on laibility and dismiss on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds, it need not address the other two bases for the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As the foregoing discussion made clear, however, the Court's discretion is not so limited. In any event, even if Plaintiff's precise formulation were correct, the course here would remain appropriate. That is because, as the following analysis will demonstrate,\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   considerations do weigh heavily in favor of dismissal, while the jurisdictional question - namely, whether an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act applies here to allow the suit to proceed - is a much closer question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dahman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203597660\">\n    2018 WL 3597660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-8 (discussing FSIA issue without input from Defendants).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In asserting\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   here, Qatar argues that the forum-selection clause in Dahman's contract - namely, an arbitration clause - necessitates dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine Constr.

The Court will address each step in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Validity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dahman's employment contract is a seven-page document that comprehensively covers the terms of his work for the Embassy. It includes provisions for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , his appointment, medical insurance, schedule, leave, obligations, and termination and associated payments. In addition, it includes an arbitration clause that reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   All disputes arising under this Local Employment Contract shall first be brought before the Administrative Officer of the Embassy. The Employee shall have the right to appeal any decision by the Administrative Officer to the Ambassador at the Embassy of the State of Qatar ... The decision of the Ambassador shall be final. After exhausting the foregoing dispute resolution procedure, any remaining dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Local Employment Contract, or the\n   breach, termination or invalidity thereof,\n   <em>\n    shall be settled exclusively by arbitration\n   </em>\n   ... The number of arbitrators shall be three; the place of arbitration shall be Doha, Qatar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Employment Contract, \u00b6 9.1 (emphasis added). In addition, a separate clause stipulates that the \"Local Employment Contract, and any related dispute, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Qatar.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9.6. On its face, then, the contract requires that Dahman's claims be submitted to arbitration in Qatar under the laws of that country. Dahman, however, contests such an interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   He raises two arguments to undermine the validity of the arbitration clause for the purpose of this dispute: first, when he was terminated, the contract had already expired, and the clause thus has no effect; and second, the clause is not applicable to his particular claims here. As to the first, Plaintiff maintains that the \"entire discussion of the arbitration clause is inapplicable\" because no contract was in force at the time he was terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 15. He elaborates that the contract \"by its own terms necessarily expired when [Dahman] reached the age of 64\" in February 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Employment Contract, \u00b6 7.1 (providing that contract \"shall renew automatically, and continue from month-to-month unless terminated in accordance with\" procedures in contract, \"provided, however, that this [contract] shall expire when [Dahman] reaches the age of 64 years\"). Because \"the contract expired,\" Plaintiff concludes, for the \"several years\" he worked after turning 64, \"local law necessarily governed the parties' relationship.\" Opp. at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While appealing at first glance, this position does not accurately reflect the law. Rather, \"general principles of contract law teach ... that when a contract lapses but the parties to the contract continue to act as if they are performing under a contract, the material terms of the prior contract will survive intact unless either one of the parties clearly and manifestly indicates, through words or through conduct, that it no longer wishes to continue to be bound thereby, or both parties mutually intend that the terms not survive.\"\n   <em>\n    Luden's Inc. v.

The Court concludes, accordingly, that the terms of the contract - including the arbitration clause - continued to bind the parties beyond the enumerated expiration date and until Dahman's termination in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff's second contention - namely, that the arbitration clause, by its terms, does not cover his statutory age-discrimination claims - fares no better. He makes a cluster of related points: 1) the arbitration clause does not apply to his \"non-contractual based statutory claims\"; 2) it cannot encompass this \"dispute ... precisely governed by U.S. law\" because the parties did not \"contemplat[e]\" \"Defendants' violation of U.S. and D.C. statutes\"; and 3) it is drafted too narrowly to encompass his discriminatory-termination claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 16-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The first two contentions are easily dispatched because Dahman points to no authority suggesting arbitration clauses do not cover statutory claims as a general matter or that claims arising under U.S. law cannot be submitted to foreign arbitration. Nor does he cite any support for the proposition that the parties here did not intend to arbitrate the violation of these or other statutes. In fact, case law makes clear that arbitration clauses can encompass non-contractual claims, including statutory ones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crescent Intern., Inc. v.

To the extent Dahman is instead arguing that because the contract provides for the application of Qatari law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Employment Contract, \u00b6 9.6, these particular U.S. law claims may not in fact be vindicated in Qatar, that is an equitable argument more appropriately weighed at the second step of the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis. That is, it does not go to whether the clause is applicable, but rather to whether the public interest disfavors dismissal. The Court thus treats it in Section III.B,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The final point - that the arbitration clause is drafted too narrowly to encompass the instant claims - requires a bit more ink. Plaintiff contends that, because the clause provides for arbitration of a dispute \"arising under\" the contract rather than \"arising out of or relating to\" it, the clause is comparatively cabined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 15-16 (citing\n   <em>\n    Dowley v. Dewey Ballantine, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201102768\">\n    2006 WL 1102768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (D.D.C. Apr. 26, 2006) ). He also maintains that this dispute is outside the ambit of the contract, since it \"is not over the terms of his termination\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   ... but rather the discrimination he experienced by Defendants during his employment based on his age.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that the arbitration clause in fact contains\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   \"arising under\" language\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \"arising out of or relating to\" language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Employment Contract, \u00b6 9.1. Specifically, it provides that \"[a]ll disputes arising under this [contract] shall first be brought before the Administrative Officer of the Embassy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Once the intra-Embassy decisional process is exhausted, then \"any remaining dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this [contract], or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, shall be settled exclusively by arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To the extent, therefore, that Dahman hangs his hat on the argument that the clause contains only - in his view, comparatively narrow - \"arising under\" language, that emphasis is puzzling, since the provision contains both phrases. If Plaintiff is making an argument that the initial \"arising under\" language limits the subsequent \"arising out of and relating to\" provision, the Court is not persuaded. The addition of the \"relating to\" language reflects an intent for a potentially\n   <em>\n    broader\n   </em>\n   range of claims to be brought before the arbitrator than could be brought in the intra-Embassy process; otherwise, the language is superfluous. Likewise, while the contract provides that \"[a]ll\n   <em>\n    disputes\n   </em>\n   \" must go through the exhaustion procedure, \"any remaining\n   <em>\n    dispute\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    controversy\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   \"- a broader class of issues - goes to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To give these textual additions meaning, the Court must conclude that any controversy \"arising out of\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   relating to\" the contract must be submitted to arbitration. Far from being a narrow mandate, the clause in Dahman's contract therefore has expansive reach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg.

The whole thrust of his suit is that Qatar terminated him for improper reasons.

RAK Investment Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524740\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/305/149/#p175\">\n    305 F.Supp.3d 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175 (D.D.C. 2018), where \"the burden [was] on Defendants to prove the foreign forum ... adequate\" and dismissal appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 24. That test is inappropriate here, where, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Azima\n   </em>\n   , the Court has found that a valid forum-selection clause applies to govern the parties' dispute. The Supreme Court has made clear that, in that instance, the burden shifts, so that Dahman must \"show[ ] why the court should not transfer the case to the forum to which the parties agreed.\"\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/49/#p60\">\n    571 U.S. at 62-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He contends here that enforcement of the clause would \"contravene[ ] the strong public policy of this forum in applying the ADEA and DCHRA\" and that his age-discrimination claims \"would not be [v]indicated in ... Qatar.\" Opp. at 25, 27, 28. As these arguments are closely related, the Court will address them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiff has not carried his burden to show that his claims would not be addressed adequately in Qatar. He asserts without citation that \"Defendants' discrimination ... inside [D.C.] would not be held to the same high standard of social justice in Qatar as it would here in Washington.\" Opp. at 26. This falls short of an actual showing that he could not bring and receive relief for a substantially similar claim in the foreign forum. Plaintiff elaborates that \"[f]orcing the parties ... to arbitrate [the] age discrimination claim in Qatar ... would directly contravene the ADEA's goal of deterring the setting of arbitrary age limits and the DCHRA's strong public policy of ending age discrimination in [D.C.] and the legislative intent of the statute.\" Opp. at 26. As he has never shown that these claims could not be vindicated in Qatar, the conclusion that dismissal would contravene the purposes of ADEA and DCHRA does not follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As Qatar may potentially consider the age-discrimination claim, Dahman has not shown that the public interest would \"overwhelmingly disfavor\" dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216237\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/20/#p26\">\n    500 U.S. at 29, 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216237\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/20/#p26\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming ADEA claims may be submitted to arbitration);\n   <em>\n    Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young U.S. LLC v.
