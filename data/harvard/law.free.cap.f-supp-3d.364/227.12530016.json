CROTTY, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a consolidated securities class action\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , alleging that Defendants failed to disclose a conflict with Effex Capital, LLC (\"Effex\"), the leading foreign currency exchange (\"forex\") trading platform for FXCM, Inc., Forex Capital Markets, LLC,\n   and FXCM Holdings, LLC (collectively, \"FXCM\"). According to Plaintiffs, FXCM hired Defendant John Dittami to create the forex trading platform Effex, which FXCM spun off but retained control over. FXCM presented its forex trading system as designed to produce better results for customers because, unlike the \"dealing desk\" model, it was inherently conflict-free. But Plaintiffs claim that these representations hid an obvious conflict with Effex, which was winning the majority of orders over banks and other \"market makers\" because it had secret access to view customers' orders, despite FXCM's promises of anonymity. Plaintiffs also allege that FXCM, through Effex, took positions opposite clients in stark contradiction with FXCM's marketing and engaged in harmful practices that violated the duties and obligations owed to its customers. According to Plaintiffs, Effex and Dittami acted under the direction of FXCM and aided and abetted FXCM's fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2017, FXCM entered into settlements with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") and National Futures Association (\"NFA\") regarding these practices and undisclosed relationship with Effex, and FXCM agreed to withdraw from operating in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 26, 2017, this Court stayed this action pending arbitration as to claims against Defendants FXCM, Dror Niv, and William Adhout, but not with respect to claims against Defendants Effex and Dittami. (Dkt. 37.) Accordingly, only the six counts (out of eleven total) alleged against Effex and Dittami are at issue here: Counts II, III, IV, V, VI, and X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants Effex and Dittami move to strike references to settlements with the CFTC and NFA and move to dismiss the six counts at issue pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. After careful consideration of the pleadings and briefing, the Court DENIES the motion to strike and GRANTS the motion to dismiss without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FXCM Develops No Dealing Desk Model\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint (Dkt. 48) (\"Complaint\" or \"Compl.\"), FXCM was an online provider of forex trading services that offered a platform for customers to invest in the forex market-the largest and most actively traded financial market in the world. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 55, 57.) Forex trading involves the exchange of one currency for another. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Trades on the forex market usually occur in over-the-counter transactions with a dealer rather than through a central exchange, making them less regulated, more reliant on the \"market makers\" or dealers who buy and sell currencies, and more susceptible to manipulation than trading in other markets. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-56, 65-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2007, FXCM transitioned from a \"dealing desk\" model for executing forex trades, in which a division of FXCM determined prices offered and took positions opposite to customers, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59), to an \"agency\" or \"no dealing desk\" (\"NDD\") model, in which price quotations were provided by third-party market makers to customers whose orders were to be kept confidential, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Effex Becomes Market Maker For FXCM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2009, FXCM hired a high frequency trader, Dittami, to create a high frequency trading algorithm for the new NDD model. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-03.) Dittami's contract with FXCM guaranteed him a base salary plus 30% of any profits generated by the system, with FXCM retaining the remaining\n   70% (the \"Rebate Payments\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 103-104.) In 2010, this high frequency trading system spun off from FXCM and became a new company-Effex-where Dittami went to work with the same profit-splitting agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-108.) Though Dittami had technically resigned from FXCM, he continued to work at FXCM's offices in New York rent-free for a year and use FXCM's servers and email systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 110-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Effex paid FXCM monthly for order flow through the Rebate Payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113.) FXCM allowed Effex to win all ties with other market makers, shared other market makers' price quotations with Effex, and added smaller markups to Effex's prices than it added for other market makers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.) As a result, Effex won a disproportionately higher percentage of orders compared to other market makers, potentially depriving customers of better prices. Effex's monthly payments to FXCM totaled nearly $ 80 million, and Effex captured over 50% of FXCM's daily order flow. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 140.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. FXCM's Relationship With Effex\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   FXCM was not forthcoming about its relationship with Effex. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 90.) For example, in its 2010 Annual Report, FXCM included a graphic showing the percentage of volume of each liquidity provider on the NDD platform: BNP (13.5%); Citi (8.0%); Citi-Prime Broker (All Others) (35.8%); Deutsche Bank (3.5%); Dresdner (13.3%); Goldman (14.4%); JP Morgan (3.6%); Morgan Stanley (8.0%). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145.) The 35.8% of trades executed by \"Citi-Prime Broker (All Others)\" was mostly, if not completely, attributable to Effex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In September 2012, in a rare if not singular public recognition of any relationship with Effex, FXCM's Brand Ambassador stated on an online forum that \"FXCM does not own [Effex], nor do they have control over what orders can go to other liquidity providers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. FXCM's Representations about NDD\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to FXCM, the NDD model was at the \"heart\" of FXCM's business, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82), and was uniquely suited to eliminate conflicts of interest and price manipulation, providing a better result for the customer, (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61, 77, 78, 81, 83, 85, 162, 164, 166, 168, 170). The NDD model was supposed to anonymize customers' orders so that market makers would compete to offer the best available price to customers and could not stake out positions contrary to customers. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) At the same time, as FXCM explained in its client agreements with Plaintiffs, the NDD model was supposed to be transparent and fair, because FXCM's profits depended on standardized markups, rather than taking positions contrary to customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60, 81, 94, 95-97.) To put it in FXCM's own words from its website\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   FXCM makes an identical amount of money in the form of pip markups\n   (which are really commissions) regardless of whether the customer made or lost money on the account. FXCM receives prices from global banks, financial institutions, and other market makers in the foreign exchange markets. A best bid/offer engine sorts those prices and marks them up with our standard markup on the majors. This markup acts as the commission on the trade. When a customer clicks on a price, they are actually clicking on a price from the bank that currently has the best bid or offer, plus our markup. Given that we make money on a per trade basis, we are motivated to encourage size and high frequency and it is why we offer extra incentives to clients. It's also why we dedicate a lot of resources in trying to improve client profitability so they have the money to stay around and trade in bigger sizes. We don't benefit from customer losses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 159.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   FXCM also represented that the NDD model was superior because it could pass on price improvements to customers by mitigating \"negative slippage\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and/or realizing the benefits of \"positive slippage.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-87.) Plaintiffs assert that FXCM's main selling point throughout the class period\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   can be summed up by the following quote taken from FXCM's website in December 2016:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   With NDD, FXCM acts as a price aggregator. We take the best available bid and best ask prices from our liquidity providers-global banks, financial institutions and other market makers-and stream those prices to your platform. This large, diverse group of liquidity providers makes this model special: The more advantageous the prices, the more order flow the provider receives. Through competition, NDD ensures prices are market-driven and fair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Effex Implements Allegedly Abusive Practices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Hold Timer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At some point, Effex began to take advantage of the benefits of positive slippage in the market rather than passing them along to customers through the use of a Hold Timer, which permitted Effex to delay order execution for a period of time (milliseconds in duration), providing Effex with a \"last look\" at the order so that it could execute the trade if the market price moved favorably, or reject the trade if it moved unfavorably. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 122-24.) Because Effex was taking positions opposite the customer, the Hold Timer and \"last look\" allowed Effex to selectively execute trades: where the price at the end of the Hold Timer had moved against Effex and in favor of the customer, Effex could reject the trade, but where the price had moved in favor of Effex and against the customer, Effex could execute the trade and pass negative price slippage to the customer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124.) FXCM staff assisted Effex in\n   configuring and adjusting the Hold Timer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Previous Quote\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A feature called Previous Quote was also implemented, which allowed FXCM to share customer data with Effex, including the price that would trigger the execution of a customer order (the \"Tagged Price\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 136.) This feature allowed Effex to choose between two trade prices-the Tagged Price or the quotation Effex had submitted to FXCM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) FXCM could thus choose the price that favored FXCM over the customer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This practice directly contradicted FXCM's representations regarding customer order anonymity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. FXCM Enters Settlement Agreements with Federal Regulators\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On February 6, 2017, FXCM, FXCM Holdings, Niv, and Adhout entered into a settlement agreement with the CFTC to pay a $ 7 million penalty based on these practices and relationship with Effex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 172-73.) The CFTC order permanently revoked FXCM, Dror Niv, and William Adhout's CFTC registrations, and found that \"FXCM engaged in false and misleading solicitations of FXCM's retail foreign exchange (forex) customers by concealing its relationship with its most important market maker and by misrepresenting that its 'No Dealing Desk' platform had no conflicts of interest with its customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 173, 178.) More specifically, the CFTC found: \"FXCM had an undisclosed interest in the market maker that consistently 'won' the largest share of FXCM's trading volume-and thus was taking positions opposite FXCM's retail customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The CFTC concluded that Forex Capital, FXCM Holdings, Dror Niv, and William Adhout had \"violated Sections 4b(a)(2), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b(a)(2), and Regulation 5.2(b),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.2\">\n    17 C.F.R \u00a7 5.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) of the CEA, with Forex Capital, FXCM Holdings, and Niv also violating Section 9(a)(4) of the CEA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179.) The parties who were subject to the settlements did not consent to the use of the order governing the settlement, or its findings or conclusions, in any other proceedings. (Dkt. 58 Ex. 6 at 1 n.1.) The CFTC order made no findings or conclusions about the culpability of Effex or Dittami.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Also on February 6, 2017, FXCM, Dror Niv, William Adhout, and Forex Capital CEO Ornit Niv, entered into a settlement agreement with the NFA, permanently revoking their membership. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 176-77.) The NFA decision found that FXCM, Ahdout, and/or Niv had violated numerous NFA Compliance Rules and Financial Requirements. Like the CFTC order, the NFA decision did not make any findings or conclusions about Effex or Dittami. (Dkt. 58 Ex. 7 at 1-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Following the two settlements, FXCM withdrew from operating in the United States and transferred control of all U.S.-domiciled customer accounts to GAIN Capital Holdings, Inc. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 181-82.) Dror Niv and William Adhout resigned from their positions as members of the FXCM Board of Directors, Dror Niv resigned as Chief Executive Officer, and FXCM changed its name to Global Brokerage Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 183.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Effex and Dittami are not parties to and not named in the CFTC settlement, but are discussed generally for their involvement in FXCM's practices. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 57 Ex. 6 (discussing \"algorithmic trading system\" and the \"high frequency trader\" who created it).) Effex is named in the NFA settlement but is not a party to it; Dittami is not named at all. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 57 Ex. 7.) Plaintiffs reference these settlements throughout the Complaint and rely heavily on them for some, but not all of their allegations against the Defendants as a group. For example, Plaintiffs provide some independent factual support for FXCM's misrepresentations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68-100, 142-52.) There are sections of the Complaint that appear, however, to have been lifted nearly verbatim from the CFTC settlement. (\n   <em>\n    Compare id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-22, 153-57\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 57 Ex. 6 at 3-7). All of the allegations against Effex and Dittami are derived from the CFTC settlement, without any independent factual support. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 102-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The allegations that have been lifted verbatim from the CFTC settlement are inadmissible, but they can be relied upon by Plaintiffs at the pleading stage as allegations made \"upon information and belief.\" At the pleading stage, Plaintiffs need only allege facts that, upon their information and belief, will likely lead to admissible evidence in discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re OSG Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219344\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/12/619/#p622\">\n    12 F.Supp.3d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 622 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). A complaint that relies solely on allegations made \"upon information and belief\" fails to meet the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b), but those statements need not necessarily be stricken under Rule 12(f). The inclusion of the settlements in the pleadings may cause prejudice to nonparties Effex and Dittami because they were not adjudicated, do not involve findings or stipulations of fact, and explicitly state that the parties have not consented to their use in any other proceedings. None of the parties who negotiated these settlements represented the interests of Effex or Dittami.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Still, the CFTC and NFA settlements have bearing on the issues in the case. Defendants cite to\n   <em>\n    Lipsky v.
