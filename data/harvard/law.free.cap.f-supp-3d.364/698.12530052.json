The Laredo City Council determined that the proposed landfill is not in the best interests of the community and decided to express that opinion to the TCEQ. While the underlying facts are interesting, they don't bestow Article III standing-Rancho Viejo may frown upon the council's comments, but it has failed to allege a cognizable injury in fact. The Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 4) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For several years, Rancho Viejo Waste Management has had an application for a Municipal Solid Waste Permit pending with the TCEQ. (Dkt. Nos. 1 at 6; 11 at 2-4; 11-3). Its proposed solid-waste landfill, the Pescadito Environmental Resource Center, would be located roughly twenty miles from the City of Laredo. (Dkt. Nos. 1 at 4; 11 at 1-2). Both Rancho Viejo and the City of Laredo acknowledge that the landfill's proposed site is outside of the municipality's jurisdiction-the city simply lacks regulatory authority over the matter. (Dkt. Nos. 1 at 2; 11 at 4; 14 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With the TCEQ application pending, Bernhard Capital Partners Management, LP reached out to Rancho Viejo to discuss purchasing or investing in the landfill. (Dkt. No. 11-4 at 1-2). Representatives from both entities spoke frequently about the status of the application, and following a February 2016 meeting, they were optimistic that they would eventually strike a deal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2016, public concerns about Rancho Viejo's proposed landfill came to the attention of the Laredo City Council. (Dkt. Nos. 1 at 2, 4-6; 11 at 2; 11-2 at 32-34). The council gave advocates and opponents\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the project an opportunity to speak and ultimately took up \"a resolution in opposition to the proposed regional landfill that is currently in the permitting process by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\" (Dkt. No. 11-1 at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The resolution passed-its final form read: \"Motion to resolve to oppose a regional landfill and that all public comments\n   made at this Council meeting be forwarded to TCEQ for their consideration during the public comment in the application process.\" (Dkt. Nos. 11 at 2; 11-2 at 22). In May 2018, Laredo City Councilmen Rudy Gonzalez and Alberto Torres again relayed opposition to Rancho Viejo's application at a TCEQ public meeting. (Dkt. Nos. 1 at 6; 11 at 3). And in August 2018, the city asked the TCEQ for leave to file an amicus brief in opposition to the application. (Dkt. No. 11 at 3-4; 11-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the city council passed its resolution, negotiations between Rancho Viejo and Bernhard Capital broke down. (Dkt. Nos. 1 at 6; 11 at 8-9; 11-4 at 3). When pressed as to whether Bernhard Capital intended to finalize a deal, one of its representatives responded, \"No, the City's opposition made it impossible now.\" (Dkt. Nos. 11 at 8-98; 11-4 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rancho Viejo subsequently brought this lawsuit against the City of Laredo and the councilmembers who voted in favor of the resolution, requesting damages, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief under \u00a7 1983 and the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause, as well as damages for tortious interference with prospective business relations under Texas law. (Dkt. No. 1 at 6-8). Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) &amp; (6). (Dkt. No. 4). Because the Court must be assured of its power to hear an action before proceeding to its merits, it ordered the parties to address an issue that none had independently raised-standing. (Dkt. No. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Laredo City Council notably chose to enact only a resolution in opposition to Rancho Viejo's permit application; it did not pass an ordinance, regulation, tax, or any other enactment capable of bringing the city's governmental powers to bear upon Plaintiff's activities. This is important because \"[t]he distinction between legislative enactments, such as statutes and ordinances, and resolutions has long been recognized [under Texas law].\"\n   <em>\n    City of Clute v.

In the final case,\n   <em>\n    Three Expo Events, L.L.C. v.

The common thread through each of those cases is that they involve a plaintiff who was denied an opportunity to pursue some benefit from government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In contrast, Rancho Viejo has identified no benefit that the City of Laredo has denied it; to the contrary, all parties admit that the City of Laredo has no power to either allow or disallow Rancho Viejo's proposed landfill. The city has merely expressed its preferred outcome in a permit application pending before the TCEQ. Rancho Viejo has not \"lost the opportunity\" to pursue its landfill-permit application or market its proposed landfill to investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It may be that-despite the authorities it cites-Rancho Viejo actually means to argue that the injury it suffered was Bernhard Capital's decision to withdraw from negotiations. But that argument is likewise unavailing. Because Bernhard Capital never actually entered into an agreement with Rancho Viejo, the latter's claimed losses are no more than conjecture-not the kind of loss that courts have found sufficient to establish an injury in fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berry v.

Affirming a district court's dismissal of the suit on multiple grounds, including lack of Article III standing, the Eleventh Circuit noted that \"[t]he discretion reserved to [the developer] under its purchase agreement with [the plaintiff] was simply so broad as to render [the developer's] eventual purchase of the [plaintiff's] lot no more than a wholly uncertain possibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9012626\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/405/964/#p985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9012626\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/405/964/#p985\">\n    at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The loss Rancho Viejo alleges is thus only conjecture. It is insufficient to establish an injury in fact under Article III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Reputational Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The only other theory of injury alluded to in Rancho Viejo's filings is reputational injury. (Dkt. No. 12 at 3). Rancho Viejo never explicitly argues that it can satisfy the first element of Article III standing on that basis, but two of its filings do touch upon the notion. In the redressability section of its initial standing memorandum, Plaintiff states that a favorable decision in this case will relieve it \"of the current smear of its reputation.\" (Dkt. No. 11 at 10). And in its supplemental standing memorandum, which addresses\n   <em>\n    Three Expo Events, L.L.C. v.

Thus, although Rancho Viejo has not expressly argued that the City of Laredo's resolution gave rise to the kind of reputational injury that would satisfy the injury-in-fact element of Article III standing, the Court will evaluate that contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As an initial matter, it is unclear whether the\n   <em>\n    Three Expo\n   </em>\n   panel actually did hold that the City of Dallas's resolution gave rise to a reputational injury sufficient to satisfy the injury element of standing. As noted above, the plaintiff in that case, Three Expo Events, LLC, was a \"company engaged in the business of producing and presenting adult; love- and sex-themed conventions.\"\n   <em>\n    Three Expo Events\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519025\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/907/333/#p336\">\n    907 F.3d at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That principle accords with the\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   rule, which mandates that \"[w]hen a fragmented [Supreme] Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as the position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Yes, Judge Dennis's opinion found that the City of Dallas's resolution caused Three Expo both (1) \"direct pecuniary injury,\" and (2) \"future reputational injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Three Expo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519025\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/907/333/#p336\">\n    907 F.3d at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Judge Jolly concurred in the judgment only \"to the extent that the opinion holds that Three Expo has sustained a\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519025\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/907/333/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Jolly, J., concurring) (emphasis added). Thus, the\n   precedent established by\n   <em>\n    Three Expo\n   </em>\n   is that a business has standing to sue when it is denied equal access to a government-provided opportunity, and the denial causes direct pecuniary injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   But even if Judge Dennis's\n   <em>\n    Three Expo\n   </em>\n   opinion wholly commanded a majority of the panel, there are weighty reasons to believe that the reputational-injury rule would not provide for standing in the case at hand.

Rancho Viejo points to no authority suggesting that is the state of the law. Nor has it articulated a sufficient basis to find reputational-injury standing in this case. It has therefore failed to establish that the Laredo City Council's resolution caused it to suffer an injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Immediate concerns are: the floodplain contains nearly half of this project; wastes including coal ash and heavy metals, oil and gas or frac[k]ing; and industrial wastes coming from across the river. There is a cluster of colonias in Laredo which continue to grow, and incoming winds from the landfill are a cause for concern to the organization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Sharyn Jordan noted that the community already has two operational landfills with over 100 remaining years of capacity. Laredo does not need another landfill, especially one that will accept hazardous waste. Some of the industrial waste to be collected at this landfill is toxic. It is feasible that southern winds will blow dust from this landfill into the residential and business communities of the City. Coal ash kills grass and trees, and Laredo should not be willing to accept this waste. Communities along the entire route will be in danger of waste contamination or rain water runoff. Ms. Jordan asked Council to protect Laredo citizens and do not allow this landfill to come to the City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Allen Messenger, an engineer representing ANB Cattle Company, reported that in 2014, approximately 300,000 tons of waste were dumped in landfill. The estimated lifespan of the Ponderosa landfill is 129 years. The Pescadito landfill has an estimated lifespan of 486-625 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Marisa Perales of Stop Pescadito Landfill League stated that this landfill would impact fire and emergency responses, and spill management. These impacts would cause the proposed landfill to be under the governmental responsibility of Council. She also noted that it is not uncommon for cities to pass resolutions in opposition to landfills. SPILL is not the only group that is opposed to this landfill. She noted over 2,200 signatures of Laredo residents have been gathered in opposition to this landfill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Lauren Ross, an engineer, reported that 40% of the proposed landfill sits in the hundred year floodplain. The applicant has brought forward a conditional letter of map provision (CLOMR) in order to engage in an activity that is inconsistent with flooding. The boundaries of the drainage areas are incorrect on the engineering\n   company's conditional letter. The applicant has also misrepresented areas of runoff and calculations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Alejandro Obregon stated that he is speaking on behalf of the entire community. Resident have worked hard for their well being and to decontaminate their streets. A couple of years ago, community members cleared 3,800 tires from the streets. After all of their hard work, they do not want to live in contaminated air. He stated that citizens are not being told enough information about the landfill by Council. Rather than build a landfill, the community members want to reforest the area. He asked if the City has prepared a health plan for the citizens living near the landfill. He voiced his concern of toxic fumes as a result of any fires in the landfill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Leon Komkov, an attorney for ANB Cattle Company, noted that ANB Cattle Company is a neighboring ranch and co-tenant of this proposed waste facility property. This facility is unwanted, unneeded, unreliable, and unsafe. Geoffrey \"Jeff\" Connor, the attorney representing Pescadito, spoke in favor of the landfill. He stated that the proposed landfill will be much further away than current landfills; it is well outside the City limits and well outside the jurisdiction of Council and the ETJ. The public was first notified about this proposed landfill five years ago. He clarified that there is much more due process that will occur with this application. A great deal of misinformation has been presented to Council. Mr. Connor clarified that the proposed landfill is not a toxic waste dump; the landfill will not accept toxic hazardous waste; the specification is that it can accept nonhazardous commercial waste. It will also not accept waste from Mexico due to federal regulations. He also noted that FEMA has verbally confirmed that they approve the submitted plan. He urged Council to let the due process work. He offered to put a summation of the application, which is six binders thick, into a clear and concise format for the public to review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   C.Y. Benavides III spoke in favor of the proposed landfill. The duty of Council is to provide services and options. This proposed landfill is an option to meet regional needs in South Texas. It allows Laredo to redevelop its footprint at the new facility. Landfills are evolving to become regional across the country.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Riazul Mia, Utilities Director, noted that Council will only be able to bring this item before the judge at the time of the hearing of the application. Permitting is a process in which, like it or not, the applicant will receive the permit if they meet all of the requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Cm. Vela stated that given the opinion from the City Attorney's Office and the fact that Laredo will soon need additional landfill space, Council should table this item and continue to monitor the situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Cm. Altgelt noted a meaningful difference of opinion from Ms. Hale's opinion to Council. Section 2.06 of the Code of Ethics states, \"A City official or employee shall not use, request, or permit the use of City resources for any private purpose.\" He stated that the proposed landfill is an issue of public health, which is not a private interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Ms. Hale stated that only TCEQ has the governmental jurisdiction to grant this permit or to wield police power regarding air quality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Cm. Balli shared the same sentiments of many of the individuals opposing the landfill. However, he does not think that Ms. Hale's advice should be ignored. For that reason, he will not support Cm. Altgelt's motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Motion to resolve to oppose a regional landfill and that all public comments made at this Council meeting be forwarded to TCEQ for their consideration during the public comment in the application process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Moved: Cm.
