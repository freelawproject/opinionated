Currently before the Court is Defendant's motion to dismiss [54] Plaintiff's second amended complaint for failure to state a claim. For the reasons explained below, Defendants motion [54] is denied in part and granted in part. Count VI is dismissed for failure to state claim, while Plaintiff may proceed with the remaining counts. Additionally, the Court strikes Exhibits A &amp; B [55-1; 55-2] attached to Defendants' motion and did not consider them in the resolution of this motion.

Feb. 13, 2018) ) ]. In brief, Plaintiff, an officer with the Illinois Secretary of State Department of Police (\"ISOS Police\"), alleges that from October 2013 to June 2014 he met with various state and federal investigators multiple times to report alleged misconduct and abuse by ISOS Police personnel, including at least two of the defendants. [52, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 11-15.] Plaintiff alleges that at some point before June 2014, Defendants became aware of the allegations and the investigations. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon learning of these discussions, Defendants allegedly conspired to retaliate against Plaintiff. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28.] In addition to the allegedly sham investigation that led to the imposition of a punitive leave and a reduction of his responsibilities, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-59; see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20835353\">\n    2018 WL 835353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ], Plaintiff now alleges several other instances of retaliatory conduct between his protected speech in 2013 and 2014 and March 2015 when Defendants placed him on leave and initiated a sham investigation. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) purposely delayed his order of specialty body armor (necessitated by his use of an insulin pump) for almost 5 months-from April 3 to August 29, 2014-when such orders typically take 2-3 weeks, [52, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) denied two separate requests from Plaintiff in October 2014 to move his residence to Kane and DeKalb counties, respectively, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22];\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (3) denied Plaintiff's request in January 2015 to have a \"moving radar\" installed in his vehicle despite the availability of funds and the fact that Plaintiff \"conducted a majority of investigations in District 1 relating to 'driving under the influence of alcohol' [ ] and 'speeding' offenses while providing that equipment to less qualified and more junior individuals, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23].\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that in August 2014, a co-worker informed him that \"he needed to 'stay under the radar' because the Defendants were watching him.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.] The co-worker also informed him that Defendants had been sending emails to each other about him for several months. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The alleged conspiracy and pattern of retaliation culminated in what Plaintiff asserts was a sham investigation into a traffic stop that Defendants used as an excuse to punish him for his discussions with investigators.

[1.] Defendants then moved to dismiss the initial complaint, see [16], which the Court struck without prejudice after Plaintiff filed his first amended complaint, see [26]. That complaint asserted claims under \u00a7 1983 for violation of Plaintiff's First Amendment and due process rights, conspiracy to deprive him of those rights, and a host of state law claims. See generally [26.] Defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss, [33], which this Court granted on February 13, 2018, [46]. The Court's memorandum opinion and order also granted Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint by March 13, 2018, [46], which Plaintiff did, see [52]. Defendants have again moved to dismiss the entire complaint [54], and the Court now resolves that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Violation of the First Amendment (Count I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court previously dismissed Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claim because it concluded that it could not plausibly infer that his speech was a motivating factor for the Defendants' allegedly retaliatory actions. Specifically, the fact that approximately nine months passed between his protected speech and when Defendants allegedly instituted a sham investigation against him was too great a gap for the Court to plausibly infer causation between the protected speech and Defendant's acts. See [46, at 7-12.] Consequently, the Court dismissed the claim with leave to file an amended complaint consistent with that ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff now alleges several other instances of retaliatory conduct between his protected speech during period from October 2013 to June 2014 and March 2015 when Defendants placed him on leave and initiated a sham investigation. As noted above, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants: (1) purposely delayed his order of specialty body armor, (2) denied two separate requests to move his residence, and (3) denied Plaintiff's request in January 2015 to have a \"moving radar\" installed in his vehicle. [52, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 22, 23.] Additionally, Plaintiff further alleges that in August 2014, a co-worker informed him that \"he needed to 'stay under the radar' because the Defendants were watching him.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.] The co-worker also informed him that Defendants had been sending emails to each other about him for several months. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As the Court previously explained, a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of First Amendment retaliation under \u00a7 1983 requires a plaintiff to show (1) that his speech was constitutionally protected; (2) that he has suffered a deprivation that is likely to deter free speech; and (3) his speech was \"at least a motivating factor in the employer's actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20835353\">\n    2018 WL 835353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   While conceding the first element, Defendants maintain that these new allegations of retaliatory conduct do not constitute a deprivation likely to deter free speech and that even with these new allegations, the Court may not infer that Plaintiff's protected conduct led to the alleged retaliation. The Court address each contention in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Adverse Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Retaliation need not be monstrous to be actionable under the First\n   Amendment; it need merely create the potential for chilling employee speech on matters of public concern.\"\n   <em>\n    DeGuiseppe v.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Bart v.

For example, Defendants point out that none of the actions left Plaintiff worse off, but merely maintained the status quo. But it is easy to see why being forced to wear an uncomfortable vest for several extra months without explanation, being unable to move to the area of one's choice, and being denied the proper equipment to conduct the majority of one's work would negatively affect an individual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Plaintiff has alleged more than just these\n   few, albeit petty actions, Plaintiff has alleged a series of slights that culminated in an sham investigation, a lengthy suspension, and the subsequent reduction of his duties. The more difficult question, and the one to which the Court now turns, is whether Plaintiff's new allegations allow the Court to infer that the entire string of allegedly retaliatory actions, and especially the allegedly sham investigation and what followed, were at least partially motivated by Plaintiff's protected speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Furthermore, Defendants argue that the new allegations are too sporadic and minor to \"constitute a 'sustained pattern' of retaliation 'stretching back in time when Plaintiff initially made these reports.' \" [55, at 10 (citing [46], at 11).] Finally, Defendants contend that the fact that almost six months passed between the co-worker's comment to Plaintiff and the final instance of retaliation makes it too implausible for the comment to support Plaintiff's theory that Defendants were planning to relate against him. In support of that argument, however, Defendants cite only cases that were decided on summary judgment. [See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 (collecting cases).] None of Defendants' cases address whether such a comment, combined with an alleged pattern of abuse, is enough to survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court concludes that the new allegations of retaliatory acts, combined with the new allegation regarding a purported vendetta against Plaintiff, raise Plaintiff's allegations of retaliation above a \"speculative level.\"\n   <em>\n    Concentra Health Servs., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5703493\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/773/#p776\">\n    496 F.3d at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Likewise, while the fact that six months past between the warning from Plaintiff's coworker and the \"sham investigation\" gives the Court pause, that allegation combined with the other allegations plead facts beyond suspicious circumstances and timing that allow this Court to draw a reasonable inference at this stage.

The Parties dispute whether the Court may take judicial notice of Exhibits A &amp; B attached to the Defendants' motion. \"A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) can be based only on the complaint itself, documents attached to the complaint, documents that are critical to the complaint and referred to in it, and information that is subject to proper judicial notice.\"\n    <em>\n     Geinosky v.

Defendants assert that the Court may take judicial notice of the two exhibits because the existence of each is referenced in the complaint. [60, at 2.] However, the exception to which Defendants refer-\"documents * * * [that] are referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are central to his claim\"-is \"aimed at cases interpreting, for example, a contract.\"\n    <em>\n     188 LLC v.

That is not the case here. Here, the documents at issue are not contracts or other documents requiring the Court's interpretation that are critical to Plaintiff's claims. Rather, it appears that Defendants are attempting to refute the assertions in Plaintiff's complaint by introducing evidence showing Plaintiff's own allegedly unconstitutional behavior to demonstrate Plaintiff's allegations are not credible. But questions of credibility belong to the ultimate trier of fact and should not be resolved on a motion to dismiss. Consequently, the Court concludes that it cannot consider those documents without converting the instant motion to a motion for summary judgment, which it declines to do.\n    <em>\n     Geinosky\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752221\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/743/\">\n     675 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    745 n.1.
