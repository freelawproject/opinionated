Specifically, Monsanto contended that: (i) the plaintiffs' claims are expressly preempted by federal law; (ii) the plaintiffs' claims are impliedly preempted; (iii) the evidence is insufficient to support a jury verdict for the plaintiffs on their failure-to-warn claims; and (iv) the evidence is\n   insufficient to support a punitive damages award. The Court previously informed the parties that Monsanto's motion on these issues would be denied; this ruling now explains why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Monsanto also seeks summary judgment against one specific plaintiff, Gebeyehou, for the additional reason that his claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The Court will rule on that motion following the completion of supplemental briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court previously rejected Monsanto's argument that the plaintiffs' failure-to-warn claims are expressly preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hardeman v.

States are permitted to impose their own pesticide labeling requirements as long as those requirements are not \"in addition to or different from\" those mandated by FIFRA. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(b).

The phrase \"widespread and commonly recognized\" comes not from the misbranding provision, \u00a7 136(q)(1)(G), but rather from the cross-referenced registration provision, \u00a7 136a(d). When determining whether a pesticide should be registered for restricted versus general use, the EPA must consider the effects a pesticide will have \"when applied in accordance with its directions for use, warnings and cautions and for the uses for which it is registered, or for one or more of such uses, or in accordance with a\n   <em>\n    widespread and commonly recognized\n   </em>\n   practice.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 136a(d)(1)(B), (C) (emphasis added). But while a label must specify a product's use classification, nothing in the statute suggests that warnings should be limited to those relevant to the \"widespread and commonly recognized\" uses of a product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20156.10\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 156.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(ix). Indeed, FIFRA's misbranding provision states that labels must include health warnings \"\n   <em>\n    together with\n   </em>\n   any requirements imposed under section 136a(d).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20136\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q)(1)(G) (emphasis added). California law is not preempted by the additional federal requirement that pesticide labels specify their use classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Monsanto argues that even if the plaintiffs' claims are not expressly preempted, they are barred under the doctrine of impossibility preemption. Relying on a trio of cases involving the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Monsanto contends that the plaintiffs' warning and design defect claims are preempted because Monsanto cannot change Roundup's label or design without first obtaining approval from the EPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mut.

Moreover, in reversing the lower court's conclusion that the plaintiffs' claims had been preempted, the Court necessarily rejected the possibility of implied preemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p447\">\n    544 U.S. at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p447\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the majority decision \"comports with th[e] Court's increasing reluctance to expand federal statutes beyond their terms through doctrines of implied pre-emption\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Even if not foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Bates\n   </em>\n   , Monsanto's argument fails on the merits. In relying on a line of FDCA cases, Monsanto elides a critical aspect of FIFRA's statutory scheme: FIFRA allows states to regulate or ban pesticides that have been federally approved. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p447\">\n    544 U.S. at 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p447\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"a state agency may ban the sale of a pesticide if it finds, for instance, that one of the pesticide's label-approved uses is unsafe\"). Monsanto acknowledges this fact, but nevertheless argues that while California can ban Roundup, it cannot impose any duties that might indirectly prevent Monsanto from selling Roundup in California (even temporarily).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mut.

But if California can stop Monsanto from selling Roundup entirely, surely it can impose state-law duties that might require Monsanto to seek EPA approval before selling an altered version of Roundup in California. By contrast, nothing in the FDCA allows a state to ban a drug.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zogenix, Inc. v.

Monsanto relies almost entirely on the epidemiological data to make this claim. Even granting Monsanto's argument that epidemiology provides the most reliable evidence of causation, it is certainly not the only evidence of causation in this case. Moreover, the epidemiology is far from undisputed. To take just one example, the De Roos (2003) study supports a conclusion that glyphosate is a risk factor for NHL, yet Monsanto fails to mention it in its motion. Monsanto cannot prevail on a motion for summary judgment by simply ignoring large swaths of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It is difficult to see how there could be no evidence that the risks of glyphosate were \"knowable\" given the Court's denial of Monsanto's motion to exclude the plaintiffs' causation experts. Of course, the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   causation inquiry is not identical to the question of whether there was a \"known or knowable\" risk from glyphosate. But the Court previously determined that the plaintiffs' experts offered reliable opinions that glyphosate causes NHL, and they did so relying almost entirely on scientific evidence that existed when the plaintiffs were using Roundup. Moreover, the plaintiffs have presented a great deal of evidence that Monsanto has not taken a responsible, objective approach to the safety of its product. Thus, assuming a jury finding that Roundup causes NHL, there is sufficient evidence for the plaintiffs to argue that Monsanto could have reached this conclusion on its own had it investigated the issue responsibly and objectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For similar reasons, the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence at summary judgment to support a punitive damages award against Monsanto. Although the evidence that Roundup causes cancer is quite equivocal, there is strong evidence from which a jury could conclude that Monsanto does not particularly care whether its product is in fact giving people cancer, focusing instead on manipulating public opinion and undermining anyone who raises genuine and legitimate concerns about the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
