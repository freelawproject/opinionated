Before the Court is AFSCME's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n  <em>\n   or\n  </em>\n  , Motion for Summary Judgment (doc. 24).

Oregon's Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act (\"PECBA\") gives certain public employees the right to unionize and to elect an exclusive representative. AFSCME is such an exclusive representative and PECBA requires it to also represent the interests of non-members during collective bargaining negotiations. To avoid free-riders, the Act authorizes public employers to deduct a fraction of full union dues, often called \"agency fees,\" from non-members to cover the costs of general collective bargaining representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs filed an action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   challenging the constitutionality of these fees. They argued that Defendants were violating their First Amendment rights by forcing compulsory agency fee payments to AFSCME as a condition of their employment, even though Plaintiffs did not belong to this union and did not wish to subsidize the union's activities. Plaintiffs sought (i) a declaratory judgment that all pertinent statutes, rules, regulations, and collective-bargaining agreements that compel agency fees violate the First Amendment; (ii) an injunction against activities that violate the declaratory judgment; and (iii) compensatory damages or restitution from AFSCME for the wrongfully seized agency fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While this case was pending, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in\n   <em>\n    Janus v.

Instead, the Ninth Circuit's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Clement\n   </em>\n   is more akin to the traditional equitable basis for extending good faith than to a formalistic analysis that would require an analogous tort over 130 years ago. To warrant good faith, the\n   <em>\n    Clement\n   </em>\n   court explained that the towing company \"did its best to follow the law ... the tow was authorized by the police department [and it was] permissible under both local ordinance and state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Clement\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556198\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/1090/#p1092\">\n    518 F.3d at 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

AFSCME used a state law procedure in violation of the First Amendment to deduct a portion of each non-member's paycheck for the benefit of AFSCME and to the detriment of Plaintiffs. And what makes AFSCME's action a \u00a7 1983 constitutional issue is its use of the Oregon statutes authorizing the deduction of agency fees from employees. The Oregon statutes provide the necessary link between AFSCME's actions and the \"under color of any statute\" requirement of a \u00a7 1983 claim. Had AFSCME's actions occurred prior to \u00a7 1983's enactment in 1871, then, Plaintiffs could have brought their action under an abuse of process theory. The state-of-mind requirement for an abuse of process claim is malice and acting in good faith would preclude the claim because it would negate the malice requirement.
