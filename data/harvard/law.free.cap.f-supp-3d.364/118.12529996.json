Gen. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 121 ; 131M.

On January 10, 2017, the Attorney General moved to dismiss. (Docket No. 22). On March 14, 2018, this Court denied the motion in part, and granted it in part.\n   <em>\n    Pullman Arms v.

Attorney General Healey noted at the hearing on this motion, and the Court agrees, that having the same counsel may mitigate the danger that Plaintiffs' rights will not be protected in the state proceedings.
