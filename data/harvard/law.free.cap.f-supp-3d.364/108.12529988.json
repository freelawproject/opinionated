On April 19, 2016,\n   Plaintiff's employment was transferred to Wind Gap for which she performed similar home healthcare services as a Registered Nurse. Plaintiff was paid $ 50.00 per hour for her services and was never a salaried employee. She regularly worked more than 40 hours per week for both Binnacle and Wind Gap but contends that she was never paid overtime. Plaintiff estimates that she is owed in excess of $ 100,000 in unpaid overtime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2017, Plaintiff signed a Confidentiality &amp; Non-Disclosure Agreement with Wind Gap. As consideration, Plaintiff was notified that the Agreement was \"part of [Plaintiff's] 'at-will' employment / engagement relationship with the Company.\" In addition, Plaintiff was promised \"for good and valuable consideration beyond any wages and/or compensation due [Plaintiff] in the amount of One thousand Dollars and no cents ($ 1,000.000).\" The Agreement provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   This Agreement affects my ability to participate in class and collective actions. Specifically, both the Company and I agree to bring any dispute (except either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy but only upon the ground that the award to which the party may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without such relief, including but not limited to enforcing the provisions of paragraph 8 above) in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others. There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (\"Class Action Waiver\"). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, disputes regarding the validity, enforceability or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class or collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class and/or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. I understand that I shall not be retaliated against, discipline or threated with discipline as a result of exercising any rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act by the filing of or participating in a class or collective action in any forum. However, the Company may lawfully seek enforcement of this Agreement and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims. The Class Action Waiver shall be severable in any case in which the dispute is filed as an individual action and severance is necessary to ensure that the individual action proceeds in arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Docket No. 7-1, \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Legal Standard\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Written arbitration agreements are governed pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 301.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Circuit City Stores, Inc. v.

As noted above, it can be argued that the \"Class Action Waiver\" is exactly what it says it is-a class action waiver. Further, the Agreement goes on to read that \"the Company and I agree to bring any dispute ... in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others.\" (Docket No. 7-2, at 2). On the one hand, this passage might be read to require any claims that the parties agree to bring in arbitration must be on an individual basis only. On the other hand, it might be read to require the parties to bring any dispute in arbitration\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   on an individual basis only. Additional passages belie the first interpretation and bolster the second. For instance, the Agreement notes that \"[i]n any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class or collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class and/or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188858\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/1/#p24\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This provision implies that arbitration is at least mandatory with respect to class claims and consequently undermines the first interpretation. The final sentence of the relevant section also supports the later interpretation, which implies that the agreement to arbitrate applies to individual claims and not only class actions: \"The Class Action Waiver shall be severable in any case in which the dispute is filed as an individual action and severance is necessary to ensure that the individual\n   action proceeds in arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188858\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/1/#p24\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because I must construe the agreement with a presumption favoring arbitration and because this agreement does not clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise, I find that Plaintiff's individual claims fall within the ambit of the arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    4.

Thus, lurking in the background of this case is the possibility of fraudulent inducement. Since Plaintiff does not present this argument, this Court will not address it.
