Russell, Senior Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant Element Transportation, LLC's\n   (\"Element Transportation\") Motion for Summary Judgment. [R. 98.] Plaintiffs Gale Carter and Forbes Hayes (hereinafter \"Plaintiffs\") responded, [R. 110], and Element Transportation replied, [R. 113]. Also before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a Sur-Reply. [R. 119.] This matter is now ripe for adjudication. For the reasons stated herein, Element Transportation's Motion for Summary Judgment, [R. 98], is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a Sur-Reply, [R. 119], is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arises out of Gale Carter and Forbes Hayes's previous employment as truck drivers for Paschall Truck Lines, Inc. (\"PTL\"). In short, Element Financial Corp. (\"EFC\") leased tractor trailers to Plaintiffs who then subleased the tractor trailers and their driving services to PTL. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 98-4 at 6-7 (Carter's Responses to Request for Admissions); R. 98-6 at 6 (Hayes's Responses to Request for Admissions).] Plaintiffs claim that this arrangement was represented to them as a \"Lease-Purchase Program.\" [R. 103 at 16 (Amended Complaint).] Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that as a condition of their employment for PTL, PTL required Plaintiffs to lease tractors from EFC, and, under the lease agreement with EFC, Plaintiffs could only drive for PTL. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.] If they did not drive for PTL, the Plaintiffs claim that they would default on their Lease Agreements, \"subjecting Plaintiffs to an acceleration clause whereby Plaintiffs would be required to pay the entire balance of the lease immediately.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9] However, this motion does not concern the substance of Carter and Hayes's claims. Rather, it involves the question of who should be held liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 20, 2015, Gale Carter entered in to an Individual Program Lease Agreement with EFC. [R. 98-3 at 2 (Carter Individual Program Lease Agreement).] That agreement terminated in December of 2015. [R. 98-4 at 7.] On March 18, 2016, Forbes Hayes entered into an Individual Program Lease Agreement with EFC. [R. 98-5 at 2 (Hays Individual Program Lease Agreement).] Hays discontinued his lease agreement in June of 2016. [R. 110-2 at 3 (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts); R. 98-1 at 6.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 30, 2016, EFC became Element Financial, LLC. [R. 110-11 at 3 (Certificate of Conversion).] Element Financial, LLC continued to operate the commercial and vendor leasing business it had previously operated as EFC. [R. 110-2 at 4; R. 98-1 at 6.] On September 19, 2016, a transaction occurred between Element Financial, LLC and Element Transportation, LLC, another subsidiary of Element Financial, LLC's parent company-Element Financial Corporation. [R. 110-19 at 67:17-21 (Bradley Rowse Deposition); R. 110-2 at 4; R. 98-1 at 7.] Plaintiffs refer to a different agreement than Element Transportation, but both parties claim the document to which they refer represents the transaction of September 19, 2016. Plaintiffs provided the Asset Purchase Agreement as evidence that Element Financial, LLC transferred the trucks and the rights to receive lease payments on those trucks to Element Transportation on that date. [R. 110-2 at 4 (citing R. 110-14).] Element Transportation provided the SUBI Sale Agreement, of the same date, as evidence that Element Financial, LLC sold Element Transportation \"a special unit of beneficial interest in certain vehicles held in trust, including the vehicles previously leased by the Plaintiffs.\" [R. 98-1 at 7 (citing R. 98-8).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 3, 2016, Element Financial Corporation split to form ECN Capital Corp. and Element Fleet Management Corporation. [R. 110-19 at 49:12-18; R. 98-1 at 7.] As a part of the split, Element Financial, LLC became ECN Financial,\n   LLC (ECN). [R. 110-19 at 49:12-18; R. 98-1 at 7; R. 110-2 at 5.] Plaintiffs states that, with that name change, ECN Financial, LLC was divested from Element Fleet Management Corporation and became a subsidiary of ECN Capital Corp. [R. 110-2 at 5.] Element Transportation, on the other hand, became a subsidiary of Element Fleet Management Corporation. [R. 110-19 at 40:16-41:7.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 30, 2016, Element Transportation assigned its interests in the trucks and accompanying leases to ECN Financial, LLC as interim assignee and 19th Capital Group, LLC as assignee. [R. 98-9 at 1 (Assignment Agreement).] In exchange, Element Transportation received an approximately 49.9995 percent equity interest in 19th Capital Group and a loan receivable-with an initial balance of approximately $740 million. [R. 110-19 at 67:24-69:2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 19, 2017, Gale Carter and Forbes Hayes, on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated, filed the First Amended Complaint against PTL, ECN (as successor to EFC), and Element Transportation, LLC (as successor to ECN). [R. 19.] On October 12, 2018, Element Transportation filed the Motion for Summary Judgment that is currently before the Court. [R. 98.] It raises the question of whether Element Transportation should be considered a successor in liability to Element Financial, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, reveals \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

First, Element Transportation reiterates that it did not have notice of Plaintiffs' claims and argues that it would be inequitable to hold Element Transportation liable for the alleged unlawful acts of Element Financial, LLC when it did not have notice of those acts. [R. 113 at 2.] Specifically, Element Transportation quotes the following line from\n   <em>\n    Golden State\n   </em>\n   as support: \"Since the successor\n   <em>\n    must have notice before liability can be imposed\n   </em>\n   , 'his potential liability for remedying the unfair labor practices is a matter which can be reflected in the price he pays for the business, or he may secure an indemnity clause in the sales contract which will indemnify him for liability arising from the seller's unfair labor practices.' \" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Golden State Bottling Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715440\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/168/#p173\">\n    414 U.S. at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715440\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/168/#p173\">\n    94 S.Ct. 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).] Secondly, Element Transportation distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   from the matter at hand by stressing that, unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , the Plaintiffs in this matter never expressed concerns about potential violations of the federal forced labor statute. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Third, Element Transportation asserts that the only evidence provided by Plaintiffs for the proposition that the officers at Element Financial, LLC were the same as the officers at Element Transportation is the Asset Purchase Agreement, in which Michael Beland signed on behalf of both the seller and the buyer. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.] However, Element Transportation states that this evidence falls short of being sufficient. Furthermore, Element Transportation argues that the \"interplay between the terms of Plaintiffs' Lease Agreements with EFC and the terms of their ICS Agreements with PTL\" is not adequate to prove that Element Transportation continued the alleged unlawful labor scheme because Plaintiffs did not show that \"PTL continued to use the same terms in its ICS Agreement\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that Element Transportation continued EFC's relationship with PTL.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Finally, Element Transportation argues that it did not assume Element Financial, LLC's liabilities in Section 2.2 of the Asset Purchase Agreement because \"Section 2.2 applies only to future liabilities,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those that arise or accrue after the asset purchase is completed.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Out of the tangled mass of notice arguments strewn before the Court, three main issues rise to the surface: (1) the weight of lack of notice in a successor liability analysis, (2) the evidence regarding\n   crossover of officers from Element Financial, LLC to Element Transportation, and (3) contractual interpretation of the agreements between the parties. First, the Court recognizes that the parties take a different perspective on the weight of notice as opposed to the other nine\n   <em>\n    MacMillan\n   </em>\n   factors. Neither perspective is necessarily incorrect. While the Supreme Court seemingly made notice a requisite for successor liability in the quote provided by Element Transportation, the Sixth Circuit stated that the nine\n   <em>\n    MacMillan\n   </em>\n   factors \"are not in themselves the test for successor liability\" and \"all nine factors will not be applicable to each case.\"\n   <em>\n    Cobb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046513\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/543/#p554\">\n    452 F.3d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although other circuits have labelled notice as critical to the successor liability analysis,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wheeler v. Snyder Buick, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1591153\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/794/1228/#p1236\">\n    794 F.2d 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1236 (7th Cir. 1986), the Sixth Circuit's stance on this matter remains unclear. However, notice's role in this case becomes more transparent when one examines the actual evidence before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Under the second issue, the Court notes that the only evidence provided for the assertion that the officers of Element Financial, LLC were the same as the officers of Element Transportation is the signature of one individual, Michael Beland, on behalf of both entities.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Harlan Coal\n   </em>\n   , the Plaintiffs in this matter provided no evidence regarding Beland's role in the negotiations, nor is there any further circumstantial evidence that would allow the Court to infer that he had knowledge of any unfair labor practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under the third issue, the parties disagree over whether certain provisions from the SUBI Sale Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement serve as proof that Element Transportation did or did not agree to assume the liability of the seller. As Plaintiffs emphasized in their Response, federal courts have generally held that a limitation of liability provision in an asset transfer agreement \"does not control when the federal standard for successor liability is at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250966\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/77/660/\">\n    77 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   692 (citing\n   <em>\n    Teed v.

In comparison to the binding case law on the matter, this amounts to the \"mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position,\" which is insufficient to prove a genuine issue for trial.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 256,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p249\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Court holds that the interests of the defendant-employer weigh against successor liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Interests of the Plaintiff-Employee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Element Transportation's second argument within its Motion for Summary Judgment is that Element Financial, LLC continued operating as ECN after the asset purchase and it has sufficient assets to pay the relief Plaintiffs seek on their federal forced labor statute claim. [R. 98-1 at 12.] Thus, Element Transportation concludes that the interests of the plaintiff weigh against successor liability. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiffs respond that the fact that Element Financial, LLC still exists and may be able to provide relief does not preclude a finding of liability against Element Transportation. [R. 110 at 22.] Furthermore, Plaintiffs assert that both Element Financial, LLC and Element Transportation may be held liable for the predecessor's bad acts under the doctrine of successor liability. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Although Plaintiffs never acknowledge \"the interests of the plaintiff-employee\" and how it should weigh in the consideration of successor liability, [\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   R. 110], it seems that Plaintiffs have an interest in being able to provide their truck driving services free from \"threats of serious harm\" and to be compensated properly. However, as explained above, Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence that Element Transportation knew of or was involved such threats. Furthermore, the parties do not dispute that ECN is solvent and may be able to compensate Plaintiffs. Thus, it would not necessarily be against Plaintiff's interests if Element Transportation was dismissed from this matter because Plaintiffs could still seek compensation from at least ECN. Considering that Plaintiffs brought this claim against Element Transportation, it would seem illogical to conclude that Plaintiffs' interests do not weigh in favor of successor liability. However, the lack of evidence and the availability of defendants to compensate Plaintiffs balances the scales. Thus, this prong weighs neutrally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiffs' Other Arguments Regarding the\n    <em>\n     MacMillan\n    </em>\n    Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In Plaintiffs' Response, after discussing Element Transportation's first two arguments, Plaintiffs briefly argue the application of the remaining\n   <em>\n    MacMillan\n   </em>\n   factors. First, in reference to the third factor, Plaintiffs argue that Element Transportation utilized the same \"plant\" as Element Financial, LLC because the lease agreements of both companies identify the same address as the principle place of business. [R. 110 at 24.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Element Transportation responds that it did not have a physical address, rather the address listed on the agreement was simply a mailing address. [R. 113 at 7.] As neither party presents sufficient evidence to ultimately prove whether Element Transportation utilizes a physical location, the Court finds that this factor weighs neutrally. Furthermore, as Element Transportation is not a manufacturer, it is not clear that this factor is relevant to this matter in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Finnerty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229597\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/624/642/#p657\">\n    624 F.Supp.2d at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding\n   that the relevance of this factor was \"not apparent\" because neither defendant \"operated a plant producing the goods that were the subject of the Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Secondly, under the fourth factor, Plaintiffs contend that Element Transportation continued the business operations of Element Financial, LLC because Element Transportation continued leasing trucks to individuals under the same lease terms and with the same \"Element\" logo on the agreement as Element Financial, LLC. [R. 110 at 25.] As evidence, Plaintiffs provide one lease agreement from after the asset purchase in which Element Transportation left every provision the same as Element Financial, LLC's lease agreements, except it changed the lessor name to Element Financial, LLC. [R. 110-8 at 14.] Element Transportation responds that there is no evidence that it provided equipment financing or vehicle fleet leasing to PTL. [R. 113 at 7.] Furthermore, under the fifth, sixth, and seventh factors, Element Transportation contends that it did not have employees or supervisory staff and it did not maintain the same jobs under the same working conditions as Plaintiffs experienced. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] While Plaintiffs' broad argument under the fourth factor seems to weigh in favor of successor liability, Element Transportation's pointed observations under the fifth, sixth, and seventh factors seem to weigh against it. Ultimately, as the parties mainly dispute the issue of notice, the limited discussion and evidence regarding these factors have little to no effect on the determination of successor liability in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Keeping with Federal Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   After arguing the first two prongs of the three-prong successor liability test, i.e., that the interests of the employer and employee both weigh against applying successor liability, Element Transportation concludes its Motion for Summary Judgment by arguing that holding it liable as a successor would not \"further the goals\" of federal policy. [R. 98-1 at 12.] Specifically, Element Transportation quotes a conference report concerning the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) which states: \" Section 1589 is intended to address the increasingly subtle methods of traffickers who place their victims in modern-day slavery, such as where traffickers threaten harm to third persons, restrain their victims without physical violence or injury, or threaten dire consequences by means other than overt violence.\" H.R.

Element Transportation reasons that these goals are not furthered by holding it liable as a successor because PTL and EFC are not traffickers, PTL and EFC did not use \"subtle methods\" to trick Plaintiffs, and \"it strains credulity\" to compare Plaintiffs' contracts with PTL and EFC to \"modern day slavery.\" [R. 98-1 at 13.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Also, Element Transportation argues that the general goals of the successor liability doctrine under federal law are not furthered by holding Element Transportation liable.

Moreover, it did not receive any benefit from the alleged forced labor of any other owner-operators because it was guaranteed those lease payments by Element Financial, LLC \"regardless of whether the owner-operators made any payments on their leases or\n   provided any services to PTL.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing R.110-19 at 71:21-72:14).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In their Response, Plaintiffs first argue that although the federal forced labor statute is mostly commonly applied to situations involving undocumented immigrants being forced into labor or the sex trade, it should not be limited to such circumstances.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that Element Transportation should be punished for benefitting from the unlawful practices by earning $28.4 million in leasing and over $30 million in loan interest because the federal forced labor statute states that \"whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture ... shall be punished ....\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs also imply that not finding Element Transportation liable would violate the policy of successor liability in that it would allow Element Transportation to benefit from continuing the business operations of Element Financial, LLC without holding anyone accountable to the injured employees.

[R. 113 at 6.] Element Transportation agrees that it generated $28.4 million in revenue from lease payments for commercial trucks, however, \"[n]one of this revenue was from Plaintiffs because Plaintiffs' leases had terminated and Plaintiffs had ceased performing work for PTL\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Element Transportation purchased the SUBI assets.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Moreover, Element Transportation contends, once again, that it did not receive any increased lease payment revenue from any owner-operator because of the alleged unlawful labor scheme between EFC and PTL. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Rather, there was a \"seller guarantee to pay EFC the payments due under the lease agreements regardless of whether the owner/operator drivers who signed those agreements made any payments or performed any work.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Lastly, Element Transportation rejects the notion that it receiving interest from 19th Capital is of any probative value because Element\n   Transportation received no revenue from lease payments for commercial trucks after December 30, 2016. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In sum, the parties dispute whether finding Element Transportation liable as a successor to Element Financial, LLC will further the interest of federal policy, both under the federal forced labor statute and the general federal policy behind successor liability.

Although the legislative history quoted by Element Transportation depicts the statute as being directed specifically at human traffickers who place victims in \"modern day slavery,\" the actual text of the statute yields a broader interpretation. The first portion of the statute reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Whoever knowingly provides or obtains the labor or services of a person by any one of, or by any combination of, the following means--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n   </strong>\n   by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, or threats of physical restraint to that person or another person;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to that person or another person\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    (3)\n   </strong>\n   by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or legal process; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    (4)\n   </strong>\n   by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause the person to believe that, if that person did not perform such labor or services, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   shall be punished as provided under subsection (d).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201589\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). In Section (c) of the statute, the term \"serious harm\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   any harm, whether physical or nonphysical, including psychological,\n   <em>\n    financial\n   </em>\n   , or reputational harm, that is sufficiently serious, under all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing labor or services in order to avoid incurring that harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201589\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added). As the Sixth Circuit stated in\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   while interpreting this statute, \"[d]efendants are correct that '[w]hen construing a legislative enactment, [courts] must give effect to the intent of the legislature adopting the statute in question.' But Defendants forget that 'legislative intent should be divined first and foremost from the plain language of the statute,' and 'reference to legislative history is inappropriate when the text of the statute is unambiguous.'\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055364\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/606/#p617\">\n    801 F.3d at 617-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). Thus, Plaintiffs were able to plead their claim under the plain language of the statute, but it remains ambiguous as to whether finding Element Transportation liable as a successor would align with the goals of the federal forced labor statute. As Element Transportation mentioned, the original purpose of the overall Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000 was to \"combat trafficking in persons, a contemporary manifestation of slavery whose victims are predominantly women and children, to ensure just and effective punishment of traffickers, and to protect their victims.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20A.L.R.%20Fed.%202d%20467\">\n    75 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Pub. L.

Furthermore, there is no case law currently available regarding the applicability of successor liability in a case involving the forced labor statute. Thus, it remains uncertain whether a finding of successor liability\n   in this matter would align with the policy goals of the forced labor statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Federal Successor Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As the Sixth Circuit stated in the context of applying successor liability in a Title VII case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Failure to hold a successor employer liable for the discriminatory practices of its predecessor could emasculate the relief provisions of Title VII by leaving the discriminatee without a remedy or with an incomplete remedy.... It is to be emphasized that the equities of the matter favor successor liability because it is the successor who has benefited from the discriminatory employment practices of its predecessor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    MacMillan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"103984\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/503/1086/#p1091\">\n    503 F.2d at 1091-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, failing to hold Element Transportation liable as a successor would not \"emasculate the relief provisions\" of the federal forced labor statute because other defendants remain who may be able to compensate Plaintiffs. Furthermore, \"the equities of the matter\" do not favor successor liability because there is not sufficient evidence that Element Transportation knew of or benefitted from the alleged unlawful labor practices of Element Financial, LLC. Plaintiffs claim that this is a situation in which a parent company attempted to evade liability by transferring interests between subsidiaries. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 110 at 26-27.] However, with no sufficient evidence that Element Transportation was aware of any unlawful labor practices and no dispute that ECN can provide monetary relief, the Court must disagree. This matter does not present a circumstance that aligns with the goals of successor liability under federal common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   After weighing the interests of the employer and employee, as well as the goals of federal policy, the Court finds that the imposition of successor liability upon Element Transportation is inappropriate. Although the second prong seems to weigh neutral, the first and third both weigh against applying successor liability in this circumstance. Perhaps most importantly, it would not be equitable here to find Element Transportation liable when there is little to no evidence it had notice of Plaintiffs' claims and Plaintiffs may still seek relief from Element Transportation's predecessor, ECN. Thus, Element Transportation's Motion for Summary Judgment, [R. 98], as it applies to Count III of the Amended Complaint, is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Count IV: Violations of the Common Law Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Element Transportation also moves for summary judgment on Count IV of Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, which alleges violations of common law unjust enrichment. In addition to federal common law, Element Transportation argues that it is also not liable as a successor under Pennsylvania law, and, therefore, Plaintiffs' claim of unjust enrichment should be dismissed. [R. 98-1 at 14.] The parties do not dispute that Pennsylvania common law applies, as the lease agreements contained a Pennsylvania choice of law provision. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 98-3 at 10; R. 98-5 at 10.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Under Pennsylvania law, \"it is well-established that 'when one company sells or transfers all of its assets to another company, the purchasing or receiving company is not responsible for the debts and liabilities of the selling company simply because it acquired the seller's property.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cont'l Ins.

However, this rule is overcome if it is established that \"(1) the purchaser expressly or implicitly agreed to assume liability, (2) the transaction amounted to a consolidation or merger, (3) the purchasing corporation was merely a continuation of the selling corporation, (4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   the transaction was fraudulently entered into to escape liability, or (5) the transfer was without adequate consideration and no provisions were made for creditors of the selling corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"906646\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/412/320/\">\n    603 A.2d at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As the factors under Pennsylvania law are rather similar to those under federal common law, the parties essentially repeat the arguments from the federal successor liability sections of their briefs. In relation to the five exceptions, Element Transportation argues: (1) the \"SUBI Sale Agreement expressly states that Element Transportation did not assume an[y] of ECN's liabilities,\" (2) Element Transportation split with ECN rather than consolidate or merge, (3) ECN continued its commercial and vendor leasing business after the SUBI sale, (4) Element Transportation and ECN could not have entered into the transaction to escape liability because neither party had any knowledge of Plaintiffs' claims, and (5) Element Transportation paid \"book value\" for the SUBI assets. [R. 98-1 at 14-15.] Plaintiffs' respond that Element Transportation \"explicitly agreed to assume the liabilities of its predecessor\" pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Asset Purchase Agreement. [R. 110 at 30.] Furthermore, Plaintiffs contend that \"during the period it continued the individual truck leasing business, Defendant Element Transportation represented a mere continuation of the individual fleet leasing business ECN Financial ran as EFC.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   First, as the Court explained above, Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence that Element Transportation continued the unfair labor practices of its predecessor. Nor do Plaintiffs provide additional evidence here that Element Transportation was a \"mere continuation\" of ECN. In fact, neither party disputes that ECN continued doing business independently after the asset purchase occurred. [R. 113 at 7; R. 110 at 22; 24.] Thus, the Court finds this argument from Plaintiffs unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Secondly, upon examining the plain meaning of the unambiguous language of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Court disagrees with Plaintiffs' interpretation of Section 2.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 2.2 states that \"Buyer,\" i.e., Element Transportation, \"[f]rom and after the date hereof,\" shall assume \"the following debts, liabilities and obligations of Seller\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (a) All debts, liabilities and obligations of Seller in respect of or relating to the Transferred Assets\n   <em>\n    that arise, accrue or are to be performed as a result of, on or after the date hereof\n   </em>\n   , whether primary or secondary, direct or indirect, known or unknown, fixed or contingent, including, without limitation, any transfer taxes not required to be charged or collected by Seller; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (b) All debts, liabilities and obligations of Seller in respect of relating to the performance or completion of tasks, deliverables, services and other obligations required by the Transferred Contracts,\n   <em>\n    other than debts, liabilities and obligations of Seller arising from the breach of, or failure of Seller to comply, prior to the date hereof\n   </em>\n   , with any representation warranty, covenant or obligation in such Transferred Contracts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [R. 110-14 at 2 (emphasis added).] Both section 2.2(a) and section 2.2(b) state that Element Transportation is to be responsible for liabilities that occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Asset Purchase Agreement, not \"prior to the date hereof.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Thus, the Court finds Plaintiffs' contractual interpretation argument regarding successor liability under\n   Pennsylvania law unconvincing as well. Element Transportation's Motion for Summary Judgment as it pertains to Count IV of Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion for Sur-Reply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Also before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a Sur-Reply. [R. 119.] In support of this motion, Plaintiffs argue that the \"Reply of Defendant Element Transportation contains a substantial inaccuracy that must be addressed for the Court to have a complete understanding of the evidence in the record.\" [R. 119.] Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that Element Transportation incorrectly asserted that Plaintiffs failed to show that Element Transportation continued the unlawful forced-labor scheme between EFC and Paschall Truck Lines.

In\n    <em>\n     Laborers' Pension Fund\n    </em>\n    , it was undisputed that the individual at issue was an officer and director of both the predecessor and successor entities with \"no question\" that the successor had notice of the predecessor's obligations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Laborers' Pension Fund\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5169475\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/455/773/\">\n     455 F.Supp.2d at 782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In fact, the defendants did not challenge the adequacy of notice.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    n.15. Here, Element Transportation questions Beland's title and role as well as notice in general. In\n    <em>\n     Sullivan\n    </em>\n    , unlike the matter at hand, there was evidence that the individual at issue was \"very involved in the day-to-day operations of Alpine\" and he was president of the two alleged successor companies.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sullivan\n    </em>\n    , No.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=09%20Cow.%202329\">\n     09 C 2329\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201575617\">\n     2011 WL 1575617\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The Court notes that Element Transportation also adds to the end of its notice argument: \"Furthermore, as evidenced by its use of identical lease terms, Defendant Element Transportation continued the unfair labor practices of its predecessors, presumably because of the benefits its predecessors derived from same.\" [R. 110 at 20.] The issue with this statement is that Plaintiffs alleged in their Amended Complaint that it was the interplay between ECN's Lease Agreement and PTL's ICS Agreement that allowed the defendants to allegedly \"force the continued labor of Plaintiffs\" by threats of serious financial harm. [\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 103 at 27.] The one piece of evidence provided by Plaintiffs on this matter is a lease agreement between Element Transportation and a lessee, Michael Grant, that was made after the asset purchase. [\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 110-8 at 14.] However, the listed carrier in the agreement is not PTL, rather a company labelled \"ASF.\" [\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 25.] Furthermore, Plaintiffs do not provide the agreement Grant entered with ASF in order to compare it to that of PTL. Thus, Plaintiffs have only provided half of the evidence required to show that Element Transportation continued the unlawful labor practice of trapping truck driving employees with an interlocking lease agreement and ICS agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Plaintiffs also state that \"both entities relied upon Quality Companies, LLC to provide the servicing of the Class A vehicles under the leases it held.\" [R. 110 at 24.] However, the Court finds this irrelevant to the matter of whether both entities utilized the same physical location.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Plaintiffs cite and briefly discuss an article from USA Today showing that \"truckers in lease contracts suffer conditions reminiscent of indentured servitude.\" [\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ] Element Transportation object to the article on hearsay grounds. [R. 113 at 5.] The Court agrees that it is hearsay.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Parker v.
