BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   ICON Entertainment Group Inc. operates Kahoots Gentlemen's Club (\"Kahoots\" or \"Club\"), an adult entertainment club in Columbus, Ohio. Stephanie De Angelis has brought suit against ICON, its individual owners, and 4522 Kenny Road, LLC, an Ohio Limited Liability Company sharing its principal place of business with Kahoots. (ECF No. 10 at 5). Ms. De Angelis alleges that she performed at Kahoots as a dancer from April 2016 to February 2017. (ECF No. 10 at \u00b6\u00b6 30, 32). Ms. De Angelis alleges that Kahoots did not pay its dancers any wages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1). She avers that, instead, Kahoots misclassified all of its dancers as independent contractors, rather than employees, and that the dancers are only compensated through tips from customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 35). She further alleges that at the end of each night, Kahoots took a cut from all tips made by the dancers, and the dancers were required to divide their tips with other employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. De Angelis signed an agreement titled \"Dancer Performance Lease\" (the \"Agreement\") with ICON Entertainment on June 2, 2016. (ECF No. 28-1). The Agreement purported to disclaim any employer-employee relationship between ICON or Kahoots and Ms. De Angelis and instead classify Ms. De Angelis as a performer leasing performance space from Kahoots. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Agreement contains a provision titled \"Mandatory Arbitration/Waiver of Class and Collective Actions/Attorney Fees and Costs\" which reads in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   EXCEPT FOR ANY ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT ARE NOT LEGALLY BARRED BY THIS\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   PARAGRAPH, ANY CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE, OR CLAIM (IN THIS PARAGRAPH 21, COLLECTIVELY \"CLAIM\") ARISING OUT OF THIS LEASE OR OUT OF ENTERTAINER PERFORMING AND/OR WORKING AT THE CLUB AT ANY TIME, WHETHER CONTRACTUAL, IN TORT, OR BASED UPON COMMON LAW OR STATUTE, SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION HELD PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (THE \"FAA\").

In\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that such a delegation provision is \"simply an additional, antecedent agreement that the party seeking arbitration asks the federal court to enforce, and the FAA operates on this additional arbitration agreement just as it does on any other.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Agreement's delegation provision reads as follows: \"\n   <strong>\n    THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES OVER THE VALIDITY AND/OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY PART OF THIS LEASE, INCLUDING THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.\n   </strong>\n   \" (ECF No. 28-1 at 4, \u00b6 21A). Ms. De Angelis argues that the delegation clause is not clear and unmistakable. Additionally, Ms. De Angelis argues that the arbitration clause does not cover the dispute at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Plaintiff challenges the contract as follows: (1) the delegation clause is not clear and unmistakable; (2) the arbitration agreement prevents the Plaintiff from effectively vindicating her rights; (3) the arbitration agreement is void for lack of mutual assent; (4) the claims alleged here \"are outside the scope of the arbitration agreement\"; (5) non signatories to the agreement cannot enforce the arbitration clause; (6) the arbitration agreement fails for lack of consideration; (7) the arbitration agreement is an attempt at impermissible waiver of rights under the FLSA and the Ohio Constitution; (8) leases cannot support agreements to arbitrate under Ohio law; (9) \"the provisions seeking costs are invalid and illegal\"; and (10) the arbitration agreement is void as unconscionable. (ECF No. 34 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In addition to challenging the arbitration agreement, Ms. De Angelis has argued that this Court cannot dismiss Defendants because they are jointly and severally liable as co-conspirators in\n   <em>\n    Doe 1, et al. v. VM3015 Inc., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:18-cv-443 (S.D. Ohio 2018) and that this Court should rule on conditional certification prior to ruling on Defendants' instant motion. This Court rejects both arguments. As this Court previously ruled in\n   <em>\n    De Angelis v. Nolan Enterprises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:17-cv-926 (S.D. Ohio 2017), Ms. De Angelis has offered no cases to support her argument that Kahoots's alleged role in an entirely different case should inform the determination of the validity and applicability of the arbitration agreement. This is particularly true where, as here, the Defendants in the\n   <em>\n    VM3015\n   </em>\n   litigation are not defendants here. As to conditional certification, this Court previously held that it would consider dispositive motions before addressing conditional class certification in the interests of efficiency and judicial economy. See\n   <em>\n    De Angelis v. Nolan Enterprises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:17-cv-926 (S.D. Ohio 2017) (ECF No. 55 at 4 n.1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Challenges to the Delegation Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Only two of Ms. De Angelis's arguments are specific to the delegation clause: first,\n   that Defendants have not specifically identified a delegation clause in the Agreement, and second, that the delegation clause is not clear and unmistakable. The Defendants have specifically identified a delegation clause. They have pointed to Paragraph 21(A) of the Agreement, which states in relevant part: \"\n   <strong>\n    THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES OVER THE VALIDITY AND/OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY PART OF THIS LEASE, INCLUDING THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.\n   </strong>\n   \" (ECF No. 28 at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, Ms. De Angelis alleges that this delegation provision is not a clear and unmistakable delegation of questions of arbitrability. Plaintiff is incorrect. The delegation provision in the Agreement between Plaintiff and Kahoots is similar to the provision that the Supreme Court found clear and unmistakable in\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   . There, the provision read, \"[t]he Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.\"\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    561 U.S. at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Archer &amp; White Sales, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623276\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/524/#p529\">\n    139 S.Ct. 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623276\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/524/#p529\">\n    202 L.Ed.2d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019). The delegation clause here states: \"\n   <strong>\n    THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES OVER THE VALIDITY AND/OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY PART OF THIS LEASE, INCLUDING THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.\n   </strong>\n   \" (ECF No. 28 at 8). Thus, Ms. De Angelis must arbitrate any challenges to the validity or enforceability of the arbitration clause. Ms. De Angelis has challenged the application of the arbitration agreement to her state constitutional claims, argued that the arbitration agreement makes her unable effectively to vindicate her rights, raised several challenges to the arbitration agreement based on contract law, and challenged the applicability of the arbitration agreement to nonsignatories. These challenges pertain to the enforceability or validity of the arbitration agreement, and therefore, these challenges must be arbitrated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff argues that her Ohio minimum wage claims are based on the Ohio Constitution and that the arbitration agreement does not cover state constitutional claims. (ECF No. 34 at 19). This challenge pertains to whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable as to the Ohio minimum wage claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff argues that despite the delegation clause, this Court must also consider Plaintiff's effective vindication challenge to the arbitration agreement. The effective vindication doctrine voids \"arbitration agreements that 'operat[e]...as a prospective waiver of a party's right to pursue statutory remedies.' \"\n   <em>\n    Am. Express Co. v.

Archer &amp; White Sales, Inc.\n   </em>\n   An effective vindication challenge is a challenge to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement. After\n   <em>\n    Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer &amp; White Sales, Inc\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   , these challenges are heard by the arbitrator where, as here, the parties' agreement includes a delegation clause. Ms. De Angelis's effective vindication challenge must, therefore, be raised before the arbitrator in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ms. De Angelis's additional contract challenges are for the arbitrator to decide. When there is a delegation clause, challenges to the overall contract or to the arbitration agreement do not pertain to the validity of the delegation clause and must be submitted to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center, W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    561 U.S. at 71-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ms. De Angelis's challenges based on mutual assent, lack of consideration, and unconscionability relate to the arbitration agreement, not to the delegation clause. Nowhere in Plaintiff's briefing of those issues does she even mention the delegation clause. Ms. De Angelis also argues that the arbitration agreement is impermissible under the FLSA, the Ohio Constitution, and the Ohio statute prohibiting arbitration of \"controversies involving the title to or the possession of real estate.\" These challenges are all challenges to the enforceability of the arbitration clause and therefore fall within the delegation clause of the arbitration agreement. Thus, these challenges are for the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff has also argued that nonsignatories to the Agreement cannot be bound by the arbitration clause. Whether such a challenge must be decided by the Court or an arbitrator is a closer question. Some courts have found that a delegation clause does not clearly and unmistakably show that Plaintiffs agreed to arbitrate arbitrability with nonparties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Republic of Iraq v.

The arbitration agreement clearly provides for attorney's fees\n   and costs where, as here, one party must take action to enforce the arbitration agreement. Such provisions typically are enforceable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cook v.

The parties' delegation clause requires that Ms. De Angelis's challenges to the validity of the arbitration agreement be submitted to an arbitrator. It is possible that the arbitrator would find the arbitration agreement invalid. While the delegation clause would still have required the parties to resolve such challenges through arbitration, it would make little sense to grant attorney's fees when the validity of the arbitration agreement has yet to be determined.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook v.
