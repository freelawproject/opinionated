Presently before the Court is St. Jude's \"Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint[,]\" filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (the \"Motion\").

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   St. Jude manufacturers a variety of medical devices, including the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 16-Channel IPG Spinal Cord Stimulator Catalogue Number 3789, Lot Number 4699346 (hereinafter, \"the SCS device\"). (D.I. 19 (hereinafter, \"First Amended Complaint\" or \"FAC\") at \u00b6 7) The SCS device is implanted in patients suffering from chronic lower back and lower extremity pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2001, following the submission of a premarket approval (\"PMA\") application and review, the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") issued an approval for the commercial distribution of the Genesis and Eon Family of Neurostimulation (IPG) Systems, manufactured by St. Jude. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In March 2014, the FDA issued an approval to change the name of a device in this family, the Eon Mini IPG, to the Protege Model 3789 (i.e., the SCS device). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mrs. Freed has suffered from chronic lower back and left lower extremity pain since before October 17, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17) She has received various surgical and non-surgical treatments providing only modest overall relief of her pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On or about July 14, 2014, Mrs. Freed underwent a trial placement of an SCS device. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18) A St. Jude representative was present during the procedure, and this representative told Mrs. Freed that she would be \"very happy\" with the SCS device. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mrs. Freed's physician subsequently recommended that Mrs. Freed undergo surgery to have an SCS device permanently implanted for management of her chronic pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After conducting internet research (including on St. Jude's website) regarding the SCS device and alternative devices, Plaintiffs decided that Mrs. Freed would proceed with permanent implantation of the SCS device in her body. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 17, 2014, Mrs. Freed underwent the implantation procedure at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19) Dr. Kennedy Yalamanchili surgically implanted the neurostimulator and battery components of the SCS device in the soft tissues of Mrs. Freed's left buttocks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A St. Jude representative was present at Christiana Hospital during the procedure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, Mrs. Freed met regularly with representative(s) of St. Jude and her physician(s) regarding the SCS device's performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On or about June 12, 2015, Mrs. Freed underwent further exploratory and fusion surgery on her lumbar spine by Dr. Yalamanchili at Christiana Hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21) Shortly thereafter, Dr. Yalamanchili prescribed the use of a bone growth stimulator to assist the healing process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Mrs. Freed began using the bone stimulator, she experienced discomfort in her left buttocks where the neurostimulator and battery components of the SCS device had been implanted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22) The discomfort progressed such that the SCS device began giving off severely painful electrical shocks and a burning sensation throughout her left buttocks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mrs. Freed stopped using the SCS device. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On August 5, 2015 she went to the Emergency Department at the Easton Hospital in Easton, Maryland due to persistent severe burning pain in her left buttocks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mrs. Freed spoke to a St. Jude representative present at the Emergency Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mrs. Freed then consulted with Dr. Yalamanchili and a St. Jude representative, and a medical decision was made to surgically remove the SCS device. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23) On August 17, 2015, Dr. Yalamanchili performed the surgery at the Upper Bay Surgery Center in Elkton, Maryland. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A\n   representative of St. Jude was present, and took possession of the neurostimulator and battery components that had been removed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that Mrs. Freed has experienced and will continue to experience severe pain and suffering and emotional distress due to the implementation of the SCS device into her body. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a Complaint in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware that was removed to this Court on August 11, 2017; that Complaint asserted state law claims for injuries allegedly sustained as a result of the implementation of the SCS device. (D.I. 1) With the case now in this Court, St. Jude moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint, arguing that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' state law claims are preempted by federal law. (D.I. 4; D.I. 5) On September 15, 2017, United States District Judge Mark A. Kearney\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted St. Jude's motion without prejudice to Plaintiffs' ability to file an amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    Freed v.

(D.I. 18)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 2, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the currently operative First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"). (D.I. 19) In the FAC, Plaintiffs have asserted claims under Delaware law for breach of express warranty (Count I), breach of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose (Counts II and III, respectively), the manufacture and/or sale of a dangerous chattel (Count IV), and loss of consortium (Count V). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In lieu of filing an Answer, on October 16, 2017, St. Jude filed the instant Motion, (D.I. 20), arguing that: (1) Plaintiffs' claims remain preempted by federal law; and (2) as to all of their claims, Plaintiffs have not otherwise stated a plausible claim for relief pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), (D.I. 21). The Motion was fully briefed on November 6, 2017. (D.I. 26)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The sufficiency of pleadings for non-fraud cases is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, which requires \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\" Fed.

For\n   these reasons, according to St. Jude, the FAC must be dismissed with prejudice. (D.I. 21 at 1-2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Below, the Court will assess each of Plaintiffs' claims, in the order they are listed in the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Breach of Express Warranty (Count I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   St. Jude argues that Plaintiffs' breach of express warranty claim in Count I remains preempted. Section 2-313 of Title 6 (\"Section 2-313\") of the Delaware Code explains that an express warranty by the seller is created as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the description.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (c) Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Del.

However, under Delaware law, \"an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.\" Del. Code tit. 6, \u00a7 2-313(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   St. Jude asserts that Count I still lacks any allegations of a violation of a federal regulation and otherwise fails to explain how such a federal regulation imposes duties that are parallel to Delaware law. (D.I. 21 at 10-11; D.I. 26 at 3-5) Additionally, St. Jude asserts that even setting preemption aside, Plaintiffs' breach of express warranty claim is not adequately pleaded under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Turning to the substance of Count I's breach of express warranty claim, what is the express warranty that St. Jude purportedly made to Plaintiffs?

The St. Jude sales representative's statement that Mrs. Freed would be \"very happy\" with the SCS device amounts to the promotion of a vague, subjective opinion.

The FAC does not resolve this deficiency. Counts II and III do not allege violation of any federal regulations, nor do they plead facts setting out the specifics of the breaches at issue.

Additionally, Plaintiffs' answering brief is of no help, since it does not even address St. Jude's arguments as to the claims for breach of implied warranty. Though the brief has a section entitled \"Plaintiffs' Warranty Claims[,]\" that section solely argues why Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    express warranty\n   </em>\n   claims should be allowed to proceed; the section is silent with respect to the claims for breach of implied warranty.

(D.I. 26 at 6-7) St. Jude sets out two reasons for its argument in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   First, St. Jude asserts that while the\n   <em>\n    Stengel\n   </em>\n   Court was considering an Arizona law that \"contemplates a warning to a third party such as the FDA[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Stengel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655701\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/1224/\">\n    704 F.3d at 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"Plaintiffs here have not cited any\n   <em>\n    Delaware law\n   </em>\n   which establishes a duty to warn-or report adverse events to-a government agency such as the FDA[,]\" (D.I. 26 at 7 (emphasis added) ). St. Jude thus asserts that if Plaintiffs are making a claim in Count IV for failure to report adverse events to the FDA, that necessarily is a claim that arises solely under the FDCA, and thus it would be impliedly preempted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It does not appear that the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has directly addressed this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, other district courts in this Circuit have concluded that state law failure to warn claims premised on Section 388, which focus on a manufacturer's failure to report adverse events to the FDA, are not preempted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silver v.
