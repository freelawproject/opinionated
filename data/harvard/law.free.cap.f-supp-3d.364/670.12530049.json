(Justice Scalia dissenting to a denial of certiorari in light of a circuit split between\n   <em>\n    Brumley\n   </em>\n   and Seventh Circuit authority on whether honest services wire fraud must be based on the violation of state law). For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Whitfield\n   </em>\n   , two former Mississippi judges (the \"State Judges\") were charged with honest services wire fraud based on bribery, as defined by a Mississippi statute. The State Judges argued that the jury instructions failed to require the Government to prove an explicit quid pro quo in connection with the bribery scheme at issue. In rejecting this argument, the Fifth Circuit explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    Brumley\n   </em>\n   requires \" 'a federal prosecutor [to] prove that conduct of a state official breached a duty ... owed to the official's employer under state law\" to the extent the state statute \"concern[s] 'something close to bribery,' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (2) The Mississippi statute informing the jury instructions \"prohibits giving things of value to an official 'with intent to influence his vote, opinion, action or judgment on any question, matter, cause or proceeding which may be then pending, or may be thereafter subject to vote, opinion, action or judgment' of the official\"; and that\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (3) This instruction necessarily amounted to bribery-even assuming that a quid pro quo is the distinguishing feature of a bribe-since the instruction required the jury to find a \"corrupt agreement\" to exchange something of value with an \"intent to influence\" official action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Whitfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3503969\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/325/#p348\">\n    590 F.3d at 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As further evidence that the jury instructions based on the Mississippi statute, indeed, required proof of conduct \"close to bribery,\" the Fifth Circuit noted that the jury instructions were substantially similar to the pattern instructions for \u00a7 201, the bribery statute applicable to federal officials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, the Fifth Circuit found the jury instructions sufficient because, \"consistent with\n   <em>\n    Brumley\n   </em>\n   ,\" they were based on the violation of a statute governing the conduct of state officials that criminalized bribery.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3503969\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/325/#p348\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Government maintains that bribery does not need to be defined pursuant to a particular statute. This is because, according to the Government, the Supreme Court overturned\n   <em>\n    Brumley\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Skilling\n   </em>\n   by establishing a \"uniform national standard\" on how bribery should be defined for purposes of the honest services statute. This interpretation does not pass muster. In\n   <em>\n    Skilling\n   </em>\n   , the defendant argued that his honest services wire fraud conviction should be overturned because the honest services statute was impermissibly vague. As the Supreme Court acknowledged, appellate courts largely disagreed on whether honest services included bribes and kickbacks, or additional conduct such as the receipt of gratuities. To save the statute from unconstitutionality, the Supreme Court defined honest services narrowly to include only bribery or kickback schemes. This meant that, although the honest services statute survived, the defendant's honest services wire fraud conviction would be reversed since \"[t]he Government did not, at any time, allege that Skilling solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for making the[ ] misrepresentations\" at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skilling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/358/\">\n    561 U.S. at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283,3815903\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2896/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Seventh Circuit reasoned that, to commit honest services mail fraud, the items of value in question must have been offered or received with an\n   <em>\n    intent to influence\n   </em>\n   -as opposed to a mere intent \"to reward\"-as evident from the Supreme Court's decision to \"reverse[ ] Skilling's conviction because he did not accept anything of value 'in exchange for' making [the] misrepresentations\" at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986163\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/880/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Skilling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/358/\">\n    561 U.S. at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283,3815903\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2896/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court sees no reason to find differently. The Fifth Circuit has explained that statutes which merely target the appearance of impropriety-without requiring an intent to influence a public official-would not constitute bribery for purposes of honest services fraud.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brumley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11978894\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/116/728/#p733\">\n    116 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   734-35 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571857\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/713/#p734\">\n    85 F.3d at 729-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a statute that criminalizes only an \"intent to 'reward' an official for an act taken in the past or to be taken in the future\" would not amount to honest services fraud since such a finding \"requires, in connection with the gratuity, the intent to cause an official to deviate from the honest performance of services\"). The Fifth Circuit has also explained that \u00a7 666 criminalizes bribery\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   gratuities. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In rejecting this argument, the Fifth Circuit noted that (1) \u00a7 666 criminalized bribery\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   gratuities, but (2) assuming that the Government was required to prove that bribery occurred in light of how the indictment was written, the evidence supported such a conviction nevertheless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duvall\n   </em>\n   at 971-72 &amp; n.6 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sorich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=555%20U.S.%201204\">\n    555 U.S. at 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20S.%20Ct.%201308\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Justice Scalia stating that \u00a7 666(a) prohibits \"bribes and gratuities to public officials\" in a dissent to a denial of certiorari).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court will therefore define bribery pursuant to Section 666's terms\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   omitting\n   any references to an intent \"to reward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   c.\n   <strong>\n    Section 666's Other Elements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Jordans object to the Government's Proposed Instructions because they do not ensure that every element underlying a violation of \u00a7 666 is satisfied. The Government's Proposed Instructions omit, for instance, the requirement that the transaction amounting to a bribe concern \"anything of value of $ 5,000 or more,\" and that Laura Jordan was an agent for a local government entity that received more than $ 10,000 in federal funds a year (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 122 at p.3). The Court agrees with the Jordans. As explained, the Fifth Circuit has repeatedly acknowledged that bribery statutes are not interchangeable for purposes of an honest services charge under \u00a7 1346.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at pp. 673-78 (discussing\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771619\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/502/375/#p381\">\n    502 F.

It follows that, when defining bribery pursuant to a particular statute, an honest services wire fraud conviction requires a finding that the defendant actually violated that underlying statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brumley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11978894\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/116/728/#p733\">\n    116 F.3d at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Stated directly, the official must act or fail to act contrary to the requirements of his job under state law.

But in\n   <em>\n    Brumley\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit refused to find that \u00a7 1346 imposed \"a federal vision of appropriate services-to establish, in other words, an ethical regime for state employees.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11978894\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/116/728/#p733\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11978894\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/116/728/#p733\">\n    at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"jurisdictional hook\"-which requires that Laura Jordan was an agent of an entity that received at least $ 10,000 in federal funds per year-ensures that, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Brumley\n   </em>\n   , the honest services wire fraud statute only imposes an ethical regime for state or local employees to the extent the federal government has a financial interest in the state or local government's affairs and not over all state employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   d.\n   <strong>\n    Instructions on a Fiduciary Duty, a Possible Motive to act Corruptly, and the Likelihood that Someone acts with a Single Purpose\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Jordans object to excerpts of the Government's proposed instructions that touch on the fiduciary duty officials owe to the public, the reasons why people may act \"corruptly,\" and the likelihood in which people act with a single purpose (Dkt. # 122 at pp. 2-3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Jordans argue that these statements are better suited for the Government's closing argument. The Court agrees. An instruction that a public official owes a duty to provide \"disinterested service to the public and the government she serves\" (Dkt. # 122 at pp. 2-3) is improper because, even if correct, the jury may mistakenly believe that they can convict the Jordans for honest services wire fraud based on a mere conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3510005\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/578/#p584\">\n    691 F.3d at 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that\n   <em>\n    Skilling\n   </em>\n   \"was establishing a uniform national standard by construing \u00a7 1346 to clearly exclude conduct outside of bribery and kickbacks, such as conflict-of-interest schemes\"). An instruction advising that \"[t]he motive to act corruptly is ordinarily a hope or expectation of either financial gain or other benefit to oneself\" (Dkt. # 122 at pp. 2-3) is also improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The jury should determine whether the Jordans acted corruptly based on their perception of the evidence in this case-without the Court suggesting that, if the Government can prove that the Jordans had a financial motive to act corruptly, the Jordans likely acted corruptly. And an instruction advising that \"people rarely act for a single purpose\" may lead to the improper inference that, as a result, the Jordans were also likely to act with more than one motive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, such a determination should be based on the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   e.\n   <strong>\n    Instruction on Furnishing Sexual Services\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Jordans argue that the Government's proposed instruction that \"[a]nything of value\" can include intangible items, such as furnishing sexual services is improper. The Court disagrees. The Fifth Circuit has found that \"intangibles,\" including sexual services, constitute a \"thing of value\" under \u00a7 666 and can be used to support the $ 5,000 threshold \u00a7 666 requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Marmolejo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046547\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/89/1185/#p1192\">\n    89 F.3d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1192-94 (5th Cir. 1996). It explains that, \"[t]o decide whether a transaction involving intangibles has a value of $ 5,000 or more, courts should look to traditional valuation methods,\" for instance, \"by looking at how much a person in the market would be willing to pay\" for those intangibles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046547\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/89/1185/#p1192\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046547\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/89/1185/#p1192\">\n    at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Jordans appear to argue that, based on their assessment of the evidence, the Government will be unable to establish that any sexual services exchanged had any particular value (Dkt. # 88 at p.11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this is for the Government to prove and the jury to decide. It would be premature to prevent the jury from making this determination. Accordingly, because the Government's requested instruction is based on a correct statement of law and because it may not be immediately obvious to the jury that intangibles can constitute a thing of value, the Court finds this instruction appropriate. The Jordans' objection to this instruction will be overruled as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, the Government's Second Set of Objections to the Court's Order on the Jury Instructions [Dkt. # 119] are\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   , the Jordans' Objections to the Government's Proposed Jury Instructions [Dkt. # 126] are\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   , and the Jordans' Initial Set of Objections [Dkt. # 88] are\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   .
