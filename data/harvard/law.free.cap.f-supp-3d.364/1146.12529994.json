SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff the State of Nevada (\"Nevada\") challenges the federal government's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   plan\n   to ship one metric ton of defense plutonium from the Savannah River Site (\"SRS\") in South Carolina to the Nevada National Security Site (\"NNSS\"). This plan is part of the Government's larger proposed action articulated in a supplemental analysis. The merits of Nevada's claims are yet to be decided; this order only addresses Nevada's motion for preliminary injunction (\"PI Motion\") seeking to enjoin any shipment of plutonium from SRS to NNSS until Nevada's claims are decided on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 2.) The Court concludes that Nevada has failed to make the requisite showing of a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of the requested preliminary injunctive relief and that the balance of equities favors Nevada. The Court thus denies Nevada's PI Motion and declines to enjoin the shipment of plutonium pending a final disposition on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. RELEVANT BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case stems from an injunction order the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina issued in December 2017 (\"Order\").\n   <em>\n    South Carolina v.

The Order required the Government to remove \"not less than one metric ton\" of weapons-grade defense plutonium or defense plutonium materials from South Carolina \"for storage or disposal elsewhere\" by January 1, 2020.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%207691885\">\n    2017 WL 7691885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Device Assembly Facility (\"DAF\") at NNSS, located approximately 65-90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is the only direct location that, at present, the Government has proposed to receive the plutonium directly from SRS. (ECF No. 1 at 2; ECF No. 27-3 at 12, 16, 21-22; ECF No. 32 at 3.) After the plutonium is transferred to NNSS, it will ultimately be removed and relocated to its final destination at Los Alamos National Laboratory (\"LANL\") in Los Alamos, New Mexico. (ECF No. 27-3 (DOE/NNSA's Supplement Analysis) at 9, 23.) The shipments of plutonium from SRS to NNSS for staging (or storage) and thereafter to be received at LANL constitutes the Government's proposed action (\"Proposed Action\") as presented in the DOE's Supplemental Analysis (\"SA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 18; ECF No. 32 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nevada filed suit against the Government contending that the Government's plan to transport and stage the defense plutonium at NNSS will result in increased radiation doses to Nevada citizens and would, in some circumstances, lead to contamination of the lands and the groundwater of the state with radioactive materials. (ECF No. 1 at 6.) Nevada asserts that in choosing to relocate the plutonium to NNSS the Government has failed to adequately comply with the National Environmental Protection Act of 1969 (\"NEPA\"), 42 U.S.C. 432\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and persists in violation of implementing regulations of the Council of Environmental Quality,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201502.9\">\n    40 CFR \u00a7 1502.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), and DOE's own NEPA regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201021.314\">\n    10 CFR \u00a7 1021.314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), by failing to prepare a draft and final supplemental environmental impact statement (\"EIS\") for the Proposed Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Nevada contends that with this failure the Government deprived it of the opportunity to formally comment upon safety and environment\n   concerns related to the Proposed Action. (ECF No. 1 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nevada's PI Motion asks this Court to enjoin the plan to ship the plutonium to NNSS-i.e., preserve the status quo-until this action reaches a final disposition. (ECF No. 2; ECF No. 34 at 5; ECF No. 27-3 at 18 (Proposed Action).) Nevada specifically seeks to enjoin the shipment of the plutonium to NNSS until the Government satisfies the alleged NEPA violations, among other remedies.

The first two arguments appear to overlap and create an umbrella claim of\n   <em>\n    injury stemming from the decision-making process\n   </em>\n   whereby (1) Nevada's concrete\n   and particularized claim of injury is that shipments to NNSS will deprive it of the opportunity to comment and (2) there is a general claim of injury based on the claim that the Government would evade NEPA compliance absent injunction.

In contrast here, it is undisputed that the Government has been transporting and staging plutonium for decades across the country and Nevada, with prior EISs addressing the matter. Notably, Nevada provides no authority that would support a conclusion that it must be provided an opportunity to comment absent the Government drafting a supplemental EIS. But, even if this Court was to find procedural harm based on\n   <em>\n    Marsh\n   </em>\n   , it is clear that Nevada must nonetheless establish a real threat of environmental harm-that is material harm to the environment that is likely to result from not having the opportunity to comment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nevada's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Strawberry Canyon\n   </em>\n   begets no different conclusion.

But this claim of other harms must be examined in the context of the Proposed Action and the status quo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The SA relied on numerous prior EISs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Government provides argument primarily based on the following: The Final Complex Transformation Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (SPEIS) drafted in 2008 (\"Final Complex Transformation SPEIS\"); The Final Surplus Plutonium Disposition Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) drafted in 2015 (\"Final Surplus Plutonium Disposition SEIS\"); and The Final Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement for the Continued Operation of the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada National Security Site and Off-Site Locations in the State of Nevada drafted in 2013 (\"NNSS SWEIS\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 27 at 26-27; ECF No. 27-3 at 14-16.) The Government also relied on the Final Environmental Statement on the Transportation of Radioactive Material by Air and Other Modes drafted in 1977. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 27-3 at 28, 39, 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The SA provides that the plutonium would be \"transported from SRS to the [DAF] in DOT-certified shipping containers, or equivalent[,]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"placed into a vault for staging.\" (ECF No. 27-3 at 21-22 (SA at 13-14 (Figures 2-2 and Figure 2-3) ).) The plutonium would be staged in the same containers used in transport \"until transport to LANL for pit production.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The SA showed an example of the customary \"DOE-STD-303 container used to store plutonium-bearing materials\" that would be used for the plutonium materials here. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (Figure 2-3).) At the Hearing it was undisputed that the customary container is a double sealed Type-B container that complies with all relevant regulations. (Hearing Transcript, ECF No. 55 (\"TR\") at 16, 17, 46-47, 118-19, 141.) It was also undisputed that the Government has repeatedly informed Nevada that the transportation of the plutonium would be carried out by the Office of Secure Transportation\n   (\"OST\") that traditionally conducts the transport of plutonium for DOE. (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) The SA provides the same. (ECF No. 27-3 at 19 (\"The DOE/NNSA Office of Secure Transportation would transport the one metric ton of plutonium between the DOE sites.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Furthermore, the SA notes that the \"proposed action does not involve new construction or ground disturbing activities\" and the proposed activities \"would occur in existing facilities where the potential impacts have been analyzed and bounded in various NEPA documents.\" (ECF No. 27-3 at 19 (referencing the various EISs which are available at pages 14 through 15) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28 (\"[I]mpacts from transportation on all resource areas are also evaluated.

(ECF No. 34 at 12-13.) At the Hearing it became apparent that this argument largely rests on Nevada's contention that the prior EISs do not take certain factors into account-particularly the form of plutonium to be shipped to NNSS, the quantity to be shipped in the proposed timeframe-by January 1, 2020, increased population density, construction irregularities, and the duration of storage at NNSS. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TR at 16-17, 66-67, 84, 119-21, 166-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Through expert testimony presented at the Hearing Nevada attempted to bolster its claim that the Government needed to perform a supplemental EIS to better assess the current risks to Nevada based on arguments going to these factors. Nevada's experts testified that the plutonium proposed to be transported to NNSS appears to be of an atypical\n   <em>\n    form\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   that has not previously been transported to NNSS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   and staged at DAF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66-67, 69-70, 100-01, 173.) The experts posited that the combination of the form of plutonium and the quantity to be shipped, in the limited time-period for shipment to NNSS, may be disastrous considering increased population density along the likely route of transport and the irregularities of construction in and near the Las Vegas metropolitan area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 166-67.) Nevada's experts further testified that the DOT-containers for shipment typically only have a life span of 10 years, making it rather dangerous that storage at NNSS, as Nevada argues, would be indefinite. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84, 119-121, 166-67;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at 2 (Nevada contending that storage would be for an indefinite period); ECF No. 27-3 at 19 (noting the \"duration of staging at ... NNSS is currently undefined, but will likely take place for a period of years\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nevada's claims of other harms, including environmental injury, are too speculative to rise to the level of the required likelihood of irreparable harm. Nevada seeks to maintain the status quo-meaning keep things as they are in relation to NNSS. However, in general the status quo at NNSS, as elucidated by testimony at the Hearing, historically includes the use of plutonium in testing operations and nuclear materials transferred to NNSS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (TR at 44, 49, 64, 101.) Thus, it is highly hypothetical that shipments of additional plutonium to NNSS and staging there would lead to imminent and immediate harm. In other words, the any potential harm is speculative given the nature of the existing activities at NNSS where the Government has shipped, stored and used plutonium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Further, the Government repeatedly noted at the Hearing that the form of plutonium and the route of shipment are classified information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (TR at 20-22, 49-50, 69.) While these statements alone do not suffice to negate Nevada's concerns, they do illustrate the speculative nature of the harm. If the form of plutonium and the routes are not known or disclosed, any claim that the plutonium would be shipped in a form that poses more imminent harm than the type that has been previously shipped to NNSS or that the routes would go through more dense areas or areas with construction projects is notional. Moreover, as the Government points out, it has safely shipped larger quantities of plutonium throughout the country and that DOE and NNSA necessarily had to have analyzed and did analyze in the relied upon prior EISs the safety of transporting and staging-for relevant time durations, whatever type of plutonium is proposed to be transported to and stored at NNSS. Nevada presented no evidence to undermine the Government's position to show that its claimed harm is not speculative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Additionally, Nevada's concern regarding the security of the shipment containers for staging at best raises the possibility of harm. Nevada's argument is grounded in part on the contention that the storage of plutonium at NNSS may go beyond 2026/2027, but this is conjecture that the Government would delay moving the plutonium to LANL as stated in the SA. Moreover, the plutonium presumably would be repackaged into other containers thus curbing concerns about the shipping container's lifespan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is persuaded by the Government's position expressed at the Hearing-that the same containers that are safe for shipment, which is a more unsteady activity than storage, also suffices for staging. (TR at 186-87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Nevada's claim of irreparable harm to Nevada's lands, environment, and by extension Nevada's citizens, is merely a theoretical possibility at this juncture as Nevada provides no evidence from which this Court may infer a likelihood of any concrete or impending harm. Accordingly, the Court finds that Nevada has failed to establish the requisite likelihood of irreparable harm to merit the exceptional relief of a preliminary injunction to enjoin the shipment of plutonium to NNSS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Balancing of the Equities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While the Court need not consider the additional\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   factors having found that Nevada fails to establish the necessary requirement of likely irreparable harm, the Court notes that the balancing of the equities favors the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"To determine which way the balance of the hardships tips, a court must identify the possible harm caused by the preliminary injunction against the possibility of the harm caused by not issuing it.\"\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Haw.

(ECF No. 2 at 10-11.) These reasons do not tip the equities regarding injunction in Nevada's favor however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   While the Order specified no particular location, the Government has chosen to remove the plutonium to NNSS for an interim period and many of the arguments Nevada raises-e.g., related to population density, form of plutonium, the quantity of plutonium in the limited time-period-could conceivably be raised by intermediate destinations. Further, it is debatable that DOE has sufficient time to consider intermediate locations, without protestation from representatives from those locations, and still comply with the January 1, 2020 removal deadline. Moreover, the balance of equities analysis specifically focuses on the possible harm that would result from not issuing an injunction, thus the Court's finding that any harm posed to Nevada is speculative tips the balance firmly in the Government's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Government would be harmed by further delay in complying with the Order as is. Any failure to comply with the Order would result in the Government violating both the Order and Congress's statutory\n   requirement whereby removal from SRS appears to be an extension of the achievement of certain production objectives pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202566\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%207691885\">\n    2017 WL 7691885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202566\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6) ( (\"Upon making a determination ...

(TR at 149, 164.) However, the word \"equivalent\" would tend to suggest than any alternative container would be as safe as the DOT-certified shipping containers. Furthermore, the Government's only witness, William Harris Walker-Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs at NNSA, indicated that the Government has no intention to use anything other than the customary shipment containers.

(ECF No. 34 at 12 n.1.) Nevada also contends that the 2013 NNSS SWEIS is too old to be relied on in the SA for the Proposed Action here because DOE's own regulation,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201021.330\">\n     10 CFR \u00a7 1021.330\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d), requires DOE to evaluate site-wide NEPA documents at least every five years. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12-13.) As to the age of the documents, the Court is unpersuaded that the age of the documents makes them inadequate absent otherwise meaningful change. Further, the fact that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission prepared a document regarding nuclear materials, as opposed to the DOE itself, doesn't clearly undermine the efficacy of the document where, as here, nuclear material is the topic of concern. Moreover, while the Final Environmental Statement on the Transportation of Radioactive Material by Air and Other Modes was not listed under the list of documents the SA notes it considered (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 27-3 at 14-16), it was nonetheless referenced throughout the SA (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201021.330\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201021.330\">\n     at 28, 39, 43\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The Government's response represented that the plutonium would be in the form of \"pits\" (ECF No. 27 at 9, 20-21), however, the Government filed an erratum to correct its response and to clarify that the plutonium \"is not in pit form.\" (ECF No. 41 at 2.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Nevada additionally argues that the Government's decision not to do a supplemental EIS left it unable to assess potential risks considering the noted factors and left it inadequately prepared to address emergencies that could stem from accidents in the transport and staging of the plutonium. The Government responds that any claims regarding the inadequacy of the prior EISs are unjustified and Nevada had the opportunity to comment on those EISs at the time they were drafted but failed to do so. The Government also argues that it previously informed Nevada that the plutonium will leave NNSS for LANL between 2026 and 2027.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    This statement takes on new meaning in light of the Government's representation that the shipment was completed before initiation of this action.
