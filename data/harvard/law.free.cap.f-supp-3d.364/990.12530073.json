BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ARPwave manufactures and distributes devices that electronically stimulate muscles. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. ARPwave's devices-and its treatment system-are designed to help athletes and others to relax and strengthen muscles, recover from injury, and better absorb force.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Salpeter first started using ARPwave's devices in 2006, while playing college hockey.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. Salpeter \"had a life-changing experience using the ARPwave system\" and \"was amazed at the ability of the ARPwave System to bring people back faster from all kinds of injuries and to reverse chronic pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2008, ARPwave and Salpeter entered into a \"clinic master lease and license agreement\" (\"the 2008 agreement\"). ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 38; ECF No. 1-1. Under the agreement, Salpeter leased various devices from ARPwave and received a license to provide ARPwave's treatment system to the public. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 42; ECF No. 1-1. Salpeter received training regarding ARPwave's proprietary devices and treatment system in Minneapolis. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 43-44. In January 2009, Salpeter registered ARPwave Austin in Texas and marketed the licensed treatment system to the public through ARPwave Austin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 39, 45-46. ARPwave alleges that \"Salpeter exercises full dominion, ownership and operational control over [ARPwave Austin].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In May 2010, ARPwave Austin and Salpeter executed a new agreement with ARPwave (\"the 2010 agreement\"). ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 50; ECF No. 1-2. This agreement granted Salpeter and ARPwave Austin a five-year lease on a newly developed ARPwave device called the \"RX 100,\" as well as a license to use the associated protocols.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both the 2008 and 2010 agreements contained identical forum-selection clauses, providing (in relevant part) as follows: \"Venue for\n   <em>\n    the enforcement of this Agreement\n   </em>\n   shall be limited to the Hennepin County, Minnesota, Federal or State District Court to the exclusion of all other courts ....\" ECF No. 1-1 at p. 5, \u00b6 21 and at p. 9, \u00a7 7, \u00b6 2 (2008 agreement) (emphasis added); ECF No. 1-2 at p. 5, \u00b6 21 and at p. 8, \u00a7 6, \u00b6 2 (2010 agreement) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In March 2012, Salpeter entered yet another agreement with ARPwave (\"the 2012 agreement\"). ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 55; ECF No. 1-3. This agreement granted Salpeter a five-year lease on a new ARPwave device called the \"POV Sport,\" as well as a license to use the associated protocols. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 55-56; ECF No. 1-3. The 2012 agreement also contained a forum-selection clause that was worded somewhat differently from the forum-selection clauses in the 2008 and 2010 agreements. The forum-selection clause in the 2012 agreement provided (in relevant part) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   EACH PARTY CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE COUNTY OF HENNEPIN, STATE OF MINNESOTA AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT\n   <em>\n    ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED AGREEMENTS\n   </em>\n   MUST BE LITIGATED IN SUCH COURTS. EACH PARTY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS AND WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ECF No. 1-3 at p. 5, \u00b6 7.9 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this action, ARPwave alleges that Salpeter failed to make the payments required by the agreements and, following expiration of the agreements, refused to return the devices leased to him under the agreements. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 49, 54, 58. ARPwave also alleges that Salpeter and the other defendants are still using ARPwave's proprietary devices and treatment system to provide services to members of the public, albeit under another brand name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 61-63. Specifically, ARPwave alleges that Salpeter registered a new LLC in Texas in April 2016 (Neurological Fitness and Recovery Facilities) and that this company is being used to promote the \"Neufit\" treatment system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. According to ARPwave, the Neufit treatment system \"is a converted copy of ARPwave proprietary and patented Systems and technology previously leased and licensed to [Salpeter].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In May 2017, Salpeter registered another new LLC in Texas (Neurological Fitness Equipment and Education).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62. Both of these new companies (collectively \"the Neurological Fitness LLCs\") have the same address.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 61-62. ARPwave alleges that Salpeter \"is the current Chief Operating Officer\" (as well as a \"director and member\") of both of the Neurological Fitness LLCs, and that he \"exercises full dominion, ownership and operational control over [them].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ARPwave also alleges that defendants are using a device that they refer to as the \"Neubie\" \"to perform ... methods of electrotherapeutic stimulation, diagnosis,\n   treatment and adjustment\" that are \"virtually identical\" to the treatment system licensed from ARPwave. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 63. ARPwave also alleges that the \"Neubie\" infringes on three ARPwave utility patents, specifically\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C768%2C474\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,768,474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (issued in 2014) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 80; ECF No. 1-7),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C302%2C102\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,302,102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (issued in 2016) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 81; ECF No. 1-8), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C526%2C892\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,526,892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (also issued in 2016) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 82; ECF No. 1-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   All of the defendants now move to dismiss ARPwave's patent-infringement claims for lack of venue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 9; ECF No. 11. All of the defendants (with the exception of Salpeter) also move to dismiss ARPwave's other claims for lack of proper venue. ECF No. 11 at 9-10; ECF No. 19 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ARPwave does not seem to dispute that, in the absence of the forum-selection clauses, venue over this case would not lie in this District. ARPwave contends, however, that because of the forum-selection clauses, ARPwave may sue defendants in this District. Defendants disagree. Defendants argue that an entity cannot be bound by a forum-selection clause in an agreement to which the entity is not a party, and point out that ARPwave Austin signed only one of the agreements and that neither of the Neurological Fitness LLCs signed any of the agreements. Defendants also argue that, even if all of them are bound by all of the forum-selection clauses, venue over some of the claims would still not lie in this District, as those claims are not within the scope of the clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court will first address the question of which defendants are bound by the forum-selection clauses, and then the question of which claims fall within the scope of those clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    A. Which Defendants Are Bound By the Forum-Selection Clauses?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants contend that an entity cannot be bound by a forum-selection clause unless the entity is a party to the agreement containing the clause. Because only Salpeter signed all three of the agreements, defendants argue, only Salpeter is bound by all three forum-selection clauses. ECF No. 11 at 9-10; ECF No. 19 at 5. ARPwave Austin signed only the 2010 agreement and thus contends that it is bound only by the forum-selection clause contained in that agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C526%2C892\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And the Neurological Fitness LLCs did not sign any of agreements-indeed, they did not even exist at the time the agreements were signed-and thus they contend that they are not bound by any of the forum-selection clauses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C526%2C892\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants' argument has surface appeal, but it founders on case law from both federal courts and Minnesota courts\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   holding that a non-party to a contract can be held bound by the contract's forum-selection clause when that non-party is \" 'closely related' to the dispute such that it becomes 'foreseeable' that [the non-party] will be bound.\"\n   <em>\n    Marano Enters. of Kan. v.

Here, the Court finds that all of the defendants are so closely related to this dispute that it was foreseeable that they would be bound by the agreements' forum-selection clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   1. ARPwave Austin\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ARPwave Austin signed the 2010 agreement and concedes that it is bound by that agreement's forum-selection clause. ARPwave Austin argues, however, that it is not bound by the forum-selection clauses in the 2008 and 2012 agreements because it is not a party to those agreements. The Court disagrees. In the Court's view, ARPwave Austin is so closely related to this dispute that it was foreseeable that the company would be bound by the 2008 and 2012 agreements' forum-selection clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ARPwave Austin is owned and controlled by Salpeter. Salpeter signed the 2008 agreement to lease various devices and treatment methods from ARPwave, and one month later created ARPwave Austin to market the system that he had leased. Salpeter still owned and operated ARPwave Austin when he signed the 2012 agreement, under which he leased new equipment and protocols from ARPwave-equipment and protocols that he marketed through ARPwave Austin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Clearly, then, ARPwave Austin can be held bound by the forum-selection clauses contained in the 2008 and 2012 agreements, given that those agreements were signed by ARPwave Austin's owner/operator, and given that those agreements conferred rights that the owner/operator exercised through ARPwave Austin.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Universal Credit Services v.

The Neurological Fitness LLCs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Neurological Fitness LLCs did not sign any of the agreements, but they too are so closely related to this dispute that it was foreseeable that they would be bound by the forum-selection clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ARPwave alleges-and Salpeter has not denied-that \"Salpeter exercises full dominion, ownership and operational control\n   over the [Neurological Fitness LLCs].\" ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 7. Further, ARPwave alleges that the Neurological Fitness LLCs provide the same services that ARPwave Austin provided, using the devices, methods, and protocols that were licensed to Salpeter in the three agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 61-63. In fact, ARPwave alleges that the Neurological Fitness LLCs' treatment system is \"virtually identical\" to ARPwave's and is, in fact, \"a converted copy of ARPwave proprietary and patented Systems and technology previously leased and licensed to [Salpeter].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Salpeter has asserted that he created the \"Neufit\" brand (now marketed by the Neurological Fitness LLCs) in 2009-the same year that Salpeter formed ARP Austin and began marketing the system licensed from ARPwave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 39, 45-46, 61-63, 83. The first of the Neurological Fitness LLCs was not even formed until seven years later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 61-62, 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The facts of this case closely resemble those of\n   <em>\n    Financial Management Group, Inc. v. University Painters of Baltimore, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Civ. A. No. 11-5821,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201150131\">\n    2012 WL 1150131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. April 5, 2012). In that case, Michael Herzog leased the rights to operate a painting business called \"University Painters\" from First Financial Management Group (\"FFMG\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The contract contained a non-compete clause providing that, following termination of the contract, Herzog would not operate another painting business in the United States for three years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Herzog exercised his rights under the contract by opening a University Painters business in Baltimore, but, after some disputes between the parties, FFMG terminated Herzog's contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Herzog created a new painting business in Baltimore-\"Perfect Painters\"-and began advertising his services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   FFMG sued Herzog and Perfect Painters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. FFMG alleged \"that Perfect Painters was a painting business run by [Herzog], working in the geographic area covered by the broad non-compete clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The court concluded that Perfect Painters was bound by the forum-selection clause contained in the contract between Herzog and FFMG, even though Perfect Painters did not exist when that contract was signed. The court reasoned that \"[b]ecause Perfect Painters is run by the same individuals, doing the same work as [Herzog] received a license to do under the contract with FFMG ... it ... is sufficiently related to [Herzog] and the underlying contract such that this Court may enforce the forum-selection clause against it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The facts of this case are materially indistinguishable. Here, ARPwave alleges that the Neurological Fitness LLCs are owned and controlled by Salpeter and are using the devices, methods, and protocols that were licensed to Salpeter under the three agreements with ARPwave. Thus, the Court finds that the Neurological Fitness LLCs are so closely related to this dispute that it was foreseeable that they would be bound by the forum-selection clauses. To find otherwise would be to allow someone in Salpeter's position to easily evade a forum-selection clause by creating a new LLC and acting through it. The law is not so toothless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howmedica Osteonics Corp. v. Bagwell\n   </em>\n   , Civ. A.

July 14, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that all four defendants are bound by all three forum-selection clauses. The next question is which of the claims asserted in this lawsuit fall within the scope of at least one of those clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    B. Which Claims Fall Within the Scope of the Forum-Selection Clauses?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In order for one of ARPwave's claims to fall within the scope of one of the forum-selection clauses, either (1) that claim must\n   be brought \"for the enforcement of [the 2008 or 2010] Agreement\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or (2) that claim must be a claim \"relating to [the 2012] agreement or any related agreements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ARPwave brings two types of claims: patent-infringement claims and non-patent infringement claims. The Court will consider each group of claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   1. Patent-Infringement Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), a patent-infringement action may be brought (1) \"in the judicial district where the defendant resides\" or (2) in any judicial district in which \"the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.\" None of the defendants resides\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Minnesota, has committed acts of infringement in Minnesota, or has a regular and established place of business in Minnesota. It is clear, then, that ARPwave cannot bring a patent-infringement claim against any of the defendants in Minnesota under \u00a7 1400(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ARPwave argues that venue nevertheless lies in Minnesota for two reasons: First, ARPwave argues that its patent-infringement claims fall within the forum-selection clauses. Second, ARPwave argues that, even if its patent-infringement claims fall outside of the forum-selection clauses, the\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -patent-infringement claims fall within those clauses. Given that this Court has venue over the non-patent-infringement claims, ARPwave argues, the Court can exercise \"pendent venue\" over the patent-infringement claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court can make quick work of the latter argument.

The 2012 forum-selection clause requires \"that all actions or proceedings relating to this agreement or any related agreements\" be brought in Minnesota. ECF No. 1-3 at p. 5, \u00b6 7.9. For a patent-infringement claim to \"relate\" to the 2012 agreement (or to any other agreement), that claim must concern the agreement or have some sort of relevance, connection, or reference to the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , New Oxford American Dictionary (3d ed. 2010) (defining \"relate to\" as to \"have reference to,\" or \"concern\"); Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (2d ed. 2001) (defining \"related\" as \"associated; connected\"); The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 2006) (defining \"relate\" as \"[t]o have connection, relation, or relevance\" and \"related\" as \"[b]eing connected; associated\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   ARPwave's patent-infringement claims do not \"relate\" to the 2008, 2010, or 2012 agreements in the ordinary sense of the term. First, none of the agreements says a word about any of ARPwave's patents-which is not surprising, given that none of ARPwave's patents even\n   <em>\n    existed\n   </em>\n   until 2014, years after the agreements were signed. The agreements also do not say a word about any patent applications. It is difficult to find that a claim for patent infringement \"relates\" to a contract that does not say a word about the patent and that was signed years before the patent came into existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Second, sometimes a defendant to a patent-infringement claim will argue that it has a license to practice the patent at issue. In such a case, the patent-infringement claim may be said to relate to the license agreement, given that the court may not be able to adjudicate the patent-infringement claim without interpreting the license agreement. But here, there is no indication that any of the defendants will rely on any of the agreements in defending against ARPwave's patent-infringement claims. To the contrary, defendants are asserting that the Neubie does not infringe any valid claim of any patent. Thus, in adjudicating ARPwave's patent-infringement claims, the Court will not have to enter the 2008, 2010, and 2012 agreements into the record, much less interpret them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Under the circumstances, then, the Court finds that ARPwave's patent-infringement claims do not \"relate\" to the 2012 agreement or any related agreement. The Court's conclusion finds support in the decisions of other federal courts\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   who have addressed the question of whether a patent-infringement claim relates to a license agreement.

Given that all of these claims are either explicit breach-of-contract claims or breach-of-contract claims repackaged as tort claims, the Court finds that all of these claims are brought to \"enforce\" or at least \"relate to\" the agreements, and therefore are properly venued in Minnesota under the forum-selection clauses in those agreements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alpha Sys.

In deciding whether to exercise pendent venue, courts have considered such factors as whether the claims share a common nucleus of operative fact, whether there are common issues of proof, and whether there are similar witnesses.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reuber\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805665,628934\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/750/1039/\">\n     750 F.2d at 1048\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, the Court need not look at the agreements to adjudicate the patent-infringement claims, and the Court need not look at the patents to adjudicate the non-patent-infringement claims.
