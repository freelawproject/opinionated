Specifically, at all times relevant to this action, the Union and the Hospital were parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\"). The CBA was in effect from October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2013 and from October 1, 2013 to October 31, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The CBA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Article XI, \u00a7 11.01 of the CBA (in effect in October 2013) provides, \"Any employer covered by this Agreement has the right to discipline, suspend or discharge a worker for Just Cause only, except in the case of a probationary worker who may be terminated without recourse to the Grievance Procedure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Article XXIV, \u00a7 24.03 of the CBA governs the parties' formal grievance and arbitration procedure. Section 24.03, in part, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 24.03 Formal Procedure:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   In the event of a controversy concerning the meaning or application of any provision of this Agreement, such controversy shall be treated by the Union and the Employer as a grievance and shall be settled, if possible, by the Union, the worker and the Employer as set forth hereafter. At all Steps of the Grievance Procedure, the worker or delegate will submit the grievance, in writing, explaining as specifically as possible, the nature of the complaint and identify the contract provision(s) affected. Group grievances may be submitted at Step 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Step 1 - Department Head/Manager\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The worker or Delegate will present a grievance in writing to the Manager or Department Head within twenty (20) working days from the date of the alleged violation of the contract.

If either party fails to make a written request for arbitration in this manner within this thirty (30) day period the grievance shall be deemed to have been settled in accordance with the most recent written answer which shall be final and binding on the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Relevant Individuals\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   MaryEllen Leveille has been employed by the Union and its predecessors since 1997. She currently serves as Vice President of the Union's Steward Health Care System Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2013, Enid Eckstein held the position as Vice President of the Union's Steward Health Care System Division. Ms. Eckstein had been employed by the Union and its predecessors since 1989. She retired in\n   October 2014, at which time Ms. Leveille succeeded her as Vice President.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In July 2013, Ms. Leveille served as the Union's Lead Administrative Organizer (\"AO\") at the Hospital. Her responsibilities as Lead AO included negotiating the Union's master contract with Steward Health Care System, administering the CBA at the Hospital, including by assisting Union delegates, and assisting then-Vice President Eckstein with staff matters and day-to-day duties. As Lead AO, Ms. Leveille also attended meetings with management on behalf of the Union and represented bargaining unit members throughout the contractual grievance procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff,\n   <strong>\n    Michael Reynolds,\n   </strong>\n   was hired by the Hospital as an MRI Technologist (\"MRI Tech\") in April 2010. While employed at the Hospital, Mr. Reynolds was a member of the Union and his employment was governed by the CBA. For the three and a half years of his employment, Mr. Reynolds was supervised by Judith Ierardi, the Operations Manager of Radiology, Radiation Oncology, and the Breast Center at the Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Contrast Incident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On July 20, 2013, Mr. Reynolds received an order for an MRI which expressly stated \"p[atien]t is pregnant and so no contrast.\" The order also indicated that it should be for an \"MRI BRAIN W/WO CON.\" Mr. Reynolds thereafter entered an order in which the statement \"patient is pregnant and so no contrast\" had been removed. On that same day, Mr. Reynolds himself injected a pregnant patient with gadolinium-based contrast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Hospital policy cautioned that \"[g]adolinium-based agents should be administered in pregnancy only with extreme caution and avoided if at all possible.\" Ms. Ierardi testified that in her 25 years she \"never ha[d] heard of anyone injecting a pregnant patient with contrast.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As a matter of routine where serious discipline was under consideration, Ms. Ierardi telephoned Ms. Leveille to let her know there had been a \"very serious incident,\" in reference to the contrast matter, and that she (Ierardi) would recommend that Reynolds be terminated.\" Ms. Leveille engaged Ms. Ierardi in a discussion of the incident and advocated strongly against termination, based on the role two physicians played in the contrast incident and based on lesser discipline that had been issued previously to an MRI tech who had committed a serious error. Ms. Leveille made clear that the Union would vigorously challenge termination should the Hospital discharge Mr. Reynolds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 26, 2013, Mr. Reynolds attended a disciplinary meeting with Ms. Ierardi regarding the contrast incident. He was represented by Union delegate, Kristin Knehans. During this meeting, Ms. Knehans stated that while the contrast incident may be \"a fireable offense,\" the Union would strongly fight against Mr. Reynolds's termination based on the lesser discipline previously issued to an MRI tech who had committed a serious error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At the conclusion of the disciplinary meeting, the Hospital did not terminate Mr. Reynolds, but issued him a Final Warning that stated, \"[Mr. Reynolds] failed to follow the contrast policy for a pregnant patient in the MRI suite. This is an egregious violation of the Contrast Medium for Pregnant Policy Rad-02-11, and MRI in pregnancy Policy MR-11 which could have resulted in harm to the unborn infant.\" The Final Warning stated that \"any other performance or behavioral problems may result in further disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Reynolds did not grieve the July 26, 2013 Final Warning or request that the Union do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Performance After the Contrast Incident Leading to His Termination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In August 2013, less than a month after the issuance of his first Final Warning, Mr. Reynolds was the subject of a complaint from a radiology tech aid, Jemilexi Figueroa. Among other things, Ms. Figueroa complained that there had been several incidents over the prior two months in which she felt that Mr. Reynolds had \"harassed and belittled\" her and that she had \"suffered stress and verbal abuse on numerous occasions\" as a result of Mr. Reynolds's behavior. Mr. Reynolds was not Ms. Figueroa's supervisor nor did he have any supervisory authority over her. In his view, she was not doing her job, was lazy, and was there just to collect a paycheck so he had created a list of responsibilities and a check-off list for certain duties to be used by Ms. Figueroa and the other tech aids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On September 17, 2013, Mr. Reynolds attended another disciplinary meeting with Ms. Ierardi and Human Resources Administrator, Catherine O'Neill,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   following Ms. Ierardi's receipt of complaints from Ms. Figueroa and other department staff concerning Mr. Reynold's conduct. Because Mr. Reynolds had expressed dissatisfaction with Ms. Knehans, Ms. Leveille herself accompanied Mr. Reynolds to the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. Reynolds received a second Final Warning. This second Final Warning cited Mr. Reynolds for his interactions with Ms. Figueroa and for \"not communicating in a respectful collaborative manner with other staff members and creating and disseminating documents surrounding responsibilities and departmental procedures [that] has created an uncomfortable work environment which counteracts the policies set forth by the Medical Center.\" It further stated that \"[f]ailure to satisfactorily correct the problem(s) as stated in this warning or any further occurrences in the future of this type or any other performance or conduct problems, will result in further disciplinary action including the possibility of suspension and/or termination. Immediate and sustained improvement is required.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Hospital issued Mr. Reynolds a Performance Improvement Plan (\"PIP\"). The PIP required Mr. Reynolds to adhere to a 7-point action plan. The first point of the PIP required him to review HR policy HR 5-10, which, among other things, informed Mr. Reynolds that actions including \"[i]nsubordination,\" \"[c]onduct contrary to the best interest of St. Elizabeth's, its patients or employees, while on or off duty,\" \"[v]iolation of patients' rights/confidentiality,\" \"[v]iolation of computer security procedures,\" \"[f]ailure to perform required job responsibilities,\" \"[f]ailure to follow department policies and policies of St. Elizabeth's Medical Center,\" or \"[i]ntentional disruption of medical center routine,\" could result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. The PIP also required Mr. Reynolds to review the Service Excellence Standards, which, among other things, informed him that he must maintain \"an atmosphere of friendliness, courtesy and concern for each patient, visitor,\n   physician and co-worker,\" provide patients \"with prompt service, always keeping them informed of delays and making them comfortable while they wait,\" and treat all ... co-workers with respect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In addition to reviewing HR policies, the PIP also required that Mr. Reynolds immediately cease from directing the work of his co-workers or colleagues, refrain from creating and disseminating documents that list the responsibilities or tasks of other co-workers, refrain from creating documents that are meant to instruct co-workers on departmental policies/procedures, not address concerns he had of his co-workers' performance directly with his co-workers, immediately address any concerns he had regarding the performance of his co-workers with his direct manager, communicate in a collaborative and respectful way with co-workers, staff members, and patients throughout the Medical Center, and meet weekly with his manager to review his progress. Mr. Reynolds testified that he understood that a failure to comply with the PIP could lead to further disciplinary action, including separation from employment. Again, Mr. Reynolds did not grieve the second Final Warning or ask the Union to grieve it on his behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On September 18, 2013, the day following the second disciplinary meeting, Mr. Reynolds filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") against the Union relating to the Final Warning he received in July 2013. Specifically, Mr. Reynolds alleged that \"[o]n July 28, 2013, my Union Representative failed to represent me by recommending my termination of employment.\" Mr. Reynolds ultimately withdrew this unfair labor practice charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In accordance with the terms of the PIP, Mr. Reynolds was scheduled to attend a meeting with management on October 4, 2013. On October 3, 2013, Mr. Reynolds sent an email to Ms. Leveille \"requesting an attorney to represent [him].\" He indicated that he did \"not feel comfortable attending any further meeting with [his] supervisor and/or H.R. personnel until [he] ha[d] an attorney present to represent [his] interests and witness any further discussions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ms. Leveille responded within minutes stating, \"We do not provide an attorney for meeting with management or HR. You have the right to have a delegate with you under the contract those are your rights.\" Mr. Reynolds replied he \"would like the Union to provide[ ] [him] with an attorney. That [that] [wa]s [his] right, and the NLRB as well as [his] attorney ha[d] already informed [him] of this entitlement.\" Mr. Reynolds never requested, nor was he denied, a Union delegate at any PIP meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On October 4, 2013, Mr. Reynolds met with Ms. O'Neill, Director of Radiology, Ray Wilburn, and Ms. Ierardi, pursuant to the PIP to discuss several performance deficiencies that had occurred between their previous meeting and October 4. Mr. Reynolds was counseled for making an injured patient wait nine-and-a-half hours for a scan that was ordered at 8:00 a.m. He was also reprimanded for commenting on the status of an injured football player's knee; technicians are not permitted to divulge to a patient that they can read the films or think that they know what the diagnosis may be. Mr. Reynolds was also counseled for leaving the hospital while a patient was waiting to be scanned. Additionally, he was counseled for failing to remove duplicate orders from the computer system and failing to perform normal stocking and cleaning duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Following this meeting, Mr. Reynolds emailed Ms. O'Neill, Mr. Wilburn, and Ms. Ierardi. Among other things, Mr. Reynolds complained that he was not provided with\n   an attorney for the meeting and concluded the email by stating that management \"can inform me of your future list of grievances [about my work performance] via email. Otherwise ... I will need to have an attorney - provided to me by the Union - present as witness at any meetings in the future.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The following day, October 5, 2013, Ms. Ierardi expressed to Ms. O'Neill and Mr. Wilburn her view that Mr. Reynolds's refusal to attend future PIP meetings constituted insubordination and further informed them that she had received complaints from other techs that Mr. Reynolds \"did not communicate with any of them yesterday, was on his cell phone and is passive aggressive.\" Moreover, that same day, Mr. Reynolds used a diphenhydramine tablet to counteract a patient's allergic reaction to the contrast medium. Rather than calling the hospital pharmacy to replace the tablet, he left a sticky-note with a patient's name and the medicine used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On October 11, 2013, Ms. Ierardi terminated Mr. Reynolds's employment in consultation with Ms. O'Neill and Gail Flynn, Director of Human Resources. At a meeting, Ms. O'Neill and Mr. Wilburn notified Mr. Reynolds of his termination and explained that his ongoing performance issues and his refusal to attend weekly review meetings with his supervisor constituted violations of his PIP and that the Hospital had \"lost faith\" in Reynolds as an employee. Mr. Reynolds was represented by Union delegate, Adam Bezza, at this meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    5.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Grievance Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On October 28, 2013, following Mr. Reynolds's termination, Mr. Bezza filed a grievance on Mr. Reynold's behalf challenging the termination as without just cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On November 26, 2013, Ms. Eckstein notified Mr. Reynolds that Union AO, Bruce Fleischer, was assigned to handle his grievance. In preparation for the Step 2 grievance hearing, Mr. Fleischer took various steps, including: speaking to Mr. Reynolds several times by telephone and email; speaking with Union delegates, Ms. Knehans and Mr. Bezza, as well as Ms. Ierardi and Ms. O'Neill; requesting and obtaining information from the Hospital related to its decision to terminate Mr. Reynolds; and reviewing Mr. Reynolds's personnel file, including the two Final Warnings and the PIP. Mr. Fleischer familiarized himself with details of both Final Warnings, but he did not investigate the underlying facts because they were not grieved and therefore could not be challenged independently during the grievance process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Ms. Flynn heard the Step 2 grievance on January 24, 2014. Mr. Fleischer reviewed the entirety of Mr. Reynolds's disciplinary history since the contrast incident and addressed each allegation to argue that the Hospital did not have just cause to terminate Mr. Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds initially felt supported by Mr. Fleischer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On February 1, 2014, Mr. Reynolds emailed Mr. Fleischer about the Step 2 grievance. In this email, Mr. Reynolds noted that during the hearing, Ms. Flynn asked about his first Final Warning and why it was not grieved, and that he and Mr. Fleischer had \"discussed the reason thoroughly.\" In his response, Mr. Fleischer explained that \"[u]nfortunately, we can't change the interactions that went on previously,\n   we need to figure out the best way forward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Several days later, on February 4, 2014, Ms. Flynn issued a Step 2 grievance response denying Mr. Reynolds's termination grievance. Mr. Fleischer notified Mr. Reynolds of Ms. Flynn's decision and timely moved the grievance to Step 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Step 3 grievance hearing was held on April 23, 2014. Justin May, in-house counsel for the Hospital, heard the grievance. As he did at Step 2, Mr. Fleischer reviewed the entirety of Mr. Reynolds's disciplinary history since the contrast incident and addressed each allegation to argue that the Hospital did not have just cause to terminate Mr. Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds later testified that he felt Mr. Fleischer's presentation at Step 3 was full and fair on his behalf. He also testified that he had the opportunity to give his side of the story in his own words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At the end of the Step 3 grievance hearing, Mr. Fleischer stated that the Union was open to considering a settlement agreement and Mr. May agreed to consider it upon receipt of a proposal from the Union. Mr. Fleischer raised the possibility of settlement based on an earlier conversation with Mr. Reynolds in which Mr. Reynolds expressed that he was very open to that possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On May 19, 2014, Mr. May issued a Step 3 grievance response denying Mr. Reynolds's grievance based on his disciplinary history and continued poor performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Following receipt of the Step 3 grievance response, Mr. Fleischer consulted with Ms. Leveille, Ms. Eckstein, and the Union's legal counsel to determine whether the Union should advance Reynolds' grievance to arbitration. Mr. Fleischer reviewed Mr. Reynolds's file with Ms. Eckstein and expressed his belief that the Union would not be successful at arbitration because Reynolds was a short-term employee with several disciplinary actions and performance concerns on his record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As Vice President, Ms. Eckstein was the final decision maker as to whether the Union advanced grievances to arbitration. Based on her twenty-five years of experience in processing grievances and determining their merit, Ms. Eckstein attempts to examine the record by looking at the relevant factors in the same way as an arbitrator. Ms. Eckstein spent considerable time reviewing Mr. Reynolds's case and discussing the merits with Mr. Fleischer. She did not conduct an independent investigation of the facts underlying the two Final Warnings because they were not grieved and, therefore, not relevant to her decision as to whether to proceed to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Ultimately, Ms. Eckstein determined that based on the two Final Warnings that were not grieved, the Hospital's ongoing concerns with Mr. Reynolds's poor performance as evidenced by staff and patient complaints, lack of disparate treatment, and his failure to fully comply with the terms of the PIP, the Union was unlikely to prevail at arbitration. Accordingly, Ms. Eckstein decided that the Union would not move Mr. Reynolds's grievance to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On May 23, 2014, the Union and the Hospital agreed to extend the time for submitting the grievance to arbitration to allow Mr. Reynolds to exercise his own internal appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On May 27, 2014, the Union advised Mr. Reynolds that it would not submit his grievance to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    6.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Internal Union Appeal Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On June 2, 2014, Mr. Reynolds appealed the Union's decision not to arbitrate his termination grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   While the Union was in the process of setting up Mr. Reynolds's appeal hearing, Mr. Fleischer and Mr. May discussed the possibility of settling the grievance. On or about September 2014, the Hospital and the Union reached a tentative settlement that the Union judged to be reasonable. On September 17, 2014, Mr. Fleischer telephoned Mr. Reynolds and left a message advising him that the Union and the Hospital had reached a settlement the Union considered reasonable and asked Mr. Reynolds to respond. He sent a letter to Mr. Reynolds the next day conveying the same message.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Shortly thereafter, in a letter dated September 23, 2014, Mr. Reynolds's counsel contacted the Union and alleged that \"1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers East has consistently breached its duty of fair representation to Michael Reynolds by failing to properly pursue his grievance against St. Elizabeth's Health Center.\" The next day, Ms. Eckstein responded to Mr. Reynolds's letter, including a copy of the proposed settlement agreement with the letter. She advised Mr. Reynolds that he had the option of accepting the settlement or proceeding with the internal appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Several months later, on or about January 6, 2015, Mr. Reynolds filed an action in state court, later removed to this court, in which he alleged that the Union \"failed to diligently investigate or pursue the Plaintiff's grievance at Step 2 or Step 3 of the grievance procedure,\" failed \"to timely file and pursue arbitration of the Plaintiff's grievance ...,\" and that such alleged failure was \"arbitrary, capricious and in bad faith.\" Mr. Reynolds served his complaint on the Union on or about February 12, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On February 17, 2015, the Union wrote to Mr. Reynolds's counsel and enclosed again the information concerning the proposed settlement provided in the Union's September 24, 2014 letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On February 26, 2015, the Union advised Mr. Reynolds that his internal appeal was still available and confirmed that the Hospital had agreed to arbitrate the termination in the event the Arbitration Appeals Committee directed arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On April 1, 2015, the Union obtained the Hospital's agreement, in writing, that should the Union's internal process result in a decision to arbitrate Mr. Reynolds's termination grievance, the Hospital would arbitrate the grievance without challenging the timeliness of its submission to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On April 14, 2015, the parties agreed that the Union would process Mr. Reynolds's appeal of the Union's decision not to arbitrate his termination grievance. On that same day, Mr. Reynolds agreed to dismiss\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers East &amp; Steward St. Elizabeth's Medical Center of Boston, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-10417 without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On April 23, 2015, Mr. Reynolds had his first hearing before the Arbitration Appeals Committee. At that hearing, Mr. Fleischer defended the Union's decision not to arbitrate Mr. Reynolds's termination grievance. Mr. Fleischer went through each event leading to Mr. Reynolds's termination, beginning with the first Final Warning that was not grieved, the second Final Warning that was not grieved, and Mr. Reynolds's termination for failing to comply with the terms of the PIP. He then described each stage of the grievance process, explained why the Union believed that it could not prevail at arbitration, and concluded with the fact that the Union was able to reach a tentative settlement with the Hospital that it judged to be reasonable. Ms. Leveille and Ms. Knehans were also present to answer\n   the Committee's questions about their involvement in Mr. Reynolds's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   After Mr. Fleischer's presentation, Mr. Reynolds was afforded an opportunity to present the facts surrounding his termination. Mr. Reynolds provided the Committee with an affidavit he prepared outlining his position and further explaining the facts from his perspective. The Committee asked him several questions about his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   On or around May 1, 2015, the Arbitration Appeals Committee Chair, Celia Wcislo, notified Mr. Reynolds that the Committee \"voted unanimously to uphold the Union's decision to not move forward to arbitration.\" She noted that \"the evidence and arguments [Mr. Reynolds] offered did not show that the Union ha[d] a reasonable likelihood of overturning [the Hospital's] decision that there was just cause to terminate [his] employment.\" Ms. Wcislo also advised Mr. Reynolds of his right to appeal the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   By letter dated May 4, 2015, Mr. Reynolds appealed the Arbitration Appeals Committee's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On September 18, 2015, the Mr. Reynold's second appeal hearing was held before the Union's Massachusetts Regional Hearing and Appeals Board. Mr. Fleischer again defended the Union's decision not to arbitrate Mr. Reynolds's termination grievance and Ms. Leveille was present to answer questions about her role in Mr. Reynolds's case. Mr. Reynolds provided the Appeals Board with the same affidavit he had distributed at the first appeal hearing. The Board then asked him several questions about his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   By letter dated September 23, 2015, the Appeals Board notified Mr. Reynolds that the Board \"voted unanimously to deny [his] appeal because it was clear that the union would have no reasonable likelihood of prevailing in an arbitration case.\" The letter further informed Mr. Reynolds that the Hospital was still prepared to honor the tentative settlement agreement it reached with the Union the previous year and requested that Mr. Reynolds notify the Union whether he was interested in accepting the Hospital's offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

He alleged that the Union \"failed to diligently investigate or pursue the Plaintiff's grievance at Step 2 or Step 3 of the grievance procedure,\" failed \"to pursue arbitration of the Plaintiff's grievance ...,\" and that such alleged failure was \"arbitrary, capricious, and in bad faith.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On June 15, 2016, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1441, and 1446, the Hospital removed the case to this court. The Union filed its consent to removal of the action on June 23, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In due course, the Union filed a motion for summary judgment on Count I of Mr. Reynolds's complaint. On the same day, the Hospital filed a motion for summary judgment on both Counts I and II. The Defendants have also filed a joint motion to strike portions of Mr. Reynolds's affidavit in support of his oppositions to Defendants' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defendants' Joint Motion to Strike\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants claim that portions of Mr. Reynolds's affidavit must be struck because statements asserted therein directly contradict his sworn deposition testimony and/or cannot be considered at summary judgment consistent with Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) because they constitute inadmissible hearsay, arguments, or conclusions and are not based on Mr. Reynolds's personal knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Contradictory Statements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The First Circuit has made clear that \"[w]hen an interested witness has given clear answers to unambiguous questions, he cannot create a conflict and resist summary judgment with an affidavit that is clearly contradictory, but does not give a satisfactory explanation of why the testimony is changed.\"\n   <em>\n    Colantuoni\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alfred Calcagni &amp; Sons, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411928\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/44/1/#p4\">\n    44 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4-5 (1st Cir. 1994). However, the First Circuit has clarified that \"[a] subsequent affidavit that merely explains, or amplifies upon, opaque testimony given in a previous deposition is entitled to consideration in opposition to a motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Gillen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508706\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/11/#p26\">\n    283 F.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (1st Cir. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    a. Paragraph 23\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In \u00b6 23, Mr. Reynolds asserts, \"Following the meeting, I told Kristin Knehans that I wanted to grieve the final warning.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   During his deposition, however, Mr. Reynolds was asked, \"[t]here was testimony yesterday that you didn't grieve either of the two final warnings, and you didn't ask the union to grieve either of the two final warnings, did you?\" After some clarification, his response to this question was, \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Mr. Reynold's testimony is a clear contradiction to his statement in his affidavit stating that he told Ms. Knehans that he wanted to grieve the final warning. This sentence in \u00b6 23 is stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In \u00b6 23, Mr. Reynolds also wrote, \"Kristine Knehans did not file a grievance on my behalf and I did not follow up on the matter because she told me the union thought I should be fired.\" Defendants call my attention to a portion of Mr. Reynolds's deposition testimony in which he states that he read the Union's grievance procedure that allows either the worker or the Union delegate to file a grievance on behalf of the worker. Although this testimony accurately depicts what the Union contract provided, it does not portray Mr.\n   Reynolds's understanding at the time. Immediately after the designated testimony, Mr. Reynolds was asked, \"So you understood that to mean that you could file a grievance?\" He responded, \"Not at that time, no, I didn't know how it worked. That is why I went to Kristin for help.\" Neither Defendants' designated portion of Mr. Reynolds's testimony nor this supplementary statement contradicts Mr. Reynolds's statement in his affidavit. Rather, Mr. Reynolds's response in some ways supplements his statement that Ms. Knehans did not file a grievance on his behalf. Accordingly, I do not find a contradiction here and will not strike this portion of \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    b. Paragraph 24\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In \u00b6 24, Mr. Reynolds stated, \"During the September 17, 2013 meeting, MaryEllen Leveille, who was supposed to represent me, repeatedly argued against my position and took St. Elizabeth's position.\" In his deposition, Mr. Reynolds stated that Ms. Ierardi \"wanted an agreement made that [he] felt was unfair, and felt that [Ms. Leveille] should have stood up for [him] and rejected and she didn't.\" He further indicated that after he spoke to Ms. Leveille privately about his concerns, \"she consented to advocating on [his] behalf.\" Mr. Reynolds was then specifically asked, \"And when she went into the meeting, she did so; she advocated the position that you had laid out for her?\" He replied, \"Yes.\" Ultimately, Ms. Leveille succeeded in getting a condition of the PIP changed. Mr. Reynolds's deposition, although it indicates there may have been some difference of opinion in the beginning between him and Ms. Leveille, maintains that Ms. Leveille did indeed advocate the position that he had laid out for her and did not \"argue against his position\" at the hearing. This testimony is contradicted by Mr. Reynolds's subsequent affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Mr. Reynolds attempts to obscure this specific contradiction by pointing to other instances in his deposition in which he testified that Ms. Leveille had advocated against him. For example, he contends that he testified that Ms. Leveille was present at the Step 2 meeting \"because she was advocating against [him] at the meetings.\" Mr. Reynolds fails to recognize that this meeting was different than the September 17, 2013 meeting. Consequently, I do not find his argument persuasive in this regard and, therefore, I strike this portion of \u00b6 24 as contradictory of his deposition testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    c. Paragraph 32\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In \u00b6 32 of his affidavit, Mr. Reynolds avers that, \"[o]n or about November 26, 2013, I contacted Enid Eckstein a Vice-President at SEIU and informed her that I did not want MaryEllen Leveille handling my grievance because I did not believe that she was acting on my behalf but was in fact supporting St. Elizabeth's. In response, Enid Eckstein sarcastically said, 'you expect the Union to help you after you filed a complaint with the NLRB.' I was shocked by her statement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   During his deposition Mr. Reynolds was asked, \"Did you play any role in that - with respect to making a request concerning who would represent the union in the grievance of your termination?\" He answered, \"Well, I was very dissatisfied with [Ms. Leveille's] performance, so I think I probably did request if I could have someone else.\" He indicated that he forwarded this request to Ms. Eckstein. Nothing in his testimony is inconsistent with \u00b6 32. Consequently, I cannot strike this portion of his affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    d. Paragraph 34\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In \u00b6 34, Mr. Reynolds claimed, \"On January 24, 2014, there was a Step 2 hearing on my grievance at which I was represented\n   by Bruce Fleischer. Gail Flynn, Director of Human Resources for St. Elizabeth's represented the hospital. During that hearing, the first issue raised by Gail Flynn was the Contrast Incident and I explained that I had done nothing wrong.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Defendants identify the following deposition testimony as contradicting this statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Q. If I represent to you that on January 24, 2014 you attended a step two grievance meeting with Bruce Fleischer representing the union, and Gail Flynn representing the hospital, do you recall that meeting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   A. Those were the only ones there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Q. (Nods head.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   A. No, I don't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Q. So I am asking about, I just want [to] be sure that you have told us everything that you remember, if anything, about the step two meeting with Gail Flynn and Bruce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   A. No, I don't have anything further I can offer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   This designation does not contradict what Mr. Reynolds stated in his affidavit. Although he did not remember much of the Step 2 meeting at the time of his deposition, there is no reason that he could not have remembered this meeting at a later time, i.e., when he was drafting his affidavit. Because I find no contradiction between this statement and Mr. Reynolds's affidavit, I will not strike this portion of his affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    e. Paragraph 35\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In \u00b6 35, Mr. Reynolds maintains, \"On April 23, 2014, there was a Step 3 hearing on my grievance at which I was once again represented by Bruce Fleischer. Justin May was the hearing officer for St. Elizabeth's. Once again, one of the main issue[s] raised by the hearing officer was the contrast incident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Defendants have focused my attention on the phrase \"by the hearing officer.\" Although Mr. Reynolds's identified deposition testimony does not indicate that Mr. May raised the contrast incident, he does indicate that Mr. Fleischer presented the contrast in pregnancy policies to Mr. May. In his deposition, Mr. Reynolds does not unambiguously state that Mr. May was the one to raise this issue. On the other hand, his testimony cannot be read to indicate that it was Mr. Fleischer who raised the issue. Therefore, I find no disabling inconsistencies between Mr. Fleischer's statement and his deposition and will not strike this portion of his affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <em>\n    f. Paragraph 37\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In \u00b6 37, Mr. Reynolds asserts, \"[a]fter I received the [Step 3 grievance] response, I told Bruce Fleischer that I wanted to arbitrate my grievance. Bruce Fleischer told me he didn't believe in arbitration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   During his deposition, Mr. Reynolds was shown his handwritten notes. Several questions were asked of him regarding the meeting he had with Mr. Fleischer. Mr. Reynolds's attention was focused on the first line of his notes in which he wrote, \"Bruce F. states he doesn't believe arbitration.\" He was asked whether he recalled what the end of that sentence was and his reply was, \"No.\" Mr. Reynolds's notes are in alignment with his statement in his affidavit. There is no reason for me to find inconsistency on grounds that he could not recall what the end of the sentence was. Accordingly, I will not strike this portion of his affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hearsay Statements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Rule 56(c)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that \"[a]n affidavit or declaration used to support or\n   oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.\" Therefore, it is well-established that \"[a] genuine issue of material fact can be created only by materials of evidentiary quality.\"\n   <em>\n    Hannon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Beard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5651391\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/45/#p49\">\n    645 F.3d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (1st Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).

By September 17, 2014, Mr. Fleischer, on behalf of the Union, and the Hospital had reached a tentative settlement that the Union considered reasonable. Mr. Reynolds did not respond to Mr. Fleischer's attempt to contact him regarding the settlement. Rather, on September 23, 2014, by letter, Mr. Reynolds, through his counsel, accused the Union of a breach of its duty of fair representation \"by failing to properly pursue his grievance against St. Elizabeth's Health Center.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   A similar situation was presented in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   where the \"appellant had notice of the union's alleged wrongdoing no later than March 2, 1982, about ten months before he filed suit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1539610\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/779/93/#p94\">\n    779 F.2d at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is enough to bar Mr. Reynold's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   While it is true that Mr. Reynold's initiated the internal appeals process in June 2, 2014, I do not find that his internal appeals process had any tolling effect between September 23, 2014, and April 14, 2015. This is due to the fact he was not diligently pursuing his internal appeals process, but was, rather, seeking redress through litigation. It was only after voluntarily dismissing his first complaint that he diligently pursued the appeals process and tolling began. By that time, however, more than six months had elapsed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the courthouse doors had presumptively closed. Thus, I find that Mr. Reynolds' claim is time barred. Notwithstanding my decision regarding the preclusive effect of the statute of limitations, in the interest of completeness, I will analyze Mr. Reynolds's substantive claims below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Hospital's Breach of the CBA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Mr. Reynolds contends, without significant citation to the record, that there is overwhelming evidence that his termination by the Hospital was without just cause and, therefore, violated the CBA. He indicates that \"[t]here is little doubt that [he] was terminated as a result of the Contrast Incident.\" He maintains that, following the Contrast Incident, Ms. Ierardi made it clear that she wanted to terminate him and everything that occurred after the incident was merely pretext to support his wrongful termination. He states that he was \"the scapegoat,\" and from that point on, Ms. Ierardi \"engaged in an obvious scheme to harass [him] into quitting his job and when she set about establishing a record of bogus claims of wrongdoing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   It is well settled that \"[w]hether the undisputed facts in a specific case establish - or fail to establish - proper cause for discharge within the contemplation of a given CBA is a question of law (and, thus, a question for the court).\"\n   <em>\n    Mulvihill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533914\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/15/#p19\">\n    335 F.3d at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). \"[T]he question of whether proper cause exists to sustain the employee's discharge intersects with the question of whether the record contains substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533914\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/15/#p19\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Under the CBA here, the Hospital had the right to discipline, suspend or discharge a worker for just cause. The record demonstrates that Mr. Reynolds was terminated for failing to comply with the PIP that was put in place as a result of the pattern of escalating performance deficiencies following a three-month period during which Mr. Reynolds was issued two separate Final Warnings. The record was developed after the Hospital received complaints from staff members and patients. Mr. Reynolds attempts to excuse his alleged deficiencies but fails to confront the fact that these events, nevertheless, occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The Hospital gave Mr. Reynolds ample opportunity to show improvement, however, he failed to do so. The Hospital had just cause to terminate Mr. Reynolds, who had received two Final Warnings in the course of less than three months and repeatedly refused to comply with the terms of his PIP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   I find that there is substantial evidentiary support to sustain the Hospital's decision to terminate Mr. Reynolds.

Indeed, despite the fact that the Hospital had just cause to terminate his employment, discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Union was successful in negotiating a settlement agreement on behalf of Mr. Reynolds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Mr. Reynolds tries to pick holes in the Union's representation. For example, he asserts that Ms. Leveille apparently conceded to the Hospital giving him a Final Warning. But he fails to recognize that this was effective advocacy to secure his continued employment with the Hospital. In any event, Ms. Leveille made clear to Ms. Ierardi that the Union would vigorously challenge termination should the Hospital discharge Mr. Reynolds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Additionally, Mr. Reynolds also labels Ms. Knehans \"a woefully unprepared delegate\" because at the July 26, 2013, meeting she made no effort to argue on his behalf and that she did not file a grievance on his behalf after he requested. However, in his deposition testimony, Mr. Reynolds made it clear that he did not ask the Union to grieve either of his two Final Warnings. He takes fault with her lack of knowledge of filing a grievance. However, as he indicated in his deposition, Mr. Reynolds did not ask for one to be filed, and as a result I cannot say that Ms. Knehans' conduct was so far outside a wide range of reasonableness as to be irrational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Additionally, Mr. Reynolds contends that Mr. Fleischer failed to take any steps to investigate the Contrast Incident. But Mr. Reynolds did not grieve the first Final Warning concerning that matter. The record demonstrates that Mr. Fleischer investigated as much was necessary. For example, during the grievance proceedings, Mr. Fleischer had several conversations with the parties involved in the matter, including Mr. Reynolds, Ms. Knehans, Mr. Bezza, Ms. Ierardi, and Ms. O'Neill. Moreover, it is undisputed that Mr. Reynolds's grievance was properly and timely advanced to both Step 2 and Step 3 of the grievance procedure. Specifically, for the Step 2 meeting, Mr. Fleischer reviewed the entirety of Mr. Reynolds's disciplinary history since the contrast incident and addressed each allegation to argue that the Hospital did not have just cause to terminate Mr. Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds testified that Mr. Fleischer \"seemed very sympathetic to the situation, and he was the first one from the union that had seemed to see the logic in [his] complaint.\" Mr. Reynolds initially felt supported by Mr. Fleischer. For Step 3, Mr. Fleischer again reviewed the entirety of Mr. Reynolds's disciplinary history since the contrast incident and addressed each allegation to argue that the Hospital did not have just cause to terminate Mr. Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds testified that he felt Mr. Fleischer's presentation was full and fair on his behalf. He also testified that he had the opportunity to give his side of the story in his own words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Having taken the entire record under consideration, I find that the Union conducted well more than a minimum investigation on behalf of Mr. Reynolds. I cannot conclude that the Union's actions here are arbitrary because I do not find the Union's behavior to be outside a wide range of recognized reasonableness, or otherwise irrational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Finally, Mr. Reynolds further objects to the Union's refusal to take his case\n   to arbitration. However, he fails to recognize that \"[a] union is under no duty to arbitrate a grievance that it honestly and in good faith believes lacks merit.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaparro-Febus\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Int'l Longshoremen Ass'n, Local 1575\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644086\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/325/#p331\">\n    983 F.2d 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331 (1st Cir. 1992) (citation omitted). Rather, if a union were forced to arbitrate \"a case that it felt had little basis in the contract, it arguably would jeopardize its credibility with the employer for purposes of later, more supportable, disputes with management policies, instituted on behalf of all members.\"\n   <em>\n    Berrigan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greyhound Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552353\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/782/295/#p298\">\n    782 F.2d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (1st Cir. 1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The record here demonstrates that the Union spent considerable time on Mr. Reynolds's case and adequately represented his interests up until the time it, in good faith, believed his case lacked merit and could not succeed at arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Mr. Reynolds was a short-term employee with two Final Warnings on his record. He was additionally placed on a PIP that required him to maintain a respectful rapport with the Hospital staff and patients, provide patients with prompt and professional service, refrain from creating and disseminating documents listing duties in an attempt to direct the work of his colleagues over whom he had no supervisory authority, and to meet with his supervisor weekly to review his progress. Mr. Reynolds failed to improve. He was ultimately terminated for a pattern of escalating performance deficiencies and his refusal to attend future review sessions, thereby violating the essential elements of the PIP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Rather than acknowledging the deficiencies with his employment conduct, Mr. Reynolds takes the conclusory position that the Union's \"refusal to arbitrate [his] grievance was not in good faith and was most likely motivated by the fact that [he] had made a complaint to the NLRB.\" This speculative statement, without more, does not reframe my analysis. I recognize that he claims Ms. Eckstein stated, \"you expect the Union to help you after you filed a complaint with the NLRB.\" This statement is without meaningful significance. There is no evidence to suggest that Mr. Eckstein had a role in deciding the outcome of Mr. Reynold's appeals or that Mr. Reynolds was not afforded fair, impartial hearings. Instead, the record fully establishes that the Union did take all justifiable steps to assist him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   I find that the Union acted well within the broad discretion afforded it in determining the merits of a grievance. I conclude that the decision not to arbitrate Mr. Reynolds's claim did not violate the Union's duty of fair representation and I find no error with said decision. Therefore, I grant Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to this count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendants' joint motion [Dkt. No. 42] to strike be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, and that Defendants' motions [Dkt.
