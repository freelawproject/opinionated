For the reasons expressed below, Defendants' motions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs, Hays Tug &amp; Launch Services, Inc. (\"Hays Tug\"), Pollution Solutions of New Jersey, LLC d/b/a River Services (\"River Services\"), McAllister Towing of Philadelphia, Inc. (\"McAllister Towing\") and General Marine &amp; Industrial Services, Inc. (\"GMIS\"), provided services during the 2015 Tall Ship Challenge (\"Tall Ship event\"), which was organized and managed by Defendant Draw Events, LLC (\"Draw Events\"). Draw Events was under contract with the event hosts, Interested Parties Cooper's Ferry Partnership and the Adventure Aquarium, as well as the Delaware River Waterfront Corporation (\"DRWC\") and the Independence Seaport Museum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Draw Events subcontracted with: Hays Tug to provide a barge and towing services; McAllister Towing to provide towing services to move vessels within the Delaware River; River Services to provide a barge, towing, repair services and supplies required to maintain the barges and assist in the emergency recovery, transportation and repair of \"Big Mama Duck,\" a large floating rubber duck that deflated in the water during the event; and GMIS to provide a crane and labor to transport, recover and repair \"Big Mama Duck.\" Plaintiffs claim that they have not been paid for their services by Draw Events despite repeated demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a result of a dispute regarding unpaid invoices from the Tall Ship event, on March 9, 2017, Draw Events filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (2:17-cv-1050-MSG), based on diversity jurisdiction against Cooper's Ferry, DRWC, Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation, Adventure Aquarium, and Independence Seaport Museum (\"Tall Ship Litigation\"). On January 29, 2018, after settlement had been reached in the Tall Ship Litigation but a few days before the paperwork was finalized, Plaintiffs here sought to intervene in the Tall Ship Litigation seeking to assert a claim for their unpaid invoices. On February 7, 2018, Judge Mitchell J. Goldberg, U.S.D.J., denied their motion to intervene determining, in part, that their attempt to intervene was untimely. Judge Goldberg dismissed the action the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 13, 2018, Plaintiffs filed suit in this Court, contending admiralty and maritime jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , F.R.C.P. 9(h), and Supplemental Admiralty Rule B (\"Rule B\"). On that same date, this Court granted Plaintiffs' motion to serve process of a maritime garnishment pursuant to Rule B, which provides: \"If a defendant is not found within the district when a verified complaint praying for attachment and the affidavit required by Rule B(1)(b) are filed, a verified complaint may contain a prayer for process to attach the defendant's tangible or intangible personal property - up to the amount sued for - in the hands of garnishees named in the process.\" Plaintiffs sought to garnish any settlement funds from the Tall Ship litigation in the hands of Cooper's Ferry and Adventure Aquarium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To that end, Plaintiffs served Cooper's Ferry with a writ of maritime attachment and garnishment at 3:39 p.m. on February 13, 2018. Plaintiffs served Adventure Aquarium with a writ of maritime attachment and garnishment at 3:44 p.m. on February 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time the writs were served, the $ 50,000 check made out to Draw Events by Cooper's Ferry for the settlement of the Tall Ship Litigation - the \"property\" of Draw Events that Plaintiffs sought to garnish - was in the New Jersey office of the attorney for the defendants in the Tall Ship Litigation. Cooper's Ferry had prepared the check on February 5, 2018, drawn on its account, on behalf of all the defendants in the Tall Ship Litigation. Counsel for Cooper's Ferry received the check in her office some time before February 9, 2018. At 4:04 p.m. on February 13, 2018, FedEx picked up the package containing the settlement check from the attorney's office destined for Draw Events in Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the writ of attachment successfully garnished the $ 50,000 because (1) it was still in the hands of Cooper's Ferry - the garnishee - by way of its attorney, when it was served, and (2) the funds did not transfer from Cooper's Ferry's possession until Draw Events deposited it several days later and the checked subsequently cleared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In contrast, Draw Events and the garnishees Cooper's Ferry and Adventure Aquarium argue that the writs of attachment did not successfully garnish the $ 50,000 because it was not in the garnishees' possession when they were served with the writs. Rather, it had been out of Cooper's Ferry's control since February 5, 2018 when it was sent to its attorney for transmittal to Draw Events.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Draw Events further argues that without a valid writ of attachment to its property, Plaintiffs would be required to establish personal jurisdiction. Draw Events also argues that the funds Plaintiffs have endeavored to attach, as well as their underlying dispute, are basic contract disputes and not maritime in nature, and therefore with no valid claim sounding in admiralty, the Rule B writs of attachment were unavailable to Plaintiffs in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition to the other bases for dismissal of Plaintiffs' complaint, Defendant Craig Samborski, the sole member of\n   Draw Events, seeks his dismissal on an individual basis because Draw Events, and not Samborski individually, entered into the relevant contracts with the parties. He has also filed a motion for sanctions for being named a defendant individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs have opposed Defendants' motions on all bases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Of course, here Plaintiffs did not seek to arrest a ship or its cargo, but Rule B attachments are not so narrow. The general point holds true; that it is the nature of Rule B attachments that the property's presence in the district - no pun intended - be fleeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For the reasons set forth below this Court will not vacate the writs of attachment at this time and will deny Defendants' motions without prejudice.

Whether Defendants can be found within this District\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We start this analysis with what appears to this Court to be an important distinction. Although related issues both factually and legally, whether a defendant may be \"found\" within the District for purposes of Rule B and whether the same defendant may be subject to personal jurisdiction in the forum are distinct issues. It seems likely that a defendant not subject to personal jurisdiction will not be found within the District for purposes of Rule B attachments. But it does not follow that the converse is necessarily true; i.e., that the property of a defendant may not be attached under Rule B if the defendant is subject to the specific or general jurisdiction of the Court. This is because being \"found\" is a narrow factual test related to traditional concepts of service of process and distinct from the more general and abstract principles of personal jurisdiction minimum contacts and due process. Stated directly, a defendant may be subject to personal jurisdiction in the forum but at the same time not be \"found\" under Rule B therefore subjecting its property to attachment under the Court's admiralty jurisdiction. Although the case law regarding this distinction is not uniform or even clear, in the absence of controlling authority in this Circuit, this Court views considering these issues separately to be the better rule and will apply it here.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    British Marine PLC v.

The bank argued that it was the law firm's duty to stop payment on the check once the writ of attachment was served on it, while the law firm argued that it had lost possession of the funds once it wrote and mailed the check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Florida Supreme Court determined under Florida's garnishment statute and the related provisions of Florida's Uniform Commercial Code (\"U.C.C.\") that \"funds remain in the garnishee's possession and control, even though a check has been written and delivered to the payee, if the check has not been presented for payment,\" and the Florida \"statute imposes a duty on garnishees to issue a stop payment order on a check that has not yet been presented for payment if a garnishee has the ability to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Arnold, Matheny and Eagan, P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8243826\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/982/628/#p631\">\n    982 So.2d at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While instructive and factually similar,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff offers no explanation as to why a New Jersey federal court sitting in admiralty should choose a Florida Supreme Court case interpreting Florida's version of the UCC as the rule of decision. Indeed, the Court has searched the submitted briefs and can find no case cited by either side that squarely addresses the issue now before the Court - who owns funds behind a check written out and held by an agent acting at the direction of the sender with instructions to deliver the check to the payee, but not yet delivered. Nor do the parties explain whether the Court should apply federal common law, analogous bodies of federal law such as bankruptcy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   New Jersey statutory law or case law, of\n   the law of some other state such as Minnesota to the issue at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Cases cited by the Defendants are not particularly helpful. Defendants set out a long string cite of state court decisions from states other than New Jersey that stand for the proposition that where a garnishee has made out and delivered the check to the payee there is no obligation to stop payment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Central Security &amp; Alarm Co., Inc. v.

Unlike the cases cited by Defendants, the check at issue here had not yet been delivered (although subject to instructions to do so) to the payee but remained in the hands of the payor's agent. Defendants make no effort to explain why cases involving actual delivery of the check should govern the facts of this case where no delivery has occurred. And like Plaintiff, they make no effort to explain why these disparate state court decisions presumably applying the statutory and common law of their jurisdictions should be persuasive authority to a District of New Jersey court exercising admiralty jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Consequently, on the current state of the parties' briefing, the Court finds that Defendants have not met their burden of showing that the third requirement for a valid writ of attachment is lacking such that the extinguishment of the writ is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Whether there is a statutory or general maritime law proscription to the attachment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The U.S. Supreme Court has instructed, \"To ascertain whether a contract is a maritime one, we cannot look to whether a ship or other vessel was involved in the dispute, as we would in a putative maritime tort case. Nor can we simply look to the place of the contract's formation or performance. Instead, the answer depends upon the nature and character of the contract, and the true criterion is whether it has reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    Norfolk Southern Ry. v.

Defendants' brief belies their own contention, however. Defendants say:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-51\">\n   In the case of Plaintiff, Hays Tug, the rental of the floating dock should not be considered a vessel or a maritime use of the structure. The dock merely sat next to a pier and allowed for the safe entrance and exit of the event goers from the Tall Ships.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-52\">\n   Similarly, the majority of the amounts sought by Plaintiff, Pollution Solutions of New Jersey, LLC doing business as River Services was for repair work to one of these floating docks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, the amounts sought by Plaintiff General Marine and Industrial Services, Inc. were for a crane that merely placed and removed a gangway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   None of these items or activities qualify as maritime and consequently, each of these Plaintiffs should not be permitted to sustain these various causes of action\n   in Federal Court under maritime jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Docket No. 24-1 at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Adding the word \"merely\" before the description of Plaintiffs' services does not negate the unquestionably maritime nature of those activities. Plaintiffs cite numerous cases to support that the chartering and towing of barges, the services to repair or maintain barges, the towing and servicing of vessels, the rental and servicing of docks, and the use of a crane to retrieve a deflated vessel are all activities that are maritime in nature.\n   <em>\n    The ALLIGATOR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3666073,1366646\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/161/37/\">\n    161 F.3d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1908) ;\n   <em>\n    Marina One, Inc. v.

Judge Goldberg granted Plaintiffs' motion to serve a maritime garnishment, but at the same time issued an order to show cause as to why the writ of attachment and garnishment should not be vacated. (2:18-cv-00601-MSG, Docket No. 10.) On February 16, 2018, Judge Goldberg vacated the writs of attachment and directed the garnishees' counsel to provide information on the timing of the service of the writs on the garnishees, and when counsel mailed out the settlement check. (2:18-cv-00601-MSG, Docket No. 13.) After receiving garnishees' counsel's submission, on February 22, 2018, Judge Goldberg ordered Plaintiffs to notify the court within 14 days how they wished to proceed in that matter, specifying \"whether they wish to proceed against Defendants on an\n    <em>\n     in personam\n    </em>\n    basis; whether they wish[ ] to seek recovery through this action against the Garnishees named in their Verified Complaint; or whether they wish to dismiss this action.\" (2:18-cv-00601-MSG, Docket No. 19.) Plaintiffs responded on March 7, 2018, requesting that the Pennsylvania action be stayed or held in suspense while they pursued discovery in the New Jersey action. (2:18-cv-00601-MSG, Docket No. 21.) Samborski filed a motion for sanctions similar to the one filed here on August 10, 2018, which is still pending as of the date of this Opinion.

The Court is unpersuaded on the present record that it lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendants. Plaintiffs' claims arise out of Draw Events' contract with New Jersey entities Cooper's Ferry and the Adventure Aquarium, its subcontract with Plaintiffs, and its organization and management of the Tall Ship event held at least in part in New Jersey. Those claims and these contacts together suggest that Draw Events and its principal may be subject to specific jurisdiction in this Court and have sufficient contacts with New Jersey to exercise personal jurisdiction over them without violating traditional due process principles.
