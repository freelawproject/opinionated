(\"Nestl\u00e9\") alleging a violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (\"Chapter 93A\") (Count One) and a claim for unjust enrichment (Count Two) based on Nestl\u00e9's failure to disclose on its product packaging that its chocolate products likely contain cocoa beans farmed by child and slave labor. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (hereinafter \"Complaint\" or \"Compl.\") ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Currently before the Court is Nestl\u00e9's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). [ECF No. 19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   It is beyond dispute that the use of child and slave labor in the production of cocoa in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (also known as the Ivory Coast) is widespread, reprehensible, and tragic. Moreover, \"[t]he fact that major international corporations source ingredients for their products from supply chains involving slavery and the worst forms of child labor raises significant ethical questions.\"\n   <em>\n    McCoy v.

App'x 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2018). The question before the Court, however, is whether Nestl\u00e9 is liable under Massachusetts law for failing to disclose the labor practices of its suppliers on its product\n   packaging at the point of sale. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that it is not, and Nestl\u00e9's motion to dismiss is\n   <em>\n    GRANTED\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's Complaint alleges the following relevant facts, which the Court accepts as true for purposes of this motion. Nestl\u00e9 is one of the largest and most profitable food manufacturers in the United States. Compl. \u00b6 2. Nestl\u00e9 markets and distributes chocolate products that are made with cocoa beans sourced from West Africa, including Nestl\u00e9 Crunch, 100 Grand, Baby Ruth, Butterfingers, Nestl\u00e9 Toll House, Nestl\u00e9 Hot Cocoa Mix, Nestl\u00e9 Milk Chocolate, and Nestl\u00e9 seasonal confections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Some of the cocoa beans that Nestl\u00e9 sources from West Africa come from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, where children and forced laborers engage in dangerous tasks while harvesting cocoa, including burning and clearing fields with machetes, spraying pesticides, using sharp tools to break open cocoa pods, and carrying heavy loads of cocoa pods and water.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 5-6. Some children become laborers after being sold by their parents to traffickers, while others are kidnapped and then sold into conditions of bonded labor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. The children who labor on cocoa farms in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire are frequently not paid for their work, forced to work long hours, held against their will on isolated farms, and punished by their employers with physical abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The abuses suffered by children and forced laborers in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire are well-documented, and Nestl\u00e9 has acknowledged that it sources cocoa in areas where such practices occur.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-9, 21-23, 25-49. In 2001, Nestl\u00e9 and other chocolate manufacturers signed the Protocol for the Growing and Processing of Cocoa Beans and Their Derivative Products in a Manner that Complies with ILO Convention 182 Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor (\"Harkin-Engel Protocol\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The Harkin-Engel Protocol sought to develop and implement a public certification program to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the growing of cocoa beans and their derivative products by July 1, 2005, but to date, Nestl\u00e9 and the other signatories have not yet established this system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31-33. In 2009, Nestl\u00e9 launched the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan to help eliminate the use of child and slave labor in the Ivorian cocoa industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. In 2012, Nestl\u00e9 partnered with the Fair Labor Association to investigate whether children were working on cocoa farms that supplied Nestl\u00e9's factories.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. After the Fair Labor Association determined that children were, indeed, working on cocoa farms in its supply chain, Nestl\u00e9 pledged to create a robust monitoring and remedy scheme to eradicate child labor in its supply chain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A 2015 audit by the Fair Labor Association, however, demonstrated that Nestl\u00e9 has not yet achieved this goal, and that child and forced laborers continue to work at farms connected to Nestl\u00e9.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nestl\u00e9 does not disclose any information about the child and slave labor practices in its supply chain on its chocolate product packaging at the point of sale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 54-56. On some of its products, Nestl\u00e9 includes information about the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan that states, \"[t]he Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan works with UTZ Certified to help improve the lives of cocoa farmers and the quality of their products, www.nestlecocoplan.com.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-56. Plaintiff, who purchased Nestl\u00e9's chocolate products from various retail stores including Stop &amp; Shop in Plymouth, Massachusetts from 2014 through the present, claims that she and other consumers would not have purchased or paid as much for Nestl\u00e9's products\n   had it disclosed the truth about the child and slave labor in its supply chain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 102. The Complaint alleges that Nestl\u00e9's omissions are deceptive and unfair under Chapter 93A, and that Nestl\u00e9 has been unjustly enriched by its conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-99, 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on February 12, 2018, seeking to represent herself and all other consumers who purchased Nestl\u00e9's chocolate products in Massachusetts in the last four years.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.

[ECF No. 26; Mars Action, ECF No. 25; Hershey Action, ECF No. 27]. On July 23, 2018, Plaintiff filed a sur-reply brief in all three cases.

The Commission explained that there are two circumstances where an actionable deception theory can reach a seller's omissions. \"First, it can be deceptive to tell only half the truth, and to omit the rest,\" such as \"where a seller fails to disclose qualifying information necessary to prevent one of his affirmative statements from creating a misleading impression.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20F.T.C.%20949\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20F.T.C.%20949\">\n    at 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, it can be deceptive \"for a seller to simply remain silent, if he does so under circumstances that constitute an implied but false representation,\" such as where a misleading impression \"arise[s] from the physical appearance of the product, or from the circumstances of a specific transaction, or ... based on ordinary consumer expectations as to the irreducible minimum performance standards of a particular class of good.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20F.T.C.%20949\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20F.T.C.%20949\">\n    at 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Commission found that International Harvester's conduct was a pure omission and did not fall into either category of actionable omissions because, under the circumstances, the company's silence said nothing deceptive about fuel geysering.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20F.T.C.%20949\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20F.T.C.%20949\">\n    at 1059-60, 1062-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Commission then held that, although \"pure omissions may lead to erroneous consumer beliefs if consumer had a false, pre-existing conception which the seller failed to correct,\" they are not deceptive under the FTCA for two policy reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   First, we could not declare pure omissions to be deceptive without expanding that concept virtually beyond limits. Individual consumers may have erroneous preconceptions about issues as diverse as the entire range of human error, and it would be both impractical and very costly to require corrective information on all such points. Second, pure omissions do not presumptively or generally reflect a deliberate act on the part of the seller, and so we have no basis for concluding, without further analysis, that an order requiring corrective disclosure would necessarily engender positive net benefits for consumers or be in the public interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   If we were to ignore this last consideration, and were to proceed under a deception theory without a cost-benefit analysis, it would surely lead to perverse outcomes. The number of facts that may be material to consumers-and on which they may have prior misconceptions-is literally infinite. Consumers may wish to know about the life expectancy of clothes, or the sodium content of canned beans, or the canner's policy on trade with Chile. Since the seller will have no way of knowing in advance which disclosure is important to any particular consumer, he will have to make complete disclosures to all. A television ad would be completely buried under such disclaimers, and even a full-page newspaper ad would hardly be sufficient for the purpose. For example, there are literally dozens of ways in which one can be injured while riding a tractor, not all of them obvious before the fact, and under a simple deception analysis these would presumably all require affirmative disclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The resulting costs and burden on advertising communication would very possibly represent a net harm for consumers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20F.T.C.%20949\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20F.T.C.%20949\">\n    at 1059-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although the Court declines to hold that pure omissions as a matter of law are never actionable under Chapter 93A's deception prong, the Court finds the Commission's omissions framework to be instructive when considering whether a seller's nondisclosures have the potential to mislead Massachusetts consumers under Chapter 93A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court here finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a deception claim under Chapter 93A because it is not plausible that Nestl\u00e9's failure to disclose information about the labor practices in its supply chain at the point of sale could have the \"capacity to mislead consumers, acting reasonably under the circumstances, to act differently from the way they otherwise would have acted (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to entice a reasonable consumer to purchase the product).\"\n   <em>\n    Aspinall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=813%20N.E.2d%20476\">\n    813 N.E.2d at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
