C. FELDMAN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is the government's motion to strike the third-party petitions by Mario Zelaya and Susana Tirado-Zelaya and its request that the Court enter a final order of forfeiture. For the following reasons, the motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This ancillary proceeding adjudicating third party rights to forfeitable property arises from a Honduran money laundering conspiracy. On April 27, 2018, Carlos Alberto Zelaya Rojas was indicted in a 12-count indictment charging him with conspiracy, money laundering, impairing a court's jurisdiction over property subject to forfeiture, impeding an official proceeding, and perjury. Two months later, the government filed a one-count superseding bill of information, which charged Rojas with conspiracy to commit money laundering; the bill included a notice of forfeiture listing the nine parcels of real estate in St. Tammany Parish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 27, 2018, Rojas pled guilty to the one-count conspiracy charge. In the Factual Basis, which Rojas adopted under oath during the rearraignment proceeding, he acknowledged under oath that the nine parcels of real estate in St. Tammany Parish, which were identified in the Notice of Forfeiture contained in the superseding bill of information, were purchased by him with criminal proceeds as part of the conspiracy between himself and his brother,\n   Mario Zelaya (formerly identified in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator, \"Honduran Public Official 1\"), the former executive director of the national social security agency of Honduras (the Honduran Institute of Social Security, or HISS), and others, to launder bribe payments and public funds embezzled from HISS. Rojas signed all relevant closing documents for the nine properties and directed the financial transactions used to purchase them. Rojas further acknowledged in the Factual Basis that he and his brother, Mario Zelaya, went to great lengths to make the overseas bribe payments appear to be legitimate commercial transactions by creating false and back-dated documents such as a fake business loan contract in the amount of $ 1,080,000.000 (fake loan contract) and a fake Contract to Promise to Buy and Sell approximately $ 300,000 of real estate in Valle de Angeles, Honduras (fake purchase agreement). The fake loan contract was intended to disguise the illegal source of funds for six of the parcels in St. Tammany, including the used car lot. The fake purchase agreement was intended to cover up the illegal source of funds used to buy the other three properties, which are the ones at issue in this ancillary proceeding: 425 Depre Street; 717 Heavens Drive, Unit 8; and 724 Heavens Drive, Unit 4. Carlos Zelaya agreed that he had \"provided false written answers under penalty of perjury\" when he stated in response to interrogatories in a related civil action in this Court that the fake loan contract was a genuine contract. Rojas also acknowledged that Honduran Public Official 1 (his brother, Mario Zelaya) was a central coconspirator in his crime. Rojas was sentenced on October 3, 2018 to serve 46 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Meanwhile, on July 5, 2018, the Court issued a preliminary order of forfeiture, which mandated that the nine parcels of real estate in St. Tammany Parish shall be forfeited to the United States, subject to public notice and adjudication of any third-party ancillary petitions. The government served notice of the order on all interested parties and published notice of the forfeiture order online between July 10 and August 9, 2018 as required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (n).

Susana Tirado-Zelaya did not amend her petition. While at least one court considering a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition has held that such a defect can easily be cured by amendment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds no reason to create an exception to the statutory requirements. To do so would countenance something less than strict compliance. The notice served on the claimants clearly informed them that any petition must be timely filed (within 30 days of receipt of the notice delivered on July 30, 2018) and that the petition signed under penalty of perjury. Susana Tirado failed to sign her petition under penalty of perjury. Her petition must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even assuming Mario Zelaya's amendment satisfies the sworn requirement, the amendment violates the statutory deadline contained in Section 853(n)(2). In fact, the deadline had expired months before Mario Zelaya submitted his December 2018 amendment (which he styles as a response to and petition to dismiss the government's\n   motion to strike). Accordingly, Mario Zelaya's petition must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, she does not assert that she has any legal interest in any of the properties. The Court is not without sympathy for her plight, but she fails to allege any facts that would state a plausible claim for relief. Her petition must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ms. Tirado's husband's petition fares no better.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Petitioner Mario Zelaya is not only the defendant's brother, but he is also unindicted co-conspirator identified in the factual basis forming the basis of the defendant's guilty plea as Honduran Public Official 1. Because the text of the statute allows \"[a]ny person, other than the defendant\" to assert a legal interest in forfeitable property, the Court assumes that Mario Zelaya may petition to assert a legal interest in the property. Further assuming that his failure to initially swear to the statements in his petition under penalty of perjury was cured by his amendment including such a statement, Mario Zelaya nevertheless fails to identify sufficient facts that would give rise to a legal interest in the three properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mario Zelaya submits that the Depre Street and Heavens Drive properties are not subject to forfeiture because there was\n   no crime. In other words, Mario Zelaya seeks to contradict the facts his brother, Carlos, acknowledged under oath when he pled guilty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mario Zelaya's petition fails allege either (a) an interest acquired prior to the conduct for which Carlos Zelaya was convicted, nor (b) a subsequent interest perfected in a bona fide transaction without knowledge of the criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As a threshold matter, Mario Zelaya's arguments that the property was not initially forfeitable has no bearing in this ancillary proceeding. The only question is whether the petitioner states a claim under either Section 853(n)(6)(A) or (B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mario Zelaya argues that three properties at issue were his and were purchased with legitimate funds disconnected from the bribery scheme underlying his brother's conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering. Mario Zelaya's argument fails to state a claim because he fails to allege that he had an interest in the property\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Carlos conspired (incidentally, with Mario) to commit money laundering. Section 853(n)(6)(A) requires that the petitioner show that his \"interest was superior to any ... interest of the defendant\n   <em>\n    at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added). As the First Circuit recently observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   To prevail on the merits under section 853(n)(6)(A), a third party must prove that, at the time of the acts giving rise to the forfeiture were committed, the right to the property to be forfeited was either vested in him rather than the defendant or that his interest in it was superior to the defendant's interest. This provision cannot be read in a vacuum but, rather, must be read in tandem with section 853(c). The latter provision, which embodies the relation-back doctrine, specifies that the right to all property used in committing, and any proceeds derived from, a criminal offense, \"vests in the United States upon the commission of the act giving rise to [the] forfeiture.\" It follows inexorably that a third party asserting an interest in forfeited property must establish that his interest in that specific property existed before the commission of the crime that led to the forfeiture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Catala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275136\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/6/#p8\">\n    870 F.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10 (1st Cir. 2017) (internal citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, given that forfeitable property vests in the government immediately upon the commission of a criminal act, a third party may prevail under 853(n)(6)(A) only if he establishes that he had a legal\n   interest in the forfeited property before the underlying crime was committed -- that is, before the government's interest was vested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Here, then, Mario Zelaya must show that his interest in the three forfeited properties existed before his brother, Carlos Zelaya, engaged in the conspiracy to commit money laundering that prompted his ultimate conviction. Section 853(c)'s relation-back doctrine stands in Mario Zelaya's way. The government's interest in the properties vested at the time of the offense under the relation back doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The acts giving rise to the forfeiture here include those constituting Carlos Alberto Zelaya Rojas's conspiracy (a conspiracy, which, incidentally, involved his brother as an unindicted co-conspirator, who is the petitioner here, and others) to launder criminal proceeds; and those acts began \"at a time unknown, but prior to December 1, 2011[;]\"\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Mario Zelaya purchased the three properties at issue with what he says were legitimate funds. There is no dispute that the contested properties came into Mario Zelaya's possession only after the start of the money laundering conspiracy among his brother and Mario Zelaya himself; the conspiracy began in 2011, and the three properties that are the subject of the present petition were purchased in January and March 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Mario Zelaya fails to state a plausible claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court finds that Susana Tirado and Mario Zelaya have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.

Any such property that is subsequently transferred to a person other than the defendant may be the subject of a special verdict of forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered forfeited to the United States, unless the transferee establishes in a hearing pursuant to subsection (n) that he is a bona fide purchaser for value of such property who at the time of purchase was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this section.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The government suggests that Mario Zelaya may not be a \"third party\" petitioner insofar as he is \"an unindicted co-conspirator convicted in a foreign country for his role in the facts\" of the criminal case forming the basis for his brother's conspiracy conviction. The Court need not determine whether Mario Zelaya should be disqualified as a petitioner on this ground; the statute suggests \"any person, other than the defendant(s) in this case ...\" may claim an interest in the forfeited property by filing a petition. There is no dispute that Mario Zelaya was not indicted in this criminal matter, and the facts pertaining to Mario Zelaya's conviction in Honduras are not of record. The Court observes that, in considering a motion to strike or dismiss a third party petition in an ancillary proceeding, it is not permitted to resolve factual disputes; Mario Zelaya disputes many of the facts in his third party petition, including whether his conviction in Honduras (whatever its basis) is final. Because Mario Zelaya's petition fails to state a claim both in its failure to comply with mandatory statutory prerequisites as well as its failure to articulate one of the limited claims for relief as recognized by Section 853(n)(6), the Court declines to consider the government's arguments that require consideration of matters outside the scope of its request for relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
