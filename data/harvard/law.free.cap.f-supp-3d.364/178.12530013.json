The litigation results from an encounter between police officers responding to a report of serious baby abuse and a new father intent on protecting his family from what he believed to be an unlawful forced entry into his apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At 10:00 p.m. one evening in Brooklyn, plaintiff, his wife, and their one-week old daughter were at home preparing for bed. Four armed uniformed police officers arrived at their door seeking to enter the apartment without a warrant. The officers were there to investigate a partially corroborated 911 call reporting that a child was being molested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   They believed the exigency of an ongoing possible threat to a child's safety justified their warrantless entry. Thompson, with his child safe and well-cared for in the back bedroom, believed otherwise. He blocked them from entering and, according to the officers' testimony, pushed one of the officers. They forced him to the ground, arrested him, handcuffing him, and according to plaintiff, beat him. The report of child abuse turned out to be false-the 911 call came from a disturbed relative temporarily living in plaintiff's apartment. The child was never in any danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Before the court are two vexing issues related to plaintiff's unlawful entry and malicious prosecution claims:\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   , which party bears the burden of proof on the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement; and,\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , whether, as an element of his malicious prosecution claim, plaintiff can establish that his criminal charges were terminated on the merits in his favor.

Exigency Burden\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   The Second Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Ruggiero\n   </em>\n   is arguably broad enough to place the burden of proving all exceptions to the warrant requirement, including exigency, on the plaintiff. But subsequent cases seem to go in the other direction, placing the burden of proving exigent circumstances in \u00a7 1983 actions on the government. And its apparent suggestion that the burden of persuasion never shifts to the defendant in civil trials is belied by other Second Circuit precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Although the law in this circuit remains unclear, it appears that the current rule is that the plaintiff bears the burden of proof for exigent circumstances. This seems wrong as policy: the burden of proving an urgent need so compelling that it justifies a warrantless entry should generally rest with the government. Unlike consent, the facts that establish exigent circumstances are uniquely within the knowledge of the police officers. Whether there was a need to render emergency aid so compelling requiring immediate action is wholly dependent upon the facts often known only to the police officer at the time of the warrantless entry. The evidence available at the time to the householder is irrelevant. As is rightfully understood in the criminal context, police officers should bear a heavy burden when overcoming a person's fundamental right to be secure in the home from unreasonable searches and seizures. There is no sound basis in law for this principle not to extend to civil matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   This is a simple problem of allocating the burden of proof. Since the Fourth Amendment has already chosen to favor a person's right inside his own dwelling over that of the police officer's right of entry, courts should do the same by placing the burden on police officers to prove that\n   exigency justified their warrantless entry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lewis,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 227 (\"The [court's] holding is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's motivation to limit the situations where exigent circumstances make warrantless searches reasonable because it could lead to a situation where a plaintiff alleging violation of his civil rights is left without the ability to ... defend those civil rights. The spirit of the Fourth Amendment is to give protective rights to citizens.\");\n   <em>\n    cf. See\n   </em>\n   Capra,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 4 (\"The Advisory Committee reasoned that presumptions are based on a combination of probability and fairness. If that combination of factors is strong enough to warrant a presumption, it should also be strong enough to shift the risk of nonpersuasion to the party against whom the presumption operates.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Favorable Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Plaintiff failed to satisfy the favorable termination element of his \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim as a matter of current Second Circuit law. Based on the facts and law of this unusual case, where there was substantial evidence that the officers' warrantless entry was lawful and the plaintiff pushed, or at minimum physically interfered with, a governmental official, plaintiff cannot establish that his obstruction charge was dismissed in a manner affirmatively indicative of his innocence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lanning v. City of Glens Falls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519141\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/908/19/#p22\">\n    908 F.3d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2018) (\"[F]ederal law defines the elements of a \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim ... [and] requir[es] affirmative indications of innocence to establish 'favorable termination' ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   The federal court's ruling against defendant should not be based on the District Attorney moving to dismiss the criminal charges \"in the interest of justice\" at the April 9, 2014 hearing. Such a broad ruling risks eviscerating malicious prosecution claims altogether. It would give prosecutors almost unlimited power to bar such claims, regardless of the strength or weakness of the underlying accusations. They could insulate police officers and district attorneys simply by repeating the phrase \"in the interest of justice\" in all cases they sought to discontinue for any reason. More must be required to qualify as an interest of justice dismissal that could, in effect, foreclose future claims for malicious prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burke v.
