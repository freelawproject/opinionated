Carranza, Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education (\"DOE\"), claiming that the Mayor and Chancellor's changes to the admissions process for the eight specialized New York City public high schools violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because they discriminate against Asian-American students. Plaintiffs are three organizations-Christa McAuliffe Intermediate School PTO, Inc. (\"PTO\"), Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York (\"CACAGNY\"), and Asian American Coalition for Education (\"AACE\")-and three individuals-Phillip Yan Hing Wong, Yi Fang Chen, and Chi Wang, who are the parents of students in New York City public schools. Before the Court are two motions: Plaintiffs' motion for the Court to take judicial notice of certain facts and Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from implementing the challenged changes while this action is pending.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' motion for judicial notice is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, and Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     MOTION FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b), \"[t]he court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined\n   from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" The court may take judicial notice of a fact on its own and must take judicial notice of a fact if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the necessary information. Fed. R. Evid. 201(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs ask this Court to judicially notice a variety of facts for the purposes of adjudicating this action, including the instant preliminary injunction motion. The Court addresses Plaintiffs' requests in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1. The Court takes judicial notice of the statistics contained in New York City's Demographic Snapshot, a database containing demographic information for every public school in New York City. Plaintiffs have rendered certain relevant information from the database into tables and attached them as exhibits to their motion for a preliminary injunction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Kieser Decl. Ex. 1-5, but ask the Court to take judicial notice of the entire database. As the Demographic Snapshot is information published by the DOE and available on a government website, the Court takes judicial notice of it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Wrights Mill Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091791\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/127/156/#p166\">\n    127 F.Supp.3d 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2. The Court takes judicial notice of the fact that in connection with the changes to the Discovery program,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (1) by the summer of 2020, 20% of the seats at each specialized school will be reserved for Discovery program participants, and (2) to participate in the Discovery program, students must attend a school with an Economic Need Index (\"ENI\") of at least 60%. These facts come from the DOE's official website, dated June 3, 2018, on a page titled Diversity in Admissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 19 Ex. A. Since the facts are from a government website, and the government is the entity making the changes to the program, judicial notice is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091791\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/127/156/#p166\">\n    127 F.Supp.3d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3. The Court does not take judicial notice of the statistics and projections in the DOE slide deck to school districts, Doc. 19 Ex. B. Many of the statistics in the slide deck are uncited, including the statistic Plaintiffs specify for judicial notice, that 61% of Asian-Americans who received offers to attend a specialized school are low-income,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 19 Ex. B at 13. The Court will, however, take judicial notice of the facts that the DOE made the slide deck and made the statements in the slide deck, facts which are undisputed by Defendants,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Roberts Decl. \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   4. The Court takes judicial notice of the fact that Mayor de Blasio's office, Mayor de Blasio, and Chancellor Carranza made the statements attributed to them in the June 3, 2018 DOE press release, Doc. 19 Ex. J. A press release is a source whose accuracy \"cannot reasonably be questioned\" as to the fact that the statements contained therein were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   5. The Court does not take judicial notice of the offer rate data for 100 New York intermediate schools contained in the June 14, 2018 Chalk Beat article, Doc. 19 Ex. C. Chalk Beat is a non-government website that publishes news related to public education; it is not a source \"whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned\" as to the proffered data. Plaintiffs argue that the statistics contained therein should still be judicially noticed because a New York Times article contained the same statistics and stated that they came from the DOE. But this does\n   not lend the quoted statistics any more credence. Presumably, if they are DOE statistics, then Plaintiffs can request them directly from the source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   6. The Court does not take judicial notice of any of the facts or data in the August 13, 2018 New York Times article, Doc. 19 Ex. F. The New York Times is a well-respected news publication, but it is not a source \"whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned\" when it comes to the facts and data Plaintiffs ask the Court to notice, namely, (1) the Specialized High School Admissions Test (\"SHSAT\") cut-off for admission at each specialized school in 2018, (2) the SHSAT cut-off score for the Discovery program in 2018, and (3) an explanation of how the Discovery program worked before 2018, Doc. 19 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   7. The Court does not take judicial notice of the statistics on the percentage of Discovery program participants who were Asian-American in 2018 proffered in the August 14, 2018 Chalk Beat article, Doc. 19 Ex. E, for the same reason as item (5), above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   8. The Court takes judicial notice of the fact that Mayor de Blasio made the statements published under his name in a June 2, 2018 Chalk Beat article, Doc. 19 Ex. D. He authored the article. The fact that he made the statements thus \"can be accurately and readily determined\" from a source \"whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   9. The Court takes judicial notice of the fact that Mayor de Blasio made the following statements published on Twitter in his official account, @NYCMayor, under his name, on June 3, 2018:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Zipcode is limiting destiny in New York City and in our Specialized High Schools. Only 14% of students at Bronx Science come from the Bronx. Only 3.4% of Brooklyn Tech students come from Central Brooklyn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Stuyvesant High School just admitted almost a thousand students, but only ten of those students were African American and less than thirty were Latino. In a city that is majority African American and Latino.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-25\">\n   These schools are the proving grounds for future leaders, and unless we believe our leaders should only come from certain communities, we cannot have our most prestigious schools available to only some.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    As discussed in greater detail below, participation in the Discovery program is one of two ways of gaining admission to the eight specialized high schools; the other way involves only one criterion-scoring high enough on a standardized test.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    Our first reforms will commit 20% of the seats to kids from disadvantaged communities.

Justice has been delayed, but it does not have to be denied. We can fix this. These schools will get better when they reflect all of New York City.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    A single standardized test can never capture the talent of young people. We need a fairer way to admit students to our Specialized High Schools.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 19 Ex. H, I. The statements were \"tweeted\" by the Mayor on his official account, under his name. The fact that he made the statements thus \"can be accurately and readily determined\" from a source \"whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    10. The Court takes judicial notice of the statements made by Chancellor Carranza in a television interview conducted on June 5, 2018 on local news station Fox 5 New York. Plaintiffs ask the Court to specifically take notice of one of the Chancellor's statements, \"I just don't buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admissions to these schools,\" Doc. 19 \u00b6 10, citing a New York Times article that reprints the statement in isolation,\n    Doc. 19 Ex. G. Defendants claim that the New York Times article \"mischaracterizes the Chancellor's statements, takes quotes out of context, and creates an inaccurate impression,\" and cite to the video footage of the full interview,\n    <em>\n     see Plan to Diversify Elite NYC Schools\n    </em>\n    , FOX 5 (June 5, 2018).\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Roberts Decl. \u00b6 14. Consequently, the Court\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    takes judicial notice of the contents of the full interview. What statements the Chancellor made therein \"can be accurately and readily determined from\" the video footage of the interview, Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Having determined what facts the Court can and shall take judicial notice of in deciding Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court turns to that motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     I. FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Specialized School System\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The New York City DOE operates eight high schools that, under state law, must admit students solely on the basis of an academic exam. These schools, called \"specialized schools,\" are the Bronx High School of Science (\"Bronx Science\"); Stuyvesant High School; Brooklyn Technical High School (\"Brooklyn Tech\"); Brooklyn Latin School; High School for Mathematics, Science and Engineering at City College of New York; High School of American Studies at Lehman College; Staten Island Technical High School; and Queens High School for the Sciences at York College.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Wallack Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10. As the parties acknowledge, these high schools offer superior educational opportunities to academically gifted students and admission is highly prized by parents and students alike. Indeed, the three oldest of these schools-Bronx Science, Stuyvesant, and Brooklyn Tech-are widely and historically regarded as amongst the finest public high schools in the country. The schools' alumni are a testament to this perception; Bronx Science, for instance, has produced eight Nobel Prize winners, and Stuyvesant four.\n    <em>\n     See About Page\n    </em>\n    , Bronx High School of Science;\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     History of the School\n    </em>\n    , Stuyvesant High School.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The state law that requires the specialized schools to use testing as the basis for admissions is the Hecht-Calandra Act (the \"Act\"), and it states the following:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    Admission to the Bronx High School of Science, Stuyvesant High School and Brooklyn Technical High School and such similar further special high schools which may be established shall be solely and exclusively by taking a competitive, objective and scholastic achievement examination, which shall be open to each and every child in the city of New York in either the eighth or ninth year of study, without regard to any school district wherein the child may reside.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20Law%20%C2%A7%202590\">\n     N.Y.

The Act expressly provides for the implementation of the Discovery program \"to give disadvantaged students of demonstrated high potential an opportunity to try the special high school program.\" Roberts Decl. in Opp. to Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj. Ex. 3 at 3. Under the Act, to be eligible for the program, a student must: (1) be disadvantaged; (2) be certified by her current school as being \"high potential\"; (3) score just below the lowest overall score of all admitted students; and (4) successfully complete a summer preparatory program demonstrating her ability to \"cope with the special high school program.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20Law%20%C2%A7%202590\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ; Chadha Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10. Importantly, however, the Act neither defines \"disadvantaged\" nor prescribes the number of students that may be admitted through the Discovery program, leaving such determination to the discretion of the Chancellor. Roberts Decl. in Opp. to Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15. Once a student successfully completes the summer school program, the student is admitted to a specialized school. Chadha Decl. \u00b6 10. Of the class entering in September 2017, approximately 4% of offers were made through the Discovery program.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Chadha Decl. Ex. 1 (recording that 203 out of 5,281 offers were made through Discovery).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    By all accounts, this admissions process is grueling. Yet over 29,000 students took the SHSAT last year in hopes of attending a specialized high school in the fall of 2019. This demand reflects the common view of New Yorkers that the schools are \"elite,\" \"exclusive,\" and \"among the best high schools in the country.\"\n    <em>\n     See The Exclusive Eight\n    </em>\n    , N.Y.

The other specialized schools are more representative, but none come close to proportionate representation. While Black and Hispanic students make up 66% of New York City public high schools, they only make up 13.5% of Brooklyn Tech, 8.7% of Bronx Science, 3.5% of Staten Island Tech, 23.9% of Brooklyn Latin, 25.2% of the High School for Math, Science &amp; Engineering, 8.4% of Queens High School for the Sciences, and 15% of the High School of American Studies.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20Law%20%C2%A7%202590\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Asian-American students make up 61.3% of Brooklyn Tech, 65.6% of Bronx Science, 48.4% of Staten Island Tech, 51.5% of Brooklyn Latin, 36.2% of the High School for Math, Science &amp; Engineering, 81% of the Queens High School for the Sciences, and 22% of the High School of American Studies.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20Law%20%C2%A7%202590\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The demographically skewed student populations and test-only admissions basis of the specialized schools have attracted scrutiny from civil rights groups and government agencies for decades.

Wallack Decl. \u00b6 16.

Thus, if a student is herself very low-income but attends an intermediate school with an ENI below 60%, the student is ineligible for Discovery, despite the fact that the student would have been eligible for the program under the prior criteria. About half of all New York City intermediate schools have an ENI below 60%.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20Law%20%C2%A7%202590\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20Law%20%C2%A7%202590\">\n     \u00b6 25\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Modeling conducted by a DOE working group projected that the ENI requirement would change the racial makeup of the Discovery program and therefore the specialized schools, albeit only slightly. To model these demographic consequences, the DOE first took the SHSAT and demographic data of the specialized schools' entering class of 2017, then analyzed how the demographic data would change if the Discovery program's eligibility criteria that year were the new criteria and the program took up 20% of the available seats. Chadha Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20. The projections show a decline of Asian-American enrollment from 53.0% to 50.9% (-2.1%), an increase in Black enrollment from 4.0% to 6.4% (+2.4%), an increase in Hispanic enrollment from 6.8% to 10.2% (+3.4%), and a decline in white enrollment from 27.2% to 24.7% (-2.5%).\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    Chadha Decl.

Three elements form the constitutional minimum of standing. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent. Second, the challenged conduct must have caused the plaintiff's injury. Third, it must be likely, not speculative, that a favorable decision by the court will redress the plaintiff's injury.\n    <em>\n     Lujan v.

When an injunction seeks \"to require a party who has recently disturbed the status quo to reverse its actions,\" it seeks to \"restore[ ], rather than disturb[ ], the status quo ante, and is thus not an exception to the rule\" that is typically applied in evaluating motions for a preliminary injunction.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5947540\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/418/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    11A Wright &amp; Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 2948 (3d ed. 2018) (\"Courts also have awarded preliminary injunctions when it is necessary to compel defendant to correct injury already inflicted by defining the status quo as 'the last peaceable uncontested status' existing between the parties before the dispute developed.

Defendants publicly announced the changes to the Discovery program on June 3, 2018, and it is the implementation of these changes that Plaintiffs seek to enjoin. The last uncontested status is therefore how the Discovery program was organized prior to the changes announced on June 3, 2018.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The fact that the DOE may have undertaken numerous steps to implement its proposed changes to the Discovery program and is currently planning to utilize the new admissions plan does not make the sought injunction a mandatory injunction. In\n    <em>\n     Mastrovincenzo v.

The City characterized the sought injunction as a mandatory injunction \"affirmatively forc[ing] the City to change its conduct\" because unless \"restrained\" by the district court, the City would \"continue\" to enforce the licensing requirement.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936162\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/78/#p90\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936162\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/78/#p90\">\n     at 89\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The PTO, which represents parents at a school no longer eligible for participation in the Discovery program because it has an ENI of less than 60%, arguably suffers the most hardship from the new changes. But I.S. 187 students may still compete for 87% of the specialized school seats this year-those seats reserved for the students who score highest on the SHSAT. The expansion of the Discovery program will lead to there being a slightly higher cut-off score for admission based purely on test scores, but this slight change is not a significant hardship. Wong's daughter attends a school with an ENI above 60%,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Kieser Decl. Ex. 1, so the program changes do not change whether she is eligible for Discovery. Further, if Wong's daughter is Discovery eligible-it is unclear from the record whether she is-then any hardship from the increased cut-off must be considered in\n    tandem with the fact that she has a higher chance of admission through Discovery this year.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Meanwhile, Defendants have shown that granting the injunction would place an undue burden on the DOE. School administrators, teachers, students, and parents have all been proceeding for the last eight months under the assumption that the new changes will be in effect for the upcoming admissions cycle.

Of course, the Court is sensitive to the time and resources needed to initiate a lawsuit and the imperative of ensuring compliance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. But Plaintiffs' filing date has left the DOE with only two months to accommodate the possibility that Plaintiffs' motion will be granted.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Irish Lesbian &amp; Gay Org. v.

Second, a law or policy that is facially neutral discriminates on the basis of race if it is enforced in a discriminatory way.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Yick Wo v.

Indeed, an argument could be made that increased racial diversity is more beneficial at the high school level, when students are younger. This is especially true for the social effects of racial diversity. High school students generally spend more time in class and have smaller class sizes than university students, amplifying the extent to which they interact with each other. Their freedom to move and attend the classes of their choice is also significantly curtailed compared to university students, limiting their ability to self-segregate. Defendants submit multiple studies that purport to show the positive social and educational effects of racial diversity in secondary education.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Mem. at 20-21.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Assuming that increasing racial diversity in the specialized high schools is a compelling government interest, Defendants must still show that this interest was in fact a reason for changing the Discovery program.

The same model projects that the enrollment of white students will decline by about 2.5 percentage points, or 9%, from 27.2% to 24.7%; and that the enrollment of students who do not report their race, Native American students, and multi-racial students will decline by about 1.2 percentage points, or 13%, from 9.0% to 7.8%.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Chadha Decl.
