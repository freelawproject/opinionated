INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants have moved for Summary Judgment, which motion has been referred for a Report and Recommendation [Docket No. 34]. For the reasons set forth below, the Court recommends that the Motion be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This dispute arises out of an incident that occurred on June 21, 2015. That afternoon, Defendant Officer Tschida was working as an off-duty officer at the University Avenue Walmart in St. Paul. [Docket No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   35 at 2]. Officer Tschida was alerted to a potential shoplifting incident involving Plaintiff James Frei and, in full police uniform, intercepted Frei as he left the store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Frei voluntarily reentered Walmart with Officer Tschida who requested that Frei remove the contraband, later found to be a wireless speaker, from his pants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; [15-cr-206]. Frei instead pulled out a handgun and pointed it in Officer Tschida's face.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Officer Tschida ducked, and Frei bolted from the Walmart, gun in hand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3; [Docket No. 29, Ex. 1 at 2]. The incident was captured on Walmart security cameras. [Docket No. 38, Ex. 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Tschida pursued Frei toward Frei's girlfriend's truck, where he ordered Frei to \"show his hands and exit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Officer Tschida claims Frei responded by again pointing the gun at him, something Frei denies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Docket No. 57 at 1]. Officer Tschida fired five shots at Frei as Frei started the truck and sped through the parking lot, over a road verge, and on to University Avenue. [Docket No. 35 at 3]. Frei was grazed by a bullet on his left shoulder, but was otherwise unhurt. [Docket No. 14 at 2]. Offer Tschida did not interact with Frei again that evening. [Docket No. 38 at 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After hearing a radio broadcast of \"shots fired,\" Officer Gilsrud joined what had become a high-speed chase pursuing Frei. [Docket No. 35 at 3]. Frei was \"waving [a] gun\" and \"disobeying all traffic controls\" throughout the pursuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The car chase came to a halt when Frei's truck suffered a \"significant impact\" with a parked vehicle, causing the airbags to deploy. [Docket No. 37 at 2]. Frei scrambled from the truck and fled on foot. [Docket No. 35 at 4]. After Frei slipped and fell, an unnamed police officer ordered Frei to remain on the ground. [Docket No. 37 at 2]. When Frei persisted in his attempts to stand, Officer Gilsrud kicked Frei in the head, and when Frei kept resisting, kicked him in the upper torso.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. Officer Gilsrud and the other officer were then able to restrain Frei and place him in handcuffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Frei claims Officer Gilsrud kicked him \"multiple times\" in his face and chest while handcuffed; Officer Gilsrud insists he only kicked Frei twice, both times while Frei was actively resisting before being handcuffed. [Docket No. 1 at 4; Docket No. 37 at 3]. Frei was briefly examined by the St. Paul Fire Department Medics, who \"did not locate any injuries on Frei that required immediate medical attention.\" [Docket No. 35 at 4]. Frei claims he had \"visible injuries to [his] face, head, left shoulder and neck.\" [Docket No. 1 at 6]. Frei was brought immediately to the St. Paul Law Enforcement Center for booking. [Docket No. 35 at 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 30, 2015, Frei pleaded guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n   <em>\n    United States of America v. James Ryan Frei\n   </em>\n   , 15-cr-206 (ADM/JSM); [Docket No. 24 at 2; Docket No. 38].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Frei now brings suit claiming that (1) both Officer Tschida and Officer Gilsrud used excessive force; and (2) the unnamed St. Paul Fire Department Medics who treated Frei immediately after his arrest were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. [Docket No. 1 at 7]. He seeks damages of $ 1,500,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants have moved for summary judgment on all claims.

Immediately, the incident shifted from a run-of-the-mill investigatory stop to a high stakes situation that endangered the lives of countless others.

The cavalier attitude with which Frei threatened Officer Tschida suggested, regardless of whether he later pointed a gun at Officer Tschida, that Frei would not hesitate to draw his gun again. Nor did Frei, who retained the gun, indicate he no longer posed a threat by fleeing.

Specifically, Frei claims he was kicked \"repeatedly\" by Officer\n   Gilsrud, when he was \"already down\" and \"no longer had a weapon.\" [Docket No. 50 at 2.] Officer Gilsrud claims he kicked Frei exactly twice while Frei was actively resisting arrest prior to being handcuffed. [Docket No. 37 at 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Thus, a material fact-whether Officer Gilsrud kicked Frei repeatedly after he had stopped resisting and was secured by handcuffs-is in dispute. Assuming, as we must, that Frei's version of events is true, Officer Gilsrud is not entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   What Frei asserts Officer Gilsrud did transcends what was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When, as Frei alleges, Frei was lying on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back, it was unreasonable to believe that Frei would draw his weapon or continue to meaningfully resist arrest. No valid argument exists to suggest that kicking Frei \"repeatedly\" in his face was permissible to secure Frei from fleeing at that point. [Docket. No. 1 at 4; Docket No. 25 at 4]. Defendants argue that no material disputed fact exists, when one clearly does, but do not take the untenable position that Frei's version of events, if true, permits dismissal of his claims against Gilsrud. Therefore, accepting the disputed material facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, Frei's claim of excessive force survives summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nor is Officer Gilsrud entitled to qualified immunity. Assuming Frei's version of events is true, kicking a suspect repeatedly after they have already surrendered and are securely in custody repeatedly has been found to violate the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blazek v.

Despite his apparent injuries, Frei alleges he was only briefly treated at the scene, and then immediately brought to the St. Paul Law Enforcement Center for processing; he was not taken to a hospital.

Here, Frei alleges the individual medics were deliberately indifferent, not that the policies of the St. Paul Fire Department Medics caused him harm. While Frei claims \"he has tried to get [the medics] names but nobody knows them\" [Docket No. 50 at 3], Defendants posit that Frei never sought the names while conducting discovery. [Docket No. 35 at 12]. Because a claim of deliberate indifference under \u00a7 1983 requires \"persons\" to be named, and because the \"person\" named is not alleged to be the source of the harm, the \"St. Paul Fire Department Medics\" are improperly named as Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Even if the proper defendants had been named, there is no evidence of deliberate indifference to Frei's medical needs. Frei did not seek medical care until days later. He offers no evidence of injury caused by deliberate indifference. He claims he has suffered \"PTSD\" and \"lower back pain,\" but provides no medical records or evidence to show that if he has the ailments, they resulted from Defendants' deliberate indifference. [Docket No. 57 at 3]. And while interpreting photographs is inherently subjective, the pictures taken of Frei the evening of his arrest do not indicate his alleged need for emergency medical care was known by or readily apparent to the medics. [Docket No. 55, Ex. 1]. Therefore, the first prong of deliberate indifference-knowledge of excessive risk to Frei's safety-is not met, because there is no evidence that the failure to take Frei to the hospital put his health at excessive risk. Even if the record demonstrated Frei required immediate medical attention, Frei offers no evidence the medics knowingly disregarded the risk to Frei's health. Therefore, even if the \"St. Paul Fire Department Medics\" were properly named defendants, the deliberate indifference claim would fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     RECOMMENDATION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Based on the files, record, and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY RECOMMENDED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [Docket No. 34] be\n   <strong>\n    granted in part and denied in part:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   1.
