Conner, Chief Judge\n   Plaintiff John Steven Bizarre (\"Bizarre\") appeals the decision of the administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") denying Bizarre's claim for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. (Doc. 1). Before the court are Bizarre's complaint and the parties' respective briefs in support of and in opposition thereto; the report of Magistrate Judge Joseph F. Saporito, Jr., recommending that the court deny the appeal; Bizarre's objections to the report; and the response of the Acting Commissioner of Social Security (\"Commissioner\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Bizarre protectively filed for disability insurance benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act on April 30, 2015. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 5; Tr. at 19). His claims were initially denied on August 18, 2015, and he thereafter filed a request for a hearing before an ALJ. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 6; Tr. at 74-79, 89-90). The ALJ convened a hearing on August 24, 2016, at which Bizarre appeared with his current counsel. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 39-60). In a written decision dated November 29, 2016, the ALJ denied Bizarre's application for benefits. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 8; Tr. at 16-29). Bizarre's request for review before the Appeals Council was denied on November 6, 2017. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 10; Tr. at 1, 11-12). The ALJ's decision accordingly stands as the \"final decision\" of the Commissioner for purposes of judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.981\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bizarre commenced this action on January 7, 2018, seeking review of the Commissioner's decision pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The parties briefed the issues on appeal before Magistrate Judge Joseph F.

The first four objections go to the merits of the ALJ's decision. In his fifth objection, Bizarre contends that the ALJ who heard and decided his case was not properly appointed under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, entitling Bizarre to remand for rehearing before a constitutionally appointed ALJ. We find merit in this argument\n   and accordingly need not address the balance of Bizarre's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Bizarre invokes the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Lucia v. S.E.C.\n   </em>\n   , 585 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), to support his Appointments Clause challenge. Plaintiff Raymond J. Lucia (\"Lucia\") argued that his administrative proceeding before the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") was invalid because the presiding ALJ was not appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause. The SEC and Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected this argument, but the Supreme Court sided with Lucia, concluding that the SEC's ALJs are \"inferior officers\" of the United States who must be properly appointed.\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2049, 2051-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to the question of remedy, the Court echoed its earlier statement from\n   <em>\n    Ryder v.

The Court observed that Lucia had made \"just such a timely challenge,\" having raised the Appointments Clause objection before the SEC and reasserted it before the court of appeals and the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The matter was remanded for rehearing before a new, constitutionally appointed ALJ.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Commissioner does not dispute that the Social Security Administration's ALJs are inferior officers for purposes of this appeal or that the ALJ in this case was not appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 23 at 3 n.1). The subject of the dispute is whether Bizarre \"timely\" raised his Appointments Clause claim as that phrase is utilized in\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. 17 at 2 n.1; Doc. 23 at 2-12; Doc. 25 at 7-8; Doc. 26 at 2-6). The Commissioner urges that Bizarre forfeited judicial review of this claim by failing to raise it before the Social Security Administration. Judge Saporito adopts the same position in his report and recommendation, determining that \"Bizarre waived [the Appointments Clause argument] by failing to raise this issue at the administrative level.\" (Doc. 24 at 29-32). We respectfully disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We acknowledge at the outset that our disagreement breaks from the emerging consensus of federal district courts to address this issue. That consensus generally holds that we need look no further than\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   to resolve the question of timeliness. After all, the Supreme Court held that Lucia's challenge, which Lucia raised \"before the Commission, and continued pressing...in the Court of Appeals and this Court,\" was \"timely.\"\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Many of the district court decisions comprising the developing majority construe this language as establishing that an Appointments Clause challenge is timely only when raised and preserved at the administrative level.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We submit that this approach misapprehends\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   , the Court was not compelled to grapple with the complexities of whether and under what circumstances administrative exhaustion is mandated or when an Appointments Clause claim is forfeited. These issues were not before the\n   Court. Lucia had raised his Appointments Clause challenge before the administrative agency's appellate body-the SEC, on review of its ALJ's decision-and reasserted his challenge before every appellate court.\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority's statement as to timeliness was not a bright-line demarcation of how and when such a claim must be brought; it simply confirmed the obvious timeliness of the fully preserved and exhausted claim as presented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Associated Mortgage Bankers, Inc. v. Carson\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-75,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20108882\">\n    2019 WL 108882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D.D.C. Jan. 4, 2019) (\"\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   did not define the scope of what constitutes a timely challenge, as there was no claim in\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   that the challenge...was not timely raised.\"). Accordingly, our analysis begins with\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   , but it does not end there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We disagree with the Commissioner's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   as mandating exhaustion at the administrative level, and we are unpersuaded by the argument that Bizarre was otherwise required to raise the Appointments Clause challenge before the agency or risk forfeiture of that claim. The Commissioner does not suggest (and we have found no authority indicating) that a Social Security ALJ would be authorized to resolve or redress a constitutional challenge to his or her own authority. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Docs. 23, 26). Furthermore, the Supreme Court has declined to require issue exhaustion at the Appeals Council level,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sims v.

The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   limited its holding to Appeals Council review and expressly declined to address \"[w]hether a claimant must exhaust issues before the ALJ.\"\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p112\">\n    530 U.S. at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p112\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Several circuit courts have thus held that\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   does not foreclose an issue-exhaustion requirement at the ALJ level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shaibi v.

Three points, each explored\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   , support our finding that this is \"one of those rare cases\" in which exercise of our discretion is warranted. First, the Commissioner has identified no authority, and we have found none, suggesting that the agency's ALJs could resolve constitutional challenges to their own appointment. In fact, after\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   , the agency explicitly instructed its ALJs to document but decline to address any Appointments Clause challenges raised at that level of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. SOC.
