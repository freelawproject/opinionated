(\"iPawn Arkansas\"), and Steve Landers Jr.'s motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 44). Plaintiffs Vincient Jones and Alrick Powell responded in opposition (Dkt. No. 53), and defendants replied (Dkt. No. 57). Defendants also filed two supplemental filings in support of their motion for summary judgment (Dkt. Nos. 66, 69). The Court concludes that there are disputed genuine issues of material fact with respect to all the claims brought by plaintiffs. The Court therefore denies defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In their operative third amended complaint, plaintiffs assert the following claims: (1) defendants charged usurious rates of interest in violation of Amendment 89, \u00a7 3 of the Arkansas Constitution ; (2) defendants charged usurious rates of interest in violation of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"ADTPA\"), Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a7 4-88-101,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (3) defendants made false statements on the face of their pawn loan contracts in violation of the ADTPA; (4) defendants charged usurious rates of interest in violation of Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a7 4-57-105 ; (5) iPawn Rodney Parham failed to identify creditors on the face of its pawn loan contracts in violation of the Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201638\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and its implementing regulations (\"Regulation Z\"); and (6) defendant iPawn Baseline failed to identify creditors on the face of its pawn loan contracts in violation of the TILA and its implementing regulations (Dkt. No. 33). For relief, plaintiffs seek injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This action was commenced on June 20, 2016, in the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, Arkansas (Dkt. No. 54, at 1). Mr. Jones was the sole plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The original complaint was amended on August 31, 2016, to allege a TILA violation, and the case was then removed to this Court on September 6, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After removal, a second amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2017, adding Mr. Powell as a plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The third amended complaint was filed on February 22, 2018, in which the class definition was altered (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 1-2). Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify\n   class on January 26, 2018 (Dkt. No. 29). The Court denied the motion to certify class (Dkt. No. 71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Jones is a resident of Pulaski County, Arkansas, who pawned three items with iPawn Arkansas (Dkt. No. 54, at 3). The name of \"iPawn Arkansas, Inc.\" is shown on each of Mr. Jones' pawn tickets (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Jones has admitted that each of his pawn tickets states the name \"iPawn Arkansas, Inc.\" at the top of the pawn ticket (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Jones admits that he did not read his pawn tickets in their entirety (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 4). Mr. Jones admits that he is not aware of the TILA (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Jones did not understand what the phrase \"annual percentage rate\" meant (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Jones is also unable to explain how he was harmed by the tickets not having either \"iPawn Rodney Parham, LLC\" or \"iPawn Baseline, LLC\" on them (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Jones did not pay a finance charge (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Powell is currently in the Faulkner County, Arkansas, jail awaiting trial on felony charges (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5). Mr. Powell's detention is indefinite (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He is a felon who was convicted of conspiracy to commit capital murder and drug possession (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Powell entered into two pawn transactions with iPawn Arkansas that are the subject of this action (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 6). Mr. Powell did not redeem the items that he pawned (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Powell further admits that he did not pay any interest (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Powell also concedes that he did not pay a finance charge (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Powell admits that at the top of each of his pawn tickets is the statement \"iPawn Arkansas, Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Powell thought he did business with iPawn Baseline because he was at the Baseline location (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This was the only reason he thought he did business with iPawn Baseline (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Powell admits that he has not been harmed by iPawn Baseline's name not appearing on his pawn tickets (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 7). Further, Mr. Powell has never met Steven Landers, Jr. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a pawn transaction, a customer will present an item of personal property to the pawn shop (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The customer and pawnshop will negotiate the value of the personal property that the customer seeks to pawn (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). iPawn Arkansas' customers sign a pawn ticket, which, among other things, contains the required TILA disclosures (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 9). iPawn Arkansas uses a standard form pawn ticket that it purchases from an out of state vendor (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The exhibits attached to the third amended complaint are examples of the form of pawn ticket that iPawn Arkansas purchases from an out-of-state printing company (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Steven Landers, Jr. is the president and sole shareholder of iPawn Arkansas (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 12). iPawn Arkansas is the sole member of iPawn Rodney Parham and iPawn Baseline (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In support of their motion for summary judgment, defendants present the affidavit of Michael Willingham, the Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of iPawn Arkansas (Dkt. No. 44-1). Mr. Willingham avers that he has been employed by iPawn Arkansas since March 2011 and that he is familiar with the pawn business in general and the operation of iPawn Arkansas in particular (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2-3). Mr. Willingham states that a pawn transaction at iPawn Arkansas commences when a customer enters the store and presents an item of personal property to an employee for the purpose of pawning it (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4). At that point, according to Mr. Willingham, the customer and pawn shop negotiate the value of the item of property, and if the customer and the pawn shop agree to a price, the customer is given cash for the merchandise (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Willingham asserts that, at the time the item is exchanged for the agreed-upon price, \"the transaction is concluded and the customer has no obligation to the pawn shop.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He also states that \"[a] pawn\n   customer is never in debt to iPawn Arkansas, Inc.\" and that \"[o]nce the customer receives the cash from iPawn Arkansas, Inc., he or she has no obligation to iPawn Arkansas, Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6). Mr. Willingham notes that \"the customer may, at his or her option, redeem the pawned property for a cash price which is stated on the pawn ticket.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7). He states that \"[t]he customer has no obligation to redeem the property which is pawned,\" though \"[a] significant percentage of customers extend the redemption period for a fee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8). The redemption rate at iPawn Arkansas averaged 56% in 2015, 66% in 2016, and 59% in 2017 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9). In the event \"the property is not redeemed during the redemption period, or an extension of the redemption period, the merchandise is placed in the pawn shop's inventory for sale to the public.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Willingham states that, at iPawn Arkansas, \"there is no such thing as a standard pawn transaction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10). He notes that \"[w]hile the methodology for each transaction is similar, each transaction widely varies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He further notes that \"[t]he items offered for pawn vary significantly\" and that \"[a]lmost any item of personal property one can own may be pawned.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Willingham states that iPawn Arkansas \"charges each customer a pawn service charge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13). The pawn service charge is an amount associated with the pawn of the item \"and includes research as to the valuation of the merchandise, cost of holding the merchandise, insurance on the merchandise,\" and other costs (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The amount of the pawn service charge is shown on each pawn ticket in the box labeled \"Finance Charge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Willingham's affidavit also discusses the form of the pawn tickets. According to him, \"[t]he pawn tickets used by iPawn Arkansas, Inc. are ordered from a printing company who prints forms for use by pawnbrokers throughout the United States,\" and \"[o]ther than name, address, and company logo, the forms are standard to the State of Arkansas.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15). Furthermore, since June 2016, \"all pawn tickets of iPawn Arkansas, Inc. have contained an arbitration clause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Willingham also states that iPawn Arkansas is the only entity sued in this litigation that is in the pawn business; according to him, \"[n]either iPawn Rodney Parham, LLC or iPawn Baseline, LLC operate a pawn business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17). He further states that iPawn Arkansas conducted its pawn business \"at two locations, one located on Rodney Parham Road in Little Rock Arkansas, and one on Baseline Road in Little Rock, Arkansas (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18). He avers that \"iPawn Rodney Parham, LLC was formed on November 12, 2015, and iPawn Baseline, LLC was formed on October 6, 2015\" and that \"[t]hose LLCs were formed to enter into leases with the owner of the realty on which each of the iPawn Arkansas, Inc. stores were located.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to him, neither of these entities are engaged in the pawn business (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Willingham also testified at a deposition in this litigation (Dkt. No. 53-28). He testified that iPawn intends to make a profit on its transactions (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 4-5). Mr. Willingham stated that iPawn makes profit through the \"sale of merchandise\" or by making a profit \"on the pawn service charge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5). In Mr. Willingham's deposition, he testified that, if pawn customers \"choose to extend it out for 30 days, we make a profit on the pawn service charge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Landers also provides an affidavit in support of the motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 44-5). Mr. Landers avers that he is \"the sole shareholder [ ] of iPawn Arkansas, Inc.\" and that \"[i]Pawn Arkansas, Inc. is the sole member of iPawn Rodney Parham, LLC, and iPawn Baseline, LLC.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2). He also avers\n   that iPawn Arkansas is engaged in pawn business at \"1108 N. Rodney Parham Rd[.], Little Rock, Arkansas 72212\" and at \"6115 Baseline Rd., Little Rock, Arkansas, 72209.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3). He notes that the Baseline Road location has closed (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He states that neither iPawn Rodney Parham nor iPawn Baseline have been, or are, engaged in the pawn business (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4). Further, he states that he is not involved in the day-to-day management of iPawn Arkansas, and he affirms that he neither has an office at iPawn Arkansas or \"regularly visit[s] the pawn stores.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5). Finally, he avers that he did not participate in any pawn transactions with Mr. Jones or Mr. Powell and that he did not set the rate of interest, the finance charge, or the language contained in the pawn tickets used by iPawn Arkansas (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants also present the expert report of Robert T. Gammill in support of their motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 44-2). According to his report, Mr. Gammill is a bank consultant at DD &amp; F Consulting Group working in the areas of regulatory intervention, mergers and acquisitions, bank recapitalizations, acquisitions of failed banks, strategic planning, and board training (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 3). Counsel for defendants retained Mr. Gammill \"to examine the distinctions, if any, between a traditional or typical loan and a pawn transaction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Gammill's opinion is based on his \"experience and [his] review of documents set forth in Appendix A [of his report] as well as observations [he] made at iPawn's location on Rodney Parham.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 3-4). Furthermore, his opinion \"is based on [his] 40 plus years of experience in managing and advising community banks ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Gammill's report is dated November 30, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 2). In his report, Mr. Gammill finds that \"there are significant differences between a 'loan' and a 'pawn.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5). Mr. Gammill's report includes, among other things, a chart comparing bank loans with pawn transactions (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 6). According to this chart, bank loans and pawn transactions differ in six different respects: loan size, loan term, requirement to be repaid, credit checks, credit reporting, and pawn charge versus interest (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The record evidence also includes the defense expert report of David Johns, whose \"opinions are based on [his] experience in the pawn industry and [his] visits to the iPawn stores over past years.\" (Dkt. No. 53-29, at 2). Mr. Johns avers that \"there is very little in common between each transaction, other than the reference to these transactions as 'pawns.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Johns further states that \"[t]he typical pawn at iPawn is written for a thirty day period with availability to the individual who requests the pawn to extend it beyond thirty days if their particular need dictates.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He also states that \"[t]he amount of a pawn is not predictable, as the amount extended a customer depends on need and the value of the merchandise offered by the customer as collateral for the pawn.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He opines that the \"difference between the value of merchandise offered for pawn collateral and the amount requested by the customer for the pawn is the subject of negotiation between iPawn and customers\" and that \"[m]erchandise offered as collateral for a pawn varies significantly,\" ranging from \"appliances to jewelry, to electronics, to guns, and can include almost any type of personal property a customer might possess.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 3). Thus, he opines that \"no two pawn transactions are alike.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Jones was deposed in this case. He states that he has done business with pawn shops for \"probably about seven or eight years ....\" (Dkt. No. 44-3, at 2). He further states that he went back to pawn shops to pick up his\n   merchandise (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 3-4). Mr. Jones states that he picked up merchandise at iPawn's Rodney Parham location (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 4). Mr. Jones states that, after this lawsuit was filed, he went to the iPawn Rodney Parham location and retrieved his items (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He notes that he did not have to pay a fee (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 4-5). Mr. Jones also testifies that he has \"twice\" gone back and obtained an extension on his merchandise from iPawn (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5). In response to a question as to whether he was \"not obligated to get [his] stuff back,\" Mr. Jones answered, \"I guess you can say that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 7). Mr. Jones further testified that there have been occasions when he pawned an item at an iPawn location and his property was sold (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 53-20, at 11). Mr. Jones testified that, as to his property, \"[m]y intentions were to go back and get it, and the money wasn't right, so I wasn't able to go back and get it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Attached as exhibits to Mr. Jones' deposition are five pawn tickets (Dkt. No. 44-3, at 22-27). The first pawn ticket is for a pawn transaction on December 5, 2015, involving a \"Boss BV93648 CD Player\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 22). This pawn ticket has Mr. Jones' name and personal information on it (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The \"amount financed\" is $100.00, the \"finance charge\" is $25.00, the \"total of payments\" is $125.00, and the annual percentage rate is listed as 300.00% (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Jones also pawned a weed trimmer, which is recorded on pawn ticket number 116589 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 11, 25). The pawn ticket for this transaction states that the merchandise being pawned was a \"Homelite UT3 String Trimmer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 23). The \"amount financed\" is $40.00, the \"finance charge\" is $10.00, the \"total of payments\" is $50.00, and the listed annual percentage rate is 300.00% (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The third pawn ticket attached to Mr. Jones' deposition is for a \"Car Ster[e]o Power Acoustik ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 24). This is pawn ticket number 116741 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 10, 24). In this transaction, which occurred on June 20, 2016, the amount financed was \"$15.00\" and the finance charge was \"$3.75,\" with a total of payments indicated as \"$18.75\" on the pawn ticket (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 24). The pawn ticket for this transaction includes an arbitration clause (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pawn tickets 116589 and 116741 have the phrase \"iPawn Arkansas, Inc.\" in the header, followed by \"11108 N. Rodney Parham Rd.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 23-24). Pawn ticket # 107937 says \"iPawn Arkansas, Inc. # 2\" in the header, followed by \"6115 Baseline Rd.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 22). Each of these pawn tickets also contain the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   You are giving a security interest in the following pledged goods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   See the remainder of this contract for any additional information concerning nonpayment and default and prepayment refunds or penalties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The undersigned Pledgor agrees that the term of this loan shall be for the period set forth herein and that at the end of such period, all charges due on this loan shall be paid in full.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   I also understand and acknowledge that I am giving a security interest in the pledged goods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 22-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Also attached to Mr. Jones' deposition are two separate pawn tickets, though these take a different form from the three discussed above (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 25). Mr. Jones states that he received these pawn tickets when he received his stereo and weed trimmer back from the pawnshop (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 16). Both pawn tickets are dated July 11, 2016, and Mr. Jones testified that he initialed both (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 13). Both pawn tickets also state \"ACCOUNT PAID IN FULL.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 25). At the top of each of these pawn tickets is the title \"IPAWN ARKANSAS, INC.,\" followed by \"11108 N. Rodney\n   Parham Rd.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants also present a check from iPawn Arkansas to Mr. Jones in the amount of $36.25 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 26-27). Mr. Jones concedes that his signature is on the back of this check (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 13, 27). Mr. Jones stated, \"I don't know what [the check] was for.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Powell was deposed in this matter. In his own words, Mr. Powell described a pawn transaction as one where \"[y]ou pledge property for a loan\" and \"[y]ou lose your property\" if you do not pay the money back (Dkt. No. 44-4, at 9). Attached to Mr. Powell's deposition are two pawn tickets (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 19-20). The first pawn ticket, which is number 108913, lists three items: a \"Actron CP9175 Orang Tool,\" a \"Kenwood KDC-1028 Blk Stereo,\" and a \"Logic CPX420 Silver Amplifier.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 19). The amount financed on this pawn ticket is $40.00, the finance charge is $10.00, the total of payments is $50.00, and the annual percentage rate is noted as 300.00% (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At the top of the pawn ticket is the title \"iPawn Arkansas, Inc.\" immediately followed by the address \"6115 Baseline Rd.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Powell testified that he was not able to go back and redeem this merchandise (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 11). He also testified that he read the pawn ticket to the extent it listed the finance charge and the annual percentage rate (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He also confirmed that he signed this pawn ticket (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 10). Mr. Powell further testified that he \"thought\" he was doing business with iPawn Baseline \"[b]ecause that's where I was at.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 13). Mr. Powell testified that he \"wasn't able to\" redeem this merchandise (Dkt. No. 53-24, at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The second pawn ticket for Mr. Powell-number 112532-is for a \"Poulan 3450 Green Chainsaw\" and a \"Champion 42432 Yellow Tool.\" (Dkt. No. 44-4, at 20). The amount financed on this pawn ticket is $115.00, the finance charge is $28.75, the total of payments is $143.75, and the annual percentage rate is 300.00% (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The title and address also reference iPawn Arkansas and the Baseline Road location (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 20). Mr. Powell testified that he signed this pawn ticket (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Both pawn tickets attributable to Mr. Powell contain the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   You are giving a security interest in the following pledged goods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   See the remainder of this contract for any additional information concerning nonpayment and default and prepayment refunds or penalties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The undersigned Pledgor agrees that the term of this loan shall be for the period set forth herein and that at the end of such period, all charges due on this loan shall be paid in full.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   I also understand and acknowledge that I am giving a security interest in the pledged goods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 19-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Mr. Powell testified that he \"lost a ODB2 diagnostic scanner\" to iPawn, though it is unclear to which item he is referring (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 9). Mr. Powell also testified that he received \"an extension on both [pawn tickets].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 16). He could not recall what he paid for the extensions (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 17). Mr. Powell also noted that he did not pay the finance charge (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 18). In response to a question regarding the amount of interest he paid, Mr. Powell testified that he was not aware of any interest he paid (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 17). Finally, Mr. Powell testified that he had never met Mr. Landers (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs present multiple screenshots from the website \"http://www.ipawnarkansas.com.\" (Dkt. Nos. 53-6, 53-7). These screenshots include the following language: \"iPawn provides quick and easy loans to customers;\" \"Getting a loan with\n   iPawn will never hurt your credit;\" \"[W]ith iPawn, you can extend Your Loan Period Without Penalty;\" and \"iPawn has no minimum or maximum loan periods.\" (Dkt. No. 53-6, at 2). Another screenshot from the same website says: \"[I]f you find yourself in need of a short-term loan and the traditional loan process is not an option, contact an iPawn representative ....\" (Dkt. No. 53-7, at 2). A separate screenshot says, \"At iPawn, you use the items you already own to obtain a short-term loan to meet you[r] financial needs. Once you pay back your loan, you can pick up your item(s).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 3). A screenshot from iPawn Arkansas' facebook page shows a photo with \"iPawn\" and the phrase \"We Do Loans!\" (Dkt. No. 53-9, at 2). Finally, plaintiffs also present a screenshot of iPawn Arkansas' LinkedIn page, which contains the following statement: \"[I]f you find yourself in need of a short-term loan and the traditional loan process is not an option, contact an iPawn representative ....\" (Dkt. No. 53-10, at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs present the articles of incorporation of iPawn Arkansas to rebut defendants' arguments for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 53-3, at 2). The articles of incorporation state that the \"nature of the business of the corporation and the object or purposes proposed to be transacted, promoted or carried out by it, are as follows: (a) Provide collateral based loans for customers[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs also present a lease between iPawn Baseline and Green, Bunn, Herrington, LLC, for a property located at 6115 Baseline Road, Little Rock, Arkansas (Dkt. No. 53-14, at 2). According to this document, \"[t]he Premises shall be used for the operation of a business providing for pawn and loan services to consumers, as well as the retail sale of goods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The lease was signed by Mr. Landers on behalf of iPawn Baseline (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 9). A lease for the 11108 North Rodney Parham Road, Little Rock, Arkansas, location is also included in the record (Dkt. No. 53-15). This lease is between iPawn Rodney Parham and Leonard R. Ellis Properties, Inc., and it states that \"[t]he Premises shall be used for the operation of a business providing for pawn and loan services to consumers, as well as the retail sale of goods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The operating agreements for iPawn Baseline and iPawn Rodney Parham are also in the record (Dkt. Nos. 53-18, 53-19). The operating agreements indicate that iPawn Baseline and iPawn Rodney Parham are entirely owned by iPawn Arkansas (Dkt. Nos. 53-18, at 10; 53-19, at 10). Both operating agreements state that \"[t]he Company is organized to provide centralized management of business activities and investments.\" (Dkt. Nos. 53-18, at 7; 53-19, at 7). Both operating agreements are signed by Mr. Landers (Dkt. Nos. 53-18, at 38; 53-19 at 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on each of plaintiffs' six claims (Dkt. No. 44). Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment for the following reasons: (1) the TILA claims must fail because iPawn Rodney Parham and iPawn Baseline are not in the pawn business, plaintiffs cannot demonstrate reliance, and plaintiffs have not been harmed; (2) the usury and ADTPA claims must fail because the undisputed facts show that plaintiffs did not pay a usurious rate of interest; (3) the usury claims must fail because the pawn transactions were not loans and interest was not charged or paid; (4) the ADTPA claims must fail because plaintiffs did not suffer actual damages; (5) the ADTPA claims must fail because the finance charge is not equivalent to interest; and (6) the claims against Mr. Landers in his individual capacity must fail (Dkt. No. 45, at 8-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs retort that summary judgment is inappropriate based upon the record\n   evidence in this case. Specifically, plaintiffs make the following arguments: (1) summary judgment should be denied on the constitutional usury claims because the record evidence shows that defendants issued usurious loans; (2) the ADPTA claims should survive summary judgment because the record evidence shows that defendants' usurious practices violate the ADTPA, that plaintiffs sustained damages as a result, and that Mr. Landers is liable as a controlling person of iPawn Arkansas; (3) the usury claims against iPawn Rodney Parham and iPawn Baseline should be decided at trial because they are creditors on plaintiffs' pawn transactions; and (4) the TILA claims must be resolved at trial because plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and because iPawn Rodney Parham and iPawn Baseline failed to list themselves as creditors on plaintiffs' pawn tickets (Dkt. No. 53, at 10-35). In reply, defendants argue that the TILA claims must fail because the record evidence demonstrates that neither iPawn Rodney Parham nor iPawn Baseline were engaged in pawn transactions and that plaintiffs did not suffer harm based upon the alleged TILA violations (Dkt. No. 57, at 3-4). Defendants also assert that plaintiffs have failed to present record evidence that the pawn transactions at issue are governed by Arkansas' usury provisions (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5). Finally, defendants assert that plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they suffered material damages under ADTPA or that Mr. Landers is personally liable under the ADTPA (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

No. 71). With respect to the proposed class members, the only record evidence before the Court regarding the alleged usurious transactions were the pawn tickets; based upon this evidence, the Court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of showing that there were questions of law and fact common to the proposed class members (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Therefore, only the claims of Mr. Jones and Mr. Powell are before the Court. The Court next turns to examine whether defendants are entitled to summary judgment in their favor on plaintiffs' claims regarding the pawn transactions entered into by plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Mr. Jones\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   There is record evidence in the form of pawn tickets that Mr. Jones entered into three separate pawn transactions with defendants (Dkt. No. 44-3, at 22-24). Pawn ticket 107937 shows that, on December 5, 2015, Mr. Jones pawned a \"Boss BV93648 CD Player.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 22). The header of pawn ticket 107937 says, \"iPawn Arkansas, Inc.\" and references the Baseline Road location (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The amount financed on pawn ticket 107937 is $100.00, the finance charge is $25.00, the total of payments is $125.00, and the annual percentage rate is listed as 300.00% (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Similarly, pawn ticket 116589 shows that Mr. Jones pawned a \"Homelite UT3 String Trimmer\" on June 13, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 23). The amount financed is $40.00, the finance charge is $10.00, the total of payments is $50.00, and the listed annual percentage rate is 300.00% (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 23). The third pawn ticket attributed to Mr. Jones is pawn ticket 116741, which shows that Mr. Jones pawned a \"Car Stereo Power Acoustik\" at the Rodney Parham location on June 20, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 24). The amount financed on pawn ticket 116741 was $15.00 and the finance charge was $3.75, with a total of payments indicated as $18.75 on the pawn ticket (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The annual percentage rate on pawn ticket 11674 is listed as \"N/A,\" and this pawn ticket contains an arbitration clause (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Each of these three pawn tickets contains the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   You are giving a security interest in the following pledged goods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   See the remainder of this contract for any additional information concerning nonpayment and default and prepayment refunds or penalties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   The undersigned Pledgor agrees that the term of this loan shall be for the period set forth herein and that at the end of such period, all charges due on this loan shall be paid in full.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   I also understand and acknowledge that I am giving a security interest in the pledged goods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 22-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Mr. Jones stated that, in the past, he had picked up his property from pawn shops (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 3-4). Mr. Jones testified that he had \"twice\" gone back and obtained an extension on his pawned merchandise with iPawn (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5). Mr. Jones further testified that there have been occasions when he pawned an item at an iPawn location and his property was sold (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 53-20, at 11). Mr. Jones testified that, as to his property, \"[m]y intentions were to go back and get it, and the money wasn't right, so I wasn't able to go back and get it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Jones also testified that, after he filed this lawsuit, he went to the Rodney Parham location where he was returned his car stereo and trimmer (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 4). He stated that, on this occasion, he did not need to pay a fee for the return of his property (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Jones testified that he received two pawn tickets when he was returned his items (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Based upon the record evidence, the Court concludes that there remain genuine issues of material fact as to whether defendants knowingly entered into loans charging usurious interest with Mr. Jones. First, certain aspects of the form of the transactions described by Mr. Jones resemble the transactions described in\n   <em>\n    Sparks\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McGhee\n   </em>\n   , both of which were ruled to be usurious loans. Briefly, in\n   <em>\n    Sparks\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff sold a sewing machine to defendant in exchange for $8.00 and a right of redemption.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20S.W.%20460\">\n    51 S.W. at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff had the right to repurchase the sewing machine for $8.00 plus 80 cents within a month.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20S.W.%20460\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    McGhee\n   </em>\n   , the Arkansas Supreme Court held that transactions\n   authorized under the Check Casher's act were loans.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8151813\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/375/52/\">\n    289 S.W.3d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As described in\n   <em>\n    Luebbers\n   </em>\n   , check-cashing transactions involve a borrower who provides a check to a lender in exchange for an amount of cash that is less than the face value of the check, and then the borrower has the option to repurchase the check for its face value. In short, the transactions in\n   <em>\n    Sparks\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Luebbers\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    McGhee\n   </em>\n   involve a loan collateralized by either merchandise or check, and the Arkansas Supreme Court characterized the fees charged for repurchase or to extend the right to repurchase as interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Mr. Jones' three documented pawn transactions involve the same form: (1) he exchanged property for cash and a right to redeem the property for a fee, and (2) he had the right to extend the right to redeem the property for a fee. Furthermore, Mr. Jones testified that it was his intent to recover his property and that he was not able to do so because \"the money wasn't right ....\" (Dkt. No. 53-20, at 11). Additionally, the form of the pawn tickets attributable to Mr. Jones state that Mr. Jones is \"giving a security interest\" and \"agrees that the term of this\n   <em>\n    loan\n   </em>\n   shall be for the period set forth herein ....\" (Dkt. No. 44-3, at 22-24 (emphasis added) ). Also, iPawn Arkansas' website and social media postings reference their willingness to make loans (Dkt. Nos. 53-6, 53-7, 53-9, 53-10). Finally, iPawn Arkansas' own articles of incorporation state that the \"nature of the business of the corporation are ... [to] [p]rovide collateral based loans for customers ....\" (Dkt. No. 53-3, at 2). The \"finance charge\" on each of the pawn tickets is 25% of the \"amount financed\" and is due monthly, which means that the annual sum of the finance charges is 300% of the amount financed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also notes Mr. Gammill's opinion that these transactions do not qualify as loans based upon their size, term, repayment requirement, lack of credit checks, lack of credit reporting, and existence of a pawn service charge (Dkt. No. 44-2, at 6). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movants, the Court concludes that the differences between traditional bank loans and pawn transactions identified by Mr. Gammill may not prevent the pawn transactions entered into by Mr. Jones from being classified as \"loans\" under Arkansas law. Further, the Court notes that in Mr. Johns' opinion, he refers to the merchandise provided by the customer as \"collateral.\" (Dkt. No. 53-29, at 2-3). Based upon the precedents discussed above, and based upon the record evidence before the Court with all reasonable inferences drawn in favor of plaintiffs, the Court concludes that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute as to whether defendants knowingly entered into loans charging a usurious rate of interest with Mr. Jones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Mr. Powell\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court also concludes that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute as to whether defendants knowingly entered into loans charging a usurious rate of interest with Mr. Powell. There are two pawn tickets in the record attributable to Mr. Powell: pawn tickets 108913 and 112532 (Dkt. No. 44-4, at 19-20). Pawn ticket 108913 is for three items, and the amount financed is $40.00, the finance charge is $10.00, the total of payments is $50.00, and the annual percentage rate is 300.00% (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 19). Pawn ticket 112532 is\n   for one item, and the amount financed is $115.00, the finance charge is $28.75, the total of payments is $143.75, and the annual percentage rate is 300.00% (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 20). Both pawn tickets contain the same language used in Mr. Jones' pawn tickets (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 19-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Mr. Powell describes pawn transactions as transactions where \"[y]ou pledge property for a loan\" and \"[y]ou lose your property\" if you do not pay the money back (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 9). Mr. Powell testified that he received \"an extension on both\" of his pawn tickets, though he does not recall what he paid for the extensions (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 16-17). Mr. Powell further testified that he \"lost\" an item to defendants, though it is not clear if this item is listed on either of the pawn tickets in the record attributable to Mr. Powell (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 9). Mr. Powell also testified that he was not able to redeem the merchandise listed in his two pawn tickets (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 10-11). Again, the Court also notes Mr. Gammill's opinion that these transactions do not qualify as loans based upon their size, term, repayment requirement, lack of credit checks, lack of credit reporting, and existence of a pawn service charge (Dkt. No. 44-2, at 6). Even with the benefit of Mr. Gammill's opinion, based upon the same precedents discussed in the preceding section, the form of the pawn transactions engaged in by Mr. Powell, Mr. Powell's understanding of pawn transactions, the language of the pawn tickets, the opinions of the two experts, and iPawn Arkansas' characterization of its services as \"loans,\" the Court concludes that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute as to whether defendants knowingly entered into loans charging a usurious rate of interest with Mr. Powell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   To the extent defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on the claims under Amendment 89 and Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a7 4-57-104 because plaintiffs were not charged interest, the Court concludes that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute on the question of whether defendants charged plaintiffs' interest or whether plaintiffs otherwise suffered damages as a result of the pawn transactions. Per Amendment 89 to the Arkansas Constitution, \"[a]ll contracts under Section 3 having a rate of interest in excess of the maximum lawful rate shall be void as to principal and interest ....\" Ark. Const. Amend. 89, \u00a7 6 (b). Arkansas courts have implied that the mere act of\n   <em>\n    charging\n   </em>\n   usurious interest creates a usurious contract.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Mr. Powell also testified that he was not able to redeem the merchandise described in pawn tickets 108913 and 112532 (Dkt. Nos. 44-4, at 9; 53-24, at 10). Viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the finance charge and extension fees paid by plaintiffs may be construed as interest. Furthermore, again viewing the record evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, plaintiffs may have lost merchandise because of their defaults on the loans extended by defendants.

The Arkansas Supreme Court has held that Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a7 4-88-107(a)(10) of the ADTPA \"may be violated by charging usurious interest rates ....\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Bryant v.

Defendants have cited the Court to no authority that indicates that the usury analysis under the ADTPA differs from the usury analysis under Amendment 89 or Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a7 4-57-104. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed in the preceding section, the Court concludes that genuine issues of material fact remain in dispute regarding whether defendants violated the ADTPA by charging plaintiffs usurious rates of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendants also assert that plaintiffs' ADTPA usury claims must fail because plaintiffs did not suffer actual damages (Dkt. No. 45, at 13-14). The ADTPA limits private rights of action to those persons who suffer \"an actual financial loss as a result of his or her reliance\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the use of a practice declared unlawful by this chapter ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-88-113\">\n    Ark.

Jan. 7, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   These precedents are factually distinct from the present case, where the record evidence indicates that Mr. Powell was not able to redeem the merchandise referenced in pawn tickets 108913 and 112523 (Dkt. Nos. 44-4, at 11; 53-24, at 10). The record evidence also shows that Mr. Powell received an extension on both of these pawn tickets, though it is unclear if he paid a fee for the extensions (Dkt. No. 44-4, at 16). The record evidence also shows that Mr. Jones \"twice\" went back and obtained an extension on his pawned merchandise with iPawn, though it is unclear if the referenced extensions relate to any of the pawn tickets attributable to Mr. Jones in the record (Dkt. No. 44-3, at 5). Furthermore, there is record evidence that Mr. Jones pawned an item at an iPawn location and that his property was sold (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 53-20, at 11). Viewing the record evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the record evidence indicates that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute as to whether plaintiffs engaged in pawn transactions that were loans charging usurious rates of interest and that plaintiffs were charged interest and lost their property to defendants. Accordingly, the Court concludes that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute as to whether plaintiffs suffered \"actual damages\" as that phrase is defined by the ADTPA. Accordingly, the Court denies defendants' motion for summary judgment on this basis on plaintiffs' usury claim under the ADTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    D. False Statement Claim Under The ADTPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' third claim, which is brought pursuant to the ADTPA. In that claim, plaintiffs allege that the statement on the pawn tickets that the finance charge \"is not interest for any purpose of law\" violates the ADTPA (Dkt. No. 33, \u00b6\u00b6 107-110). Defendants argue that plaintiffs have not suffered any \"actual damages\" under the ADTPA and that \"[a] finance charge is not interest.\" (Dkt. No. 45, at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Court disagrees that defendants are entitled to summary judgment based on either of these arguments. In short, these arguments recycle arguments made by defendants against plaintiffs' usury claims. As to the argument that plaintiffs have not suffered any \"actual damages,\" the Court finds that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute regarding whether plaintiffs engaged in pawn transactions that were disguised loans charging usurious rates of interest and suffered actual damages as a result. Furthermore, as discussed earlier, there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute as to whether the finance charge at issue qualifies as interest on a loan under Arkansas constitutional and statutory law. For these reasons, the Court denies defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' false statement claim under the ADTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Steve Landers' Alleged Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendants argue that summary judgment is appropriate on plaintiffs' claims against Mr. Landers in his individual capacity because he is a passive investor in the other defendants (Dkt. No. 45, at 14-16). They argue that the undisputed material facts show that Mr. Landers does not exercise day-to-day control over the other defendants, that he does not participate in pawn transactions, that he rarely visits the pawn shops, and that he did not set the alleged rates of interest charged to plaintiffs (Dkt. No. 45, at 15). Defendants assert that Mr. Landers is shielded from personal liability by the corporate form of iPawn Arkansas, for which he is the sole shareholder\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs respond by citing to Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a7 4-88-113(d)(1) and\n   <em>\n    Roggasch v.

The ADTPA provides that \"[e]very person who directly or indirectly controls another person who is in violation of or liable under [the ADTPA] shall be jointly and severally liable ..., provided that the person ... knew or reasonably should have known of the existence of the facts by reason of which the violation or liability exists.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-88-113\">\n    Ark.

Section 1638(a)(1) of the TILA requires that \"[f]or each consumer credit transaction ... the creditor shall disclose ... the identity of the creditor required to make disclosure.\" The TILA defines a \"creditor\" as \"a person who ... regularly extends ... consumer\n   <em>\n    credit\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (emphasis added).

No. 45, at 9). It is defendants' position that iPawn Arkansas is the only entity with whom plaintiffs conducted the pawn transactions (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In support of this argument, defendants point to the pawn tickets attributable to plaintiffs and point out that \"[i]Pawn Arkansas, Inc.'s name is clearly stated on all of the Plaintiffs' pawn ticket[s].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 8). Defendants also argue that the undisputed material facts show that plaintiffs cannot demonstrate detrimental reliance, which is a necessary element to prove a disclosure violation under the TILA (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 9). In response, plaintiffs point to the leases executed by iPawn Rodney Parham and iPawn Baseline, both of which state that leases are \"for the operation of a business providing for pawn and loan services to consumers, as well as the retail sale of goods.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   On the first question, the Court concludes that a genuine issue of material fact-whether the finance charges on plaintiffs' pawn transactions is \"credit\"-remains in dispute in this case. On the face of the pawn tickets attributable to plaintiffs, the finance charges are due a month after the pawn transaction occurs (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 44-3, at 22-24; 44-4, at 19-20). Mr. Jones testified that he had returned to iPawn to receive an extension on his pawn (Dkt. No. 44-3, at 5). In Mr. Willingham's deposition, he testified that if pawn customers \"choose to extend it out for 30 days, we make a profit on the pawn service charge.\" (Dkt. No. 53-28, at 5). This testimony, viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, indicates that the finance charges are due\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the pawn transaction initially occurs, which makes them more akin to the facts of\n   <em>\n    Holbrooke\n   </em>\n   than\n   <em>\n    Yancy.\n   </em>\n   Based upon these precedents and viewing the record evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the Court concludes that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute regarding whether the finance charges included in plaintiffs' pawn transactions qualify as \"credit\" under the TILA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As to the second question-whether iPawn Rodney Parham and iPawn Baseline were involved in the pawn business-the Court concludes that there are still material issues in dispute. Mr. Willingham and Mr. Landers aver that neither of these entities are involved in the pawn business (Dkt. Nos. 44-1, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; 44-4, \u00b6 4). Mr. Willingham avers that these entities \"were formed to enter into leases with the owner of the realty on which each of the iPawn Arkansas, Inc. stores were located.\" (Dkt. No. 44-1, \u00b6 18). The leases for iPawn Rodney Parham and iPawn Baseline both state that \"[t]he Premises shall be used for the operation of a business providing for pawn and loan services to consumers, as well as the retail sale of goods.\" (Dkt. Nos. 53-14, at 2; 53-15, at 2). Furthermore, Mr. Jones testified that he thought he was doing business with iPawn Baseline and \"Rodney Parham\" because he was at those locations (Dkt. No. 53-20, at 15). As to the pawn tickets attributable to Mr. Jones, one includes the Baseline address and the other two state the Rodney Parham address, though all three say \"iPawn Arkansas, Inc.\" at the top (Dkt. No. 44-3, at 22-24). Both pawn tickets attributable to Mr. Powell have the Baseline address on them, and both pawn tickets also have \"iPawn Arkansas, Inc.\" on the header (Dkt. No. 44-4, at 19-20). The Court is not swayed by the\n   non-controlling authorities cited by defendants for the position that affiliated companies, officers, agents, and employees are not creditors under the TILA, especially given the record evidence before the Court (Dkt. No. 57, at 2-3). The record evidence cuts both ways, but viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs as the Court is required to do at this stage of the proceeding, the Court concludes that there remain genuine issues of material fact in dispute regarding whether iPawn Rodney Parham and iPawn Baseline qualify as \"creditors\" under the TILA, engaged in pawn transactions governed by the TILA, and failed to place their names on the pawn tickets memorializing such pawn transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Detrimental Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The final question is whether summary judgment is appropriate on the TILA claims because plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate detrimental reliance. The Eighth Circuit has held that, to receive actual damages as a remedy for a disclosure violation under \u00a7 1638(a)(2), \"a plaintiff must show that: (1) he read the TILA disclosure statement; (2) he understood the charges being disclosed; (3) had the disclosure been accurate, he would have sought a lower price; and (4) he would have obtained a lower price.\"\n   <em>\n    Peters v. Jim Lupient Oldsmobile Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209654\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/915/\">\n    220 F.3d 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). In the\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   case, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment against plaintiff because the \"record reveals no evidence that [plaintiff] would have received a lower premium on the two insurance policies from any other insurance provider or that he suffered any actual damages.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209654\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/915/\">\n    220 F.3d at 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since \"the only remedy for a violation of \u00a7 1638(a)(2)(B)(iii) is actual damages and [plaintiff] cannot show any actual damages,\" the Eighth Circuit concluded that plaintiff's TILA claim failed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209654\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/915/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   According to defendants, plaintiffs \"stated that they were not harmed\" and have not demonstrated detrimental reliance (Dkt. No. 45, at 9). Plaintiffs respond that they are entitled to declaratory relief under the TILA and that therefore detrimental reliance is not an element of their claims under the TILA (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 45, at 34). In reply, defendants argue that plaintiffs did not plead for declaratory relief in their operative complaint and that \"requesting declaratory relief does not transform a legally deficient claim into a viable claim.\" (Dkt. No. 57, at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   First, the Court will address the pleading issue. The Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , provides that, \"[i]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction ... any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Plaintiffs did not ask specifically for any form of relief certain on any of their claims alleged in the third amended complaint (Dkt. No. 33), including but not limited to their TILA claims (Dkt. No. 33, at 18). Instead, plaintiffs requested relief in the last \"wherefore\" paragraph of their third amended complaint (Dkt. No. 33, at 19). Further, the operative complaint contains claims for declaratory relief under the state law usury claims (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court concludes that the operative complaint is sufficient to put defendants on notice that plaintiffs were seeking a declaratory judgment regarding iPawn Rodney Parham and iPawn Baseline's obligations to disclose their identities on the pawn tickets. The operative complaint does not cite\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but it does contain claims for violations of the TILA by iPawn Rodney Parham and iPawn Baseline and a request for \"[a]ny other relief this Court deems just and\n   proper.\" (Dkt. No. 33, at 19). For these reasons, the Court concludes that, under federal pleading standards, the \"appropriate pleading\" has been filed for purposes of compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and defendants were on notice of a request for declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Court next turns to the question of whether detrimental reliance is a required element where a plaintiff seeks declaratory relief for a violation of \u00a7 1638(a)(1). The\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   decision relied upon by defendants is inapposite because, as the Eighth Circuit recognized, the only remedy for the claims raised in that case-claims based upon \u00a7 1638(a)(2) -was actual damages, and the elements discussed in that case are directed at the proof necessary to demonstrate actual damages, not declaratory relief.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209654\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/915/\">\n    220 F.3d at 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither party has directed the Court to authorities that state whether actual damages are the only available remedy for violations of \u00a7 1638(a)(1). Defendants cite to\n   <em>\n    Christ v. Beneficial Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050797\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/547/1292/#p1298\">\n    547 F.3d 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1298 (11th Cir. 2008), and\n   <em>\n    Bolin v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11156157,11181526\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/231/970/\">\n    231 F.3d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 978-79 (5th Cir. 2000), two non-controlling cases, for the proposition that the TILA does not provide for declaratory relief, but these cases discuss whether certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate based upon a request for declaratory relief; the Court does not understand these cases to stand for the proposition that declaratory relief is wholly unavailable for violations of \u00a7 1638(a)(1). Further, the Court can find no controlling authority on this issue as it relates to an alleged violation of \u00a7 1638(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Eighth Circuit has held that, even when a borrower cannot establish actual damages, lenders may be liable for technical or minor violations of the TILA because, for example, a proven violation of disclosure requirements is presumed to frustrate the Act's remedial purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dryden v. Lou Budke's Arrow Finance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1181948\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/661/1186/#p1191\">\n    661 F.2d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1191 (8th Cir. 1981). While plaintiffs do not appear to be seeking statutory damages for the alleged technical violations of the TILA, nothing in the authorities reviewed by this Court suggests that plaintiffs cannot seek declaratory relief based upon the same alleged technical violations. Accordingly, the Court declines to grant summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs' TILA claims due to plaintiffs' alleged failure to demonstrate detrimental reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   It is so ordered, this the 5th day of March, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    To the extent defendants argue that Amendment 89 has altered the definition of \"loan\" as applied to this litigation, the Court disagrees. Amendment 89 does not contain a definition for \"loan or contracts\" as those words are used in Section 3 of Amendment 89 ; rather, Amendment 89 defines \"loan or financing transaction by or to a federally insured depository institution\" and \"loans made by or to governmental units.\" Ark.
