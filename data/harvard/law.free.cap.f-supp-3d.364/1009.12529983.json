Plaintiff Lisa Russ (\"Russ\") requests judicial review of the Secretary of Education's final decision that she is responsible for consolidated student loan debt. She asserts this debt was the result of identity theft. Russ asserts that the United States Department of Education (\"the Department\") fraudulently and improperly denied her identify theft claim, as\n   well as fraudulently determined that she is obligated to pay her student loan. Defendants contend that Russ's complaint should be dismissed, for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted as the fraud claim lacks sufficient specificity, and that the case should be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction due to the Department's sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lisa Russ was married to Kevin W. Russ in 1994.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In either 1995 or 1996, Lisa Russ and Kevin Russ consolidated their undergraduate student loans. In 2000, they divorced. Under their divorce decree, Kevin Russ was responsible for the consolidated student loans totaling approximately $ 55,000-$ 25,000 of which belonged to Lisa Russ. During her divorce proceedings, Lisa Russ applied for and received student loans for a master's degree program. Sometime after her divorce Lisa Russ received a past due notice from a student loan servicer, Great Lakes Higher Education Corporation and Affiliates (\"Great Lakes\"). The notice showed a balance for the spousal consolidation loan exceeding $ 121,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Russ inquired with both Great Lakes and the Department regarding the past due loan. Great Lakes told Russ that the loan account information was accessible on Studentloans.gov and that if the website did not list the loan, then she was not responsible for it. Studenloans.gov did not list the $ 121,000 loan. She also contacted the Department, providing the loan identification number Great Lakes had given her. Based on this identification number, the only loan records the Department possessed were from her master's degree program. Later, Russ attempted to refinance some loans but was unsuccessful due to her poor credit report based on the delinquent student loans. She alleges that Great Lakes and the Department are responsible for these negative reports on her credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After subsequent inquiries into Great Lakes' loan document records by Russ, it provided her with a 1999 promissory note and a 2012 unemployment request. Russ further alleges that these forms are fraudulent and that her identity was stolen. In January 2016, she filed an identity theft report with the Saunders County Sheriff's Department, which sent a subpoena to Great Lakes in February 2016. By September 2016, Great Lakes had yet to respond. She also contacted the Department, which issued a final decision on March 22, 2017, denying Russ's identity theft claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 22, 2017, Russ filed an amended complaint alleging her inability to obtain loan refinancing due to her damaged credit because of Defendants' failure to clarify her loan obligations. Accordingly, she claims defendants violated the CCPA, including FDCPA and FCRA subchapters, by continuing to seek loan collection payments in error. Moreover, she claims Defendants acted fraudulently by denying her identity theft claim, alleging the Department's denial is incorrect. As a result, Russ is requesting judicial review of the Department's final decision to deny her identity theft claim; injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from proceeding on the Department's decision; declaratory relief that she is not obligated to Great Lakes; declaratory relief that Great Lakes is civilly liable for its CCPA violations; declaratory relief that Defendants were negligent pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681o ; declaratory relief that Defendants acted fraudulently; restoration of her credit; and attorney's fees, costs, and litigation expenses. The Department filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and both Defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant\n   to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.

TILA does not address sovereign immunity. This demonstrates that the Department has not given its consent to suit, and therefore, it is immune from claims brought against it. While the TILA does not address sovereign immunity, it does address statutory exemptions. Russ's consolidated student loan is exempt from TILA's statutory obligations because it is a loan \"made, insured, or guaranteed pursuant to\" the Higher Education Act (\"HEA\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201603\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7).

Although FCRA includes in its definition of potentially liable \"person\" any \"government or governmental subdivision or agency,\" this definition is not sufficient to permit Russ to sue the Department. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(b).

Instead, Russ merely asserts the Department sought to collect payment on the consolidated loan and made negative credit reports against her. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 38\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 54). This is not a fraud claim; instead, it is a conclusory statement.

Both of Russ's fraud claims are not specific enough to merit judicial relief, therefore, her fraud claims are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Russ claims she is entitled to review of the Department's final decision to deny her identity theft claim, thus obligating her to pay the consolidated student loan. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 38\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). She alleges judicial\n   review is necessary because the Department acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and failed to support its decision to deny her claim without sufficient evidence in the record. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 38\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57). Further, the government seems to concede that Russ has a right to proceed with this claim. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 48\n   </em>\n   , at 2).

Certain loans are exempt from TILA's statutory requirements, such as loans made under the HEA.

Therefore, her FCBA claim is dismissed for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Similarly, Russ's FDCPA claim against Great Lakes, the student loan servicer, fails to allege adequately that Great Lakes is subject to FDCPA's statutory requirements. A company is subject to the FDCPA if it is a \"debt collector,\" or a \"person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce ... who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). The statutory definition as well as the act's legislative history is determinative if a company is subject to the FDCPA. The act's legislative history reveals that section 1692a(6) was intended to cover independent debt collectors and not to cover the \"collection of debts such as ... student loans, by persons who originated such loans ... [or] others who service outstanding debts for others.\" S. Rep. No. 95-382, 95th Cong., 1st Sess.

She only asserts conclusory statements without further factual allegations.

FCRA \u00a7 1681s-2(a) outlines duties and prohibitions that credit furnishers must follow. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(a). Although Russ alleges Great Lakes violated some of these statutory requirements, her complaint fails to assert a viable claim for relief because she\n   does not have a private right of action to enforce section 1681s-2(a). Instead, FCRA limits section 1681s-2(a)'s enforcement to federal and state agencies: \"[T]he provisions ... shall be enforced exclusively as provided under section 1681s of this title by the Federal agencies and officials and the State officials.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(d). As such, her claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, Russ's fraud claim is dismissed for lack of specificity to constitute a valid fraud claim. She merely asserts Great Lakes \"sought to collect payment, and made negative reports on [her] credit\" (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 38\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 54). This is not a fraud claim; instead, it is a conclusory statement.
