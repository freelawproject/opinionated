Under\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   , unions could forcibly collect fees from nonmembers as a condition of employment as long as those fees were put toward collective bargaining rather than political or ideological activities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n    at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, on June 27, 2018, the Supreme Court overruled\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Janus v. American Federation of State, County, &amp; Municipal Employees, Council 31\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613066\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2448/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613066\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2448/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). The Court held that collecting fees from nonconsenting public sector employees violates the First\n   Amendment, regardless of how the fees are spent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Justin Carey, JoBeth Deibel, David Gaston, Roger Kinney, and Keith Sanborn are public school employees who work in bargaining units represented by WEA but are not union members themselves. Prior to June 27, 2018, the collective bargaining agreements governing Plaintiffs' units required them to pay agency fees to WEA, which were deducted from their paychecks. This practice was authorized under Washington law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 41.59.060, 41.59.100. However, on June 27, 2018, WEA and the State Defendants sent out communications discontinuing the practice of forcibly collecting fees from nonunion employees. WEA's records indicate that no agency fees have been deducted from Plaintiffs' paychecks since June 27 and that the school districts where Plaintiffs work have stopped collecting fees from nonunion workers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A few months before the\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   opinion was announced, Plaintiffs sued WEA and the State Defendants seeking a declaration that the laws and collective bargaining agreements permitting public-sector unions to collect agency fees from nonunion members are unconstitutional. Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief against all future collection of agency fees from nonunion members. Finally, and most controversially, Plaintiffs assert a \u00a7 1983 claim based on violation of their First Amendment rights, as well as state law claims for conversion, trespass to chattels, replevin, restitution, and unjust enrichment that Plaintiffs recently added in their First Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 55-1, at 8. Plaintiffs request that the Court order WEA to \"disgorge and refund\" all agency fees collected from Plaintiffs and any certified class members. Dkt. # 55-1, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its Motion, WEA asks the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief as moot because WEA has already changed its policy to stop collecting fees from nonunion members. WEA similarly argues that declaratory relief is unnecessary because\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   already declared the relevant conduct unconstitutional. WEA contends that Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claim for monetary relief must also be dismissed because WEA acted in good-faith reliance on then-valid Washington law when collecting fees from nonunion members. If the Court grants WEA's Motion, WEA requests that the Court decline to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. For the following reasons, WEA's Motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   WEA argues that Plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief is moot because WEA ceased collecting agency fees from nonunion members immediately after the\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   decision was published. WEA also asserts that the doctrine of \"voluntary cessation\" does not apply because WEA ceased fee collection in response to an intervening change in law, not litigation. In any case, even if WEA's cessation of fee collection could be characterized as voluntary, WEA argues that there is no reasonable expectation that the practice will continue. Finally, WEA contends that declaratory relief is uncalled for because the\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   decision itself already declared unconstitutional the compulsory payment of agency fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs respond with two incongruous arguments. First, Plaintiffs argue that\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   did not \"change\" the law at all, but rather corrected the Court's misinterpretation in\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   and announced what the Constitution has always mandated. Second, Plaintiffs contend that this non-change in the law imposes no new requirements on those who were not parties to the suit. In other words, despite holding that the practices of unions like WEA have always been unconstitutional, WEA has \"no formal legal obligation\" to conform to the ruling.

Plaintiffs first respond that WEA's good faith defense fails because private parties may only assert the good faith defense in \u00a7 1983 cases where the corresponding common law tort also allows for such a defense, and WEA cannot satisfy that requirement here. Second, Plaintiffs contend that the good faith defense requires evidence of the defendant's subjective state of mind, which WEA has not provided. Plaintiffs also suggest that WEA had subjective knowledge that\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   would be overruled because of the Supreme Court's warnings to that effect.

Both the allegations in the Complaint and the evidence presented by WEA indicate that it did. Although the First Amended Complaint alleges that WEA\n   <em>\n    expected\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court to overrule\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   , such an expectation cannot produce subjective belief in unconstitutionality when the defendant is also aware that the prior holding has not been overruled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 61, at 5. In other words, a defendant's expectation about future unconstitutionality is irrelevant because a defendant's own beliefs about what the constitution says hold no weight if they clash with their knowledge of clear judicial precedent. If anything, a defendant's belief that a prior holding will be overruled only serves to emphasize their awareness of a binding constitutional decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   All of the evidence shows that WEA consciously relied on a then-valid Washington statute. WEA had a practice of tracking which employees were nonunion members or religious objectors and WEA immediately shifted its procedures to comply with\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   after the decision was handed down.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 34, at 2, 4;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556198\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/1090/#p1097\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A. This evidences WEA's knowledge of the relevant constitutional requirements. In any case, Plaintiffs have presented no facts or allegations demonstrating that WEA acted with complete legal ignorance of\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   's holding, and no amount of discovery will allow Plaintiffs to prove something that both the evidence and common sense contradict. WEA collected agency fees from nonunion members because it correctly believed that doing so was lawful at the time. It therefore may assert the good faith defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs set forth a variety of arguments against application of the good faith defense. Those arguments are addressed more fully below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    1. Availability of the Good Faith Defense based on Common Law Tort Analogy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs first contend that\n   <em>\n    Wyatt\n   </em>\n   established a \"rule\" under which a defendant may only assert the good faith defense if it would be available under the common law tort most analogous to the plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claim. Consequently, Plaintiffs argue, WEA cannot assert the defense because the proper common law analogue in this case is conversion, which has no scienter requirement and thus no possibility of a good faith defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Wyatt\n   </em>\n   was far narrower, and the dicta far murkier, than Plaintiffs present it.

According to Plaintiffs, it is entirely possible that WEA expected the Supreme Court to overrule\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   because the Court had previously given indications that\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   's constitutionality was uncertain.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Plaintiffs point out that even the\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   decision itself observed that \"public-sector unions have been on notice for years regarding this Court's misgivings about\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613066\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2448/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the roots of the good faith defense suggest that good faith may be decided as a matter of law when the defendant relied upon a valid statute. Justice Kennedy observed this in his\n   <em>\n    Wyatt\n   </em>\n   concurrence, alluding to\n   <em>\n    Birdsall v. Smith\n   </em>\n   's proclamation that \"[e]very statute should be considered valid until there is a judicial determination to the contrary, and\n   these defendants had a right to act upon such assumption.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728192\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/158/#p168\">\n    504 U.S. at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6516625\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/112/1827/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring) (citing\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1585820\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/158/390/#p394\">\n    158 Mich. 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 394,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20N.W.%20626\">\n    122 N.W. 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1909).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, WEA had a similar right to act on the assumption that RCW 41.59.060 and 41.59.100 were valid law, despite any Supreme Court insinuations that stopped short of overruling\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   . As courts have observed, any other approach would require \"telepathy\" on the part of defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Danielson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527883\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/340/1083/#p1084\">\n    340 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1086 ;\n   <em>\n    Winner v.

Plaintiffs' position is premised on the idea that judicial decisions do not change the law but merely interpret what it has always said.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harper v. Virginia Dep't of Taxation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355584\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/86/#p97\">\n    509 U.S. 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355584\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/86/#p97\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355584\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/86/#p97\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) ; Dkt. # 53, at 1. This theoretically opens the door for a private individual's ideas to align with the Constitution even when the judiciary had previously held something different, so long as that holding is eventually reversed. However, until Americans can time travel to read the opinions of the Supreme Court's final iteration, this application of\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   would give rise to a chaotic form of constitutional gambling. Legal fictions aside, there are myriad factors that influence constitutional interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Adam M. Samaha,\n   <em>\n    Dead Hand Arguments and Constitutional Interpretation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Colum.%20L.%20Rev.%20606\">\n    108 Colum. L. Rev. 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633 (2008) (explaining the disagreements about the purpose of constitutional interpretation); Thomas B. Colby &amp; Peter J. Smith,\n   <em>\n    Living Originalism\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Duke%20L.J.%20239\">\n    59 Duke L.J. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (explaining disagreements among adherents to originalism). As long as such inconsistency exists, it would be a mistake to punish individuals who adhered to the law while aware that it may fluctuate in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Plaintiffs' approach would have the practical effect of destabilizing the very role of the judiciary. As Chief Justice Marshall established in 1803, \"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\"\n   <em>\n    Marbury v. Madison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/#p177\">\n    5 U.S. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6759998,6760011,12121622\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cranch/1/137/\">\n    1 Cranch 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/#p177\">\n    2 L.Ed. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1803). But if a defendant's personal beliefs or expectations about the constitution could legally bind their actions,\n   <em>\n    Marbury\n   </em>\n   's pivotal holding would be thrown into doubt. Stripped of the security provided by unequivocal precedent, private individuals would be forced to become constitutional scholars tasked with deciding if they truly agree with the Supreme Court's reasoning to avoid future liability. Even worse, those who disagreed with a ruling and deeply believed the Court would eventually overturn it would be forced to choose between their own convictions and the Court's. In a time when American society is as divided as ever about the meaning of the constitution, embracing Plaintiffs' approach would have pernicious effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This does not mean that the subjective good faith defense is coextensive with qualified immunity. For example, in a situation where a broad constitutional holding may or may not apply to a novel fact pattern, qualified immunity would apply if it was not \"clearly established\" that the holding extended to the new scenario.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Dillard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251626\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/864/#p871\">\n    818 F.3d 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871 (9th Cir. 2016) (concluding that, although the domestic violence nature of an investigation does not automatically create reasonable suspicion, this was not clearly established at the time the officer detained\n   the plaintiff). In contrast, the good faith defense would not shield a defendant so long as they genuinely believed the prior holding applied to the new scenario, regardless of whether this was \"clearly established\" at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   But this case does not involve a novel application of a broad constitutional holding; instead, it involves the exact type of conduct that the Court had sanctioned in a previous case. It therefore does not matter how many \"warnings\" the Court may have given about its intention to overrule\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   . Until it actually did so,\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   was the law of the land and WEA's conscious compliance with that ruling can establish its good faith as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    3. Compliance with Pre-\n   </em>\n   Janus\n   <em>\n    Case Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a backup plan, Plaintiffs argue that WEA cannot assert the good faith defense because it has not proven that it complied with\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   's requirement that unions only collect fees from non-members if those fees go toward non-ideological activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n    431 U.S. at 239-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . WEA responds that Plaintiffs' Complaint does not allege that WEA failed to comply with\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   . In any case, WEA argues that this is a different claim that would not preclude the application of the good faith defense to Plaintiffs' claim that he is entitled to retroactive compensation based on\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   WEA is correct on both points. Although Plaintiffs amended their Complaint to basically re-state the legal argument contained in their Opposition brief, this is not a \"plausible\" allegation that WEA violated the pre-\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   requirements for collecting fees from nonunion members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Furthermore, even if WEA does carry the burden of proving its good faith compliance with the law (which seems doubtful), this does not mean that it must prove its compliance with\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   law. Rather, to assert the defense, WEA need only have believed that the complained-of conduct was constitutionally valid at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wyatt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517086\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/1113/#p1118\">\n    994 F.2d at 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant can only be liable if they \"knew or should have known of the statute's constitutional infirmity\"). Here, the complained-of conduct was forcibly collecting fees from non-members, which was later held to be unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   . However, because WEA correctly relied on a then-valid statute in collecting fees, it may assert the good faith defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    4. The Good Faith Defense's Application to Equitable Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the good faith defense can only shield a defendant from damages and does not apply to claims for equitable relief, such as restitution or unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

WEA responds that the facts alleged by Plaintiffs do not support an equitable remedy because WEA relied on a presumptively valid statute in collecting the fees and because Plaintiffs had no expectation of a refund and received the benefit of collective bargaining representation.

Not only have all of Plaintiffs' federal claims been dismissed, but the remaining state law claims were not even part of the case until a few weeks ago. Allowing a plaintiff's case to continue in federal court because of a late-stage amended complaint indiscriminately tacking on state law claims would be unfair, uneconomical, and contrary to principles of comity. Plaintiffs' state law claims are thus dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the above reasons, WEA's Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment [Dkt. # 48] is GRANTED.
