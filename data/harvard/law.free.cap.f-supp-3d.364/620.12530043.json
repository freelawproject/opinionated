Nunez-Garcia seeks a temporary stay of deportation and also asks to be transported to the Western District of Virginia via a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum. The government has responded to the motions. As discussed more fully below, the court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the motion to stay and the motion for a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, but directs the clerk to set an evidentiary hearing and arrange for Garcia-Nunez to participate via video conference from immigration custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On September 15, 2009 Nunez-Garcia was indicted on two counts related to a methamphetamine dealing conspiracy which began no later than February 12, 2009 and continued until April 29, 2009. ECF No. 1 at 1, 3. On February 26, 2010, Nunez-Garcia entered into a written plea agreement in which he pleaded guilty to Count 1 of the indictment. ECF No. 69 at 1. A change of plea hearing was held on March 1, 2010 in front of a United States Magistrate Judge who recommended that Nunez-Garcia's plea agreement be accepted. ECF Nos. 73, 78. On May 6, 2010 judgment was entered against Nunez-Garcia and he was sentenced to a term of 70\n   months in the Bureau of Prisons to be followed by a 5-year term of supervised release. ECF No. 84 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Nunez-Garcia was born in Mexico and applied to become a United States citizen. As part of the naturalization application process, and during the time period he was involved in the methamphetamine conspiracy, Nunez-Garcia attested under oath in a naturalization interview that he had never committed a crime or offense for which he had not been arrested. On April 29, 2009, two weeks after his naturalization interview, Nunez-Garcia was arrested by local law enforcement, charged in connection with the methamphetamine conspiracy, and released on bond. Nunez-Garcia was scheduled for a naturalization ceremony on July 4, 2009. When he arrived at the naturalization ceremony, he was required to submit a follow-up questionnaire related to his immigration application and he stated that he had not been arrested or charged for violation of any law and affirmed the answers on his original application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following the federal indictment on the methamphetamine charges, Nunez-Garcia was arrested and on September 24, 2009 he was released on bond. On January 9, 2010 he was charged in state court with involuntary manslaughter, felony eluding, DUI, and child abuse. The charges arose out of an incident nine days earlier where police tried to stop him for driving erratically. Nunez-Garcia did not stop but led the police on a chase, which ended with his having a single car accident resulting in the death of his seventeen-year-old passenger. On November 15, 2010, Nunez-Garcia pleaded guilty plea to all of the charges except child abuse. He was sentenced to ten years on the aggravated DUI manslaughter charge with five years suspended; two years on the eluding police charge; and twelve months, suspended, on the DUI charge. The 5-year sentence was to run consecutively to his federal sentence and the 2-year sentence was to run concurrently with his federal sentence. ECF No. 124 at 7-8. The child abuse charge was dropped. Nunez-Garcia was represented by Scott Hansen on both the state and federal charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nunez-Garcia served seven years on the state charges before he began serving the 70-month federal sentence. ECF No. 117 at 3. On November 21, 2016, his federal sentence was reduced from 70 months to 57 months after an applicable sentencing guidelines provision was lowered and made retroactively applicable to him. ECF No. 119. In addition, he sought an order from the court declaring that his federal term of imprisonment run concurrently with his state term. ECF No. 122. The court granted him limited relief, finding that the two-year sentence for eluding police should run concurrently with his federal sentence. ECF No. 124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 27, 2016 a complaint was filed against Nunez-Garcia in the Eastern District of Virginia alleging he had made false statements under oath as part of his application for naturalization. The complaint referred to the questions where he had stated that he had not committed a crime for which he had not been arrested during the time he was participating in the methamphetamine conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court in\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   was called upon to decide whether the standard used to decide to stay a removal order is \"clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of an order is prohibited by law,\" as set out in \u00a7 1252(f)(2), or whether the traditional standard for a stay should apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Court determined that the traditional standard applies.\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p426\">\n    556 U.S. at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p426\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However that decision did not address a district court's ability to stay a removal action and does not offer authority for this court to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nor is\n   <em>\n    Michael v. I.N.S.\n   </em>\n   helpful to Nunez-Garcia. While the case does state that the All Writs Act provided the Courts of Appeal with an independent statutory basis to stay deportation pending ruling on a motion to reopen, the case was decided prior to enactment of the IIRIRA and does not address the exclusive jurisdiction provision of \u00a7 1252(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nunez-Garcia also cites\n   <em>\n    Arce v.

The court found that because the plaintiff was not attacking the removal itself, the claims did not arise from the removal order but from violation of an earlier court's order, and therefore the district court had jurisdiction to stay the removal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518131\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/796/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518131\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/796/\">\n    at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Eighth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion on similar facts in\n   <em>\n    Silva v.

There, the court rejected an argument, among others, that \u00a7 1252(g) does not apply to claims under the FTCA or\n   <em>\n    Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.

The court commented that \"[t]he limitation on jurisdiction .... applies to '\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien' that arises from a decision to execute a removal order, so it was unnecessary for Congress to enumerate every possible cause or claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 941.

Given that courts in the Fourth Circuit have thus far found that district courts do not have such authority, this court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Nunez-Garcia's motion to stay deportation proceedings pending against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nunez-Garcia asks in the alternative for the court to issue a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum to allow him to participate in an evidentiary hearing on his petition. Inasmuch as it appears that Nunez-Garcia is likely to remain in this country for a few more months, the clerk is directed to set an evidentiary hearing on Nunez-Garcia's \u00a7 2255 petition and to arrange his appearance by video conference from immigration custody. The motion for writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum is taken under advisement pending the scheduling of this hearing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2)(A)(i)(ii) provides that \"Any alien who is convicted of a crime for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed is deportable.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    In addition,\n    <em>\n     Ragbir\n    </em>\n    differs from the instant case in that the petitioner there had exhausted his statutory appeals, whereas Nunez-Garcia's appeal to the BIA is pending and if the stay is denied, he will be able to appeal to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals for relief. Counsel for Nunez-Garcia noted that the deportation order was entered against him on November 8, 2018 and he appealed it. Counsel spoke to a deportation officer who told her that appeals to the BIA by detained aliens were taking five to six months to resolve. If relief is denied by the BIA, Nunez-Garcia will have thirty days to appeal to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and may also seek a stay in that court.

The court in\n    <em>\n     Ragbir\n    </em>\n    granted a limited 30-day stay so that the case could receive proper consideration.
