(\"ECY\"), and Yuma Endoscopy Center, L.L.C. (\"YEC\") (collectively, \"Defendants\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 62, \"Mot.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs AmSurg Holdings, Inc. (\"AmSurg\"), and The Yuma AZ Endoscopy ASC, L.L.C. filed a response (Doc. 74, \"Resp.\"), to which Defendants filed a reply (Doc. 86, \"Reply\"). Oral argument was held on January 9, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant ECY is a physician entity located in Yuma, Arizona. Defendants Divesh Anireddy, M.D., and Alec Esker, M.D., are Members of ECY. AmSurg is a corporation in the business of developing, owning, and operating ambulatory surgery centers in partnership with physicians. Their dispute arises from a joint venture that began in October 2005, when AmSurg bought a 51% share of a surgery center operated by ECY. (DSOF, Ex. 1). Plaintiffs allege they paid $ 6.5 million for their share of the surgery center. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 14, \"Complaint\"). To operate the surgery center, AmSurg and ECY formed an LLC called The Yuma AZ Endoscopy ASC, LLC (\"ASC\"). (DSOF, Ex. 1). Defendant Beverly Bryant was an administrator at ASC, where defendant Seth Miller, M.D., also performed procedures before starting a competing surgery center, YEC. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege Defendants purposely undermined the success of the joint venture in order to operate and develop YEC. (Doc. 46, \"Complaint\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   AmSurg and ECY signed an operating agreement (the \"Agreement\") for ASC that states that the purpose of ASC is to own and operate the \"Center.\" (DSOF, Ex. 1). The Center is defined as \"the ambulatory surgery center operated by [ASC] and located in Yuma, Arizona, including the real property, or leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, the Equipment, books records, supplies, accounts receivable, goodwill, other intangibles and other assets used in its operation.\" (DSOF, Ex. 1). ECY maintained a 49% stake in the Center, and AmSurg and ECY are the only two members of ASC. (DSOF, Ex. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Agreement also includes an anti-assignment clause that, among other things, requires all members to approve another member's assignment of its membership interest to a non-party. (DSOF, Ex. 1). An assignment that is inconsistent with the Agreement \"shall be void.\" (DSOF, Ex. 1). The Agreement is governed by Tennessee law, specifically the Tennessee Limited Liability Company Act, Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 48-201-101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (DSOF, Ex. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the Agreement, AmSurg Holdings, Inc. and its parent company, AmSurg Corp., were both corporations organized under Tennessee laws. (DSOF, Ex. 1). In 2014, AmSurg Holdings, Inc. (\"AmSurg-Tennessee\") merged into a newly-created Delaware corporation of the same name (\"AmSurg-Delaware\"). (DSOF \u00b6 7). In 2016, AmSurg Corp. also merged into a different Delaware Corporation called New Amethyst, which then merged into Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Envision\"). (PASOF \u00b6 19). The parent company was not a party to the Agreement. AmSurg-Delaware had no further mergers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants argue Plaintiffs lacking standing to sue because the mergers violate the Agreement's anti-assignment clause, thus voiding Plaintiff's interest in ASC. (Mot. at 8-17). Plaintiffs, however, characterize the merger as a \"routine business decision\" meant only to change AmSurg's state of domicile from Tennessee to Delaware. (Resp. at 1, 3; PASOF \u00b6 8). They assert the merger did not change \"AmSurg's business operations, practices, policies, officers or other personnel,\" (Resp. at 3; PASOF \u00b6 9), and that the merger was not a traditional assignment\n   but a transfer or assignment\n   <em>\n    by operation of law\n   </em>\n   , which is not a prohibited assignment as contemplated by the agreement. They note AmSurg-Delaware even retained the same IRS Federal Employer Identification Number after the merger. (Resp. at 3; PASOF \u00b6 10). Defendants do not present any facts to dispute the assertion that the merger didn't change AmSurg's business operations, practices, policies, officers or other personnel. Defendants, for their part, say Plaintiffs hid the merger from them, (Mot. at 16), and they only \"discovered\" the merger after discovery began in this litigation. (DSOF \u00b6 12). Plaintiffs respond by noting the merger was a public transaction filed with the Tennessee and Delaware Secretaries of State. (Resp. at 2; PASOF \u00b6 7). Plaintiffs also argue that equity compels the court to reject Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants' motion asks for summary judgment on all causes of action alleged in the Complaint arguing that Plaintiffs have no standing to sue. (Mot. at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Under this standard, \"[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under governing [substantive] law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on the grounds that the entities they contracted with, AmSurg-Tennessee and AmSurg Corp., ceased to exist when they merged into different corporations and the anti-assignment clause prevents any rights the original entities had from transferring to the new corporations AmSurg-Delaware and Envision. Therefore, Plaintiffs do not have standing to sue. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' arguments are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The ASC's anti-assignment clause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The anti-assignment clause is found in Section 12 of the Agreement. Defendants argue Plaintiffs only have standing to sue if the original entities assigned their membership interest to the new entities consistent with Subsection 12.3, the portion of the Agreement that governs assignments to \"any person who is not a member.\" (Mot. at 5). The relevant portions of the Agreement are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    12.1. Assignment of Membership Interests.\n   </strong>\n   No assignment of all or any part of a Membership Interest in the LLC (including any Financial Rights, Governance\n   Rights or other rights pertaining to a Membership Interest) shall be made except as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   12.1.2. Subject to the provisions of Section 12.3 hereof, a Member may assign such Member's Membership Interest to any person who is not a Member;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   12.1.5. The LLC need not recognize any assignment of all or any part of a Membership Interest other than an assignment described in Sections 12.1.1 through 12.1.4 hereof. Any other assignment or attempted assignment shall be void. No assignment shall be effective until written notice thereof has been provided to the LLC and any other applicable requirements set forth in this Agreement, the Articles of Organization or the Act have been satisfied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    12.3. Assignment of Membership Interest with Consent of Other Members.\n   </strong>\n   A Member may assign all or any part of such Member's Membership Interest to a person not theretofore a Member in accordance with Section 12. l.2 hereof if (a) the assignor first gives written notice to the other Member(s) and the LLC of the proposed assignment, giving the name, address and social security or taxpayer identification number of the proposed assignee and describing the terms of the assignment, (b) the proposed assignee executes a copy of this Agreement and agrees in writing to be bound by the terms hereof, (c) the assignment is approved in writing by the other Members, and (d) the assignment is permitted under Section 12.5 hereof.... The approval by the Members of an assignment pursuant to this Section 12.3 shall constitute consent to the continuation of the existence and the business of the LLC pursuant to the Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    12.5. Restrictions on Assignment.\n   </strong>\n   No Member shall be permitted to assign such Member's Membership Interest, Financial Rights or Governance Rights if such assignment would result in the LLC being taxed for federal income tax purposes as an association taxable as a corporation or would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state law. Each of the Members hereby agrees and acknowledges that the restrictions on assignment contained in this Article 12 are not unreasonable in view of the nature of the parties and their relationships to one another and the nature of the business of the LLC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The crux of the issue is whether AmSurg-Tennessee's merger into AmSurg-Delaware is a prohibited assignment contemplated by the Agreement. Defendants contend that the merger was a \"transfer by operation of law,\" which is barred by the Agreement and AmSurg-Delaware is nothing more than an \"imposter\" without a claim to any of the contractual rights previously possessed by AmSurg-Tennessee. (Mot. at 10-11) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Freeman Mgmt. Corp. v. Shurgard Storage Centers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:06cvo736,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201541877\">\n    2007 WL 1541877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (M.D. Tenn. May 23, 2007) ). Plaintiffs agree the merger is \"an assignment by operation of law\" or a \"transfer by operation of law,\" but argue an assignment by operation of law is a legal term of art that is fundamentally different than an assignment as contemplated by the Agreement. (Resp. at 4-9).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2048-244-104\">\n    Tenn.

Mergers of for-profit business corporations are governed by Tenn. Code. Ann \u00a7 48-21-108. It provides that when a merger is effective, \"The Corporation or eligible entity that is designated in the plan of merger as an entity surviving the merger shall survive, and the separate existence of every other corporation or eligible entity that is a party to the merger\n   <em>\n    shall cease.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2048-21-108\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 48-21-108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (emphasis added). Further, \"All property owned by, and every contract right possessed by, each corporation or eligible entity that is merged into the survivor shall be vested in the survivor without revision or impairment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2048-21-108\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 48-21-108(a)(2). Therefore, when AmSurg-Tennessee merged into AmSurg-Delaware, AmSurg-Tennessee ceased and all property owned by it \"vested in\" AmSurg-Delaware \"without reversion or impairment.\" The same goes for AmSurg Corp.'s merger into New Amethyst and then Envision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants argue that the party they originally did business with has ceased to exist and the \"vesting\" of AmSurg-Tennessee's interest in the ASC into AmSurg-Delaware is an assignment in violation of Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 48-218-102, which sets the default rules for assignment of membership interests in Limited Liability Companies. Section 48-218-102(b)(2)(A) governs an assignment to a non-member:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Except as provided in subdivisions (b)(2)(B) and (C), any other assignment of any governance rights is effective only if all the members, other than the member seeking to make the assignment, approve the assignment by unanimous consent or if the articles or operating agreement so permit, the assignment is approved in accordance with, if the assignment is approved in accordance with \u00a7 48-232-102.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Subsection f provides the outcome of an assignment that is not consistent with the statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (f) CONSEQUENCES OF INEFFECTIVE ASSIGNMENT. If any purported or attempted assignment of governance rights is ineffective for failure to obtain the consent required in subsection (b):\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) The purported or attempted assignment is ineffective in its entirety; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) Any assignment of financial rights that accompanied the purported or attempted assignment of governance rights is void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   What is conspicuously absent from the statutes cited by Defendants is whether the statute that vested AmSurg-Tennessee's property into AmSurg-Delaware when those corporations merged is an \"assignment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, subsection (b)(1) of the same statute the defendants cited allows parties to contract around the default rules. Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 48-218-102(b)(1). And, as previously noted, Plaintiffs concede that courts have interpreted a merger to be an assignment by operation of law or a transfer, but they argue the Agreement should be interpreted as unambiguously allowing a merger because it is a legal term of art, categorically different\n   than the generic \"assignment\" used in the Agreement. That is, the Agreement was never intended to prevent assignments by operation of law. Defendants argue otherwise, pointing to case law that has barred transfers of property after a merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Case law does not provide a definitive answer.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants argue that a merger is a \"transfer by operation of law,\"\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201541877\">\n    2007 WL 1541877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4, which constitutes an assignment.

Therefore, the Court is unable to determine a clear intent with regard to whether the anti-assignment clause applies to transfers by operation of law. Accordingly, both Plaintiffs' and Defendants' readings of the anti-assignment clause are\n   a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   interpretation of it, and, therefore, the clause is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    The ambiguity precludes summary judgment because it is a material issue of fact.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In interpreting contracts, a court's goal \"is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Allmand v.
