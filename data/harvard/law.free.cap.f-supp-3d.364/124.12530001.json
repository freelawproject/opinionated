The case was tried before a jury, which returned a verdict in Defendants' favor on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the close of the evidence, Plaintiff moved for judgment as a matter of law on Counts I and II (unlawful seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, respectively).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 112.) The Court heard argument and denied the motion at sidebar. After trial, Plaintiff renewed the motion and, in the alternative, sought a new trial on those counts. (Dkt. No. 123.) Defendants opposed the renewed motion, arguing the seizure was lawful and, even if it was not, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. (Dkt. No. 126.) Defendants also contend Plaintiff has not met his burden of establishing a new trial is warranted. The court heard argument on the matter on January 16, 2019. At the hearing, the court requested the parties order the final trial transcripts so there would be a record on which the court could rely in considering Plaintiff's motion. The parties did so, and, on February 22, Plaintiff filed a supplemental memorandum in which he provided citations to the transcripts supporting his summary of the facts presented at trial. (Dkt. No. 137.) Defendants filed their supplemental memorandum on March 6. (Dkt. No. 138.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on Counts I and II will be granted. Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on either count. Plaintiff's motion for a new trial will be conditionally denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are based on the evidence introduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the night of Monday, September 14, 2015 and into the early morning of Tuesday, September 15, 2015, Defendants were on duty working the midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift. They participated in roll call at the police station at 10:45 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then patrolled the downtown Springfield area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At approximately 2:00 a.m. on September 15, 2015, Plaintiff was walking on Market Way\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in downtown Springfield between Harrison Avenue and Falcon Way. Plaintiff testified he had gone out that night (starting the night of Monday, September 14) to celebrate his upcoming birthday. He had been at a gentleman's club called Center Stage, was hungry, and was on his way to Crown Fried Chicken, a several-minute walk from the club.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As Plaintiff walked south on Market Way toward Falcon Way, Defendants drove east up Harrison Avenue. Defendant Lopez was driving, and Defendant Cicero was in the passenger seat. Defendant Cicero saw Plaintiff on Market Way. Defendant Cicero testified: \"I saw somebody coming or walking on Harrison. It sort of seemed like he was coming out of a building.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (10/30/18 Trial Tr. (Dkt. No. 133) at 109:9-11.) When defense counsel sought to confirm Defendant Cicero \"had seen [Plaintiff] coming out of the rear of a building,\" Defendant Cicero responded, \"That's what I believed I saw. It was poorly lit, so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111:10-13.) On cross-examination, Plaintiff's counsel asked, \"And you testified that when you were driving east on Harrison Avenue that you looked to your right and you saw somebody come out of a building on Marketplace [sic]; is that right?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135:24-136:2.) Defendant Cicero replied, \"What I believed to be happening, yes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 136:3.) He \"couldn't tell,\" though, which business (if any) he saw Plaintiff exit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 136:8-10.) Defendant Cicero further testified that he saw Plaintiff on the end of Market Place closer to Harrison Avenue than to Falcon Way, but Defendant Cicero did not know which businesses were on that street, and he did not document the businesses in his report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant Cicero told Defendant Lopez he had seen someone on Market Way. Defendant Lopez continued driving east, up the rest of the block on Harrison Avenue. He then took a right onto Dwight Street and a second right onto Falcon Way and proceeded to where Market Way meets Falcon Way. Defendants saw Plaintiff coming out of Market Way onto Falcon Way and intercepted him there. The parties' testimony differed as to what happened next. But because the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendants in assessing both the motion for judgment as a matter of law and whether Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, the court summarizes Defendants' version of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both Defendants testified that during the 10:45 p.m. roll call, the supervising sergeant (Sergeant Philip McBride) informed them there had been break-ins in\n   the Market Way area. Sergeant McBride testified at trial and initially explained he worked the midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift on September 15, 2015, he arrived at the police department at 11:20 or 11:30 p.m. before the shift started, and roll call began at 11:45 p.m. He later testified it was possible he arrived earlier and was there for the 10:45 p.m. roll call, in which case Defendants would have encountered him then. Either way, he did not recall having a conversation with Defendants or giving them any information about Market Way or break-ins in the surrounding area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on Sergeant McBride's purported warnings, Defendant Cicero was suspicious of Plaintiff's presence on Market Way because it was after business hours, and Defendant Cicero believed there had been recent break-ins in the area. But Defendant Cicero did not see broken glass, hear an alarm, or see Plaintiff running or carrying anything that might indicate he had broken into a building. Moreover, neither Defendant could identify a single report of, investigation into, or prosecution related to a break-in on Market Way leading up to September 15, 2015. Call for service records showed that there had not been any report of a break-in on Market Way from January 1, 2015 through September 14, 2015. There was testimony that had any buildings on Main Street, which back up to Market Way, been broken into, records of any such break-in would not appear on call for service records for Market Way. Here, neither Defendant returned to Market Way after Plaintiff was arrested to investigate whether there had in fact been a break-in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant Cicero testified that when Defendants drove up to Plaintiff on Falcon Way, they wanted to conduct a field interview to find out Plaintiff's name and what he had been doing on Market Way. So when Defendants approached Plaintiff, Defendant Cicero called out to him from the cruiser and asked what he was doing. Defendants testified Plaintiff did not respond and kept walking across Falcon Way. Defendant Lopez then asked Plaintiff where he was going and to come over to the cruiser, and-according to Defendants-Plaintiff again did not respond and kept walking. According to Defendants, this further raised their suspicions. They got out of the cruiser and seized Plaintiff by telling him to stop, which he did. Specifically, Defendants said to Plaintiff, \"hey, hey, hold up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113:6-9, 113:17-19.) Defendant Cicero testified about this interaction as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q: What was your intent in speaking to Mr. Gunter?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Our intent was just to find out what he was doing in the alley, possibly his name, and that's about it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q. And so what happened when you approached Mr. Gunter as he emerged from Market Way?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. I asked him, what are you doing and he continued to walk away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q. What direction was he walking at that point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A. He was walking across the street towards the MassMutual Center.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q. Did you -- were you in the car at this point in time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q. At that point in time did you have -- or when you first encountered Mr. Gunter, did you have any intention of getting out of the car?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q. So what happened after you spoke to him and do I understand he failed to respond to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q. So what happened next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A. He walked around the rear of the cruiser and continued to walk across the street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q. And what, if anything, happened then?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A. Officer Lopez said to him, hey, where are you going?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q. Okay. And can you describe what happened from that point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A. He just kept walking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q. And what significance did that have to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A. It raised my suspicions even further that he was up to some kind of criminal activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q: Did [Mr. Gunter] say anything about why he was on Market Street when you tried to make contact with him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A: Mr. Gunter would not answer our questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q: If he had told you that he was on his way from a bar on Dwight Street to a restaurant at the corner of State and Main, how would that affected [sic] the way you dealt with him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A: If Mr. Gunter answered our questions and engaged with us, he probably -- we probably would have just taken a field interview report and he would have walked away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q: Would you have ever even gotten [out] of the car if he had answered some of your questions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111:3-6, 111:21-112:22, 151:8-20.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   According to Defendants, Plaintiff's hands were in his pockets; after Defendants exited the cruiser, they asked him to remove his hands, but he did not. Defendants became concerned Plaintiff was trying to hide something, like a weapon. They asked him a few times to take his hands out of his pockets, but he did not. Both Defendants testified that they held Plaintiff's upper arm or shoulder to escort him to the cruiser, where it would be easier to perform a pat frisk for weapons. A struggle ensued during which Plaintiff struck Defendant Lopez in the side of the face and struck Defendant Cicero in the stomach. Plaintiff slipped out of his sweatshirt, fled the scene, and was later found near City Hall. While Plaintiff testified Defendant Lopez raised his baton during their encounter on Falcon Way, Defendant Lopez testified he not raise or use his baton, and, moreover, he had put his baton and hat in the cruiser's trunk at the beginning of his shift and did not remove them. Defendant Cicero also testified he did not see Defendant Lopez take out his baton or have it in his hand. Additional facts regarding Defendants' search for and eventual arrest of Plaintiff are not relevant to the present motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

R. Civ. P. 49. Here, the jury completed a form titled \"Special Verdict Form\" that was divided into sections based on each count and each Defendant. (Dkt. No. 122). It contained a series of general verdict questions on the issue of liability for each Defendant on each count. If the jury answered \"yes\" to any general verdict question (e.g., \"Did the Plaintiff prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant Anthony Cicero intentionally or recklessly committed an act that violated the Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment right to be free from an unreasonable seizure?\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) ), it was directed to answer follow-up questions on disputed issues, such as causation and harm (e.g., \"[If you answered 'yes' to the previous question,] [d]id the Plaintiff prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Defendant Anthony Cicero's unreasonable seizure of the Plaintiff caused him actual injury?\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) ). The jury answered each general verdict question on liability in Defendants' favor, so it did not answer any follow-up question, and it did not reach the sections of the verdict form on compensatory and punitive damages. When considering a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court is not bound to follow the jury's verdict, but it may be guided by the jury's answers to special questions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ciolino v.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Based on Fourth Amendment and Article 14 jurisprudence, the seizure in this case was unreasonable. In particular, the reasoning from\n   <em>\n    Dapolito\n   </em>\n   , described above, applies here. Defendants here were not justified in converting their initial encounter with Plaintiff into a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   investigative stop. Defendant Cicero saw Plaintiff on Market Way and-at most-believed he might have been coming from a building. There was no evidence of a break-in or that Plaintiff had engaged or was engaging in criminal activity. He was walking-not running-on a publicly-accessible way; he was not carrying anything that might indicate he had been involved with a break-in-no backpack or other bag, no tools, no equipment, no merchandise. Nothing in Defendants' testimony indicates they were in any hurry to stop Plaintiff. Urgency on Defendants' part might have shown they believed Plaintiff was involved in criminal activity. Rather than immediately exiting the cruiser to talk to Plaintiff when Defendant Cicero first saw him, Defendants drove all the way around the block. The evidence most helpful to Defendants is their own assertions that there had been break-ins in the area, but they observed nothing consistent with such activity other than Plaintiff's presence in the area at a late hour. Further, their supervisor does not remember whether he was at the same roll call as Defendants and does not remember giving them any specific instructions. The call for service records for Market Way for more than eight months before the night in question do not show any reports of break-ins in the preceding calendar year (though records of break-ins of buildings on Main Street that backup onto Market Way would not have been in those records).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   When Defendants first spoke to Plaintiff, he-according to Defendants-did not answer their initial questions about\n   where he was coming from and where he was going, and he kept walking across Falcon Way. Plaintiff did not run, and there was no evidence he appeared intoxicated or engaged in irrational conduct. In short, Plaintiff did not act in any way that would support a conclusion other than, for the most part, he ignored the police.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195479\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/491/#p497\">\n    460 U.S. at 497-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195479\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/491/#p497\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant Cicero, though, specifically testified that if Plaintiff had answered the officers' questions, they would not have gotten out of the cruiser. (10/30/18 Trial Tr. (Dkt. No. 133) at 151:11-20.) But even if Plaintiff did not answer Defendants' initial questions, his refusal was lawful and did not give Defendants reasonable suspicion to escalate the initial encounter into a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bostick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    501 U.S. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[R]efusal to cooperate, without more, does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for a detention or seizure.\");\n   <em>\n    Barros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993862\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/435/171/#p178\">\n    435 Mass. at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=755%20N.E.2d%20740\">\n    755 N.E.2d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (refusing to answer officer's questions \"cannot provide reasonable suspicion for justification of a detention or seizure\").

Defendants, on the other hand, addressed the issue of a new trial, arguing one is not warranted because the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence, upholding the verdict will not result in a miscarriage of justice, and the trial was fair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Because Plaintiff did not sufficiently raise any argument for a new trial, his request for a new trial is conditionally denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Specifically, Plaintiff's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on Counts I and II is granted, and Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity. Plaintiff's motion for a new trial is conditionally denied.
