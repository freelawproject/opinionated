In response, Defendant asserted counterclaims for unjust enrichment and breach of contract.

Doc. 1; Doc. 72 at 3. Plaintiff's claims prompted Defendant to conduct an audit of its employees' time and pay records, which revealed that overtime hours\n   had been undercounted for several employees. Doc. 72 at 3. Specifically, the audit showed that some employees had been paid \"straight time\" (i.e., their standard hourly wage) for the undercounted overtime hours, instead of the \"time-and-a-half\" due for those hours under the terms of their employment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With respect to Plaintiff, the audit revealed three hours for which Plaintiff had been paid straight time instead of overtime wages, a difference of $ 30.38.

Although Plaintiff's FLSA violation claim was previously conditionally certified as a collective action under \u00a7 216(b) of the FLSA, the case has since been decertified as a collective action.

Doc. 78 at 6-9. Therefore, Plaintiff argues, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the counterclaims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411002\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/58/533/#p541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court addresses the parties' respective arguments separately with regard to each of the counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its opposition to the motion to dismiss, Defendant concedes that-in comparison to its claim for unjust enrichment, discussed below-its breach of contract counterclaim bears a more tenuous relationship to Plaintiff's FLSA claim. Doc. 80 at 13. However, Defendant attempts to create a link between its breach of contract claim and Plaintiff's FLSA claim by arguing that the money owed by Plaintiff in connection with the car repair loan is akin to an overpayment of wages because she did not earn it, has not repaid it, and received the money solely due to her employer-employee relationship with Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16. Defendant reasons that any overpayments received by Plaintiff are related to her FLSA allegations, as such overpayments must be figured into the amount of any net underpayment to Plaintiff arising from the miscounting of her overtime hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court disagrees with Defendant's analysis and finds that the facts underlying Plaintiff's FLSA claim and Defendant's breach of contract claim do not overlap to the degree necessary to justify an exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First, the Court notes that the employer-employee relationship alone is insufficient to create a common nucleus of operative fact between an FLSA claim and a state law claim.\n   <em>\n    Wilhelm v. TLC Lawn Care, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20640733\">\n    2008 WL 640733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Kan. 2008) (\"Because defendant relies solely on its employer-employee relationship with plaintiffs to support supplemental jurisdiction, and does not identify a more specific factual connection between its counterclaims and plaintiffs' FLSA claim, the Court cannot find a common nucleus of operative fact between the causes of action which would permit it to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over defendant's state law counterclaims.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, Defendant's allegation that Plaintiff failed to repay a car loan rests on an entirely different set of facts than Plaintiff's claim for overtime wages under the FLSA. To prove her FLSA claim, Plaintiff will need to present evidence showing the number of hours she worked, the pay actually received for those hours, and the pay she should have received for those hours. By contrast, to prove its counterclaim for breach of contract, Defendant will need to establish the existence of the loan agreement itself (a contract wholly separate from Plaintiff's employment agreement, which establishes the terms of her payment), Plaintiff's failure to repay that loan, and proof of damages from\n   Plaintiff's failure to repay. Defendant's state law counterclaim for breach of contract does not derive from the same nucleus of operative fact as Plaintiff's FLSA claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bautista v. The Discount Warehouse, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201028358\">\n    2016 WL 1028358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D. Fla. 2016) (concluding, in action for unpaid overtime wages under the FLSA, that an employee's indebtedness under a promissory note did not arise from facts and circumstances pertaining to his FLSA claim because \"[i]n deciding whether Plaintiff failed to pay the note, the Court would not need to determine questions of fact similar to those of the FLSA case, such as Plaintiff's employment status and hours Plaintiff worked\");\n   <em>\n    Brennan v.

Rather, an exercise of jurisdiction over Defendant's breach of contract claim would complicate these proceedings because this claim would require different evidence and, likely, different witnesses. The Court accordingly dismisses Defendant's counterclaim for breach of contract for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In contrast to its claim for breach of contract, Defendant's unjust enrichment counterclaim derives from the same nucleus of operative fact as Plaintiff's FLSA claim. Again, to prove her FLSA claim, Plaintiff will need to present evidence showing her overtime hours worked and how much Defendant should have paid her (versus what she was actually paid). For Defendant to prove its unjust enrichment claim, Defendant must present evidence that it paid Plaintiff holiday pay to which she was not entitled, and that Plaintiff knew she was not entitled to those wages but retained them anyways. Put simply, Plaintiff's FLSA claim is to recover\n   <em>\n    underpaid wages\n   </em>\n   , whereas Defendant's counterclaim is to recover\n   <em>\n    overpaid wages\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court therefore finds that there is a logical relationship between the facts and evidence needed to prove Plaintiff's FLSA claim and Defendant's counterclaim for unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schaeffer v. N.J. Transit Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%208251607\">\n    2014 WL 8251607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (D.N.J. 2014) (denying plaintiff's 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss defendant's counterclaim alleging that it overpaid plaintiff for unused vacation time, sick leave, and educational assistance, finding that the counterclaim derived from a \"common nucleus of operative fact\" as plaintiff's FLSA claim). The unjust enrichment claim is distinguishable from the breach of contract claim because the car loan extended by Defendant does not directly relate to wages earned and paid, whereas the holiday-pay issue underlying Defendant's unjust enrichment claim does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, allowing Defendant's unjust enrichment counterclaim to proceed would serve the interests of judicial economy. A simultaneous determination of the claims is necessary to calculate the appropriate measure of damages. Furthermore, the parties are the same, the claims require much of the same evidence, and many of the same witnesses are likely necessary for both claims. Defendant's unjust enrichment counterclaim shares a common nucleus of operative fact with Plaintiff's federal claim for violation of the FLSA. The Court therefore finds it may exercise supplemental\n   jurisdiction over Defendant's counterclaim for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Rule 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is directed at only Defendant's counterclaim for unjust enrichment. In determining whether a counterclaim should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court applies the same standards as applied in considering a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim for relief.\n   <em>\n    Ramada Franchise Sys., Inc. v.

Kan. 2005) (agreeing with the defendant's statement of applicable law, which sought to apply\n   <em>\n    Bill Johnson's\n   </em>\n   in the context of an FLSA retaliation case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, Plaintiff fails to show that Defendant's counterclaim for breach of contract lacks a reasonable basis. Although the Court dismisses the counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   this does not render the claim factually or legally baseless. And Plaintiff fails to present any evidence that Defendant's argument for subject matter jurisdiction rested on an indisputably meritless legal theory or that the substantive claim is not factually or legally sound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff also does not sufficiently establish retaliatory motive. To support its allegations of retaliatory motive, Plaintiff relies on testimony from Steve Kamau, Defendant's clinic director and owner, stating that Defendant would not have brought this counterclaim (related to Plaintiff's alleged failure to repay the car loan) but for Plaintiff's lawsuit. Doc. 78 at 2-3, 11; Doc. 78-5 at 36-37. Defendant, meanwhile, argues that it did not pursue repayment of the loan before Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit because it simply made a business decision that it was not worth the time, effort, and money to pursue collection. Doc. 80 at 20. Mr. Kamau further testified that, at the time of Plaintiff's termination, there were more pressing issues demanding his attention and he therefore elected not to pursue the loan at that time. Doc. 78-5 at 32-33. Once Plaintiff filed this action, however, it made sense to try to collect given the fact that Defendant was now engaged in litigation with Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. Based on this evidence, the Court finds disputed issues of fact regarding Defendant's motivation for filing the counterclaim, precluding entry of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff has not carried her burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation. The Court must therefore deny Plaintiff's request for summary judgment on Count V for FLSA retaliation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   THE COURT THEREFORE ORDERS that Plaintiff's Renewed Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 75) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   THE COURT FURTHER ORDERS that Plaintiff's Renewed Motion to Dismiss\n   and Second Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 77) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as set forth in Part II.A and Part II.B.2,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Defendant's counterclaim for breach of contract is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    With respect to Plaintiff's motion to dismiss the counterclaims (Doc. 77), the Court accepts as true Defendant's well-pleaded factual allegations. In reciting the facts relevant to Plaintiff's motions for partial summary judgment (Docs. 75, 77), the Court has set forth only those uncontroverted facts required to reach its decision, and the Court construes those facts in the light most favorable to Defendant as the non-moving party.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The Court's recitation of the claims and counterclaims in this action is based on the amended pretrial order entered on September 28, 2018, which supersedes the pleadings and controls the course of this case going forward. Doc. 72. The Court also notes that, although Plaintiff's original complaint asserted a claim for quantum meruit, Plaintiff has since abandoned that claim.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Although Plaintiff moves to dismiss both counterclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), Plaintiff moves pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) with respect to Defendant's counterclaim for unjust enrichment only.

But since the enactment of \u00a7 1367, the Tenth Circuit has not determined whether supplemental jurisdiction depends upon the distinction between compulsory and permissive counterclaims.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202938109\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ;\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wilhelm v.
