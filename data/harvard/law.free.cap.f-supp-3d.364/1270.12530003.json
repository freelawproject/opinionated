BRACK, SENIOR U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the Motion to Dismiss of Defendants Uwe Rusch and Mabel Rusch Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3), filed on August 13, 2018. (Doc. 7.) Having considered the motion, briefs, attached documents, and relevant law, the Court finds that the motion should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2012, Defendant Uwe Rusch (Mr. Rusch) was the sole owner and member of a Florida limited liability company called UNC-FL. In furtherance of this business, Mr. Rusch's wife, Defendant Dr. Mabel Rusch (Dr. Rusch), registered a trademark in her name. In 2013, Plaintiffs entered into an agreement with Defendants to become part owners of UNC-FL, and Plaintiff Volker Strobel (Mr. Strobel) took an active role in advancing the Florida business. Soon thereafter, the parties became concerned about Florida's regulatory framework and decided to dissolve UNC-FL and re-establish the business in New Mexico under the name UNC-NM. Mr. Strobel and Mr. Rusch were managers of UNC-NM. In 2015, Mr. Strobel announced to the parties that the business was struggling and in need of capital. Thereafter, Defendants took actions that violated the parties' agreement. Plaintiffs now bring suit for a variety of tort and contract claims. Defendants argue that neither jurisdiction nor venue is proper in New Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants are residents of Florida. (Doc. 1 (Compl.) at 1 &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) In 2012 Mr. Rusch formed UNC-FL, a limited liability company created to produce and sell cordials (a type of after-dinner drink). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Years before, Defendants had organized a business in Germany and registered the trademark CORDIALS V.I.P. DRINKS (the \"V.I.P. Mark\" or the \"trademark\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) After forming UNC-FL, Defendants transferred registration of the trademark from the German company to Dr. Rusch in her own name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Strobel and Plaintiff Heike Strobel (Mrs. Strobel) are residents of New Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1 &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) The Strobels met Defendants while vacationing in Florida in 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Defendants told the Strobels \"about the business of UNC-FL and invited them to invest in UNC-FL's business....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18-1 \u00b6 6.) At that time, \"Mr. Rusch was the sole record owner and member of UNC-FL....\" (Compl. \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18-6 at 1.) After the Strobels returned to New Mexico, Mr. Rusch began to email and call Mr. Strobel to encourage him to invest in the business. (Doc. 18-1 \u00b6 7.) Mr. Rusch visited New Mexico in \"April 2012 to discuss several business opportunities, one of which involved the cordials business....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2012, both Mr. and Dr. Rusch visited New Mexico to speak with Mr. and Mrs. Strobel about investing in the cordials business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) During this visit, Dr. Rusch stated that she would transfer registration of the V.I.P. Mark from her name to UNC-FL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Dr. Rusch's consent to transfer registration of the trademark is memorialized in the parties' Partnership Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18-6 at 2 (\"Mrs. Mabel Rusch hereby undertakes to convey to the Holding all rights to the CORDIALS trademark and all rights to the design and logos of CORDIALS products.... The transfer of ownership of these rights will be initiated after the signing of this agreement.\" The transfer is \"part of the package of CORDIALS rights that Mr. and Mrs. Rusch are contributing to the Holding.\").) She also told Plaintiffs that Mr. Rusch \"had authority to speak for her with respect to her ownership of the trademark and participation in the business.\" (Doc. 18-1 \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Rusch, Mr. Strobel, and Plaintiff Hans Baur (Mr. Baur) met in Arizona in early 2013 to discuss the terms of Plaintiffs' investment in UNC-FL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Thereafter, Mr. and Dr. Rusch, Mr. and Mrs. Strobel, Mr. Baur, and another individual who is not a party to this lawsuit, entered into an agreement to invest in UNC-FL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Compl. \u00b6 15.) Over the next year, Mr. Strobel often traveled to Florida to help Mr. Rusch develop the business. (Doc. 18-1 \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties soon became concerned that Florida's \"regulatory climate was not favorable for the development and operation of\" UNC-FL; therefore, they decided to dissolve the business in Florida and reestablish it in New Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Compl. \u00b6 18.) In 2014, Mr. Rusch formally terminated UNC-FL, and Mr. Strobel formed UNC-NM-a continuation of the cordials business-in New Mexico. (Doc. 18-1 \u00b6 14.) Both Mr. Strobel and Mr. Rusch were managers of UNC-NM, and Mr. Rusch continued to communicate with Mr. Strobel via phone and email to manage the business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16.) The business utilized a certified public accountant (CPA) located in New Mexico, who \"had been preparing tax returns for UNC-FL ... since 2013, both before and after the\" company relocated to New Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Approximately one year later, Mr. Strobel told the other parties that UNC-NM needed new capital or the business would fail. (Compl. \u00b6 20.) Defendants then ceased communicating with Plaintiffs about the business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs learned that Dr. Rusch had transferred registration of the trademark to UNC-NM, but had later transferred it back to her own name without informing Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18-1 \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18-1, Ex. 11.) Plaintiffs also discovered that, since learning that UNC-NM was failing, Defendants \"have sought investment or business opportunities from others, based on the representation that [Dr. Rusch] owned the V.I.P. Mark and they owned the beverage business associated with the V.I.P. Mark.\" (Compl. \u00b6 21.) Plaintiffs assert that Defendants' actions have infringed upon UNC-NM's rights in the trademark and caused damage to Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs filed suit against Defendants in this Court in July 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.) Defendants now move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and venue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defendants moved their business to New Mexico, had regular contact with the New Mexico Plaintiffs via telephone, mail, and internet, and later took an active role in the business when it was situated in New Mexico. And, as is required to establish minimum contacts, Plaintiffs' claims arise out of the actions Defendants took to establish their connection with New Mexico-the claims center on the parties' agreement and Defendants' alleged breach of that agreement.

In this action, the Florida-based Defendants persuaded the New Mexico-based Plaintiffs to invest in a Florida-based business. Defendants contacted Plaintiffs in New Mexico via telephone, mail, and internet, and they traveled to New Mexico to discuss the business. The parties met in Arizona to finalize the agreement. The parties initially managed and promoted the business in Florida. Defendants\n   eventually dissolved the Florida-based business in order to take advantage of New Mexico's more favorable regulations, and the parties continued to manage the business, now headquartered in New Mexico. The parties' utilized a New Mexico CPA-even while the business was still headquartered in Florida. The business's financial records are in New Mexico.
