Dooley, United States District Judge\n   This action arises out of the events that unfolded following the termination of plaintiff Kevin Ollie (\"Ollie\") as the head coach of the men's basketball team at the defendant University of Connecticut (\"UConn\"). Ollie brings discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\") as well as the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act (\"CFEPA\"). He seeks preliminary injunctive relief and other equitable relief. By a motion dated December 27, 2018, UConn seeks dismissal of this action pursuant to Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to State a claim for which relief may be granted, and failure to join a necessary party. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants UConn's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Allegations and Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For purposes of this motion, the Court accepts the allegations in the Complaint as true and they are set forth as follows. Ollie was formerly employed as the head coach of the UConn men's basketball team. (Compl. at \u00b6 8.) On March 10, 2018, Ollie was informed that he was being terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.) On May 10, 2018, Ollie's union, the UConn Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (the \"Union\"), sent a letter to the president of UConn, in which it \"raised issues of discrimination on [Ollie's] behalf.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) On June 19, 2018, the president of UConn upheld Ollie's termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.) Thereafter, the Union filed a grievance on Ollie's behalf claiming that UConn terminated him without just cause in violation of the Union's collective bargaining agreement (the \"CBA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) The Union is currently arbitrating that grievance pursuant to Section 10 of the CBA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While the Union and UConn moved forward with the arbitration, Ollie sought to preserve his ability to pursue discrimination claims under the CFEPA and Title VII in an administrative or judicial forum. Because the CFEPA and Title VII have relatively short limitations periods - 180 days and 300 days, respectively - Ollie was concerned that the deadline for filing his discrimination claims would pass before the arbitration concluded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 46a-82(f) (\"one hundred and eighty days after the alleged act of discrimination\"); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1) (\"three hundred days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred\"). Ollie was also concerned, however, that UConn would terminate the arbitration pursuant to the\n   election-of-remedies provision in the CBA if he filed a discrimination claim with either the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (\"CHRO\") or the United States Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (\"EEOC\") prior to the conclusion of the arbitration. (Compl. at \u00b6 34.) The election-of-remedies provision, set forth in Section 10.3 of the CBA, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   If prior to seeking resolution of a dispute by filing a grievance under this contract, or while the grievance proceeding is in progress, a member seeks to resolve the matter in any other forum, whether administrative or judicial, the [UConn] Board [of Trustees] shall have no obligation to entertain or proceed with this grievance procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accordingly, prior to filing a claim with the CHRO or EEOC, Ollie asked UConn, through counsel, whether it would agree not to invoke Section 10.3 if he filed a discrimination claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36.) Alternatively, he proposed entering into a tolling agreement concerning these claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.) UConn responded that it was \"not willing to waive 10.3\" and that it did not agree to the terms of Ollie's proposed tolling agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40, 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 17, 2018, Ollie instituted this action against UConn. Based upon the allegations set forth above, Ollie asserts that UConn has violated the CFEPA and Title VII in two ways. First, he alleges that, by refusing to agree that it will not invoke Section 10.3, UConn is, in effect, unlawfully \"asserting the right to refuse to proceed with the grievance-arbitration process under the collective bargaining agreement if [Ollie] exercises his rights to file discrimination claims in an administrative agency or in a judicial forum.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 56, 72.) Second, Ollie alleges that by refusing to agree to his proposed tolling agreement, UConn is attempting to deter him from exercising his rights under the CFEPA and Title VII until the limitations period has lapsed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, 73-74.) Ollie alleges that he has been harmed by this illegal conduct because, absent judicial intervention, he will lose either (a) his contractual right to arbitrate his grievance under the CBA upon filing a claim with the CHRO or EEOC or (b) his statutory rights under the CFEPA and Title VII due to the passage of the limitations period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60-61, 76-77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With the Complaint, Ollie filed an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction prohibiting UConn from invoking Section 10.3 if he files a claim with the CHRO or EEOC. He also sought (and still seeks) an order prospectively equitably tolling the applicable statute of limitations for his discrimination claims under the CFEPA and Title VII and equitably estopping UConn from asserting a statute of limitations defense to those claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Prayer for Relief, at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) The Court denied the request for a temporary restraining order under Rule 65(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but convened a hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction on December 28, 2018. Prior to the hearing, UConn filed the instant motion to dismiss challenging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , this Court's subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the claims asserted herein are not ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.

The complaint in this case, however, references and relies upon a series of e-mails between counsel for both parties. The e-mails were not attached to the complaint but were appended to Ollie's subsequent pleadings, including his memorandum in opposition to the instant motion to dismiss. The e-mails include Ollie's request that UConn either waive Section 10.3 if he files a claim with the EEOC or CHRO, or, alternatively, enter into a tolling agreement with respect to his discrimination claims. The e-mails also include UConn's response to these inquiries. Neither party has raised any challenge to the authenticity of the e-mails or objected to the Court's consideration of them. Indeed, both parties have relied upon the e-mails in their arguments regarding the motion to dismiss. In addition, the Court concludes that the communications reflected in the e-mails are \"integral\" to the complaint and may be fairly considered on a motion to dismiss even though they are not attached to the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goel v.

Constitutional ripeness, in other words, turns on the first\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   factor-to say a plaintiff's claim is constitutionally unripe is to say the plaintiff's claimed injury, if any, is not actual or imminent, but instead conjectural or hypothetical.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Org. for Marriage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864425\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/682/#p688\">\n    714 F.3d at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   UConn urges dismissal of this action because Ollie's claims do not present a real or substantial controversy insofar as Ollie has not suffered an actual or imminent injury. There is no \"injury in fact,\" UConn argues, because it is undisputed that Ollie has not filed a claim with the CHRO or the EEOC and, therefore, UConn has not had to decide whether it can or should invoke Section 10.3. Nor is there an imminent risk of harm because UConn has not threatened to invoke Section 10.3 if Ollie decides to file a claim with the CHRO or the EEOC. UConn has merely indicated that it will not, anticipatorily, waive Section 10.3. Accordingly, UConn argues, Ollie's claimed injuries are hypothetical; based on a series of events which have not, and might never, come to pass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response, Ollie articulates three distinct bases under which his Title VII claim\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   is ripe for adjudication. Ollie first asserts that UConn's refusal to agree not to invoke Section 10.3 has deterred, or \"chilled,\" him from filing a claim with the EEOC and that chilling effect constitutes a sufficiently concrete and particularized injury to confer standing. Second, Ollie argues that there is a \"credible threat\" that UConn will invoke Section 10.3 if he files a claim with the EEOC. This \"credible threat,\" he argues, has resulted in \"coerced self-censorship\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not filing a claim with the EEOC) sufficient to confer standing. Finally, Ollie asserted in his Complaint that he has suffered an actual or imminent injury under the first\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   factor due to (a) the lapse of the limitations period for his Title VII claim as a result of UConn's refusal to waive its rights under Section 10.3 or (b) his risk of losing his contractual right to arbitrate his grievance if he files a claim with the EEOC. (Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.) Ollie's arguments are addressed\n   <em>\n    seriatum.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ollie first argues that UConn's conduct has \"chilled\" his exercise of his Title VII rights and that chilling is a sufficient injury to confer standing. His argument derives from a series of cases involving\n   pre-enforcement challenges to statutes or regulations based on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In these cases, plaintiffs have been held to have standing to bring First Amendment challenges to laws prior to their actual or threatened enforcement based on the chilling effect the law has on their protected speech.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Org. for Marriage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864425\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/682/#p688\">\n    714 F.3d at 687, 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding plaintiff had constitutional standing to challenge statute where plaintiff \"plausibly contends\" it was regulated by that statute even though plaintiff had not attempted to ascertain its status vis-\u00e0-vis the statute nor had it been subject to any enforcement action);\n   <em>\n    Vt.

As an initial matter, Ollie is not seeking a declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment Act. He seeks equitable and preliminary injunctive relief to safeguard his claims under the CFEPA and Title VII. The\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   decision was decided entirely within the context of a declaratory judgment and, therefore, it is unclear whether\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   has application outside of that context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Assuming, without deciding, that\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   applies outside of the declaratory judgment context, it is inapposite. UConn has not threatened to sue Ollie or to terminate the arbitration if Ollie files a discrimination claim with the EEOC. UConn has stated only that it is \"not willing to waive [Section] 10.3.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ollie contends that this is a distinction without a difference, arguing that by refusing to stipulate that it will not invoke Section 10.3 UConn is affirmatively \"asserting the right to refuse to proceed with the grievance-arbitration process under the collective bargaining agreement if [Ollie] exercises his rights to file discrimination claims in an administrative agency or in a judicial forum.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 56, 72.) While Ollie might not recognize the distinction, this Court must. This Court should not and cannot speculate as to the myriad of considerations UConn might undertake when determining how to respond to any claim Ollie might (or might not) file with an administrative agency or court. Whether and how UConn might choose to exercise its rights is simply unknown at this juncture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Critical to the outcome in\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   and the cases cited therein, was the actual threat made against the plaintiffs and the significant harms that could flow therefrom. Absent any actual threat by UConn,\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Moreover, the \"worst case scenario\" faced by Ollie is that he loses the ability to arbitrate his termination, a forum he prefers insofar as UConn bears the burden of proof there. This is ultimately the basis for his argument that he is being asked to \"bet the farm.\" However, even if this worst-case scenario was to come to pass, Ollie is not without recourse because he still has the ability to challenge his termination in another forum. In a forum other than the arbitration, Ollie would bear the burden of proof, but this situation does not approach the dire Hobson's Choice faced by the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Lastly, the Court looks to whether Ollie has standing under the traditional standing analysis set forth in the first\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   factor. Ollie contends in his complaint that he has suffered real or imminent harm because UConn's conduct, which he claims violates Title VII, has caused the limitations period for some of his discrimination claims to lapse. (Compl. at \u00b6 60.) He also asserts as a real or imminent harm based on the potential loss of his arbitration rights under the CBA if UConn invokes Section 10.3 after he files a discrimination claim with the EEOC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.) These harms are both conjectural and hypothetical at this stage and cannot therefore provide a basis upon which Ollie has standing or this Court has subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The passage of a limitations period does not in and of itself bar Ollie's claims because the limitations period under Title VII is not jurisdictional.\n   <em>\n    Zipes v.

Appx. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2009). Consequently, for Ollie to suffer an actual injury based on the passage of the limitations period, he must first file a claim with the EEOC, UConn must then assert the limitations period as an affirmative defense, and UConn must prevail in that defense. A statute of limitations defense, of course, is \"subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.\"\n   <em>\n    Zipes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305742\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/385/#p393\">\n    455 U.S. at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305742\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/385/#p393\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Ollie can challenge this defense by, for example, requesting that the limitations period be equitably tolled or that UConn equitably estopped from asserting this defense (as he has requested in this proceeding). Because any harm related to the passage of the limitations period is contingent on future events that might never come to pass, it is conjectural, hypothetical, and inadequate to establish standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Similarly, any injury based on the termination of the arbitration by UConn is hypothetical at this stage. UConn has only asserted that it is \"not willing to waive [Section] 10.3.\" If Ollie files a claim with the EEOC, it is unknown and speculative whether UConn will actually invoke Section 10.3. Accordingly, UConn's refusal to waive its rights under the CBA does not cause a real or imminent injury to Ollie and therefore it does not create an issue that is ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In concluding that Ollie's claims are not ripe for adjudication at this stage, the Court makes no determination as to the merits of his claims. The Court is deciding\n   only that it is premature to decide the issues presented in Ollie's complaint because the injury or harm he identifies might never come to pass. If the events portended by Ollie come to pass, Ollie will have the opportunity to raise all of his claims and defenses in due course and in whichever forum he finds himself. His effort to litigate those claims and defenses on a pre-emptive basis through this action, however, fails for the reasons set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Because the Court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case, it need not (and cannot) adjudicate the merits of UConn's alternative bases for dismissal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Morrison v.
