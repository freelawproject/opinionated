However, plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing that HBML has had contacts with the state of California, plaintiffs' CERCLA claim arises out of HBML's successor liability, and it is not unreasonable to exercise jurisdiction over HBML. Swagelok and Whitney, as cross-claimants, have alternatively made a prima facie showing of alter ego liability. Accordingly, HBML's motion to dismiss is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. CONTAMINATION OF THE PROPERTY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs, Successor Agency to the former Emeryville Redevelopment Agency (\"Successor Agency\") and the City of Emeryville (\"City\"), bring ten claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"), and various California laws, to recover environmental cleanup costs and related relief from plaintiffs' investigation of contamination on a property in Emeryville, California. Defendants HBML, Swagelok Company (\"Swagelok\"), Whitney Research and Tool Co. (\"Whitney\"), and Catherine Lennon Lozick (\"Lozick\"), are allegedly responsible for the contamination caused by industrial activities that began approximately in 1910 on 5679 Horton Street in the City of Emeryville, California (\"the Property\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From approximately 1910 to 1959, the Property was owned by the Marchant Calculating Machine Company (\"Marchant\"), a California company that manufactured mechanical calculating machines. SAC \u00b6 3. Marchant's operations used various oils, chlorinated solvents, and other chemicals that have been found in the soil at the\n   Property, in groundwater on and down gradient from the Property, and in vapors inside large buildings located on the Property. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 5, 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 1958, Marchant was consolidated via merger with Smith-Corona Inc., a New York corporation and Marchant was renamed Smith-Corona Marchant Inc. (\"SCM\"). SAC \u00b6 3; Bookspan Decl. \u00b6 9. The following year, SCM moved operations to a different location along the border of the cities of Oakland and Berkeley.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   SCM regularly conducted business in California and continued operating the Marchant business as a division within SCM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By 1963, SCM renamed itself SCM Corporation. It continued to operate in California until it closed the Marchant division in approximately 1972.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Affiliates of defendant Swagelok purchased the Property in the mid-1960s and owned it until the late-1990s. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 11. Swagelok is an Ohio corporation with its principal place of business in Solon, Ohio.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Property was technically operated by defendant Whitney, which was controlled and dominated by Swagelok.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Whitney was founded in 1959 as a California corporation and is now dissolved. SAC \u00b6 53. Whitney produced machine valves and associated valve parts on the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also allegedly contaminated the Property through its operations, including in the grease room, hazardous waste area, solvent recovery area, and drum storage areas. SAC \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Property changed hands once again in 1999 when the former Redevelopment Agency, a public entity formed under California law and authorized to undertake environmental cleanup projects, purchased most of it from a Swagelok controlled entity. SAC \u00b6 11. The proceeds of that sale, assets worth in excess of $ 1.5 billion, and approximately 65% ownership interest in Swagelok, all went to defendant Catherine Lozick as the sole beneficiary of the CLL Trust, in 2003. SAC \u00b6 60. Since that time, the former Redevelopment Agency's rights, powers, and obligations have vested by statute in plaintiff Successor Agency, a separate public entity located and operating in Alameda County, California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. INVESTIGATION INTO SUBSEQUENT MERGERS AND OWNERSHIP\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Successor Agency investigated the contamination when it acquired the Property. SAC \u00b6 20. Successor Agency identified a series of mergers that also linked Marchant and SCM's alleged contamination on the Property to defendant HBML via a series of transactions in the mid-1980s. SAC \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   HBML was incorporated in 1950 under the name C. Wiles Limited, as a limited company organized and existing under the laws of England and Wales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rogers Decl. \u00b6 2. Its sole current office and headquarters, which is its registered principal place of business, is in Berkshire, England.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   HBML has operated under several different names, including Wiles Group Limited, Hanson Limited, Hanson PLC, and Hanson Trust PLC. HBML is the same entity originally formed in 1950 though it has gone by different names since its incorporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   HBML first acquired control over SCM through hostile takeover tactics, including tender offers to shareholders. SAC \u00b6 23. Then, intent on liquidating the SCM conglomerate for profits, HBML formed several new Delaware corporations in 1985 as\n   indirect subsidiaries with names beginning with \"HSCM,\" (i.e., HSCM-1 to -20), referred to as \"fan companies.\" SAC \u00b6 24; Hempstead Decl. \u00b6 7. One of those fan companies, HSCM-20, eventually was merged into SCM in 1986, with HSCM-20 as the surviving entity with residual assets and legacy liabilities. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28; Hempstead Decl. \u00b6 12. HBML then caused HSCM-20 to merge into another subsidiary, HSCM Holdings Inc., which then merged again into HBML subsidiary HM holdings, Inc. (\"HM Holdings\"). SAC \u00b6 29; Hempstead Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-15. Plaintiffs' theory of the case is that these mergers ultimately caused Marchant's contamination liability for the Property, and its jurisdictional contacts with California, to flow into HSCM-20, which was controlled by HBML. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. HBML's theory in defense is that the relevant transactional activities occurred under the control of its United States counterparts, particularly Hanson Industries, which was distinct from HBML in the United Kingdom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs nonetheless allege that HBML's control over these mergers and the liquidation of SCM is demonstrated by a 1989 initial public offering for a typewriter business that was marketed in California and other places. SAC \u00b6 32; Hamidi Decl. \u00b6 8, Ex. D. During the IPO, HBML changed the name of HSCM-10 to Smith Corona Corporation and then dominated and controlled the transactions. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 32-34; Hamidi Decl. \u00b6 8, Ex. D at 5 (HBML 2968). Smith Corona Corporation, HM Holdings, and other entities that HBML controlled entered transactions referred to in the 1989 IPO prospectus as the \"Reorganization.\" SAC \u00b6 35. In the Reorganization, Smith Corona Corporation and HM Holdings entered a Cross Indemnity Agreement in which HBML assured prospective buyers that the company was protected from all \"Hanson Liabilities,\" defined as SCM non-typewriter businesses, past use of property, release of hazardous substances, and nuisances from non-typewriter operations or properties. SAC \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following the investigation, plaintiffs plead that the presence of contaminants on the Property can be traced to the operations of Marchant, SCM's Marchant division, and Swagelok and Whitney. SAC \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Successor Agency and the City filed this lawsuit on January 20, 2017 and amended the complaint on June 30, 2017. Dkt. Nos. 1, 42. Swagelok and Lozick separately answered and filed crossclaims against HBML and counterclaims against plaintiffs. Dkt. Nos. 46, 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In October 2017, I issued an Order granting the parties' proposed stipulation to amend the pleading to properly identify HBML as the named party, for Whitney to bring crossclaims against HBML, and for the parties to conduct jurisdictional discovery. Dkt. No. 66. That discovery led to the production of thousands of pages of documents, hundreds of emails between counsel, several 30(b)(6) depositions, and four written discovery disputes brought to the court's attention. Noma Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-10. Stopping short of raising additional disputes, Lozick maintains that HBML engaged in certain jurisdictional discovery abuses and seeks to reserve the right to extend jurisdictional discovery if needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the operative second amended complaint on October 5, 2017. Dkt. No. 67. On December 4, 2017, HBML moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Dkt.

Related to the second factor, it repeats the undisputed fact that SCM's Marchant division did not become an indirect subsidiary of HBML prior to 1986, decades after Marchant ceased to own or operate on the Property.

Plaintiffs successfully make out a prima facie case of specific personal jurisdiction based on this combination of HBML's direct contacts with California and the contacts of its predecessor SCM.

Plaintiffs establish this factor through their successor liability theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   HBML's acquisition of SCM is the but for cause of its alleged CERCLA liability, creating the nexus between its activities in California and the cause of action. Plaintiffs allege that the industrial operations-based contamination occurred on the Property because of Marchant's operations from approximately 1910 to 1958, SCM's Marchant division after it acquired Marchant between 1958 to 1959, and Swagelok and Whitney from the mid-1960s to the late 1990s. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.

Thus, plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Shute\n   </em>\n   to argue that HBML's successor liability makes it responsible for the \"but for\" cause of the injury-Marchant and SCM's contamination of the Property-and brings it within the \"striking distance\" allowed in the Ninth Circuit.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530616\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/897/377/#p385\">\n    897 F.2d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The second paragraph of the agreement, Section 1, states that \"Hanson,\" defined in the letter as collectively HSCM Industries Inc., Hanson Holdings Netherlands B.V. and Hanson Trust PLC, \"agrees to effect as promptly as practicable a merger with\" SCM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1 (HBML 24750). There is no dispute Hanson Trust PLC is the same entity as HBML. Section 12 then declares the contract to be binding on the parties in the letter, again including HBML.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. (HBML 24755) (\"This contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, [and] the persons and entities referred to herein.\"). Plaintiffs observe that the letter does not include Hanson Industries, the United States counterpart to HBML.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, they point to the testimony of an HBML Rule 30(b)(6) witness, Graham Dransfield, who was an HBML employee in the legal department starting in 1982, former Legal Director of HBML from 1993 to 2003, and Legal Director of Hanson Limited from 2003 to 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dransfield\n   Decl. \u00b6 1. Dransfield testified that Hanson Industries (a division of an HBML subsidiary named Tillotson Commercial Motor Company in the United States) was not involved in making the tender offer for SCM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doty Decl. \u00b6 7 Ex.

All of these facts, along with the press releases and ads from HBML during the time of the transactions, give rise to a prima facie showing of successor liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   HBML \"does not dispute that the company formerly known as SCM was ultimately merged into HM Holdings,\" another subsidiary of HBML. Mot. to Dismiss at 4 n.3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hempstead Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-15 (explaining the various corporate transactions and noting that \"the surviving company from the above-described mergers [referring to the twenty fan companies after the 1986 SCM corporate restructuring] ultimately was merged into another U.S. company and an indirect subsidiary of HBML, known as HM Holdings, Inc.\"). But it argues that its United States subsidiaries were in control. HBML contends that management of its United States businesses reported directly to Hanson Industries, and that as a result HBML is not the successor to SCM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In 1986, SCM was acquired by the indirect subsidiaries of HBML, Hanson Holdings Netherlands B.V. and HSCM Industries Inc.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hempstead Decl. \u00b6 6; Swagelok Oppo., Berle Decl. Ex. D (HBML 604-607); Reck Decl. Ex. C at 68:5-11; 69:2-6. HBML points to its own 1986 Chronology of the Acquisition and Restructuring of SCM, which states that on March 31, 1986 the merger occurred, \"resulting in ownership by HSCM Industries of 8,040,000 shares of SCM (80.4%) and by [Hanson Holdings Netherlands B.V.] of 1,960,000 shares (19.6%) of SCM.\" Berle Decl. Ex. D (HBML 605).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   But the observation that the actual purchase was through subsidiaries or that they reported to Hanson Industries as entirely separate from HBML is unpersuasive given evidence that HBML (Hanson Trust PLC at the time) was in control. In the 1986 HBML annual report, Sir Gordon White explained the two entities of HBML and Hanson Industries as \"constituting a single corporate entity and sharing a common business strategy,\" though operating as two separate companies. Hamidi Decl., \u00b6 17, Ex. K (HBML 6517-6525); Doty Decl., \u00b6 14, Ex. J at 17 (HBML 15572).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Consistent with this outlook, on August 22, 1985, meeting minutes from HBML in London show that its directors determined a cash tender offer announcement was necessary following a rise in the share prices the day before.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doty Decl. Ex. L at 1. The minutes also \"resolved\" that the announcement \"on behalf of the Company,\" HBML, was approved and a committee of the board consisting of HBML directors were appointed to \"facilitate the proposed cash tender offer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   HSCM Industries was formed by HBML in 1985 for the purpose of purchasing SCM and did not own other asserts or conduct other activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl. Ex. A at 65:4-17; Ex. G (HBML 7462). Hanson Netherlands spent money for the acquisition it received from loans directly by HBML.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl., Ex. G (HBML 7462-63); Ex. E (HBML 25531).

Ex. L at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Through the tender offer and acquisition process, HBML then made clear that \"as soon as practicable, Hanson Trust intends to seek to influence the management of the Company, to seek majority representation on the Company's Board of Directors and to seek to effect a business combination between the Company and Hanson Trust or an affiliate of Hanson Trust...\" Berle Decl., Ex. G (HBML 7450, 7469). HBML's involvement in the open market transactions for SCM obligated it to file a Schedule 13D with the SEC as a result of its beneficial ownership of more than 5% of the voting class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Request for Judicial Notice (\"Swagelok RJN\") Ex. TT at 18495 (Dkt. No. 113-5). Moreover, HBML was part of the group Schedule 13D along with its subsidiaries HSCM Industries, Hanson Netherlands, and HMAC Investments Inc., which would not have been filed but for these entities acting together for the purpose of acquiring SCM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17 C.F.R. 240.13d-5(b)(1) (\"When two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of equity securities of an issuer, the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   HBML's attempt in this litigation to separate itself from the tender offer and acquisition of SCM is also unsuccessful, at least at this stage, in light of certain holes in Hempstead's testimony. He states that he was an Associate Director of HBML from 1990 to 1996, but that this was only an \"honorary title\" with his only role being \"to sign certain disclosures for the company to be filed with U.S. regulatory authorities.\" Hempstead Decl. \u00b6 3. From 1976 to 1978, and then from 1982 through 1996, he says that he was employed by Hanson Industries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. Yet Hempstead is the signatory for HBML and Hanson Netherlands on the 1986 merger agreement, which did not include any mention of Hanson Industries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hamidi Decl., Ex.

Hanson Industries, according to plaintiffs, is a division of Tillotson Commercial Motors, but the company's director's report for 1985 to 1987 does not mention any SCM-related activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doty Decl. \u00b6 18, Ex. N at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   HBML attempts to push successor liability onto another entity, Millennium Chemicals, Inc. (\"Millennium\"). It asserts that after the acquisition in 1986, SCM's assets and liabilities were restructured by Hanson Industries and its general counsel. Hempstead Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-15.

D at 20 (Dkt. No. 82-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   HBML's reliance on the spinoff of liabilities onto Millennium in 1988 for purposes of personal jurisdiction is irrelevant. It does not refute or negate evidence of HBML's earlier control of the SCM acquisition or its ownership of SCM while SCM allegedly contributed to the contamination of the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons, I find\n   that plaintiffs' successor liability theory meets the second factor of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Exercising Jurisdiction Over HBML Would be Reasonable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Once plaintiffs satisfy the first two factors of the specific personal jurisdiction test, the burden shifts to the defendant, HBML, to show why jurisdiction would not be reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Schwarzenegger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237389\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/797/#p802\">\n    374 F.3d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

HBML asserts that the second and sixth factors make jurisdiction unreasonable. Its arguments are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   HBML argues that it is overly burdensome to require it, a London-based corporation, to litigate in California. It highlights that three of four depositions have already taken place in London, relevant employees are outside the United States, those same relevant employees may not be able to participate given health issues, they would not be able to travel to California to testify in defense of HBML, and HBML's document repository is located outside the United States. But a similar burden would apply to plaintiffs and cross-claimants if they had to litigate in the United Kingdom. Moreover, as the Ninth Circuit stated in\n   <em>\n    Sinatra\n   </em>\n   in 1988, \"modern advances in communications and transportation have significantly reduced the burden of litigating in another country.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537421\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/854/1191/#p1195\">\n    854 F.2d 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1199. HBML's witnesses may testify by video deposition if they are unable to travel. It would not be overly burdensome to hale HBML into federal court in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   HBML also argues that any interjection it has made in California was not on purpose. It says that it has not operated any business in California, has no facilities in California, and has had no contacts of any kind-including subsidiaries-since 2005. Rogers Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. I disposed of this argument above and found that HBML purposefully directed its activities toward California when it acquired SCM, and that SCM's conduct on the Property could be imputed to HBML through a successor liability theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corp.

Alter Ego Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Given my findings on personal jurisdiction, it is not necessary to address a second avenue for personal jurisdiction that relies on cross-claimants' theory, joined by plaintiffs, that HBML (including Hanson PLC, Hanson Trust PLC, and Hanson Limited) and Hanson entities in the United States are alter egos.

Acquisition Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Swagelok discusses several pieces of evidence both before and after the acquisition of SCM to demonstrate a unity of interests between HBML and its subsidiaries. To start, it is undisputed that HBML incorporated the twenty entities, HSCM-1 through HSCM-20, in anticipation of the takeover and that it organized these entities as subsidiaries of HM Anglo-American Ltd. (\"HM Anglo\"), another wholly owned subsidiary of HBML sharing its executive offices with HBML in London, England.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl., Ex. I (HBML 15566-67); Ex. A 49:4-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On August 21, 1985, a press release was sent from HBML stating that \"Hanson Trust PLC (either directly or through one or more of its affiliates) intends to commence a tender offer for any and all outstanding shares of common stock of SCM Corporation.\" Berle Decl. Ex. G (HBML 7468). HBML notes that the letter began with \"Sir Gordon White, Chairman of Hanson Trust PLC's North American interests, announced today...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20824\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It also asserts that London Stock Exchange rules required HBML to inform its own shareholders and the market generally of the\n   transaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Foreign Law, LSE Listing Rules (Jan. 1999) \u00a7\u00a7 10.1(a), 10.37 (requiring \"an explanatory circular must be dispatched to the company's shareholders\" for \"a transaction by any subsidiary undertaking of the listed company.\"). This does not make the initial representation that HBML was the entity \"intend[ing] to commence a tender offer\" any less significant. Berle Decl. Ex. G (HBML 7468).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   HBML issued several other press releases taking apparent credit for the SCM takeover as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl., Ex. S (announcing \"SCM is now part of Hanson Trust,\" \"Hanson Gains Control of SCM,\" \"Hanson Extends SCM Offer,\" \"Hanson to Purchase SCM shares,\" and \"Hanson Wins SCM Appeal.\"). HBML does not respond to the particular statements in the releases, except to repeat that they were sent by HBML's United States entities or by Sir Gordon White on behalf of North American interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply to Swagelok Oppo. at 5 n.10. The communications still tend to show that HBML shared a unity of interest with the subsidiary vehicles used to acquire SCM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In addition, Swagelok and Lozick present the HBML directors meeting minutes from August 22, 1985, which I discussed above in analyzing the successor liability theory. The meeting minutes show that HBML considered the tender offer announcement \"on behalf of the Company\" to \"facilitate the proposed cash tender offer\" and that one director discussed \"the background to the Company's interest in SCM Corporation.\" Doty Decl. Ex. L at 1. HBML argues that the board was required to approve the transaction by the London Stock Exchange because it was considered a material transaction by an indirect subsidiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Foreign Law, LSE Listing Rules (Jan. 1999) \u00a7\u00a7 10.1(a), 10.37. However, as with the SEC filings, those obligations do not diminish the evidence of HBML's involvement and control over the effort to acquire and liquidate SCM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Next, Swagelok contends that the August 26, 1985 tender offer was made by HBML through two wholly owned subsidiaries which it controlled, HSCM Industries, Inc. and Hanson Holdings Netherlands B.V.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl., Ex. G (HBML 7462-63). Hanson Netherlands received the money for the acquisition from loans directly by HBML.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20824\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. E (HBML 25531). In the tender offer, HBML made clear that \"as soon as practicable, Hanson Trust intends to seek to influence the management of the Company, to seek majority representation on the Company's Board of Directors and to seek to effect a business combination between the Company and Hanson Trust or an affiliate of Hanson Trust...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20824\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. G (HBML 7450, 7469). HBML's response to this evidence is that the tender offer was made by HSCM Industries Inc. and Hanson Holdings Netherlands B.V. as indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of HBML.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20824\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (HBML 7448, 7450). The tender offer, press releases, and meeting minutes evidence suggest that HBML was the power behind the acquisition of SCM, which was accomplished through its control of the subsidiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Lawsuits Reflecting HBML Control Over the SCM Acquisition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Swagelok also asserts that litigation filed by HBML concerning SCM shows its control over the acquisition. In August 1985, HBML filed two lawsuits against SCM for attempting to utilize the New York Securities Takeover Disclosure Act to prevent the takeover.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl., Ex. J; Ex. K; Ex. V. Swagelok argues that HBML used the court system to its benefit and in the process claimed that it was the real party in interest. This is additional evidence of HBML's control\n   over the acquisition, according to Swagelok.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   HBML disagrees. It contends that its role in the litigation was \"merely incidental to its status as the beneficial owner\" and that the legal fees were paid by Hanson Industries and managed by George Hempstead, not HBML counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hempstead Dep. Tr. 81:19-81:23. As noted earlier, it is not clear that the fact of Hempstead's management absolves HBML of control: from 1982 to 1996, which includes the time of the lawsuits, he signed the 1986 merger agreement with SCM on behalf of HBML and Hanson Netherlands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hamidi Decl., Ex. C (HBML 24756). Hempstead additionally served as a Director of HSCM Industries and as Vice President of all the fan companies when he signed the consent to liquidate HSCM Industries and SCM in 1986.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl., Ex. P-Q. HBML's participation in the litigation to acquire SCM tends to support a unity of interest with its subsidiaries, regardless of Hempstead's official role.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Undercapitalizing HBML-20\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Swagelok next argues that the HBML-20 entity, formed to house the Marchant liability, was not adequately capitalized because HBML did not conduct any valuation of the assets and liabilities deposited into HSCM-20. The Ninth Circuit has found that inadequate capitalization alone can serve as a basis for alter ego liability against a parent corporation.\n   <em>\n    Slottow v. Am. Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515301\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1355/#p1360\">\n    10 F.3d 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1360 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"[I]nadequate capitalization of a subsidiary may alone be a basis for holding the parent corporation liable for acts of the subsidiary.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   During liquidation, SCM's operating businesses were distributed to the fan companies HSCM-1 through HSCM-19.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl., Ex. N, Hempstead Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. SCM was left with \"residual assets and contingent/legacy liabilities associated with [SCM's] former defunct businesses\" that were merged into HSCM-20.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. X (Memorandum of Distribution in Liquidation). None of the businesses distributed into HSCM-20 were operating businesses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. N; Ex. B at 228:17-230:11, 238:2-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   HBML contends it did value the HSCM-20 assets and liabilities in a balance sheet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl. Ex. AA at HBML0026899 (showing assets equal to liabilities with Kalamazoo Reserves at $ 0). The valuation was performed by Hellings and other HBML employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reck Decl. Ex. E (Hempstead Dep. Tr.) at 418:13-15. Hempstead testified generally that he believed HSCM-20 was properly capitalized in 1986 because they \"were not aware of any significant pending liabilities or contingent liabilities at the time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 401:23-402:18. But when he was asked if he knew the residual assets and contingent liabilities were valued at $ 150 million (the amount of debt allocated to HSCM-20) Hempstead stated he did not know.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 299:2-9. Dransfield also testified, again as HBML's 30(b)(6) witness, that he was not aware that the assets or liabilities deposited into HSCM-20 were valued to determine adequate capitalization. Berle Decl., Ex. C at 219:12-221:9, 281:16-292:21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   To show that HSCM-20 was undercapitalized, Swagelok focuses on Marchant's liabilities and liabilities from the Kalamazoo Mill, an entity distributed to HSCM-20 that was not valued in the acquisition. It had been part of the former Allied Paper Division of SCM. The Kalamazoo Mill, also referred to as the Kalamazoo Site by the parties, was placed on the Environmental Protection Agency National Priorities List in 1989 as one of the most polluted areas in the country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Swagelok RJN Ex. UU at 1-2 (discussing the Kalamazoo River Cleanup in 2002 and Allied Paper's operations there since 1925) (Dkt. No. 113-5);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Berle Decl., Ex. BB (letter from Allied Paper to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources regarding PCB levels tested in Kalamazoo River). The SCM acquisition occurred in 1986, three years prior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Swagelok suggests that the Allied Paper Division of SCM would have known, or had reason to know, about the contamination at the Kalamazoo Site in 1986 during the time of the merger. Prior to the SCM acquisition in 1986, HBML also acknowledged in a Form 20-F that SCM was in negotiations with \"pollution control agencies\" on steps to be taken for compliance with applicable regulations. Berle Decl., Ex. M (HBML 8514); Ex. B, Hempstead Dep. Tr. at 235:10-237:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In its reply, HBML re-asserts that liabilities like the Marchant and Kalamazoo Site were not part of the valuation because they were unknown at the time. This is consistent with Dransfield's 30(b)(6) testimony on September 14, 2018, explaining why the entity was not valued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl., Ex. C at 220:11-12 (\"...they wouldn't put a value to it. And you can't put a value to things that are unknown.\"). But it leaves unrebutted the likelihood that SCM, and HBML through the acquisition process, would have known about the significant pollution at the Kalamazoo Site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   HBML also argues as a legal matter that it did not have to include an assessment of the Marchant or Kalamazoo Site liabilities for the capitalization of HSCM-20 when there was only a claim for liability rather than a judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Packaged Seafood Prods.

If the capital is illusory or trifling compared with the business to be done and the risks of loss, this is a ground for denying the separate entity privilege.\"). If the liabilities from Marchant, the Kalamazoo Site, and other entities were known but not yet incurred, adequate capitalization requirements suggest at least that a valuation occur to consider those risks and prospective liabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   HBML argues that because HBML-20 had no active operations it required no assets, and that in any event it had assets such as a lease of a building at 299 Park Avenue and others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reck Decl. Ex. K (HBML 627-29) (listing assets in HSCM-20). But Swagelok disputes Hempstead's account that the proceeds of selling two properties were received by HSCM-20 and that, if they were, they would be enough to capitalize it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl., Ex. B at 229:15-231:23. On this record it appears that HSCM-20 did not have its assets or liabilities valued during the SCM transactions, even while HBML had reason to know the fan company faced prospective liabilities from its SCM distributions. At a minimum, there remains a question whether HSCM-20 was undercapitalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Sharing the Same Officers and Directors in Subsidiaries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, Swagelok discusses HBML's use of the same officers for the restructuring and liquidation of SCM as\n   another factor weighing in favor of alter ego liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slottow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515301\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1355/#p1360\">\n    10 F.3d at 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding a unity of interests where, in part, a parent company owned nearly all shares of a subsidiary, and all the subsidiary's officers were officers of the parent company).

P-R, X, CC, PP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As HBML asserts, this is insufficient to weigh in favor of a unity of interest or ownership. Swagelok does not identify any directors of HBML in 1986 who were concurrently directors of HSCM-20.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Berle Decl., Ex. NN at 710 (HBML 10818). According to HBML, of all twenty-six directors, associate directors, and officers of HBML and HSCM-20, there was only one in common between the two companies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dransfield Dep. Tr. at 5-9, 203:2-204:3, 204:21-205:20. That said, sufficient evidence supports a finding that a unity of interest and ownership exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

N \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Swagelok's allegations are consistent with plaintiffs' in terms of demonstrating HBML's control over the tender offer, acquisition, liquidation of SCM, and the post-acquisition restructuring of its liabilities. Because I found that plaintiffs stated a claim for successor liability against HBML, similar considerations would lead to an inequitable result if the corporate veil were not pierced. Alter ego liability is a second, alternative reason to find jurisdiction over HBML.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    II. REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE AND EVIDENTIARY DISPUTES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   HBML, plaintiffs, and Swagelok filed requests for judicial notice. HBML then filed separate oppositions to plaintiffs' and Swagelok's requests. Additionally, Swagelok filed evidentiary objections to HBML's Hempstead declaration in support of its motion, HBML moved to exclude Dr. Bookspan's testimony in its reply, and objects to specific paragraphs and exhibits in the Berle, Doty, and Hamidi declarations. My findings on these issues are explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Requests for Judicial Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Cal. Feb. 23, 2017) (taking judicial notice of documents that were filed with the secretary of state). The ability to take judicial notice of court filings extends to documents filed in federal bankruptcy court actions as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richard &amp; Sheila J.

Accordingly, I GRANT HBML's request for judicial notice of Exhibits A through F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiffs Request for Judicial Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Plaintiffs request judicial notice of documents like a transcript of Hellings's deposition in a 1985 case between HBML and SCM in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (Exhibit A) and a copy of HBML's Memorandum of Contentions of Fact and Law filed in another case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (Exhibit B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff RJN at 1. Judicial notice is possible for records filed in another case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Mercury Ins. Co. v. Kinsale Ins.

Aug. 21, 2018) (judicially noticing deposition transcripts and filed documents in the case). It is appropriate to notice that the deposition occurred and was filed in another case, but I do not adopt Hellings's underlying testimony as undisputed fact. Because I did not need to rely on Exhibit B in rendering a decision, I decline to take judicial notice of it. I GRANT plaintiffs' request to take judicial notice of Exhibit A and DENY AS MOOT judicial notice of Exhibit B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Swagelok Request for Judicial Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Swagelok/Whitney requests judicial notice of Exhibits SS to EEE in its compendium of evidence in support of its opposition to the motion to dismiss. Swagelok RJN at 2, 6. Of these requests for judicial notice, I relied on Exhibits TT and UU in this Order, which are a beneficial ownership disclosure statute in effect in 1985 when HBML filed a Schedule 13D and an EPA 2002 Fact Sheet regarding the Kalamazoo River Cleanup and the EPA 1993 Fact Sheet regarding the proposed addition of sites to the National Priorities List, respectively. The existence of these documents are judicially noticeable as publicly available documents whose existence cannot\n   reasonably be questioned. Therefore, I GRANT the request to judicially notice Exhibits TT and UU, and the remaining exhibits I decline to judicially notice at this time are DENIED AS MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Evidentiary Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Swagelok and Lozick Evidentiary Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Swagelok brings nine evidentiary objections to portions of HBML's Hempstead declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evidentiary Objections (Dkt. No. 113-6). All of Swagelok's objections are based on a lack of personal knowledge or lack of foundation under Federal Rule of Evidence 602, and inadmissible hearsay grounds under Rules 801(c) and 802. Some objections are lodged on relevance grounds under Rule 401. Lozick also challenges the relevance of two prior lawsuits involving HBML.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lozick Oppo. at 18-19. Because I find there is personal jurisdiction in favor of plaintiffs, Swagelok, and Lozick, these various objections are moot at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    2. HBML Evidentiary Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   HBML seeks rulings on evidentiary objections that it leveled in its reply to plaintiffs and Swagelok's oppositions, as well as at the hearing on their motion to dismiss. HBML first seeks to exclude the testimony of plaintiffs' historian, Dr. Bookspan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply to Emeryville at 13-15 (Dkt. No. 126). HBML argues that it is inadmissible under Rule 702, which allows for testimony based on sufficient facts, the product of reliable methods, and which applies those reliable methods to the facts. Specifically, HBML contends that Dr. Bookspan is unqualified to offer her opinion that HBML and its United States counterpart Hanson Industries were indistinguishable entities in the way they were financed and managed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bookspan Decl. \u00b6 40. It also argues that her entire testimony on the content of the materials referenced in her declaration is not helpful because of her lack of experience in corporate legal structures or finance; and that her testimony on HBML's California contacts should be excluded as irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   I do not agree that Bookspan lacks the expertise to offer an opinion on HBML's activities from the 1980s to 2000 that are relevant to the alleged environmental contamination. Bookspan Decl. \u00b6 2 (\"I have 34 years of experience in conducting corporate history research for clients involved in environmental cleanup liability issues as well as for internal corporate purposes.\"). Her testimony is relevant and her interpretation of the contents of historical materials referenced in her declaration would be helpful to a factfinder. Therefore, HBML's objection to Bookspan's declaration is OVERRULED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Next, HBML objects to exhibits attached to the Doty declaration, portions of the Hamidi declaration, and the entire Hellings's deposition transcript. Starting with the Hamidi declaration, HBML objects to paragraphs 8, 9, and 11 on hearsay grounds and the best evidence rule with respect to how it summarizes Hempstead's testimony. I do not rely on Hamidi's declaration for its statements on Hempstead's testimony, making this objection moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   HBML then objects to Hellings's deposition on grounds that it is hearsay, an unsigned copy of the transcript, and because plaintiffs apparently failed to produce it in advance of the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of HBML. As I discussed above, the Hellings deposition transcript was found suitable for judicial notice as a public record filed in another case whose existence cannot reasonably be questioned. The objection is OVERRULED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   As for the Doty declaration, HBML's objections are brought on the grounds of a lack of authentication and lack of personal knowledge for both Exhibit I, an ad from\n   the Los Angeles Times, and Exhibit N, a Tillotson Director's Report. HBML raises these technical objections without giving cause for concern about authenticity, even though each was raised in depositions taken in jurisdictional discovery. At this stage, it is clear from the exhibits themselves that they are what they purport to be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(4) (a document's \"appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all the circumstances\" is evidence enough to satisfy the authentication requirement). There is no indication from HBML or otherwise that plaintiffs would be unable to authenticate the exhibits in trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faulks v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268603\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/231/387/#p397\">\n    231 F.Supp.3d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 397-98 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (overruling objections to admissibility because \"it is possible that the facts underlying [the exhibit] could be admissible at trial.\"). These objections are OVERRULED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Finally, with respect to HBML's reply to Swagelok's opposition, HBML objects to the Berle declaration and several of its attached exhibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply to Swagelok Opposition at (Dkt. No. 127). HBML objects to paragraph 23 to the extent it summarizes Lyondell bankruptcy documents. I do not rely on Berle's summary of the Lyondell bankruptcy, so this objection is moot. HBML also objects to Berle declaration paragraphs 15 and 32, but since I do not rely on these paragraphs in the Order these objections are moot as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   HBML then objects to Exhibits L and BB for lack of authentication and lack of personal knowledge to authenticate the documents. In addition, HBML objects to Exhibit BB for lack of foundation. Exhibit L, a copy of HBML meeting minutes, was produced by HBML in jurisdictional discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doty Decl. \u00b6 16, Ex. L (explaining that the meeting minutes were produced by Dransfield in his capacity as HBML's Rule 30(b)(6) witness). Exhibit BB, a 1976 letter from Allied Paper to the Department of Natural Resources, was introduced by Berle citing the ancient document exception to hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Like cases at summary judgment, here the authenticity and lack of personal knowledge objections are not well-taken because there is no suggestion the evidence would not be admissible at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faulks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268603\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/231/387/#p397\">\n    231 F.Supp.3d at 397-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, courts tend not to exclude evidence before trial based on objections to form-such as a lacks foundation challenge-as opposed to whether its contents are admissible.\n   <em>\n    Ochoa v. Santa Clara Cty. Office of Educ.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-03283-HRL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202423183\">\n    2017 WL 2423183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Cal. June 5, 2017) (\"courts at the summary judgment stage focus not on the form of the evidence submitted by the parties but on the admissibility of its contents.\"). The objections to Exhibit L and BB are OVERRULED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   For the reasons stated above, HBML's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is DENIED.
