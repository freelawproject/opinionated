See,\n   <em>\n    Centro Presente v. Dep't of Homeland Sec'y\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-cv-10340-DJC (D.Mass. filed February 22, 2018)(Haiti, El Salvador, and Honduras);\n   <em>\n    Ramos v.

While not entirely uniform in their reasoning, district court decisions reject challenges to subject matter jurisdiction, and find at least some of the complaints to state viable claims, both statutory and constitutional. As a result of the decisions already produced by those courts, the analysis here need not be extensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (\"NAACP\"), Haitian Women for Haitian Refugees (\"HWHR\"), and the Haitian Lawyers Association, Inc. (\"HLA\"), seek declaratory relief and to enjoin the November 2017 decision of Defendants, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), former acting DHS Secretary Elaine C. Duke (\"Duke\"), and current DHS Secretary Kristjen Nielsen (\"Nielsen\"), terminating Temporary Protected Status (\"TPS\") for Haitian nationals based on alleged Due Process and Equal Protection violations. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' decision \"reflects an egregious departure from the TPS statute's requirements and an intent to discriminate on the basis of race and/or ethnicity.\" (ECF No. 30 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Amended Complaint contains three counts. Count I asserts a violation of the Fifth Amendment, both equal protection (intent to discriminate against Haitian immigrants because of race and/or ethnicity) and due process (irrational government action). Counts II and III seek mandamus and declaratory relief, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Section 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), codified in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a, allows the Secretary of Homeland Security (\"Secretary\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to designate Temporary Protected Status (\"TPS\") for a country under certain conditions, for example: (i) if \"there has been an earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic, or other environmental disaster in the state resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living conditions in the area affected,\" or (ii) if the Secretary finds that a country is temporarily unable to handle the return of its nationals. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(1)(B)(i)-(ii). The TPS designation protects nationals of that country from removal while the designation is in effect, and allows them to hold a registration document and obtain work authorization in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1254a(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Secretary has the discretion to designate TPS for an initial period of 6 to 18 months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1254a(b)(2). After the allotted time has expired, the Secretary is required to review the conditions in the foreign state and determine whether to renew its TPS status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1254a(b)(3)(A). A renewal may extend the designation for up to 18 months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1254a(b)(3)(C). If the Secretary determines the conditions no longer warrant TPS, she must terminate the designation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1254a(b)(3)(B). The Secretary must publish renewal and termination\n   decisions in the Federal Register.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1254a(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Haiti received an 18-month TPS designation in January 2010, after an earthquake \"destroyed most of the capital city\" and caused numerous deaths in 2010. (ECF No. 30 \u00b6 21). Different administrations later extended the designation in May 2011, October 2012, March 2014, and August 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 28, 33, 38). Each respective Secretary supported the extensions with a discussion of Haiti's country conditions, including continuing impacts from the 2010 earthquake, multiple cholera outbreaks resulting from a breakdown in healthcare infrastructure, breakdowns in law enforcement and government stability, lack of access to basic health services, a high unemployment rate, and compromised food security, among other issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After President Trump took office, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly extended the TPS designation for six months, from July 23, 2017 to January 22, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51). Although he found the country conditions in Haiti to be severe enough to warrant a shorter TPS renewal, he signaled the administration's intent to terminate the TPS designation soon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 20, 2017, in the face of strong political support to the contrary, then-acting Secretary Duke announced her decision to terminate TPS for Haiti with a delayed effective date of 18 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74). Her press release stated that the extraordinary conditions caused by the 2010 earthquake no longer existed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75). She later published her decision as a Notice in the Federal Register.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Termination of the Designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%202%2C648\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. 2,648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 18, 2018). The Notice was published four days before the TPS designation was set to expire. Plaintiffs allege that the \"unprecedented delay\" caused uncertainty and economic losses for Haitians living in the United States, including loss of jobs and certain federal benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants from implementing the TPS termination decision and to secure declaratory relief that the decision is a violation of Due Process and Equal Protection rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46). Plaintiffs contend that the decision was not based upon objective evidence but was intended to discriminate against Haitian immigrants on the basis of race and/or ethnicity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs claim to have circumstantial and direct evidence, including (1) alleged DHS targeted searches for evidence that Haitians with TPS in the United States were criminals and recipients of public welfare, (ECF No. 30 \u00b6\u00b6 87-88); (2) President Trump's alleged comments that Haitians \"all have AIDS\" and \"Why do we need more Haitians?\" and the alleged order to drafters of the immigration bill to \"take [Haitians] out,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 96-98); (3) President Trump's alleged question in response to Haitian immigrants \"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%202%2C648\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ); (4) President Trump's alleged comments expressing a preference for immigrants from places like Norway, where the population is over 90\n   percent white, (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%202%2C648\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ); President Trump's comments about other minority races, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90-95); (5) Secretary Duke's failure to acknowledge evidence of Haiti's troubling country conditions today, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-86); (6) the \"unprecedented\" delay in publishing the Notice in the Federal Register, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76); (7) Secretary Duke's failure to consider all factors in the statutory mandate, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80); and (8) influence from the presidential administration to pressure the Secretary to rescind Honduras's designation as part of a broader strategic goal on immigration, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 17, 2018 Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint. (ECF No. 30). Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) on May 7, 2018. (ECF No. 36). Plaintiffs responded in opposition on June 7, 2018. (ECF No. 45). Defendants replied on June 27, 2018. (ECF No. 58).

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9294800\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/277/#p290\">\n    354 F.3d 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290-91 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc), the Fourth Circuit held that courts \"do not limit the discrimination inquiry to the actions or statements of formal decisionmakers[,]\" because such a limitation would \"thwart the very purposes of the [anti-discrimination] acts by allowing employers to insulate themselves from liability simply by hiding behind the blind approvals, albeit non-biased, of formal decisionmakers.\" Influential racial animus principles in the employment context apply with full force to government officials' alleged constitutional violations, even the President.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526259\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/1083/#p1102\">\n    321 F.Supp.3d at 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"There is no logical reason why this principle should not apply with equal force when the superior entity or authority (here, the President) influences a subordinate (here, a cabinet member) to perform an action charged to the latter.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal v.

The dispositive question here is whether the challenged decision was motivated by impermissible animus. Defendants appear to concede that the White House may have been involved in the termination decision, (ECF No. 36, at 29) (\"it should be considered unremarkable that a White House advisor would provide input to the Secretary of Homeland Security on a politically sensitive matter of this nature\"), and thus do not reject the possibility of a \"cats' paw\" theory of animus. Instead, Defendants argue that because Acting Secretary Duke did not immediately terminate TPS status for another country, Honduras, at the behest of the White House, that she is resistant to the administration's pressures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 58, at 15). However, Defendants ignore that Honduras' TPS status was later rescinded by Acting Secretary Duke, that inaction or delay could reasonably not be seen as \"resistance,\" and importantly fail to distinguish the power of President Trump's alleged statements of animus specifically targeting Haiti. Even if it is arguable that Acting Secretary Duke's delay was a \"resistance,\" or that President Trump's statements did not influence the TPS decision, at the motion to dismiss stage all factual allegations must be accepted as true and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs' complaint alleges a plausible claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Mandamus and Declaratory Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs' allege they are entitled to mandamus relief because Defendants' have failed their mandatory and nondiscretionary duties set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(3). Defendants' contend that Plaintiffs' claims do not meet the narrow criteria for mandamus relief. Mandamus relief is \"intended to provide a remedy for a plaintiff only if he has exhausted all other avenues of relief and only if the defendant owes him a clear nondiscretionary duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Heckler v.

Plaintiffs' have a direct cause of action by way of the Constitution, including for injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Hood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"414062\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/678/#p684\">\n    327 U.S. 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 684,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"414062\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/678/#p684\">\n    66 S.Ct. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"414062\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/678/#p684\">\n    90 L.Ed. 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1946). Thus, Plaintiffs' have not exhausted all other avenues of relief. Similarly, the Declaratory Judgment Act provides a mode of relief, and is not an independent cause of action. To the extent that Plaintiffs seek full relief under Count I, there is no need to resort to Count III for declaratory relief. Accordingly, both Counts II and III will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
