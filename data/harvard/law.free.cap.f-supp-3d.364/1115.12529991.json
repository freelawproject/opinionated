(Doc. No. 9.) Attorneys Bobbie R. Bailey and Emily Kate Doty appeared on behalf of plaintiff BASF Corporation (\"BASF\"). Attorney Dean A. Rocco appeared on behalf of defendant. The court has considered the parties' briefs and oral arguments, and for the reasons set forth below, will grant in part and deny in part defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff BASF sells automotive refinish products, including paints, refinishes, coating, primers, thinners, and reducers (collectively \"refinish products\"), for the reconditioning, refinishing, and repainting of automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles. (Doc. No. 1 [hereinafter \"Compl.\"] at \u00b6 3.) Defendant Cesare's is an auto body shop engaged in the business of reconditioning, refinishing, and repainting automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 4, 2014, BASF and Cesare's entered into a written contract [hereinafter \"Requirements Agreement\"] in which Cesare's agreed to fulfill one hundred percent of its requirements for refinish products from BASF, up to a minimum purchase requirement of $ 743,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) In consideration thereof, BASF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   agreed to pay Cesare's $ 80,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.) Pursuant to the Requirements Agreement, if the agreement was breached for any reason prior to Cesare's purchase of the minimum $ 743,000 in refinish products, Cesare's was required to refund BASF the $ 80,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BASF alleges that on or about June 2014, Cesare's breached the Requirements Agreement, without justification, by entering into an agreement with one of BASF's competitors and failing to purchase any of its requirements for refinish products from BASF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14.) By letter dated February 17, 2017, BASF gave notice to Cesare's that it was in default of its contractual obligations, and demanded a refund of the $ 80,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.) BASF alleges that, to date, Cesare's has failed to satisfy its obligations under the Requirements Agreement or refund the $ 80,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BASF initiated this action against Cesare's on April 16, 2018, asserting four causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) quantum meruit; and (4) declaratory relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-37.) On June 13, 2018, Cesare's filed the motion to dismiss now pending before this court. (Doc. No. 9.) BASF filed its opposition on July 3, 2018, and Cesare's filed its reply on July 10, 2018. (Doc.

The Parties' Positions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss argues that all four of plaintiff's causes of action arose more than four years prior to the initiation of this action on April 16, 2018, and are therefore barred by the applicable statutes of limitations under California law, which provides four years for the bringing of a cause of action for breach of contract, three years for the bringing of a cause of action for unjust enrichment, and two years for the bringing of a cause of\n   action for quantum meruit. (Doc. No. 9 at 6-9.) According to defendant, because plaintiff's fourth cause of action for declaratory relief is derivative of the other causes of action, it too must be dismissed as untimely and barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In opposition, plaintiff contends that it is Michigan, not California law, that provides the applicable statutes of limitations in this case. (Doc. No. 12 at 5.) A copy of the Requirements Agreement, incorporated into plaintiff's complaint as an exhibit, specifies: \"This Agreement and performance or non-performance hereunder shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Michigan without regard to principles of conflicts of law.\" (Doc. No. 6 at \u00b6 6.) Plaintiff asserts that Michigan law provides a six-year statute of limitations for each of its causes of actions and that, accordingly, plaintiff's complaint is timely. (Doc. No. 12 at 5-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In reply, defendant argues that even if Michigan substantive law applies to this action, Michigan's \"borrowing statute\" must also apply. Michigan's borrowing statute provides that \"[a]n action based upon a cause of action accruing without this state shall not be commenced after the expiration of the statute of limitations of either this state or the place without this state where the cause of action accrued.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600.5861\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.5861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant argues that plaintiff's causes of action all accrued in California, and that Michigan's borrowing statute is therefore applicable and requires compliance with both Michigan and California statutes of limitations. (Doc. No. 13 at 3-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Enforceability of Choice-of-Law Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court considers first whether the choice-of-law provision in the parties' Requirements Agreement is enforceable. A federal court sitting in diversity applies the choice of law rules of the forum state.\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v. Citibank (S.D.), N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895540\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/546/1078/#p1082\">\n    546 F.3d 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1082 (9th Cir. 2008). Because this action was brought in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. at \u00b6 5), the court will apply California choice-of-law rules. Where a contract includes a choice-of-law provision, the court must first determine: \"(1) whether the chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction, or (2) whether there is any other reasonable basis for the parties' choice of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Nedlloyd Lines B.V. v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2008201\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/3/459/#p466\">\n    3 Cal. 4th 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 466,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20330\">\n    11 Cal.Rptr.2d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=834%20P.2d%201148\">\n    834 P.2d 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). \"If neither of these tests is met, that is the end of the inquiry, and the court need not enforce the parties' choice of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=834%20P.2d%201148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If either test is met, however, the court must next determine whether the application of the law of the designated state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of the forum state.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=834%20P.2d%201148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   California courts have routinely found that the required substantial relationship exists where one of the parties is incorporated or maintains a principal place of business in the chosen state.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pinela v.

Plaintiff has not identified any authority indicating that the circumstances presented here satisfy the \"substantial relationship\" test, and the court has located none. Whether Michigan has \"substantial\n   relationship\" to the parties or the transaction at issue therefore appears doubtful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   However, whether there is \"any other reasonable basis\" for the parties' choice of law \"appears to be a lower standard.\"\n   <em>\n    J.P.

Cal. Nov. 14, 2014). Plaintiff notes that the Requirements Agreement identifies BASF's office in Southfield, Michigan as BASF's location for the purposes of the contractual relationship, that the connection to Michigan is apparent on the face of the contract and that this connection provides a \"reasonable basis\" for selecting Michigan law. (Doc. No. 12 at 6-7.) At the hearing on the pending motion to dismiss, counsel for plaintiff further clarified that although BASF does not maintain its principal place of business in Michigan, BASF's automotive refinish products business-the segment of the business at issue in the Requirements Contract-is located in Michigan. Given these circumstances, the court concludes that there is a reasonable basis for the parties' choice of law that is not completely arbitrary.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Missaghi v.

According to the allegations of plaintiff's complaint here, the alleged breach of contract occurred when Cesare's \"breached and ultimately terminated the Requirements Agreement by, among other things, entering into an agreement with one of BASF's competitors and failing to purchase one hundred percent of its requirements for Refinish Products from BASF.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 12.) The complaint further alleges that Cesare's \"has failed and refused to purchase any further Refinish Products in violation of Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Requirements Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) The essential facts giving rise to BASF's claim here thus occurred in California, where Cesare's is incorporated and maintains its principal place of business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scherer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=716%20N.W.2d%20307\">\n    716 N.W.2d at 310-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a cause of action for breach of contract accrued in Michigan, where the defendant was residing when breach allegedly occurred). Because BASF's breach of contract claim accrued outside the State of Michigan, Michigan's borrowing statute applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Timeliness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Pursuant to Michigan's borrowing statute, for plaintiff's claims to be timely, they must satisfy California's applicable statutes of limitations. The court next considers whether plaintiff's claims fall within the relevant limitations period under California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Breach of Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under California law, plaintiff's first cause of action for breach of contract is governed by a four-year statute of limitations. Cal. Code Civ. P. \u00a7 337. Plaintiff's complaint alleges that defendant breached the Requirements Agreement in June 2014, when defendant entered into an agreement with one of BASF's competitors, and therefore failed to purchase one hundred percent of its requirements for refinish products from BASF. (Compl. at \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant disputes the June 2014 date of breach, contending that the allegations of the complaint indicate that the alleged breach must have occurred in March 2014, when the contract term began and when defendant was supposed to begin purchasing refinish products from BASF. (Doc. No. 9 at 7.) The relevant portion of the parties' Requirements Agreement states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The Term of this Agreement shall commence with the first full calendar month subsequent to the Effective Date and continue until [Cesare's] and or until its Controlled Business have purchased $ 743,000 in the aggregate of BASF Products ... subsequent to the Effective Date .... During the Term of this Agreement, [Cesare's] shall cause each of its Controlled Businesses to purchase from an authorized BASF distributor one hundred percent (100%) of their requirements for Refinish Products in connection with the Business, specifying\n   only BASF brand products for Refinish Products.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Doc. No. 6 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) The Requirements Agreement was signed in February 2014, making the first full calendar month-and the start of the contract term-March 2014. Plaintiff argues, however, that the contract terms did not require defendant to make purchases by any particular deadline. Construing the allegations of the complaint as true and in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the court finds that the plaintiff has adequately alleged that the purported breach occurred in June 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Given California's four-year statute of limitations, plaintiff therefore had until June 2018 to bring a breach of contract claim against defendant. The complaint in this action was filed on April 16, 2018, and plaintiff's claim for breach of contract is therefore timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Unjust Enrichment and Quantum Meruit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff's second and third causes of action are for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit, respectively. (Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 27-33.) Defendant argues that these causes of action are time-barred because under California law there is a three-year statute of limitations for unjust enrichment claims grounded in fraud or mistake, and a two-year statute of limitations for quantum meruit claims. (Doc. No. 9 at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In opposition to the pending motion, plaintiff contends that defendant's arguments in this regard are meritless, but provides no meaningful explanation as to why that is so and cites no authority suggesting an alternative limitations period under California law for either of these causes of action. (Doc. No. 12 at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant is correct that California law provides a three-year limitations period for unjust enrichment claims and a two-year limitations period for quantum meruit claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal.

Assuming the claimed breach of contract occurred in June 2014 as alleged in plaintiff's complaint, plaintiff had until June 2017 to file a claim for unjust enrichment, and until June 2016 to file a claim for quantum meruit. However, as noted above, plaintiff's complaint was not filed until April 16, 2018. Accordingly, plaintiff's causes of action for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Declaratory Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff's fourth and final cause of action is for declaratory relief. (Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 34-37.) A cause of action for declaratory relief is derivative of the underlying obligation, and the statute of limitations is \"determined by the nature of the underlying obligation sought to be adjudicated.\"\n   <em>\n    Snyder v.

Here, plaintiff's complaint specifies that its cause of action for declaratory relief is premised on the \"rights and obligations\" of the parties \"under the Requirements Agreement\" (Compl. at \u00b6 36), and as such, it is based on the underlying cause of action for breach\n   of contract. The court, having determined above that plaintiff's cause of action for breach of contract was timely filed, also finds that plaintiff's cause of action for declaratory relief was timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, defendant's motion to dismiss (Doc.
