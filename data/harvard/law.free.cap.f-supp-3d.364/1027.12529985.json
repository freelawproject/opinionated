(Doc. 7 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13, 16, 17.) C.L. was \"stimming\" with a piece of string. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) \"Stimming,\" or \"self-stimulatory behavior,\" is the repetition of physical movements and sounds or the repetitive movement of objects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22). Stimming is common in individuals with developmental disabilities, as it provides a sense of calm and helps them cope with their surroundings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23.) It is a well-known and common symptom of autism. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant David Grossman (\"Officer Grossman\")-a police officer and drug recognition expert employed by the Buckeye Police Department-approached C.L. after seeing C.L. stimming. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 20, 25, 27, 29.) Officer Grossman claims that he mistook C.L.'s stimming for illegal drug use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Officer Grossman asked C.L. what he was doing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) C.L. responded, \"Me? Good.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Grossman again asked C.L. what he was doing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) C.L. answered, \"I'm stimming.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Officer Grossman responded, \"What?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) C.L. then stated, \"I stim with this,\" as he held up a piece of string for Officer Grossman to see. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) Officer Grossman responded, \"What is that?\" and commanded C.L. to \"stop walking away from me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   C.L. stopped walking and answered, \"It's a string,\" and again held the string up for Officer Grossman to see. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Officer Grossman then responded, \"Ok. So why are you bouncing around that way,\" and asked C.L. if \"he had any ID on him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) C.L. answered, \"No\" and turned to leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) Officer Grossman immediately grabbed C.L.'s right wrist and began bending C.L.'s right arm behind C.L.'s back, telling him: \"Don't go anywhere.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Officer Grossman then grabbed both of C.L.'s arms, forced them behind C.L.'s back, and began to handcuff him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) C.L. began screaming and tried to move away from Officer Grossman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   C.L.'s reaction was predictable, given that people with autism often have hypersensitivity to sounds or touch, a condition known as tactory or sensory defensiveness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Even a slight touch can cause those with autism to suffer great anxiety, discomfort, and even physical pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Grossman then slammed C.L. against a tree, wrestled him to the ground, and pinned C.L. with his full body weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) C.L. continued to scream, repeatedly saying to himself, \"I'm ok, I'm ok.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) C.L. then told Officer Grossman, \"I need help,\" and \"I can't breathe.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Officer Grossman asked, \"Why are you acting like this, C.L.?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At this point, C.L.'s caregiver, Ms. Craglow, arrived at the park after running errands and informed Officer Grossman that C.L. is autistic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) Initially, Officer Grossman ignored the statement and told Ms. Craglow that C.L. was \"doing something with his hands.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Ms. Craglow explained, \"He's stimming,\" to which Officer Grossman responded \"Yeah. I don't know what that is.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61, 62.) Ms. Craglow further explained, \"It's when you have autism. It's his nerves.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Officer Grossman uttered, \"Uh huh, okay,\" and, despite the explanation, continued to pin C.L. to the ground with his full body weight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Ms. Craglow then informed Officer Grossman that C.L.'s hand was \"turning white.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) Officer Grossman continued to hold down C.L. forcefully. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When another officer arrived on the scene, Officer Grossman allowed C.L. to get off the ground and sit with Ms. Craglow. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 71.) Officer Grossman told the other officer that he had detained C.L. because C.L. \"started backing away from me while I was identifying him and trying to figure out what was in his hand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   C.L. suffered significant injuries resulting from his encounter with Officer Grossman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) He suffered scratches, cuts, and bruises to his face, back, and arms and a serious ankle injury that has required numerous draining procedures with a heavy gauge needle as well as a surgical intervention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74, 75.) C.L. also suffered emotional damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Post-Incident Conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the incident, C.L.'s parents filed a complaint against Officer Grossman with the Buckeye Police Department (\"BPD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) In response, the BPD admitted that Officer Grossman \"has not been trained in handling special needs people or mentally ill persons.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) Nevertheless, the BPD concluded that Officer Grossman \"acted within the law and did not abuse his power as a sworn officer and was not negligent as an officer during this incident.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In a press conference following the incident, the BPD justified Officer Grossman's actions as those of \"an officer who encountered a subject who was displaying behavior that he believed may have been of a subject who was under the influence of an inhalant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) In that same press conference, the BPD stated that Officer Grossman's actions were justified because Officer Grossman \"had reasonable suspicion\" to \"detain the juvenile\" and \"the juvenile began to walk away.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The BPD made those statements despite knowing that C.L. had twice showed Officer Grossman the piece of string in his hand and had informed Officer Grossman that he was \"stimming.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The BPD didn't discipline Officer Grossman despite his track record of past misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-89.) Officer Grossman had been disciplined at least four times in the seven years preceding the incident, including for illegally arresting a suspect, filing false reports, failing to act, and abandoning his duty as a police officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-94.) In addition to those events, the BPD also knew that Officer Grossman had in the past (1) deployed excessive force without legal justification, (2) seized \"brass knuckles\" despite them not being illegal, (3) written defective police reports, and (4) engaged in reckless driving. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Officer Grossman's supervisors-Lieutenant Charles Arlak (\"Lieutenant Arlak\") and Chief of Police Larry Hall (\"Chief Hall\")-have enabled Officer Grossman's illegal behavior by actively protecting him and minimizing and covering up his illegal behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) Lieutenant Arlak is Officer Grossman's brother-in-law and is a close friend of Chief Hall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.) Certain BPD officers have overheard Lieutenant Arlak saying that he needs to \"protect\" Officer Grossman because of repeated illegal conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) Lieutenant Arlak has also ordered other members of the BPD to \"quit targeting\" Officer Grossman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) Chief Hall has \"targeted\" supervisors who have attempted to discipline Officer Grossman for past illegal conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.) Additionally, Chief Hall ordered the BPD to defend Officer Grossman in press conferences, such as the one occurring after the incident with C.L. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 140.) BPD employees have voiced their concerns to Buckeye City Manager Roger Klingler, but nothing has been done to address the conduct of Officer Grossman, Lieutenant Arlak, or Chief Hall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112, 113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The complaint names four defendants: the City of Buckeye (\"City\"), Officer Grossman, Lieutenant Arlak, and Chief Hall (collectively, \"Defendants\"). (Doc. 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Grossman, Lieutenant Arlak, and Chief Hall are named in their individual and official capacities.

First, Defendants contend the facts as pleaded don't show that Officer Grossman arrested C.L. Instead, Defendants argue, Officer Grossman engaged in a lawful investigatory stop, supported by reasonable suspicion, which wasn't converted into an arrest when Officer Grossman restrained C.L. after he attempted to flee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   C.L. responds that he was arrested by Officer Grossman because \"[a]n arrest is complete when the suspect's liberty of movement is interrupted and restricted by the police.\" (Doc. 21 at 4-6.) Additionally, C.L. claims his arrest was unsupported by probable cause, because after showing Officer Grossman he had a string in his hand, \"a reasonably prudent person would have perceived that C.L. was disabled, and likewise would have known that C.L. was not holding drugs or contraband in his hand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, C.L. argues that Officer Grossman isn't entitled to qualified immunity because \"[i]t is well established that 'an arrest without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment and gives rise to a claim for damages under \u00a7 1983.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court finds that the facts alleged in the complaint, construed in the light most favorable to C.L., demonstrate that Officer Grossman arrested C.L. without probable cause and thus violated C.L.'s clearly-established constitutional rights.

First, the intrusiveness of the stop cuts in favor of an arrest finding. C.L. alleges that Officer Grossman \"grabbed [C.L]'s right wrist and began bending [C.L.]'s right arm behind [C.L.]'s back, telling him: 'Don't go anywhere.' \" (Doc. 7 \u00b6 50.) Officer Grossman then \"grab[bed] both of [C.L.]'s arms, forced them behind [C.L.]'s back, and began to handcuff [C.L.].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.)

Officer Grossman \"remained on top of [C.L.], continuing to pin him down with his full body weight\" until another officer arrived. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64, 70.) This was at least a moderately significant restriction of C.L.'s liberty, and a reasonable innocent person wouldn't have felt free to leave under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Moreover, before any force was employed, C.L. explained to Officer Grossman that he was stimming with a piece of string and showed the string to Officer Grossman. (Doc. 7 \u00b6\u00b6 36-40.) Because, as alleged, Officer Grossman saw that C.L. was not holding drugs or contraband in his hands, C.L. has plausibly alleged that Officer Grossman lacked probable cause to arrest him.

Applying the test used by the Ninth Circuit, a reasonable jury could conclude that Officer Grossman used excessive force. The first two factors of that test-the severity of the crime and whether the suspect posed an immediate threat-strongly favor C.L. Officer Grossman initiated the encounter because he suspected C.L., who was standing by himself in a park, was engaged in \"illegal drug use.\" (Doc. 7 \u00b6 25.) This is not the crime of the century. Moreover, C.L. immediately explained to Officer Grossman that he was stimming and showed Officer Grossman the piece of string that was in his hand. Yet after receiving this innocuous explanation, Officer Grossman \"handcuff[ed] C.L., slam[med] him against a tree, tackle[d] him to the ground, and forcefully pin[ned] him down until backup arrived.\" (Doc. 21 at 6 (citing Doc. 7 \u00b6\u00b6 50-71).) C.L. also alleges that his hand \"turned white\" from Officer Grossman restraining him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Only the last factor-\"whether [the suspect] is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight\"-could weigh in Defendants' favor. But even then, the complaint only alleges that C.L. \"turned to leave,\" not that he began running away or fought Officer Grossman. (Doc. 7 \u00b6 49.) It also bears noting that C.L. was only 14 years old at the time of this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For these reasons, a reasonable jury could conclude the physical force exerted against C.L. was excessive. Because the right to be free from excessive force is clearly established, Officer Grossman is not, at this juncture, entitled to qualified immunity related to Cause II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Cause III: Failure to Train and/or Supervise\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Lieutenant Arlak and Chief Hall move to dismiss Cause III because a failure to train or supervise employees \"must amount to 'deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the [untrained employees] come into contact,\" which typically requires \"[a] pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees.\" (Doc. 16 at 10.) Defendants argue that \"[t]here are no allegations that Lieutenant Arlak or Chief Hall directly supervised Officer Grossman, had any direct responsibility for his training, or were aware of a need to train or supervise Officer Grossman on dealing with autistic\n   persons and were then deliberately indifferent to a need to train or supervise in that 'relevant respect.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   C.L. counters that the complaint \"contains detailed allegations regarding Grossman's long history of illegal actions, conduct, and behavior\" and that Lieutenant Arlak and Chief Hall \"actively protect[ed] Grossman, minimizing and covering-up Grossman's illegal behavior.\" (Doc. 21 at 7-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   To assert a \u00a7 1983 claim against Lieutenant Arlak and Chief Hall, C.L. must show the \"personal participation\" of each defendant.\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Although C.L. identifies various types of misconduct that Officer Grossman allegedly committed (Doc. 7 \u00b6\u00b6 90-99), none of these allegations concerns mistreatment of an individual with a disability, and only one concerns an arrest without probable cause and use of excessive force. (Doc. 7 \u00b6 96). In that latter instance, Officer Grossman was specifically admonished. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Consequently, C.L. has failed to allege a plausible claim that Lieutenant Arlak and Chief Hall failed to train or supervise Officer Grossman in a manner that would trigger liability under \u00a7 1983. And because C.L. hasn't alleged a constitutional violation, Lieutenant Arlak and Chief Hall are entitled to qualified immunity on Cause III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   C.L. similarly fails to allege that the City is liable under \u00a7 1983 for failing to train or supervise Officer Grossman. C.L. asserts the City failed to \"enforce proper and adequate training and supervision on interacting and dealing with individuals with disabilities....\" (Doc. 7 \u00b6 125.) But C.L. identifies no other instances where the City violated the rights of disabled individuals.

First, Defendants claim that ratification is a theory of municipal liability, \"not a basis to impose individual liability on a supervisor.\" (Doc. 16 at 11.) Moreover, Defendants argue that C.L.'s allegations \"do not show that Lieutenant Arlak or Chief Hall, individually, said or did anything deliberately to endorse unconstitutional behavior\" and that solely failing to discipline Officer Grossman is insufficient to show ratification.

C.L. also argues that ratification occurred when Lieutenant Arlak and Chief Hall \"approv[ed] of Grossman's actions, clear[ed] him of any improper conduct, fail[ed] to impose meaningful discipline, and order[ed] the BPD to defend Grossman in press conferences after C.L.'s illegal arrest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Further, C.L. contends that ratification was demonstrated by Lieutenant Arlak and Chief Hall's \"active protection of Grossman and their orders to other supervisors to 'quit targeting' Grossman when these supervisors attempted to impose discipline on him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As an initial matter, ratification of unconstitutional conduct appears to be both a theory of municipal and individual liability under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    Larez v.

Nor are Lieutenant Arlak or Chief Hall accused of enacting policies that encouraged unlawful arrests or the use of excessive force.

C.L. also contends that he has alleged his disability with specificity, pointing to, among other things, the allegations that autism\"substantially limits one or more of C.L.'s major life activities, including caring for himself, performing manual tasks, learning, concentrating, communicating, and interacting with others.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (quoting Doc. 7 \u00b6 148).) Finally, C.L. argues that he has stated a plausible claim under the ADA because Officer Grossman \"arrested C.L. because of conduct related to C.L.'s disability,\" specifically, by \"mistaking C.L.'s 'stimming' for drug use.\" (Doc. 21 at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court agrees with Defendants that the claim against Officer Grossman should be dismissed. \"The term public entity [as used in the ADA] does not include individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Voiles v.

The second factor is also satisfied. C.L. alleges that he told Officer Grossman \"I stim with this\" while holding a piece of string. (Doc. 7 \u00b6 38.) A reasonable jury could conclude that Officer Grossman \"should have known\" C.L. was disabled. Finally, a reasonable jury could conclude the encounter constituted an arrest, not a mere\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop, and that the arrest was because of C.L's disability-specifically, that Officer Grossman arrested C.L. because he misperceived C.L.'s stimming, an effect of his disability, as criminal activity.

They further contend the claim should be dismissed because \"there are no plausible facts to show Grossman's actions in briefly holding C.L. until back-up arrived were 'by reason of his disability,' or were a different response than other, similarly-situated arrestees would face.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.)

C.L. contends by not accommodating him after being informed he was autistic, Officer Grossman violated the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court concludes that C.L. hasn't alleged a plausible failure-to-accommodate claim and will thus dismiss Cause VI. It bears emphasizing that C.L.'s claims in Causes V and VI are alternative claims.
