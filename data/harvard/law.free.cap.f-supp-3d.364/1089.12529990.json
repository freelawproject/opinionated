Defendant RJN, Ex. 1. Prescriber's Choice and Sincerus are both owned by Florida-based Sincerus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; share resources, staff, leadership, and business efforts; have the same principal place of business; and the same CEO, Spencer Malkin (\"Malkin\"). Allergan SUF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6-7. Sincerus produces drugs; Prescriber's Choice markets Sincerus's drugs and makes them\n   available to physicians. Allergan SUF \u00b6 8; Declaration of Joseph Akrotirianakis (\"Akro. Decl.\") (Dkt. 95), Ex. 1 at 2848. Sincerus registered with the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") as an \"outsourcing facility\" under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\") in March 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Allergan SUF \u00b6 4. Sincerus has formulated, compounded, distributed, and sold drugs from 700 different drug formulations. Allergan SUF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prescriber's Choice has marketed the services of Sincerus. Declaration of Spencer Malkin (\"Malkin Decl.\") (Dkt. 115-1) at \u00b6 3. Prescriber's Choice has roughly 3,000 customers in 30 states to whom Sincerus has distributed their drugs. Allergan SUF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; Akro. Decl., Ex. 2 at 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Drug compounding\" is often regarded as the process of combining, mixing, or altering ingredients to create a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient. Allergan RJN, Ex. A. A drug may be compounded for a patient who cannot be treated with an FDA-approved medication, such as a patient who has an allergy to a certain dye and needs a medication to be made without it, or an elderly patient or a child who cannot swallow a tablet or capsule and needs a medicine in a liquid dosage form.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11100379\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/668/#p688\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Practitioners in hospitals, clinics, and other health care facilities sometimes provide compounded drugs to patients when an FDA-approved drug is not medically appropriate to treat them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11100379\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/668/#p688\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Compounding commonly occurs in pharmacies, although it may also occur in other settings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11100379\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/668/#p688\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The drugs Sincerus and Prescriber's Choice have produced, marketed, and distributed were intended to treat acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, melasma, alopecia, dermatitis, and fungus, among other conditions. Allergan SUF \u00b6 14. Defendants have produced, marketed, and distributed drugs containing the bulk drug substances\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dapsone, Ciclopirox Olamine, Acyclovir, Fluocinolone Acetonide, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydrocortisone, Tolnaftate, Tretinoin, Sulfar, Tazarotene, Sodium Sulfacetamide, and Spironolactone. Allergan SUF \u00b6 15. Only one drug used by Defendants (Magnesium Sulfate Injection) appears on FDA's drug shortage list. Allergan SUF \u00b6 21. The FDA has not found a \"clinical need\" for outsourcing facilities to use any bulk drug substances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Before July 2018, these bulk drug substances were not on the FDA \"Category 1\" list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. This list is described in further detail\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    fra.\n   </em>\n   The \"Category 1 list\" comprises drugs that the FDA is evaluating to determine whether there is a clinical need.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Allergan RJN, Ex. D. If there is a clinical need, the drugs may be used under the Section 503B statutory exemption.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As of September 7, 2017, Defendants were compounding, producing, and marketing drugs using bulk drug substances on FDA's Category 3 list, including Tolnaftate, Sulfur, and Sodium Sulfacetamide. Allergan SUF \u00b6 17. The FDA's Category 3 list comprises nominated substances that require more information before the FDA determines whether they belong in Category 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Allergan RJN, Ex. D. The parties dispute whether Sincerus continues to use any bulk drug substances on FDA's Category 3 list. Defendants' Statement of Genuine Disputes (\"Defendant SGD\") (Dkt. 117) \u00b6 18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Every one of the bulk drug substances utilized by Sincerus for compounding is obtained from an FDA-registered firm and each of the bulk drugs has an FDA-assigned National Drug Code number. Defendant SGD \u00b6 110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants promote their business through a sales force, marketing program, and sales and training materials that Malkin developed with other employees. Defendant SGD \u00b6 23. There is a standard format for the Prescriber's Choice sales pitch, although the initial sales presentation has been modified since early 2016 as some of the materials initially used are no longer relevant due to the changing health care landscape. Defendant SGD \u00b6 24; Declaration of Lawrence Silverman (\"Silverman Decl.\") (Dkt. 116), Ex. 4 at 88. Prescriber's Choice's sales consultants are trained on how to present the Prescriber's Choice platform to customers. Defendant SGD \u00b6 25. Prescriber's Choice sales consultants distribute sample advertisements to dermatology clinics that are its customers and work with the physicians to change or personalize the advertisements. Defendant SGD \u00b6 26; Arko. Decl., Ex. 1 at 27-28. One advertisement disseminated broadly to dermatology clinics that are Defendants' customers inform patients of the \"freedom to choose\" between a commercially available medication or Sincerus's customized drugs. Allergan SUF \u00b6 27; Arko Decl., Ex. 1 at 31-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The parties do not dispute that Defendants have promoted their business and drugs by representing to their customers that Defendants comply with the law, that it is legal for Sincerus to compound in large quantities, and that the business meets federal regulatory guidelines. Allergan SUF \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Akro. Decl., Ex. 31 at 661 (\"Is the model that Prescriber's Choice &amp; Sincerus FL follow compliant? Yes!\"). Specifically, Defendants have represented to their customers: \"The truth is that Sincerus FL is a 503B facility (one only has to check the FDA's website listing all registered 503B facilities to verify this) and the drugs compounded by a 503B facility do not have to go through the New Drug Application (or Abbreviated New Drug Application) process. The FDA expressly exempts drugs compounded by 503B facilities from being subject to this process.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 30. Prescriber's\n   Choice sales consultants have represented that the medications used in the formulations are FDA approved and \"All [Defendants'] prescription medications are FDA approved and are produced using only U.S. sourced FDA approved active ingredients.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants have also promoted their business and drugs by representing to their customers-including those who asked for reassurance or had questions about FDA compliance-that \"[t]o demonstrate compliance, Prescriber's Choice and Sincerus FL tasked one of the top international law firms, Ropes &amp; Gray, to analyze whether the business model comports with FDA regulations,\" and \"[t]he resulting written memorandum concludes that if your practice follows the model outlined, you are compliant.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36; Akro. Decl. Ex. 31. Further, Defendants have represented to customers that \"[a] general summary of the conclusions reached in the Ropes &amp; Gray memorandum are as follows: ... Compounding by the outsourcing facility for physician customers under the Prescriber's Choice platform meets the requirements of 503B.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On at least one occasion, a Presciber's Choice sales consultant stated to a customer that the Sincerus drugs are \"prepared in the FDA facility, Sincerus, so you have the supreme reassurance that the quality of the medication is made under CGMP manufacturing standards with federal oversight.\" Defendant SGD \u00b6 33; Akro. Decl., Ex. 26 at 601. Separately, a different Prescriber's Choice sales consultant represented to a customer that the Ropes &amp; Gray memorandum provides \"supreme reassurance that speaks about how Prescriber's Choice and their customers are complaint with both federal and state law.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 37; Akro. Decl., Ex. 62 at 879. A third Prescriber's Choice sales consultant represented to a customer that the \"whole platform has been vetted out and everything is perfectly legal\" as Sincerus is a \"FDA facility and everything we provide is the only way it is legal.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 38; Akro. Decl., Ex. 47 at 809.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On another occasion, the same Prescriber's Choice sales consultant represented to a different customer that Defendants \"have had over 400 independent healthcare attorneys from many states review our whole platform and they all recommend our platform.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 39; Akro. Decl., Ex. 46 at 805-06. One internal e-mail between Prescriber's Choice employees notes that \"I of course did explain to [the customer] that everything comes from our 503B facility and is FDA approved.\" Akro. Decl., Ex. 51 at 834.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants have also promoted the effectiveness of their drugs, including that \"[t]he unique combination of active and inactive ingredients has been selected to produce an outcome that is clinically superior and materially different to that which is commercially available.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The FDA does not \"accredit\" or \"approve\" Section 503B outsourcing facilities or pharmaceutical ingredients, although the FDA does register and inspect such facilities. Defendant SGD \u00b6\u00b6 51, 54, 56. Sincerus has been formally inspected by the FDA three times and submits all active pharmaceutical ingredients used to the FDA as part of statutory semiannual reports, and the FDA has never objected to or disputed the reported information. Defendant SGD \u00b6\u00b6 115, 117. It is \"slightly\n   inaccurate\" to describe a Section 503B outsourcing facility as \"FDA accredited\" as the FDA registers and inspects as but does not accredit or approve. Silverman Decl., Ex. 3 at 66. It is disputed whether the statement \"Defendants' drugs are FDA-approved\" is false, as the bulk drug substances used by Sincerus are all obtained from firms registered by the FDA and are active pharmaceutical ingredients of Section 505 approved drugs. Defendant SGD \u00b6 58. It is also disputed whether there is \"no reason to believe that Sincerus's drugs are superior to commercially available drugs.\" Defendant SGD \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Prescriber's Choice sales representatives have represented to customers that Defendants comply with the law because they knew that compliance with the law was an important issue to customers when they make a decision. Akro. Decl., Ex. 2 at 106-05. One of the reasons Defendants convey that the active pharmaceutical ingredients are FDA approved is because dermatologists are seeking safe medication. Akro. Decl., Ex. 6 at 66. Barret Malkin, Prescriber's Choice's National Director, told the sales team that Sincerus's status as a \"503B FDA Facility\" would provide \"even more assurance to patients due to the fact that they are generally familiar with the FDA.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Allergan's sales representatives have testified that dermatologists have switched from prescribing branded medications (such as Allergan's) to Prescriber's Choice's drugs. Allergan SUF \u00b6 77. It is disputed whether Prescriber's Choice and Sincerus are competitors of Allergan and have been competitors of Allergan at all times material to this action. Defendant SGD \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Allergan commissioned a survey of 202 dermatologists regarding their views on Allergan's medical dermatology products and the products of others, including Prescriber's Choice. Defendant SGD \u00b6 137. Allergan's final report on its survey about Prescriber's Choice reflects that 25 percent of physicians \"worry about the legality and tediousness of in-office physician dispensing\"; 27 percent of the respondents agreed with the statement \"I worry about the legality of in-office dispensing\"; 18% of the respondents said that \"state regulation/restriction concerns\" was a challenge with recommending or prescribing Prescriber's Choice's products; and 24 percent of dermatologists who had been visited by a Prescriber's Choice sales representative indicated that they had received \"Guidance with governmental regulations\" from Prescriber's Choice. Defendant SGD \u00b6\u00b6 140-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Recently, Allergan entered into a business acquisition agreement (\"Acquisition Agreement\") whereby Allergan Sales, LLC and APIL sold assets related to Aczone, Azelex, Cordran Tape, Tazorac, and Sarecycline. Defendant Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (\"Defendant DUF\") (Dkt. 89) \u00b6 2. Allergan USA, Inc. (the Plaintiff in this action) has a Supply Agreement with Almirall, Inc.'s (\"Amirall\") affiliate, Aqua Pharmaceuticals LLC (\"Aqua\"), through which Allergan has contracted to distribute Aczone and Tazorac in exchange for volume-based payments. Allergan Statement of Genuine Disputes (\"Allergan SGD\") (Dkt. 111-1) \u00b6 2. On September 20, 2018, Allergan Sales, LLC (\"Allergan Sales\") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell the dermatology product Rhofade to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Aclaris\"). Defendant DUF \u00b6 3. The agreement includes a provision that gives Allergan Sales an ongoing economic interest in Aclaris's sales of Rhofade and other products containing oxymetazoline as an active pharmaceutical ingredient in the form of earnout payments.

The Court briefly recounts the three key agreements at issue:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Almirall Acquisition Agreement:\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   On August 3, 2018, Allergan Sales, (Allergan's parent company) and Allergan Pharmaceuticals International Limited sold to Almirall certain assets relating to Aczone and Tazorac (FDA-approved acne drugs) and other drugs. Defendant DUF \u00b6 2; Declaration of Marc Forth (\"Forth Decl.\") (Dkt. 111-2) \u00b6 5. This agreement includes a contingent payment, whereby in the event Almirall's future sales of the products exceed a certain milestone, Almirall shall pay to Allergan Sales in 2022 an amount contingent upon those future sales, but capped at $ 100 million. Forth Decl. \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Supply Agreement:\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ancillary to the Almirall Acquisition Agreement is the Supply Agreement between Allergan (the Plaintiff) and Almirall's subsidiary (Aqua) through which Plaintiff has contracted to manufacture Aczone and Tazorac and to distribute those drugs to Aqua.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7; Forth Decl., Ex. A. Allergan continues to function as the distributor of Aczone and Tazorac, but has delegated its manufacturing duties to Allergan Sales to manufacture the drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Aclaris Acquisition Agreement:\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   And on October 15, 2018, Allergan Sales, LLC sold to Aclaris certain assets related to the drug Rhofade, a topical rosacea drug.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. This agreement includes a tiered earnout structure whereby Aclaris shall pay to Allergan Sales royalties on future sales of Rhofade.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Allergan Sales shall receive earnout payments on all sales starting October 15, 2018, and the earnout percentage increases upon certain sales reaching certain thresholds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The question presented is thus whether under the terms of these agreements, Allergan still has standing despite its parent company's decision to sell assets related to Aczone, Tazorac, and Rhofade, and where Allergan continues to (1) distribute Aczone and Tazorac under an exclusive Supply Agreement and (2) indirectly benefit from earnouts tied to the sales of these drugs. The Court agrees with Allergan that the agreements are conclusive evidence that Allergan continues to have standing to pursue declaratory and injunctive relief. First, because Allergan Sales continues to manufacture Aczone and Tazorac and Allergan continues to supply these drugs to Almirall's subsidiary, Aqua, there is no doubt that Defendants' alleged unlawful conduct would reduce sales of Aczone and Tazorac and thus reduce the volume of those drugs that Allergan distributes. Defendants accuse Allergan of attempting to \"retool\" the Complaint at the last moment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs. Mot. at 7. But in the Complaint, Allergan admits that \"[a]ffiliated Allergan entities manufacture Aczone, and Allergan then distributes Aczone to a network of authorized healthcare professional resellers.\" Compl. \u00b6 23. Thus an exclusive Supply Agreement whereby Allergan affiliates manufacture Aczone and Allergan then distributes the drug to Acqua should not come as a surprise to Defendants-the arrangement has narrowed to an exclusive distribution scheme, and future economic harm is therefore more exact, but this does not impact Allergan's standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   It is a closer call with respect to Rhofade, as the prospective relief is more attenuated. But the earnouts within the acquisition agreements with Aclaris and Almirall are sufficient to establish Allergan's standing, regardless of whether the earnouts are fed directly to Allergan Sales (Allergan's parent company). The parties need not amend the complaint to add Allergan Sales to address this standing argument. Under the agreements, Allergan continues to compete in the market as a distributor under the Supply Agreement and as an indirect recipient of earnouts. If there is a substantial risk that future injury will occur, it will harm Allergan. Allergan therefore has standing to pursue injunctive and declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court therefore DENIES Defendants' Motion for partial summary judgment and DENIES AS MOOT Allergan's Motion to Amend Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court does not wish to set a policy that limits the ability of the FDA to determine whether there is a clinical need for particular drugs while simultaneously allowing the compounding of certain drugs to meet health needs. The FDA has set forth a process whereby it receives\n   information to evaluate whether the nominated substances should appear on the Category 1 list.

Allergan SUF \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Akro. Decl., Ex. 31 at 661 (\"Is the model that Prescriber's Choice &amp; Sincerus FL follow compliant? Yes!\"). Some of these statements are not literally false. For example, Defendants have represented to their customers: \"The truth is that Sincerus FL is a 503B facility (one only has to check the FDA's website listing all registered 503B facilities to verify this) and the drugs compounded by a 503B facility do not have to go through the New Drug Application (or Abbreviated New Drug Application) process. The FDA expressly exempts drugs compounded by 503B facilities from being subject to this process.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 30. Defendants have also stated in a promotion: \"Is it legal for Sincerus FL to compound in large quantities? Yes!\" Allergan SUF 29. These statements are not literally false. As Allergan acknowledges, Congress permits outsourcing facilities to produce drugs on a larger scale under certain circumstances to meet patient needs. Allergan Mot. at 5. Sincerus did not make a literally false statement by describing itself as a 503B facility and noting that Congress has carved out such an exception for compounders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   But there is a difference between (1) describing to customers the FDCA's 503B exception and (2) representing to customers compliance with that exception or general FDA approval. While Sincerus may currently produce drugs in compliance with the FDA Interim Policy, there is no dispute of fact that the company used drugs that were not on the FDA Interim Policy's Category 1 list.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , Section IV(B)(2). And even compliance with the FDA Interim Policy cannot be equated with \"FDA approval.\" The FDA instituted and is following a process by which it determines whether there is a clinical need for outsourcing facilities to produce drugs using certain bulk drug substances. It is literally false for a company to represent that a compounder is \"FDA approved\" during this period of regulatory evaluation, especially when the compounder is not even complying with FDA's interim guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   It is true that the FDA inspects outsourcing facilities like Sincerus according to a risk-based schedule. Allergan RJN, Ex. A. Facilities that register with FDA as outsourcing facilities under section 503B are primarily overseen by FDA and inspected by FDA accordingly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But falling within the sphere of FDA enforcement does not equate to FDA \"approval.\" The FDA Interim Policy makes this clear. The introduction of the guideline provides that \"[i]n general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.\" Allergan RJN, Ex. D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Despite not producing drugs that are on the drug shortage or clinical need lists, Prescriber's Choice sales consultants have represented that the medications \"are FDA approved.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6\u00b6 43-44. Defendants have also promoted their business and drugs by representing to their customers-including those who asked for reassurance or had questions about FDA compliance-that \"[t]o demonstrate compliance, Prescriber's Choice and Sincerus FL tasked one of the top international law firms, Ropes &amp; Gray, to analyze whether the business model comports with FDA regulations,\" and \"[t]he resulting written memorandum concludes that if your practice follows the model outlined, you are compliant.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36; Akro. Decl. Ex. 31. Further, Defendants have represented to customers that \"[a] general summary of the conclusions reached in the Ropes &amp; Gray memorandum are as follows: ... Compounding by the outsourcing facility for physician customers under the Prescriber's Choice platform meets the requirements of 503B.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   On at least one occasion, a Presciber's Choice sales consultant stated to a customer that the Sincerus drugs are \"prepared in the FDA facility, Sincerus, so you have the supreme reassurance that the quality of the medication is made under CGMP manufacturing standards with federal oversight.\" Defendant SGD \u00b6 33; Akro. Decl., Ex. 26 at 601. Separately, a different Prescriber's Choice sales consultant represented to a customer that the Ropes &amp; Gray memorandum provides \"supreme reassurance that speaks about how Prescriber's Choice and their customers are complaint with both federal and state law.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 37; Akro. Decl., Ex. 62 at 879. A third Prescriber's Choice sales consultant represented to a customer that the \"whole platform has been vetted out and everything is perfectly legal\" as Sincerus is a \"FDA facility and everything we provide is the only way it is legal.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 38; Akro. Decl., Ex. 47 at 809.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   On another occasion, the same Prescriber's Choice sales consultant represented to a different customer that Defendants \"have had over 400 independent healthcare attorneys from many states review our whole platform and they all recommend our platform.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 39; Akro. Decl., Ex. 46 at 805-06. One internal e-mail between Prescriber's Choice employees notes that \"I of course did explain to [the customer] that everything comes from our 503B facility and is FDA approved.\" Akro. Decl., Ex. 51 at 834.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Again, a 503B model may be \"perfectly legal.\" Congress enacted two specific exceptions that permit 503B facilities to use bulk drug substances: to produce a drug\n   that appears on the FDA's drug shortage list or where the FDA has found a clinical need for outsourcing facilities to produce drugs using a given bulk drug substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 353b(a)(2)(A). But this does not mean that the drugs produced under the 503B exception are \"FDA approved\" and it does not mean that the outsourcing facility is in compliance with the other conditions of Section 503B or FDA interim guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   At least before July 2018, Sincerus was not compliant. The company used drugs that were not on the FDA drug shortage list, the clinical need list, or the Category 1 list. Only Magnesium Sulfate Injection appears on the FDA's drug shortage list. Allergan SUF \u00b6 21. None of the drugs produced by Defendants is on the clinical need list; indeed, the FDA has yet to identify any bulk drug substance for which there is a clinical need for use by outsourcing facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. And compounded drugs are not FDA-approved. Allergan RJN, Ex. A. This means that FDA does not verify the safety or effectiveness of compounded drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is more than \"slightly inaccurate\" (as Defendants contend) to describe a Section 503B outsourcing facility as \"FDA accredited\" as the FDA registers and inspects but does not accredit or approve. Silverman Decl., Ex. 3 at 66. And that the bulk drug substances used by Sincerus are all obtained from firms registered by the FDA and are active pharmaceutical ingredients of Section 505 approved drugs does not alter the analysis. Defendant SGD \u00b6 58. The fact that Defendants' products contain drugs approved in other drugs does not mean Defendants' products are FDA approved. If that were the case, there would be no need for the FDA interim process determining whether such drugs should fall under the 503B exemption as a clinical necessity. There is therefore no material dispute of fact that Sincerus representatives made literally false statements to customers by suggesting that they were legally compliant with the 503B requirements and were \"FDA approved.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This conclusion does not apply to statements regarding drug superiority. Defendants have also promoted the effectiveness of their drugs, such as that \"[t]he unique combination of active and inactive ingredients has been selected to produce an outcome that is clinically superior and materially different to that which is commercially available.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 49. There is no doubt that such drugs can improve patient outcome and provide drugs that may otherwise be unavailable, for example if a patient has a specific allergy to a type of medication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Allergan RJN, Ex. A. Outsourcing facilities can give doctors more flexibility to decide what to prescribe.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Allergan's arguments that such statements are literally false because there is \"no reason to believe that the ingredients ... are of any greater purity\" is unavailing. Allergan Mot. at 6. There is least a dispute of fact as to whether the statements regarding superiority of the drugs are literally false where the drugs may allow a patient relief where she cannot tolerate a more traditional prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Because the statements regarding FDA approval and legal compliance are literally false, there is a rebuttable presumption of actual deception. Regardless, the undisputed facts make clear that the legality of Sincerus's operation was material to Prescriber's Choice's customers. Prescriber's Choice sales representatives have represented to customers that Defendants comply with the law because they knew that compliance with the law was an important issue to customers when they make a decision. Akro. Decl., Ex. 2 at 106-05. One of the reasons Defendants convey that the active pharmaceutical ingredients are FDA approved is because dermatologists are seeking safe medication. Akro. Decl., Ex. 6 at 66. Malkin, Prescriber's Choice's National Director, told the sales team that Sincerus's status as a \"503B FDA Facility\" would provide \"even more assurance to patients due to the fact that they are generally familiar with the FDA.\" Allergan SUF \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Indeed, some of the false commercial promotions were made in direct follow-up to customer questions about quality and FDA compliance. One doctor sent an email stating that he had concerns about the quality of Prescriber's Choice product, specifically that he had heard about a patient who used the ciclopirox compound that \"ate through her skin on the toes.\" Akro. Decl., Ex. 23 at 586. In follow-up correspondence, the Prescriber's Choice sales consultant stated, \"The quality of the medication is made under the most strict regulatory standards. We not only have to meet the federal regulatory standards but also state standards. We meet and exceed all of these from every angle and this is something we do not take lightly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 584. This correspondence was sent in February 2017, when Sincerus admits it used drugs that were not on the FDA Category 1 list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Separately, a director of operations for a cosmetic dermatology clinic sent a sales representative an email asking about the legality of a numbing cream. Akro. Decl., Ex. 66 at 904. The sales consultant responded that \"[a]ll our practices meet and exceed BOTH STATE and FEDERAL guidelines. Our process is 100% compliant[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 903 (capitalization in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Defendants largely rely on a survey conducted by Allergan before they filed this action to argue that statements regarding legality are not material to experienced customers familiar with FDA and its policies. Defs. Opp'n at 14. But the Court views this survey as confirmation that customers did in fact consider the legality of Sincerus's operations. According to the survey, about 24% of dermatologists visited by Prescriber's Choice sales representatives indicated that they received guidance with governmental regulations. Defs. DUF \u00b6 144. And 27% responded that they agreed with the statement, \"I worry about the legality of in-office dispensing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141.

Allergan argues that Defendant's understanding of the FDUTPA is based on a superseded version of the statute that limited recovery to consumers. Allergan Reply at 23. According to Allergan, the Florida legislature amended the statute to permit any injured person to sue for damages and that this replacement of the word \"consumer\" with \"person\" demonstrates an intent to allow a broader base of complainants, including competitors, to seek damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.

Allergan Mot. at 24. Defendants argue that there is evidence that Allergan had an official policy to spread doubt about Prescriber's Choice and Sincerus, and that Allergan coordinated with its competitors to jointly spread that doubt. Defs. Opp'n at 16. Allergan argues that because Prescriber's Choice did violate 503B and was at least using drugs not on the Category 1 list before July 2018, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , it follows that the alleged statements cannot be false and thus cannot be the basis for liability under the UCL and Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Court agrees that spreading doubt about the legality of a company that is not complying with the FDA Interim Policy cannot give rise to a valid claim under the Lanham Act. But there is enough evidence presented to the Court to suggest that Allergan sales representatives went beyond the mere spreading of doubt. True, Defendants point to two sales presentations that use the language \"plant the seed of doubt\" among dermatologists about Prescriber's Choice and compounding. Defs. SGD \u00b6 133. But according to Defendants, documents show that Allergan worked alongside competitors Galderma and Valeant to \"shut Prescriber's Choice out of St. Louis.\" Defs. Opp'n at 17; Defs. SGD 136.

It is a close call, but in viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant Defendants, a reasonable jury could determine that Allergan violated the UCL and Lanham Act. Defendants have pointed to enough evidence of a defamatory campaign that stretches beyond the mere spreading of doubt about a company who is not complying with the FDA Interim Policy. Again, the burden is flipped for these counterclaims because Allergan is moving for summary judgment, not Defendants.

Decl., Ex. 1 at 58-59 (\"Q: Have you ever [used Desonide]? A: I believe at one point we did, yes. Q: Do you know when you stopped? A: I don't.\"). Subsequent testimony regarding Nystatin and Kojic acid does not clearly elicit when Sincerus used the drugs to compound.

Defs. Reply at 7-9. The Court denies this objection. Defendants have not requested additional depositions in light of the production of the Supply Agreement, but may make such a request before trial. Regardless, Marc Forth testified that Allergan will continue to provide manufacturing services.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7. Evidence that Allergan continues to distribute Aczone and Tazorac should not be excluded on the basis of a failure to disclose.
