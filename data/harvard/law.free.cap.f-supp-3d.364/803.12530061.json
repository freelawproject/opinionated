J.A. has been diagnosed with Down Syndrome and is eligible for special education with Smith County under the category of Developmental Delay. (Doc. No. 7-2 at 1.) J.A. entered the Smith County School System in 2017-2018 calendar year, and discussions between B.P. and Smith County regarding an individualized education program (\"IEP\") began in April 2017. (Doc. No. 6 at 202.) J.A.'s formal IEP meeting was conducted on May 19, 2017, and, at that meeting, the parties agreed that the IEP would be revisited after the first nine weeks of the school year to determine if adjustment was necessary. (Doc. No. 38 at 2.) Thereafter, J.A. was placed in a regular education classroom at New Middleton Elementary School (\"New Middleton\") and began preschool there on August 7, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 25, 2017, the parties held a follow-up IEP meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) J.A.'s difficulties with his placement were discussed at this meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For example, it was reported that J.A. had difficulty with the overwhelming stimuli of the classroom, would roam the school, lick furniture and other students, and was generally unable to control his behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Smith County proposed moving J.A. to a comprehensive development class (\"CDC\"), a special education class comprised of both disabled and non-disabled students, located at Carthrage Elementary School (\"Carthage\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) B.P., J.A.'s mother, did not agree with the proposed change in placement and requested that J.A. be provided with a one-on-one aide in the New Middleton classroom so that his behavior could be monitored and improved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Smith County declined to offer J.A. a one-on-one aide in the regular classroom environment, determining that it would be too restrictive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   J.A. continued his placement in the regular classroom at New Middleton, and another IEP meeting was held on November 20, 2017, during which Smith County again recommended J.A. be moved to the CDC class at Carthage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) B.P. reiterated her objection to such a placement because New Middleton was closer and would offer an opportunity for J.A. to imitate the other, non-disabled students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) B.P. again requested that Smith County provide a one-on-one aide, but Smith County resisted, contending that the aide would only help in preventing J.A.'s bad behaviors rather than facilitate his learning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At\n   this meeting, Alecia Talbott, the parents' advocate, recommended that J.A. (1) receive a functional behavior assessment (\"FBA\"); and (2) the school implement a Behavior Intervention Plan (\"BIP\"), with reevaluation in February or March. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shortly thereafter, in early December 2017, B.P. viewed a Facebook video, showing J.A.'s classmates performing a dance routine while J.A., not being assisted by the teacher in participating, stood and watched. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) As a result, B.P. withdrew J.A. from New Middleton. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) B.P then filed a due process complaint on J.A.'s behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) At the required resolution meeting, Smith County stated that they were willing to proceed with a FBA, BIP, and other training, but reiterated that: (1) the Carthage elementary staff was more highly trained and experienced; (2) J.A. would receive more attention at the Carthage CDC class; and (3) a one-on-one aide would be too restrictive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Smith County \"drew a line\" on placement and the request for a one-on-one aide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a result, B.P. requested a due process hearing before an ALJ. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 6.) At the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ ruled in favor of Smith County, finding that the November IEP, recommending placement in the Carthage CDC, did not violate J.A.'s right to free and appropriate public education (\"FAPE\"). (Doc. No. 7-4 at 4-10.) The ALJ concluded that: (1) the one-to-one aide would help manage J.A.'s behavior but would not provide additional educational benefit or decrease the classroom stimuli; (2) placement at Carthage was a reasonable alternative; and (3) Smith County based its new placement on available information and was willing to conduct additional evaluations (the FBA) but was unable to because of J.A.'s withdrawal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) The ALJ also determined that, because the IEP was within 17 days of expiration at the time of the hearing, relief for the disputed IEP was limited to completion of the FBA (agreed to by Smith County) so that a proper placement for J.A. could be determined for the upcoming school year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.P., on behalf of J.A., appealed the ALJ's decision, and the Magistrate Judge held a supplemental hearing. (Doc. No. 38 at 17-23.) After the evidentiary hearing, the Magistrate Judge entered a 48-page R &amp; R, recommending that J.A.'s previously filed Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (Doc. No. 7) be granted and that J.A. be placed in kindergarten at New Middleton with a paraprofessional properly trained in dealing with Down Syndrome children. The Magistrate Judge also recommended that Smith County be required to conduct a FBA and implement a BIP for J.A. (Doc. No. 38 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Smith County has filed objections to the R &amp; R, which are detailed below. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 42.) Having considered the matter\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   as required by Rule 72 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including the record before this Court and the one developed during the administrative proceedings, the Court finds that the R &amp; R appropriately resolves the issues presented and, as such, it will be adopted. Because the R &amp; R will be adopted, the objections thereto (Doc. No. 42) will be overruled, and J.A.'s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. No. 7) will be granted. Before discussing the specific objections to the Magistrate Judge's recommended resolution, however, a little background on the IDEA helps place Smith County's arguments in perspective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Background of the IDEA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The IDEA \"offers federal funds to States in exchange for a commitment: to furnish a 'free appropriate public education'...to all children with certain physical\n   or intellectual disabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Fry v.

Smith County identifies the \"appropriateness\" of the Magistrate Judge's placement determination as the basis for its objections. However, the gravamen of Smith County's objections is geared towards the Magistrate Judge's alleged lack of deference to \"the opinions of professionals who have spent five days a week with J.A. for nine weeks, as opposed to a run-in, run-out observation and paid-for opinion.\" (Doc. No. 42 at 7.) Smith County argues that the Magistrate Judge concludes that \"what is best for J.A. is to be determined by someone who has been hired to render an opinion for the parents, and that forty-five days of hand on experience with J.A. is not relevant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Moreover, Smith County asserts that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Magistrate Brown did not, in fact, give the local educators nor [ALJ] Summers' \"greater deference\" to the substantive aspects of the IEP proposed by [Smith County]. Judge Summers heard the witnesses who had worked with J.A., and who had discussed his program with his mother, showed her the classroom at Carthage Elementary heard J.A.'s parents testify, and she considered that same law and the same criteria for making the judgment as did Magistrate Brown. In the process the \"greater deference\" disappeared.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) The remainder of Smith County's filing challenges the Magistrate Judge's decision generally and argues that placement in the CDC class at Carthage would provide J.A. with \"the best of both worlds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-20.) Smith County requests that the Court: (1) reinstitute ALJ Summers' decision; (2) order that J.A. be returned to Smith County to complete the FBA and BIP; and (3) order the parties to reconvene to determine J.A.'s abilities so that appropriate personnel can determine an appropriate IEP.

Importantly, as in\n   <em>\n    L.H.\n   </em>\n   , Smith County is not arguing that J.A.'s expert was unqualified, which could be framed as a legal challenge, rather, Smith County is arguing that her testimony was unpersuasive considering the other testimony, which is a challenge to the Magistrate Judge's weighing of the evidence and determination of the facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518251\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/779/#p788\">\n    900 F.3d at 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At bottom, Smith Count argues that the Magistrate Judge should have deferred to the opinions of Smith County's teachers and staff because they had spent far more time with J.A. and were more familiar with his abilities, behaviors, and limitations, so they knew best how he should be educated. In\n   <em>\n    L.H.\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit specifically confronted this issue and explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   If the law were that a court must defer to the opinions of those who spend the most time with the student and presumably know him best, then there would be no place for experts. Moreover, parents could never prevail because the student's teachers will always spend more time with the student or know the student better than the parents' hired experts. On the other hand, the parents spend more time with the student and know the student better than any teacher. Taking [this] argument to this ultimate end, the district court would actually defer to the student's parents, who surely know the student the best, regardless of any expertise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518251\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/779/#p788\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the Magistrate Judge recounted testimony from all of the witnesses, both lay (i.e., B.P., Smith County officials and experts) and expert (Dr. Kathleen Whitbread, J.A.'s expert).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-38.) The Magistrate Judge also considered the ALJ's oral and written opinion and provided a detailed explanation for his divergent determinations.

State Administrative Law Judge's Oral Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ issued an oral decision from the bench, stating, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   The issue that we are addressing is educating JA in the least restrictive environment with the most educational benefit.... And I don't think there's any real disagreement between the parties that the placement at NMS, without some sort of modification, was not working, so something needed to change....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   The petitioners were essentially asking for the placement to remain the same, with the addition of a one-to-one aide. I mean, that accomplished leaving JA in a regular classroom with predominantly non-disabled children, would provide him help with his behaviors. The downside that I could see from that placement was the absence of a special ed teacher, a potentially chaotic environment that may have been contributing to some of his behaviors, and having an adult with him throughout the entire school day could potentially be a more restrictive placement than the alternative. And also, recognizing that a child with an adult caretaker doesn't really help him blend with his classmates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   The alternative that was offered by the school system was the integrated classroom at Carthage Elementary School, where admittedly, there was -- while some, as we have been referring to them, typical children, it was predominantly children with disabilities. But my understanding is that there was still a regular curriculum, more teachers for fewer children, so while JA would not be -- have a one-to-one aide, there would be more adults for fewer children, and JA would not be singled out in that classroom as the child that needed the specific adult caretaker. You have a special ed teacher with proven results, a more controlled environment. But also, possibly - well, certainly, a more restrictive environment than where he was at NMS....[C]ertainly the petitioners have suggested, and I know that their expert would testify, that the alternative with the one-to-one aide would be better and the least restrictive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   And in weighing all of this information, I cannot conclude that the school system's alternative, it violates the IDEA. I think it's a tossup, based upon the criteria that I just iterated. I don't think it's, again, in violation of the IDEA. I think it's a reasonable alternative to educating JA in the least restrictive environment available to Smith County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   And based upon the testimony that I have heard this morning, and the fact that the appeal was of this current IEP, which we are still in, although for a limited time, I am going to order the functional behavioral assessment, upon JA's return to the school system, obviously. I think that until he's actually enrolled in Smith County, I don't -- I wouldn't assume that there is any impediment to him being enrolled today. And whether or not there's a limitation on getting that done -- the functional behavioral assessment -- in the next 17 days, at least in sufficient time for decisions to be made about the next school year, which would include whether or not he is reenrolled in Pre-K or moves on to kindergarten. I'm not going to make that decision. I think that smarter people than me should be making that decision with the necessary additional information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   I'm also not going to order a one-to-one aide. I think until the functional behavioral assessment is completed and there's an opportunity to review those results and a determination is made -- I understood from Mr. Swann that, you know, behaviors could be related to the size of the classroom and the stimulation in that classroom, or there may be other issues that could be addressed with an aide. And until we have that information, I think it's premature to make a decision about where JA should be educated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at pp. 318-321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    8.

Defendant agreed to conduct a functional behavior assessment on J.A., but after his placement at CES.

Defendant never provided J.A. with a one-on-one aide. Defendant maintains that J.A.'s proper placement should be in the special education classroom at CES. J.A. also remains eligible for and interested in enrollment in the school district. Accordingly, based upon this record and recognizing the reality that administrative and judicial review of an IEP will not usually be complete until a year after an IEP has expired, the Magistrate Judge concludes that this action is not moot as the issue of mainstreaming will remain in dispute and therefore capable of repetition, yet evading review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Here, the record reflects that Emmerson Stockton, the director of special education, stated that no student in Smith County had a full day aide and that Eric Swann, Smith County's school psychologist, stated that the District was \"100% on board\" with an FBA and a behavior plan and open to training, but that a line would be drawn on placement and a one-on-one aide, thus refusing to consider the use of a paraprofessional as being too restrictive. Swann also testified that he had never worked with a Down Syndrome child who had a one-on-one aide in a regular education classroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   However, Dr. Whitbread testified that the person who collects the data showing the events which trigger a Down Syndrome child's behaviors is often the paraprofessional. Wendy Cond admitted that there was not any data at the IEP meeting as to how J.A. would perform with a one-on-one aide. Thus, the failure to even consider incorporating the use of a paraprofessional with an FBA would limit the collection of any data Plaintiffs could have collected and produced in order to change the District's determination that a one-on-one aide would be too restrictive. This predetermination not to consider using a paraprofessional because the District believed it was too restrictive amounted to a procedural violation of the IDEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Accordingly, for these reasons, the Magistrate Judge concludes that Defendant committed a procedural violation that infringed upon Plaintiffs' ability to participate in the IEP process, which resulted in substantive harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

(Docket Entry No. 36, at 36-37). \"In matters alleging a procedural violation, a hearing officer may find that a child did not receive a free appropriate public education only if the procedural inadequacies significantly impeded the parents' opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process regarding the provision of a free appropriate public education to the parents child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(E)(ii)(II). Plaintiffs cite the District's repeated use of the term \"CDC\" to describe J.A.'s proposed placement at CES. Hembree and Barry Smith testified that the use of the term \"CDC\" to describe Kellye Martin's class was improper. However, the record reflects that the IEP provided that J.A. would be placed in an integrated self-contained pre-K at CES, that J.A.'s mother visited CES with Smith to observe how the classroom worked, and Hembree testified that the District made it clear to J.A.'s mother that CES was an integrated classroom with typical peers or non-disabled children. Plaintiffs did not present any evidence showing that J.A.'s parents were actually confused by the terminology. While the record reflects a technical violation, Plaintiffs have failed to show that this violation significantly impeded the parents' opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process or denied them from meaningful participation in the IEP process. Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge concludes that this claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Substantive FAPE Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Plaintiffs assert a claim for the denial of a FAPE for an inappropriate IEP. Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that (1) the IEP lacks meaningful academic goals; (2) it lacks appropriate behavioral supports; and (3) it lacks the support of a paraprofessional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Lack of Academic Goals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In providing a FAPE, the IDEA \"demands more\" than providing \"merely more than\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   \" educational benefit to a child with a disability.\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1001. \"It requires an educational program reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the chil's circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   The IEP must aim to enable the child to make progress. After all, the essential function of an IEP is to set out a plan for pursuing academic and functional advancement. This reflects the broad purpose of the IDEA, an \"ambitious\" piece of legislation enacted \"in response to Congress' perception that a majority of handicapped children in the United States 'were either totally excluded from schools or [were] sitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when they were old enough to \"drop out.\" ' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 999 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The parties stipulated that the pre-K curriculum consists of reading, writing, language, math, science, social, studies, creative arts, and PE/health. However, J.A.'s May and November 2017 IEPs did not contain academic goals, but mainly contained fine motor and gross motor skills goals. Although J.A.'s IEP plan did not contain any academic goals for math, science or social studies, Cond testified that she tried to teach J.A. math, social studies, and science. However, there was nothing in the I.E.P. for charting J.A.'s rate of progress in these subjects. Swann testified that the importance of including measurable goals in the IEP is that the goals provide a baseline on how to measure progress. Dr. Whitbread testified that the IEP for a child in pre-K should have some sort of reading or math goal, which would be consistent with the standards in Tennessee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The IDEA requires that an IEP include \"a statement of measurable annual goals, including academic and functional goals\" that enable the disabled \"child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum\" and that \"meet each of the child's other educational needs that result from the child's disability.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201414\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A)(i)(II).

In fact, at the administrative hearing, the ALJ stated, \"I don't think there's any real disagreement between the parties that the placement at NMS, without some sort of modification, was not working, so something needed to change.\" (Docket Entry No. 6-2, at p. 318).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   As the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   , \"[w]hen a child is fully integrated in the regular classroom, as the [IDEA] prefers, what that typically means is providing a level of instruction reasonably calculated to permit advancement through the general curriculum.\" 137 S.Ct. at 1000 (footnote omitted).

(Docket Entry No. 7-2, at \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The record reflects that the special education teacher at NMES, who worked with J.A. for 30 minutes a day, helped J.A. improve his behaviors. Cond, however, believed a one-on-one aide would be too restrictive, although the District lacked data showing how J.A. would perform with a one-on-one aide. The District believed that J.A. needed something more because an aide would only help in preventing bad behaviors rather than helping him to learn. At the resolution meeting, Stockton stated that Smith County did not provide a full time aide to any child. Swann testified that he had never worked with a Down Syndrome child who had a one-on-one aide in a regular education classroom. However, Hembree testified that some children in Smith County have been provided a full time aide. Hembree stated that she had never given special education supports or services to a child with Down Syndrome in a general education classroom and her experience in teaching children with Down Syndrome was limited to teaching them in a special education classroom. Smith testified that the District could provide a full time aide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The record also shows that the District's teachers lacked training to deal with Down Syndrome children. Talbott testified that a paraprofessional's role is to help the child be as independent and as successful as possible. Talbott offered to provide such training to the District for free. Further, the ALJ ordered the District to participate in the training offered by the Down Syndrome Association, and since then teachers have received such training. Dr. Whitbread testified that it was possible that a paraprofessional would be too restrictive in a general education classroom, but that if a paraprofessional had proper training then it would be inappropriate to assume that a paraprofessional would be too restrictive for J.A., adding that very young children with Down syndrome often need an extra person in the classroom. Smith testified that a full-time aide could be set up for J.A. at NMES.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    I.L. through Taylor v. Knox Cty.

The perception that a segregated institution is academically superior for a handicapped child may reflect no more than a basic disagreement with the mainstreaming concept. Such a disagreement is not, of course, any basis for not following the Act's mandate. In a case where the segregated facility is considered superior, the court should determine whether the services which make that placement superior could be feasibly provided in a non-segregated setting. If they can, the placement in the segregated school would be inappropriate under the Act. Framing the issue in this manner accords the proper respect for the strong preference in favor of mainstreaming while still realizing the possibility that some handicapped children simply must be educated in segregated facilities either because the handicapped child would not benefit from mainstreaming, because any marginal benefits received from mainstreaming are far outweighed by the benefits gained from services which could not feasibly be provided in the non-segregated setting, or because the handicapped child is a disruptive force in the non-segregated setting. Cost is a proper factor to consider since excessive spending on one handicapped child deprives other handicapped children. Cost is no defense, however, if the school district has failed to use its funds to provide a proper continuum of alternative placements for handicapped children. The provision of such alternative placements benefits all handicapped children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <em>\n    Roncker On Behalf of Roncker v.

Although his goals were heavy on motor skills, J.A. was making appropriate progress on them and was anticipated to complete them by the end of the year. There is no data showing that J.A. could not benefit from regular education with a paraprofessional and behavior supports as the District failed to provide any of these. Dr. Whitbread testified that J. A. operated the augmentative and alternative communication device very well and was able to communicate with it. Based upon J.A.'s educational record that she reviewed, her experience with children with Down syndrome, and her meeting with J.A., and all of the videos she watched of J.A., Dr. Whitbread opined that J.A. could benefit from a regular education classroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   As to the second exception, \"any marginal benefits received from mainstreaming are far outweighed by the benefits gained from services which could not feasibly be provided in the non-segregated setting,\" Dr. Whitbread opined that the composition of the classroom at CES would not provide a typical school experience and would not be beneficial as the makeup of the classroom would not mimic the percentages of disabled and nondisabled children in the community. Dr. Whitbread also believed that the class being made up of different children each day would be confusing to a Down Syndrome child. According to Dr. Whitbread, any benefit in a smaller classroom could be duplicated in a regular education classroom through small groups or through \"pull out\" or \"push in\" sessions. Dr. Whitbread testified that one of the main goals of inclusion in general education classrooms is so that a Down Syndrome child can learn to socialize and conform behavior by observing nondisabled children. Dr. Whitbread explained that based upon her experience and significant research \"putting children in settings where there are primarily children with disabilities results in poor outcomes in almost every area that we measure, so [sic] academically and socially.\" The Magistrate Judge further notes that the ALJ found that placement at CES did not \"far outweigh,\" NMES, describing the issue as a \"tossup\" and finding placement at CES a \"reasonable alternative.\" Accordingly, based upon the foregoing, the Magistrate Judge concludes that the second exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Lastly, whether \"the handicapped child is a disruptive force in the non-segregated setting,\" the record shows that the District did not provide J.A. with an FBA and a BIP. The ALJ did order the District to conduct such an assessment, albeit after J.A. had disenrolled, and further ordered training to be provided to the District's teachers. Dr. Whitbread testified that she could not determine what caused J.A.'s behaviors by just looking at Cond's behavioral log because the log only described the behavior without providing the \"before data and after data.\" Dr. Whitbread testified that without a functional behavior assessment and behavior intervention plan a school would not know the \"why of the behavior\" and therefore could not move forward to change the behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   As stated previously, the IDEA has a strong preference for mainstreaming to \"the\n   <em>\n    maximum extent appropriate\n   </em>\n   \" and that disabled children will be separated \"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when the nature or severity of the disability ... is such that\n   <em>\n    education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services\n   </em>\n   cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(A).

Dr. Whitbread testified that one of the main goals of inclusion in general education classrooms is so that a disabled child can learn to socialize and conform behavior by observing nondisabled children; that without a paraprofessional and a behavior intervention plan at NMES J.A. would not have what he needed to be successful; and based upon her experience and significant research, placing children in settings where there are primarily disabled children results in poor outcomes in almost every area measured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   There is no showing that the issuance of an injunction will cause substantial harm to others. Providing J.A. behavioral supports and a properly trained paraprofessional would assist his education in the regular education classroom and help him conform his behavior. The ALJ previously ordered the District to provide training to its teachers and to conduct an FBA. Smith testified that a full-time aide could be set up for J.A. at NMES. Dr. Whitbread testified that she would make herself available to answer any questions any teachers may have regarding Down Syndrome children and J.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Finally, the Magistrate Judge concludes that the public interest would be served by the issuance of the injunction as Swann and Hembree testified that they had never seen a Down Syndrome child included with supports or services in the regular education classroom in Smith County for the majority of the day. Moreover, an injunction would further the goal of the IDEA to address \"[t]he perception that a segregated institution is academically superior for a handicapped child [which] may reflect no more than a basic disagreement with the\n   mainstreaming concept,\" and that \"[s]uch a disagreement is not, of course, any basis for not following the [IDEA's] mandate.\"\n   <em>\n    Roncker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844643\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/700/1058/#p1063\">\n    700 F.2d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Therefore, the Magistrate Judge concludes that J.A. should be placed at NMES with a properly trained paraprofessional and for the District to conduct an FBA and implement a BIP. Further, based upon Dr. Whitbread's testimony that because J.A. is now six years old (and will be seven in August 2019) and research shows that there is no benefit to holding Down Syndrome children back at the pre-K level and, because most children with Down Syndrome have delayed learning and therefore developing early literacy skills as early as possible is important, the Magistrate Judge concludes that J.A. should be placed in kindergarten rather than repeat pre-K.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
