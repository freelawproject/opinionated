(Dkt. 1). In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs assert a Title IX discrimination claim (Count XVI) against the Board on behalf of both Jane Doe I and II and assert the following state-law claims against the Board and/or Cruz: sexual battery (Counts I and IX) and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Counts VII and XV) against Cruz; failure to supervise (Counts III and XI), negligence (Counts IV and XII), willful and wanton conduct (Counts V and XIII), negligent retention (Counts VI and XIV), and negligent failure to control the conduct of Cruz (Count VIII) against the Board; and negligent infliction of emotional distress (Counts II and X) against both the Board and Cruz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jane Doe I also asserts a claim for false imprisonment (Count XVII) against Cruz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Board moved to dismiss all claims asserted against it pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Dkt. 42). For the following reasons, the Board's Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 42) is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint and are accepted as true for purposes of the Board's Motions to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Law Office of Terrence Kennedy, Jr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411932\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/709/826/#p827\">\n    709 F. App'x 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 827 (7th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Casino Cruz was employed by the Board for nearly 20 years, first at Roberto Clemente High School (RCHS) from 1999 until February 2017 and then at Farragut High School from August 2017 until June 2018. (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 118, 126). During his tenure at RCHS, Clemente served as security guard, assistant dean, swim instructor, swim team coach and volleyball coach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21). In these roles, Cruz regularly engaged in \"grooming\" or sexually inappropriate behavior with female students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). Cruz's various positions of authority, in particular his power to discipline students and make decisions regarding the extent of their participation in sporting activities, generally prevented students from confronting Cruz about his inappropriate conduct and/or disclosing such conduct to school officials or parents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25). Despite this, by Fall 2016 when Jane Doe I and II started as freshman at RCHS, RCHS and the Board knew of several incidents of sexual harassment of female students by Cruz beginning as early as 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Prior Incidents at RCHS (1999-2016)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1999-2000, Cruz was a security guard and the female swim coach at RCHS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27). During that time, a female student reported to Dolly Irizarry, a teacher at RCHS, that Cruz told the student in front of other female students that she had a \"hot pussy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27-29). Ms. Irizarry reported the conduct to RCHS administration who with the help of the Board commenced an investigation, including interviewing Irizarry and other female students, but never disciplined Cruz or contacted the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) about the comments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30-32). Cruz continued to work as a security guard and the female swim coach at RCHS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In December 2002, M.T., a female student in Cruz's swim class, told RCHS administration that Cruz made her feel weird and did weird stuff to her and that Cruz regularly entered the women's locker room while she and other students were changing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36, 40). Other female students confirmed that Cruz would regularly walk in on girls changing in the locker room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43). One day while at the swimming pool, Cruz touched M.T.'s breast. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37). M.T. told her mother that Cruz had touched her breast and her mother went to RCHS and reported the incident to RCHS Assistant Principal Conrad. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38). Another time, Cruz threw M.T. into the pool. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41). M.T. and her mother requested that the RCHS administration take action against Cruz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42). M.T. ultimately failed her swim class because she refused to be near Cruz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44). Eventually, M.T.'s mother contacted the Chicago Police Department who arrested Cruz on April 4, 2003 for physical battery against M.T. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45). The Board and RCHS administration knew about the arrest yet continued to employ Cruz at RCHS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2003-2004, R.L. was a student in Cruz's swim class at RCHS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50-52). After class, Cruz would regularly walk through the women's locker room while the female students were changing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54). R.L. told Cruz to stop doing so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54). R.L. and several other female students also told RCHS staff and administration that Cruz walked through the women's locker room while they were changing but RCHS administration ignored the conduct and took no action against Cruz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54-57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2007-2008, S.H. was a student in a P.E. class moderated by Cruz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58-60). Cruz regularly walked into the women's locker room after class while female students were changing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61). S.H. and other female students in the class screamed at Cruz to stop doing so and notified RCHS staff and administration about his conduct but the RCHS administration never took any action against Cruz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2012, a female student at RCHS filed a complaint received by the Board Investigations Unit and Law Department alleging Cruz sexually harassed her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66). The \"Investigation Memorandum\" provided to the Law Department reported that, according to the student, Cruz \"flirt[ed]\" with her, \"hit[ ]\" on her, \"mess[ed]\" with her, hit her in a playful manner, slapped\n   her on the back of the neck, grabbed the back of her arm, flicked her and called her \"Babe,\" and called her a \"bitch\" after she told him to stop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67). The Board never disciplined or counseled Cruz for his conduct or reported it to DCFS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January 21, 2014, several adult RCHS staff members observed Cruz slap a female student across the face multiple times while having a heated argument with her in a classroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 69-70). One witness reported the incident to DCFS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73). When RCHS Principal Marcey Sorenson learned of the incident, she called Cruz to her office and he admitted to slapping the student. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74). The Board continued to employ Cruz and never disciplined him for the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 75-76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Fall 2016, X.S., a female RCHS student, reported to her mother that Cruz played with her hair and made her feel uncomfortable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 78-79). Her mother reported Cruz's conduct to a member of the Board Investigation Unit but the investigator never opened an investigation into the allegation or reported the conduct to DCFS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In September 2016, Cruz was coaching the women's volleyball team and walked up behind a player, T.R., during warm-ups for a game and inappropriately touched her butt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82-83). The incident was reported to Assistant Principal Crosen who in turn never disciplined Cruz for his conduct or reported the incident to DCFS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84-85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jane Doe I and II Incidents (2016-2017)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Jane Doe I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When Jane Doe I started at RCHS in Fall of 2016, Cruz was the Dean of Students and a security guard stationed at the screening area on the first-floor entrance of the school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 87-88). In September 2016, Jane Doe I forgot her ID and was directed to Cruz to obtain a temporary ID in order to be admitted into the school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 89-90). Instead of handing the ID to Jane Doe I, Cruz \"placed it on her forehead and proceeded to touch and caress [her] face with the back of his hand,\" making Jane Doe I feel \"very nervous and scared.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 91-92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 21, 2016, while dropping Jane Doe I off at school, her father approached Cruz and told him he would \"kick Cruz's ass if [he] ever touched his daughter again.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93). RCHS Dean of Students Albert Lawson witnessed the confrontation but never reported any incident to DCFS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In or about late October 2016, Cruz placed Jane Doe I in a fifth-floor classroom alone with him making it clear she was not free to leave and directed her to type something on one of the computers in the room about an interaction with her boyfriend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 94-95). Cruz leaned over Jane Doe I while she typed, \"placed his head very close to [her] head and placed his arm on her arm,\" and then \"leaned and pushed his body into [her] body and called her 'baby girl.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 96-97). Jane Doe I pushed her self away but \"felt disgusted and scared because she could not get out of the fifth floor room.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In early November 2016, RCHS security guard Darlene Sierra Clark broke up an argument between Jane Doe I and another student and took Jane Doe I to Cruz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98). Cruz initially spoke angrily to Jane Doe I but, after Clark left the room, \"soften[ed] his tone, rubb[ed] Jane Doe I's arm and [told] her it would be ok.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99). Also in early November, Jane Doe I was talking loudly on an escalator in RCHS when Cruz \"came up from behind her, touched [her] on her waist and whispered\n   in her ear to 'stop yelling.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 100).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Jane Doe I reported to Clark and RCHS Dean of Students Christopher Ellis that she did not like the way Cruz touched her and that Cruz \"made her feel weird and uncomfortable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101). Clark and Ellis reported this to Dean Lawson and Principal Sorenson who determined the encounter with Cruz was \"non-sexual.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102). Neither Lawson, Sorenson, Clark nor Ellis reported the incident to DCFS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 102-103). However, in January 2017, CPD reported the incident to DCFS, who investigated and ultimately \"Indicated\" the complaint after finding credible evidence of child abuse and/or grooming by Cruz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Jane Doe II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Jane Doe II also started as a freshman at RCHS in Fall of 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104). In or about mid-December 2016, Jane Doe II was riding up an escalator at RCHS when Cruz \"quietly approached [her] from behind, put his arm around [her], touched her inner thigh and said '... whats up F ...?' \" and then continued up the escalator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 106-108). The encounter caused Jane Doe II to \"flinch away from Cruz and feel angry and uncomfortable\" and she immediately told her teacher and her mother what happened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 109-10). Her mother contacted RCHS and the RCHS administration contacted DCFS and CPD about the allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 110-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Jane Doe II and her mother were told a \"Safety Plan\" would be implemented to protect Jane Doe II but it never was. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112). Cruz remained in the school and followed Jane Doe II to her classes \"making it impossible for [her] to continue to attend RCHS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114). As a result, in January 2017 she transferred to another school outside of the Chicago Public School district to get away from Cruz. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Cruz's Arrest and Suspension\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On January 17, 2017, CPD arrested Cruz and charged him with battery of Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117). Despite instructions that Cruz was not to have any contact with Jane Doe I or II, RCHS allowed Cruz to access RCHS where Jane Doe I was still a student. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117). Cruz's continued intimidation of Jane Doe I caused her to experience \"mental anguish, humiliation, and emotional and physical distress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117). In or about February 2017, the Board suspended Cruz with pay due to the arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Incidents at Farragut (2017-2018)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In August 2017, the Board transferred Cruz to work as a security guard at Farragut High School. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119). Cruz was still awaiting a criminal trial for the battery of Jane Doe I and II at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 120).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In January 2018, a Farragut teacher reported to Farragut administration via email that several female students had complained of inappropriate behavior by Cruz that made them feel uncomfortable, including playing with female students' pony tails, telling a student to come closer so he could smell her perfume, walking behind female students on the stairs and \"star[ing] at their butt,\" and pushing a student's head as she entered a classroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 122-124). The teacher also reported that she observed Cruz and a female student screaming and hitting each other in the hallway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 123). The Farragut administration forwarded the email to Farragut Principal Hamacker who in turn forwarded it to the Board Investigation Unit and Law Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 125).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Board never opened an investigation or took any action to discipline Cruz or prevent his continued inappropriate behavior toward female students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 126-127). Cruz continued to work at Farragut until June 15, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 126).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"To survive a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6), a complaint must 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Gabrielle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   also cited by the Board, the court affirmed summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiff's Title IX claim, finding that the alleged student-on-student harassment was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to deprive a student of access to education where the plaintiff's \"grades remained steady and her absenteeism from school did not increase.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377122\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/817/#p822\">\n    315 F.3d at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Dkt. 42 at 13-14). Whether an employee acted within his or her scope of employment is relevant where the plaintiff seeks to hold a defendant liable under a theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glade ex rel. Lundskow v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3515263\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/718/#p721\">\n    692 F.3d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721 (7th Cir. 2012). That is not the case here. Here, Plaintiffs seek to hold the Board\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   liable for its own negligence in failing to \"under[take] appropriate measures to prohibit and prevent Cruz from engaging in inappropriate sexual abuse and harassment of other students\" (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6 140)-not to hold the Board\n   <em>\n    vicariously\n   </em>\n   liable for Cruz's intentional misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3515263\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/718/#p721\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (distinguishing between claim based\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   and negligence claim for direct liability).

Whether Cruz was acting within the scope of his employment when he committed the alleged sexually harassment has no bearing on the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In support of its argument, the Board cites to\n   <em>\n    Doe ex rel. Doe v. Lawrence Hall Youth Services\n   </em>\n   in which a student alleged among other things that a school negligently supervised him by allowing him to sneak off campus and engage in sexual activity with a female teacher.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=358%20Ill.%20Dec.%20867\">\n    358 Ill.Dec. 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20N.E.2d%2052\">\n    966 N.E.2d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ill. App. Ct. 2012). In\n   <em>\n    Lawrence Hall\n   </em>\n   , the district court construed the negligent supervision claim as alleging\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability for the female teacher's misconduct and then dismissed the claim on the grounds that the teacher's sexual misconduct was outside the scope of her employment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20N.E.2d%2052\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=358%20Ill.%20Dec.%20867\">\n    358 Ill.Dec. 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20N.E.2d%2052\">\n    966 N.E.2d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff argued on appeal that the trial court erred in construing the negligent supervision claim as alleging\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability and the appellate court affirmed the holding, specifically finding that the negligent supervision claim as alleged encompassed the female teacher's misconduct: \"[T]he trial court did not err where the issue of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   must necessarily be addressed based on plaintiff's allegations that defendant, through its 'various agents and employees,'\n   <em>\n    including [the female teacher] Pithyou\n   </em>\n   , negligently supervised plaintiff, causing him injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20N.E.2d%2052\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20N.E.2d%2052\">\n    at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20N.E.2d%2052\">\n    966 N.E.2d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, the NEID claim in the Complaint cannot possibly be construed to allege\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability for Cruz's misconduct. To the contrary, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence Hill\n   </em>\n   , the NEID claim in the Complaint specifically distinguishes between the Board's alleged negligent conduct and Cruz's intentional misconduct by basing the negligence claim on the Board's (and its employees') failure to\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   Cruz's intentional misconduct. Whether Cruz committed the sexual misconduct outside the scope of his employment has no bearing on whether the Board or any of its agents or employees was negligent in failing to prevent that misconduct from occurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Board next argues that all negligence claims based on Cruz's criminal\n   conduct must be dismissed because it had no duty to Jane Doe I or II to prevent the criminal acts by a third party. Specifically, the Board seeks to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress, failure to supervise, negligence, negligent failure to control Cruz's conduct, and willful and wanton conduct-all of which allege the Board's negligent and/or willful and wanton misconduct failed to prevent Cruz's alleged sexual harassment and abuse of Plaintiffs-on this basis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 40 (Counts II, III, IV, V, VIII, X, XI, XII and XIII) ). Generally, a person has no duty under Illinois law to act affirmatively to protect another from criminal conduct by a third person.\n   <em>\n    Doe-2 v. McLean Cty. Unit Dist.

Here, as discussed already, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the Board had knowledge that Cruz posed a threat to Jane Doe I and II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Additionally, the Board could be held liable for each of these claims under an alternative theory of liability: breach of the duty under Illinois law to protect Jane Doe I and II against harms created by\n   <em>\n    their own\n   </em>\n   conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 515 (\"While persons generally have no duty to protect against dangers created by third parties, they do have a duty to protect against harms created by their own conduct.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Cuyler v.

For example, Plaintiffs allege the Board continued to employee Cruz and withheld information concerning prior complaints of sexual harassment and abuse by Cruz from female students and their parents or guardians. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 207). Such allegations plausibly allege the Board created the risk that Cruz would harass Jane Doe I and II and, therefore, assumed a duty to protect her against such risk.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McLean Cty.\n   </em>\n   at 516 (school district created risk that teacher would harass student, and in doing so assumed a duty to protect her, when it took deliberate steps to secure a position for the teacher while concealing his known history of sexual harassment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, the Court denies the Board's motion to dismiss any of the negligence claim asserted against it based on criminal conduct committed by Cruz on either of these bases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Board's Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 42) is granted in part and denied in part. The Court dismisses without prejudice Plaintiffs' claim for Negligent Failure to Control Conduct of Cruz (Count VIII) and claims for Negligence based on the failure to supervise Cruz (Counts IV, XII). All\n   other claims, including Plaintiffs' claim for Negligence based on other allegations, may proceed as alleged.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    On February 5, 2019, the en banc Court of Appeals will hear argument in\n    <em>\n     Jane\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Doe No. 55 v.
