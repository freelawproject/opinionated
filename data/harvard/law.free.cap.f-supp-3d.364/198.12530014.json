(Doc. 1.) In particular, Ms. Leonard challenges the following statement in the collection letter: \"Settling a debt for less than the balance owed may have tax consequences and Discover may file a 1099C form.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) CMS has filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), arguing that Ms. Leonard lacks standing because there was no concrete injury, and that the challenged language in the collection letter is true and accurate and is not deceptive or misleading under the FDCPA. (Doc. 7-1.) Ms. Leonard opposes the motion (Doc. 10), and CMS has filed a reply in support of its motion (Doc. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant factual allegations in the complaint are as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to January 18, 2017, CMS was directing debt-collection activities towards Ms. Leonard on an alleged consumer debt (the \"Alleged Debt\").

Noting that gross income includes income from the discharge of indebtedness,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2061\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(11), CMS maintains that the Tax Statement's \"tax consequences\" clause is true. CMS asserts that the Tax Statement's \"1099-C\" clause is true because it is not cast in mandatory language, and states only that Discover \"may\" file a 1099-C form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   CMS also maintains that the Tax Statement is not \"deceptive\" or \"misleading.\" (Doc. 7-1 at 10-15.) According to CMS, the statement that settlement \"may have tax consequences\" is an accurate \"disclosure of tax consequences\" that has been held not to violate the FDCPA in other cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) And CMS argues that the statement that it \"may\" file a 1099-C form does not imply that CMS or Discover would take any action, much less report the discharged indebtedness to the IRS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ms. Leonard maintains that the Tax Statement is false and deceptive for three reasons. First, she asserts that \"it would be unnecessary and inappropriate for Discover to file a 1099C in this instance.\" (Doc. 10 at 12.) Second, she argues that the Tax Statement \"fails to convey the possible tax consequences to which it is referring.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, she contends that the Tax Statement \"scares the least sophisticated consumer into waiving her option to take the settlement offer for fear of the false tax implications invoked by the Letter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The court begins with Ms. Leonard's second point, which appears to be directed at the Tax Statement's \"tax consequences\" clause. Other courts have considered and rejected the same argument challenging language that a settlement of a debt might have \"tax consequences.\" For example, in\n   <em>\n    Ceban v. Capital Management Services, L.P.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-CV-4554(ARR)(CLP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20451637\">\n    2018 WL 451637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 17, 2018), the court held that a statement that \"this settlement may have tax consequences\" was\n   not false, deceptive, or misleading.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-6. The court rejected the plaintiff's contention that the statement's failure to provide information about what those tax consequences might be rendered the statement impermissibly vague.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Ms. Leonard acknowledges\n   <em>\n    Ceban\n   </em>\n   and other similar cases, and she cites no authorities holding to the contrary. She insists, however, that this case is different because CMS's Tax Statement included more than just a \"tax consequences\" clause, and went on to suggest that CMS might file a report with the IRS. (Doc. 10 at 15-16.) The court accordingly turns to Ms. Leonard's first point, which focuses on the 1099-C clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The parties agree that a creditor is not required to issue a form 1099-C if the canceled debt is under $ 600.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6050P(b) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .6050P-1 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   IRS Pub. No. 4731,\n   <em>\n    Screening Sheet for Nonbusiness Credit Card Debt Cancellation\n   </em>\n   (2015),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4731.pdf (\"The creditor is not required to issue a Form 1099-C if the canceled debt is under $ 600. However, the taxpayer may be required to report the canceled debt as income regardless of the amount.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the terms of the offer in CMS's January 2017 letter, the total debt forgiveness would have been less than $ 600.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   There would be no reporting requirement for CMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   CMS does not dispute the exception to the reporting requirement for discharges under $ 600, nor does it dispute that the offer to Ms. Leonard would have resulted in a discharge of less than $ 600. Instead, CMS relies on its characterization of the Tax Statement's 1099-C clause as \"qualified\" or conditional. (Doc. 7-1 at 13; Doc. 11 at 9.) According to CMS, the statement that Discover \"may\" file a 1099-C form does not state or imply that CMS or Discover \"will or would\" take any action. (Doc. 7-1 at 14; Doc. 11 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Applying the \"least sophisticated consumer\" standard, the court concludes that Ms. Leonard has stated a plausible claim that the Tax Statement is misleading or deceptive. One reasonable interpretation of the use of the word \"may\" in the 1099-C clause is that, upon the debtor's acceptance of the settlement offer and settling the debt for less than the total due, CMS or Discover might choose to report the cancelled debt to the IRS, and the debtor might face adverse tax consequences. Interpreted in that fashion, the statement is false. Although CMS correctly points out that the Tax Statement does not explicitly refer to reporting to the \"IRS,\" the reference to filing a 1099-C form is equivalent in all material respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ms. Leonard relies on\n   <em>\n    Velez v. Enhanced Recovery Company, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-164,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201730721\">\n    2016 WL 1730721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. May 2, 2016). The court finds that case to be instructive here. The debt collector in that case, ERC, sent the debtor, Radamed Velez, a letter in connection with a $ 692.70 consumer debt that he owed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The letter offered to settle the debt for\n   $ 554.16. The letter also stated: \"[A]ny indebtedness of $ 600.00 or more, which is discharged as a result of a settlement, may be reported to the IRS as taxable income pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code 6050 (P) and related federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Velez sued ERC under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e, alleging that ERC's statement was false, deceptive, and misleading.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court denied ERC's motion to dismiss. First, the court held that the challenged language was not completely true, since \"the use of the contingent 'may' ... fail[s] to communicate that there are other exceptional circumstances beyond the threshold amount that affect whether the cancellation of the debt is reportable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. In the\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   court's view, ERC's statement \"suggests the possibility that the cancelled debt could be reported.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   court went on to hold that ERC's statement could mislead or deceive the least sophisticated debtor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The conditional \"may\" of the Statement does not remove from the realm of possibility that the least sophisticated debtor might be deceived into thinking that ERC must or will report certain settlement amounts to the IRS, even when it does not intend to, or would not be required to, under the relevant statute and regulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   court rejected ERC's argument that its statement was not \"material.\" The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The least sophisticated debtor could reasonably assume that ERC included the Statement because it was relevant, and such a debtor could believe, given the lack of specificity in the generally-stated rule that mentions one exception but not others, that the action he chooses to take with respect to the debt will trigger tax consequences or reporting requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In a footnote, the\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   court reiterated that the use of the word \"may\" in ERC's statement did not render the statement proper. Although one possible interpretation of that conditional language might be that filing a 1099-C depended on whether the $ 600 threshold was triggered, \"[t]he least sophisticated debtor, even reading carefully, might not understand that the 'may' refers only to the $ 600 threshold and to no other possible triggering event or exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 n.1. \"It would not be bizarre or idiosyncratic for the least sophisticated debtor to believe that ERC retained some discretion in whether to report or that some other related federal law governed the reporting of the discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   court's conclusions about the conditional language used in that case apply with equal force in this case, and CMS's attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   is unavailing. CMS asserts that the Tax Statement in this case is different because it \"made no reference at all to IRS Guidelines, nor the $ 600 threshold.\" (Doc. 11 at 7.) CMS is correct insofar as the\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   court's analysis began by noting that ERC's statement in that case included some details (e.g., the $ 600 threshold and a reference to \u00a7 6050P ), but no indication that there are other \"exceptional circumstances beyond the [$ 600] threshold amount that affect whether the cancellation of the debt is reportable.\"\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201730721\">\n    2016 WL 1730721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. But\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   is not distinguishable just because CMS used a more general statement that included\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   details about when or why a 1099-C form might be filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court recognizes that there can be good reasons for using very general language. The \"may have tax consequences\" clause is a good example. The use of such\n   general language has the merit of flagging a potential issue without \"wading into the technicalities\" of that issue, especially where a full recitation of the technicalities can be more intimidating than helpful.\n   <em>\n    Ceban\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20451637\">\n    2018 WL 451637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. On the other hand, using generalities can render a statement susceptible to the charge that, even if it is not \"false,\" it is \"not completely true\" either.\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201730721\">\n    2016 WL 1730721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Good v.

Pa. 2014) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   court began its discussion of ERC's statement with just that concern. The same problem is present with CMS's 1099-C clause: it does not even mention the $ 600 threshold. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   suggested that that Mr. Velez would know that the $ 138.54 debt write-off (the $ 692.70 minus the $ 554.16 settlement amount) could not meet the $ 600 threshold for reporting. The\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   court rejected that argument, reasoning that the amount owed was greater than $ 600, so the least sophisticated debtor could be confused or misled because, even after reading carefully, he or she still might not understand whether the $ 600 threshold applied to the total indebtedness or just the write-off amount.\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201730721\">\n    2016 WL 1730721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 n.1. Here, perhaps even more obviously than in\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   , CMS's 1099-C clause-which does not even mention the $ 600 threshold-\"suggests the possibility that the cancelled debt could be reported.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   court's conclusion rested on more than just the observation that the omission of the exceptions rendered the statement less than \"completely true.\" The court held that the least sophisticated debtor \"might be misled into thinking that there will be adverse tax consequences for settling a debt for less than the total amount due.\"\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201730721\">\n    2016 WL 1730721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 n.1. The same conclusion holds true in this case. And just as ERC's use of the conditional \"may\" did not eliminate the potential to deceive the least sophisticated debtor, CMS's use of that same conditional word does not, either. Although ERC's statement referenced the $ 600 threshold, the\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   court held that the least sophisticated investor \"even reading carefully, might not understand that the 'may' refers only to the $ 600 threshold and to no other possible triggering event or exception.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201730721\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *3 n.1. Here, CMS's statement does not even mention the $ 600 threshold, so the debtor might believe that ERC retained complete discretion in whether to report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The other cases upon which CMS relies are not persuasive.

The\n   <em>\n    Elmore\n   </em>\n   court did state, as an alternative or additional basis for its conclusion, that the debt collector's statement did not suggest that it \"will\" file a 1099-C form, and instead merely notified the debtor that such action \"may\" be taken.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204480419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This court respectfully declines to adopt that rationale for the reasons stated above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 7) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Where necessary to understand the import of the allegations, the court has included statements that are reasonable inferences from the facts alleged.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    CMS refers to this statement as the \"Tax Statement.\" The court adopts that nomenclature for convenience.
