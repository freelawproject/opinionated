Barbieri, Herbert Porter and Raymond Raptis, representing a class of employees of the defendant, United Technologies Corporation, are precluded from asserting their breach of contract claims in state court. Following a jury verdict for the defendant, the trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict and concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 (a). On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly determined that their breach of contract claims were preempted by federal law and, further, that the trial court improperly instructed the jury in several respects. We conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, although not preempted under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 (a), are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board and are therefore preempted pursuant to <em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 245, 79 S. Ct. 773, 3 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1959) (holding that when activity is arguably subject to \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158, \u201c[sjtates as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board\u201d). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment for the defendant and remand the case to the trial court with direction to dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At various times before the events giving rise to this dispute occurred, the plaintiffs had accepted jobs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>as hourly employees with Pratt and Whitney Aircraft (Pratt &amp; Whitney), a division of the defendant. During their tenure as employees of the defendant, the plaintiffs had received promotions to salaried, nonunion positions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Between 1991 and 1993, the defendant eliminated many of the salaried positions in conjunction with a company-wide reorganization and reduction in its workforce. As a result, while the plaintiffs maintained their salaried positions, the defendant offered them two options: either (1) accept a demotion to an hourly position within the company and receive, for a fixed period of time, a supplemental wage payment over the maximum wage set forth in the collective bargaining agreement covering those hourly positions; or (2) terminate their employment and, if they were eligible, receive a salaried severance package. Each of the plaintiffs accepted the hourly positions, joined the bargaining unit, and thereafter were subject to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the defendant and the union.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In an effort to soften the transition from salaried to hourly positions for the demoted employees, the defendant had maintained a policy of (laying such employees a temporary wage supplement in addition to the maximum rate of pay, as defined by the collective bargaining agreement, for the labor grade to which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>had been demoted. The plaintiffs received wage supplements consistent with the defendant\u2019s policy. The defendant\u2019s policy, which the plaintiffs referred to as the \u201cStep-Down Program,\u201d gradually phased out the wage supplement. The payments decreased over time until each plaintiff received the maximum rate for his or her assigned labor grade. The labor grade pay rates and the manner in which the defendant phased out the wage supplement had been drawn directly from the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">During the course of negotiations in June of 1993,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the union challenged the wage supplement practice, contending that the policy favored those union members who had been demoted from salaried positions and paid them more, for the same work, than the rest of the union membership. The union also objected to the practice because, in its view, the wage supplement payments were inconsistent with the maximum wage rates dictated by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant agreed to discon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tinue the wage supplement policy. The defendant memorialized its agreement with the union in an October 19, 1993 letter, which indicated that all employees demoted from salaried positions to hourly status would \u201cbe paid no more than the maximum of the grade to which they are assigned\u201d and that those employees who had been demoted prior to October 22, 1993, would again have the option of receiving a severance package, in the event that they did not choose to continue working as hourly employees. On November 21, 1993, the defendant stopped paying the plaintiffs the wage supplement and reduced the plaintiffs\u2019 wages to the maximum rate for the labor grades to which they had been assigned. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">On May 16, 1994, the plaintiffs initiated the present action alleging breach of contract, promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation and violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs alleged primarily that the wage supplement practice had created individual contracts for payments supplementing the maximum wages under the collective bargaining agreement and that the defendant had breached those individual contracts by discontinuing the phaseout policy. The defendant filed a petition for removal in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut on June 14, 1994, arguing that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act because they fell within the collective bargaining agreement in force between the union and the defendant. The District Court, Nevas, J., adopted the recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge, Smith, J., concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not preempted by federal law because they were based on individual contracts entered into before the plaintiffs had accepted the demotions and joined the bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>unit. Accordingly, the District Court remanded the case to state court. <em>Barbieri </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 3:94-0970 (D. Conn. July 24, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Following the remand, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in September, 1995. The defendant pressed its argument that the plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims were preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, and argued further that the claims were subject to preemption under the National Labor Relations Act. The trial court, <em>Holzberg, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion on August 14, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">After the parties had conducted discovery, the defendant again moved for summary judgment in 1997. The defendant argued that the alleged contracts to pay the wage supplement had been modified by the union, which became the plaintiffs\u2019 authorized representative following their return to the bargaining unit. In essence, the defendant argued that the alleged contracts had been subsumed by the collective bargaining agreement, thus modifying its terms and again raising the specter of preemption under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. The trial court, <em>Aurigemma, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion on October 28, 1998, agreeing with the prior rulings of both Judge Nevas and Judge Holzberg regarding preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Thereafter, on May 6, 1999, the trial court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification with respect to their breach of contract and state statutory claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>A jury trial commenced and at the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the defendant moved for a directed verdict based on preemption under both the Labor Management Relations Act and the National Labor Relations Act. The trial court reserved its decision on that motion, allowing the case to proceed. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant. Although the jury concluded that (1) a contract to pay the wage supplement had existed between the plaintiffs and the defendant, and (2) the defendant had breached that contract by ceasing the wage supplement phaseout policy in November of 1993, it determined that the defendant had proved its affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction. That defense had been premised on the fact that the plaintiffs, before the defendant eliminated the wage supplement policy, had been offered the same choice that they had been offered when they were first demoted to the hourly positions. That is, the defendant again had given the plaintiffs the option of leaving the company and receiving a severance package before the defendant terminated the wage supplement policy. The jury concluded that, by continuing to work after that option had been presented, the plaintiffs had manifested their consent to be paid in accordance with the wage rates dictated by the collective bargaining agreement, thereby agreeing to forgo the wage supplement phaseout.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Thereafter, the trial court orally denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict. The next day, the plaintiffs moved for articulation and, on May 11, 2000, the trial court, contrary to its previous decision and relying on a case cited by the defendant in its motion for a directed verdict, concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims were preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the case to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Before this court, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly determined that their claims were preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. The plaintiffs also maintain that the trial court improperly instructed the jury with respect to the defense of accord and satisfaction and that, because of that instruction, a new trial is required.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The defendant asserts that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 state law breach of contract claims are preempted under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. As an alternative ground for affirming the judgment, the defendant argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. In addition, the defendant maintains that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions with respect to accord and satisfaction were proper. Finally, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly denied its motion to decertify the class and that, in the event that this court remands the case for a new trial, the class should be decertified.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">We agree with the plaintiffs that their state law breach of contract claims are not preempted under the Labor Management Relations Act. We conclude further, however, that their claims, which seek to enforce individual contracts for the payment of the wage supplements above the bargained for wage rates in the collective bargaining agreement, are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>supra, 359 U.S. 245, and its progeny.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not reach the remaining issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">\u201cThe question of preemption is one of federal law, arising under the supremacy clause of the United States constitution. . . . Determining whether Congress has exercised its power to preempt state law is a question of legislative intent. . . . [A]bsent an explicit statement that Congress intends to preempt state law, courts should infer such intent where Congress has legislated comprehensively to occupy an entire field of regulation, leaving no room for the States to supplement federal law ... or where the state law at issue conflicts with federal law, either because it is impossible to comply with both ... or because the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of congressional objectives . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>244 Conn. 781, 791, 712 A.2d 396, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Slotnik v.

Ed. 2d 451 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Preemption of state law under the Labor Management Relations Act differs markedly from preemption under the National Labor Relations Act. As discussed more fully herein, the former is a species of the complete preemption doctrine; see id.; and it does not divest state courts of subject matter jurisdiction, but simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>supplants state substantive law. <em>Livadas </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>512 U.S. 107, 122, 114 S. Ct. 2068, 129 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1994) (noting that \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act \u201cdoes not preclude state courts from taking jurisdiction over cases arising from disputes over the interpretation of collective-bargaining agreements, [but] state contract law must yield to the developing federal common law, lest common terms in bargaining agreements be given different and potentially inconsistent interpretations in different jurisdictions\u201d). \u201c[The Supreme] Court has made clear that \u00a7 301 is a potent source of federal labor law, for [although] state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over controversies involving collective-bargaining agreements . . . state courts must apply federal law in deciding those claims . . . and indeed any state-law cause of action for violation of collective-bargaining agreements is entirely displaced by federal law under \u00a7 301 ... . State law is thus \u2018pre-empted\u2019 by \u00a7 301 in that only the federal law fashioned by the courts under \u00a7 301 governs the interpretation and application of collective-bargaining agreements.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC </em>v. <em>Rawson, </em>495 U.S. 362, 368, 110 S. Ct. 1904, 109 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1990); see also <em>Local 174, Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers of America </em>v. <em>Lucas Flour Co., </em>369 U.S. 95, 103, 82 S. Ct. 571, 7 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1962) (noting that \u00a7 301 requires that substantive principles of federal labor law take precedence over state law in enforcement of collective bargaining agreements); <em>Textile Workers Union of America </em>v. <em>Lincoln Mills of Alabama, </em>353 U.S. 448, 457, 77 S. Ct. 912, 1 L. Ed. 2d 972 (1957) (noting that any state law applied that is compatible with federal labor policy will be absorbed as federal law and will not be independent source of private rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In contrast, two doctrines exist under the National Labor Relations Act that may lead to preemption. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number><em>Belknap, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>463 U.S. 491, 498-99, 103 S. Ct. 3172, 77 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1983) (summarizing preemption doctrines under National Labor Relations Act). The first doctrine, emanating from <em>San Diego Building Trades Councils. Garmon, </em>supra, 359 U.S. 240 (activity clearly or arguably within \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the National Labor Relations Act displaces state jurisdiction), precludes both state and federal courts from adjudicating issues that are entrusted to the National Labor Relations Board in the first instance. Preemption under <em>Garmon </em>not only preempts state substantive law, but safeguards the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board over issues arguably within the scope of the National Labor Relations Act. <em>Local 926, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>460 U.S. 669, 680, 103 S. Ct. 1453, 75 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1983). The National Labor Relations Board retains <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction over activity that may constitute unfair labor practices under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. <em>See International Longshoremen\u2019s Assn., AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>476 U.S. 380, 393 n.11, 106 S.

And, although the exclusive nature of this jurisdiction was not explicitly noted by Congress, [the United States Supreme] Court has held that such exclusivity was intended by Congress. Enactment of such exclusive jurisdiction must, by operation of the Supremacy Clause, pre-empt conflicting state-court jurisdiction.\u201d <em>International Longshoremen's Assn., AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 393-94 n.11. \u201c[T]he issue is a choice-of-forum rather than a choice-of-law question.\u201d Id., 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">\u201cA second pre-emption principle, <em>Machinists </em>preemption, see <em>[Local 76, International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, </em>427 U.S. 132, 147, 96 S.

Ed. 2d 396 (1976) <em>(Machinists)], </em>prohibits state and municipal regulation of areas that have been left to be controlled by the free play of economic forces. . . . <em>Machinists </em>pre-emption preserves Congress\u2019 intentional balance between the uncontrolled power of management and labor to further their respective interests.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Building &amp; Construction Trades Council of the Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Associated Builders &amp; Contractors of Massachusetts/Rhode Island, Inc., </em>507 U.S. 218, 225-26, 113 S.

Thus, under <em>Machinists, </em>federal law supplants state law, but federal law may direct that the activity at issue is to be free from any regulation whatsoever. See <em>Golden State Transit Corp. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>475 U.S. 608, 614\u201415, 106 S. Ct. 1395, 89 L.

Corp. </em>v. <em>Crystal, 251 </em>Conn. 748, 763, 741 A.2d 956 (1999). Because, however, preemption under the Labor Management Relations Act is intertwined with the National Labor Relations Act issues in this case, we consider the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling on that matter first. See <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 789 (addressing claim of preemption under federal Immigration Reform and Control Act before jurisdictional claims because issues were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Whether the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were preempted under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act is a question of law, which we review under the plenary standard. See <em>In re David W., </em>254 Conn. 676, 686, 759 A.2d 89 (2000); <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Olson, 252 </em>Conn. 98, 104-105, 742 A.2d 799 (2000). If the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claims are preempted under \u00a7 301, then any state law that they seek to invoke as a means of recovery is displaced by federal law. <em>United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>CLC </em>v. <em>Rawson, </em>supra, 495 U.S. 368. Thus, if federal law controls in the state forum, to succeed, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims must be cognizable as federal, rather than state, causes of action. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act provides that \u201c[sjuits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 (a). \u201cSection 301 governs claims founded directly on rights created by coHective-bargaining agreements, and also claims substantially dependent on analysis of a collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caterpillar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>482 U.S. 386, 394, 107 S.

Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act is such a statute and, because it preempts state law regarding the interpretation of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, \u201cany claim purportedly based on that preempted state law is considered, from its inception, a federal claim, and therefore [it] arises under federal law.\u201d Id.; <em>Wilhelm </em>v. <em>Sunrise Northeast, Inc., </em>923 F.

Not all disputes involving a collective bargaining agreement or provisions thereof, however, are preempted by \u00a7 301. <em>Lingle </em>v. <em>Norge Division of Magic Chef, Inc., </em>supra, 413 n.12 (noting that state law claims that tangentially involve collective bargaining agreement may survive, but federal law would govern any interpretation of agreement itself). Indeed, individual contracts governing employment may stand as a source of recovery under state law as long as they truly are independent of the collective bargaining agreement. <em>Caterpillar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 396; see also <em>Livadas </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>supra, 512 U.S. 124 (\u201cthe bare fact that a collective-bargaining agreement will be consulted in the course of state law litigation plainly does not require the claim to be extinguished\u201d). \u201c[Not] every state-law suit asserting a right that relates in some way to a provision in a collective-bargaining agreement, or more generally to the parties to such an agreement, necessarily is pre-empted by \u00a7 301.

Id., 388-89. Thereafter, the defendant downgraded the employees from their nonunion positions to hourly jobs covered by the collective bargaining agreement, assuring the plaintiffs that the downgrades were temporary. Id., 389. After the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>dant abruptly fired the plaintiffs, they brought an action in state court seeking damages for breach of contract based on the alleged individual contracts. Id., 390. The defendant sought to remove the case to federal court, contending that the breach of contract claims were essentially claims arising under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. Specifically, it argued that the plaintiffs had accepted positions covered by a collective bargaining agreement and that, consequently, any individual employment contracts had \u201c \u2018merged into\u2019 \u201d and were \u201c \u2018superseded by\u2019 \u201d that agreement. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The court explained that \u201c[t]he pre-emptive force of \u00a7 301 is so powerful as to displace entirely any state cause of action for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization. Any such suit is purely a creature of federal law, notwithstanding the fact that state law would provide a cause of action in the absence of \u00a7 301.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 394. The court concluded, however, that \u201c[cjlaims bearing no relationship to a collective-bargaining agreement beyond the fact that they are asserted by an individual covered by such an agreement are simply not pre-empted by \u00a7 301.\u201d Id., 396 n.10. Although the plaintiffs in <em>Caterpillar, Inc., </em>had been members of the bargaining unit at the time that they were fired, and they \u201cpossessed substantial rights under the collective agreement,\u201d the fact that they could have brought an action under \u00a7 301 alleging a breach of that agreement did not mean that the alleged individual contract claims were necessarily dependent upon the collective bargaining agreement for resolution. Id., 395; id., 394 (\u201c[s]ection 301 says nothing about the content or validity of individual employment contracts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">In addition, the court in <em>Caterpillar, Inc., </em>rejected the argument that the plaintiffs\u2019 individual employment contracts had been subsumed into or eliminated by the collective bargaining agreement. Id., 395-96. \u201c[I]ndivid-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ual employment contracts are not inevitably superseded by any subsequent collective agreement covering an individual employee, and . . . [such an employee] is permitted to assert legal rights <em>independent </em>of that agreement, including state-law contract rights, so long as the contract relied upon is <em>nota, </em>collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Moreover, the court recognized that enforcement of the individual contracts might implicate preemption under the National Labor Relations Act, but concluded that that issue was \u201cirrelevant\u201d to whether the cause of action pleaded was a removable \u00a7 301 claim. Id., 398 n.12. \u201cThe fact that a defendant might ultimately prove that a plaintiffs claims are pre-empted under the [National Labor Relations Act] does not establish that they are removable to federal court\u201d under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. Id., 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In the present case, the United States District Court denied the defendant\u2019s petition for removal, concluding that \u201cthe promise to pay the wage supplement is not founded upon rights created in the bargaining agreement. It is a separate and distinct agreement, and resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims will not be preempted by \u00a7 301 of the [Labor Management Relations Act].\u201d <em>Barbieri </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, United States District Court, Docket No. 3:94-0970, citing <em>Caterpillar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 396; see <em>Varnum </em>v. <em>Nu-Car Carriers, Inc., </em>804 F.2d 638 (11th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1049, 107 S.

In so ruling, the trial court relied primarily on <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Kiewit Pacific Co., </em>114 F.3d 892, 894 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1108, 118 S. Ct. 1036, 140 L.

See also <em>Aguilera, </em>v. <em>Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp., </em>223 F.3d 1010, 1015-16 (9th Cir. 2000) (independent agreement regarding job security inconsistent with portions of collective bargaining agreement governing layoffs; collective bargaining agreement controls).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In <em>Beals, </em>the plaintiff had been induced to accept a union job by the employer\u2019s representation in a letter that he would not be discharged for the duration of a specific project. <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Kiewit Pacific Co., </em>supra, 114 F.3d 893. The collective bargaining agreement provided that any employee in the bargaining unit could be discharged for \u201cjust cause.\u201d Id. Before the project had been completed, the employer discharged the plaintiff and the plaintiff brought an action for breach of contract, alleging that the promise to employ him for the duration of the project constituted an individual employment contract. Id., 893-94. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that, because the plaintiff had accepted the union job, and the alleged individual contract was in direct conflict with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement with respect to discharge, the individual contract was subsumed into the collective bargaining agreement and therefore was preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. Id., 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In this case, the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs had also accepted union jobs and that, because the wage supplement contracts were \u201cdirectly inconsistent with the provisions of the collective bar-gaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>agreement,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were likewise superseded by that agreement. The defendant contends that the trial court properly determined that \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act preempted the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Caterpillar, Inc., </em>\u201c[individual contracts cannot <em>subtract </em>from collective ones, and whether under some circumstances they may add to them in matters covered by the collective bargain, we leave to be determined by appropriate forums under the law of contracts applicable, and to the [National Labor Relations] Board if they constitute unfair labor practices.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caterpillar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 396, quoting <em>J.I.

The plaintiffs accepted hourly jobs governed by the collective bargaining agreement and agreed to the wages for the labor grade to which they had been assigned. The plaintiffs had the option of terminating their employment and accepting a salaried severance package. The wage supplements, although calculated as additional hourly payments, are alleged to be individual contract rights, offered by the defendant as a matter of practice, based on the plaintiffs\u2019 salaried, nonunion status at the time of the demotions. Those supplements neither limited the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, nor did they render any term therein conditional. The payments simply augmented the wages that the plaintiffs received under the collective bargaining agreement for a limited time.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>In this case, whether the wage supplement payments are inconsistent with the maximum wage rates defined in the collective bargaining agreement, such that the bargaining agreement would control, is a close question. We recognize that, as a practical matter, once the plaintiffs accepted the hourly positions, they began receiving more money for performing bargaining unit jobs than similarly situated employees that had not been demoted from salaried positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based on contracts offered to them <em>before </em>they accepted the bargaining unit jobs, and the individual contracts were not inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement because they did not subtract from the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. <em>Caterpillar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 396. Rather, as the plaintiffs alleged in their complaint, the individual contracts granted them rights <em>in addition </em>to those that they enjoyed under the collective agreement, and they rely on state law to establish the defendant\u2019s liability for breaching those contracts. See id., 395-96.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We conclude that the trial court improperly determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 individual contract claims had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>been superseded by the collective bargaining agreement and that they, therefore, were preempted by federal law under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 (a). If, indeed, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims had been preempted under \u00a7 301, their state law claims effectively would have been extinguished by federal law and, in order to maintain this action under federal law, they would have been required to allege in their complaint that the defendant had breached the collective bargaining agreement. See <em>Livadas </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>supra, 512 U.S. 122 (state court retains jurisdiction over claims alleging breach of collective bargaining agreement under \u00a7 301, but state contract law yields to federal law). The core of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, however, is that the defendant breached contracts for the wage supplements that existed <em>wholly independent </em>of that agreement. <em>Caterpillar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 396 (plaintiff entitled to assert state law contract rights as long as contract is not collective bargaining agreement). Because the plaintiffs are attempting to assert individual contract rights that do not subtract from the terms of the collective agreement, but merely augment those terms, the individual contracts are not necessarily inconsistent with, nor subsumed by, the collective bargaining agreement. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">We are persuaded by the reasoning of the federal District Court in this case and emphasize that \u201cthe plaintiffs were not subject to a collective bargaining agreement at the time that the [individual contracts were] entered into.\u201d <em>Barbieri </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, United States District Court, Docket No. 3:94-0970. The individual contracts were not superseded simply because the plaintiffs accepted bargaining unit positions. <em>Caterpillar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 396-97; see also <em>Varnum </em>v. <em>Nu-Car Carriers, Inc., </em>supra, 804 F.2d 641 (complaint focusing on conduct of employer before plaintiff accepted employment not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>preempted under \u00a7 301). Thus, as the District Court concluded, \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 claims are founded upon rights independent of the bargaining agreement and . . . resolution of these claims will not require analysis of the [collective bargaining] agreement.\u201d <em>Barbieri </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, United States District Court, Docket No. 3:94-0970.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Our conclusion that the trial court improperly determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 state law breach of contract claims were preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act does not end our preemption inquiry. The defendant asserts, as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment, that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are preempted under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 through 169. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are preempted under both <em>Garmon </em>and <em>Machinists, </em>and, therefore, that the plaintiffs cannot prevail on their state law breach of contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In <em>Garmon, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cheld that a state court was precluded from awarding damages to employers for economic injuries resulting from peaceful picketing by labor unions that had not been selected by a majority of employees as their bargaining agent.\u201d <em>Building &amp; Construction Trades Council of the Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Associated Builders &amp; Contractors of Massachusetts/Rhode Island, Inc., </em>supra, 507 U.S. 225, citing <em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>supra, 359 U.S. 246. The court in <em>Garmon </em>acknowledged that the case \u201cconcerned] one of the most teasing and frequently litigated areas of industrial relations, the multitude of activities regulated by \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 of the National Labor Relations Act ... 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157 [and] 158.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number><em>Garmon, </em>supra, 241. The touchstone of preemption under this doctrine is the potential for conflict\u2014\u201cpotential conflict of mies of law, of remedy, and of administration.\u201d Id., 242. \u201c[T]he potential conflict of two law-enforcing authorities, with the disharmonies inherent in two systems, one federal the other state, of inconsistent standards of substantive law and differing remedial schemes\u201d is the primary concern when a party in a labor dispute seeks to vindicate rights that implicate the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s jurisdiction. Id. Within this \u201ccomplex and interrelated federal scheme of law,\u201d the Supreme Court has concerned itself with \u201cconflict in its broadest sense.\u201d Id., 243; <em>Amalgamated Assn. of Street, Electric Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees of America </em>v. <em>Lockridge, </em>403 U.S. 274, 276, 285-87, 91 S.

First, \u201c[w]hen it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by \u00a7 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8 [of that act], due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield.\u201d <em>San </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number><em>Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>supra, 359 U.S. 244. Second, the court recognized that \u201c[a]t times it [may not be] clear whether the particular activity regulated by the States [is] governed by \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8, or [is], perhaps, outside both these sections.\u201d Id. In those instances, \u201c[w]hen an activity is arguably subject to \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the [National Labor Relations] Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted.\u201d Id., 245; <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s Assn., AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 389-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Exceptions to the preemption of state jurisdiction under this rationale do exist, and a state is not ousted of the power to adjudicate matters that are of \u201cperipheral concern\u201d to the federal labor scheme or where the conduct at issue \u201ctouche[s] interests . . . deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility.\u201d <em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>supra, 359 U.S. 243-44; see also <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Industry </em>v. <em>Gould, Inc., </em>475 U.S. 282, 291, 106 S.

In assessing whether to apply either exception a court must balance \u201cthe State\u2019s interest in controlling or remedying the effects of the conduct . . . against both the interference with the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s ability to adjudicate controversies committed to it by the Act . . . and the risk that the State will sanction conduct that the Act protects.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Belknap, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>supra, 463 U.S. 498-99; see also <em>Pennsylvania Nurses Assn. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania State Education Assn., </em>90 F.3d 797, 803 (3d Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1110, 117 S.

Ed. 2d 347 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>In the present case, the defendant claims that the alleged contracts concern wages, which is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, and bargaining unit positions. Because the defendant failed to negotiate with the union as the exclusive representative of bargaining unit employees prior to initiating the alleged contracts for the wage supplements, the defendant contends that the activity is clearly prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We agree with the general proposition, offered by the defendant and conceded by the plaintiffs, that an employer who bypasses a union and deals directly with employees in a bargaining unit violates the National Labor Relations Act. See <em>Medo Photo Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>321 U.S. 678, 684, 64 S. Ct. 830, 88 L. Ed. 1007 (1944) (noting that it is \u201ca violation of the essential principle of collective bargaining and an infringement of the [National Labor Relations] Act for the employer to disregard the bargaining representative by negotiating with individual employees\u201d); <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>American Basketball Assn., Inc., </em>66 F.3d 523, 528 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1033, 116 S. Ct. 2579, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1094 (1996) (\u201c[o]nce a union has been selected as a collective bargaining representative, the [National Labor Relations Act] extinguishes the individual employee\u2019s power to order his own relations with his employer and creates a power vested in the chosen representative to act in the interest of all employees\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Division, </em>789 F.2d 121, 134 (2d Cir. 1986) (noting that efforts to bypass union are considered direct dealing in violation of National Labor Relations Act \u00a7 158 [a] [5]); <em>Wonder State Mfg. Co., </em>151 N.L.R.B. 904, 914 (1965) (direct dealing is unfair labor practice). We also recognize that an employer violates its duty to bargain collectively when it unilaterally changes terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>and conditions of employment without first bargaining with the exclusive collective bargaining representative of its employees. See <em>Litton Financial Printing Division </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations </em>Board, 501 U.S. 190, 198-99, 111 S. Ct. 2215, 115 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1991); <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>369 U.S. 736, 743, 82 S. Ct. 1107, 8 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1962). Similarly, the National Labor Relations Board clearly has determined that implementing unilateral changes in the wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment for bargaining unit employees, while a valid collective bargaining agreement is in effect, amounts to an unfair labor practice. See, e.g., <em>Frontier Hotel &amp; Casino, </em>318 N.L.R.B. 857, 878 (1995), enforced in part sub nom. <em>Unbelievable, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>118 F.3d 795 (D.C. Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Under the factual scenario in this case, however, these general propositions fail to demonstrate sufficiently that the defendant <em>clearly </em>has violated the National Labor Relations Act. It is an undisputed fact that, at the time that the plaintiffs were notified of their options regarding demotion and the wage supplement or termination, they had not yet accepted the offered positions in the bargaining unit. Nor do the previously set forth principles lead us to conclude that it is clear or it fairly may be assumed that enforcing the individual contracts, which allegedly had been entered into before the plaintiffs accepted the bargaining unit positions and which granted them greater rights than those in the collective bargaining agreement, under state contract law would constitute an unfair labor practice or otherwise violate the National Labor Relations Act. <em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>supra, 359 U.S. 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">We do conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s arguments proffered to advance a clear violation of the National Labor Relations Act apply with equal force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>to an <em>arguable </em>violation thereof. As noted previously, <em>Garmon </em>and its progeny instruct that state jurisdiction must yield to that of the National Labor Relations Board \u201c[w]hen an activity is arguably subject to \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8\u201d of the National Labor Relations Act.

Ed. 2d 388 (1989); <em>Local 926, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 676. \u201c[A] party asserting pre-emption must advance an interpretation of the [National Labor Relations] Act that is not plainly contrary to its language and that has not been authoritatively rejected by the courts or the [National Labor Relations] Board. . . . The party must then put forth enough evidence to enable the court to find that the [National Labor Relations] Board reasonably could uphold a claim based on such an interpretation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s Assn., AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 395. \u201cThe critical inquiry [is] . . . whether the controversy presented to the state court is identical to . . . or different from . . . that which could have been, but was not, presented to the [National] Labor [Relations] Board.\u201d <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>San Diego County District Council of Carpenters, </em>436 U.S. 180, 197, 98 S. Ct. 1745, 56 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In the present case, the trial court, <em>Holzberg, J., </em>addressed this issue in denying the defendant\u2019s first motion for summary judgment. Although Judge Holz-berg recognized that the controversies presented to the state court and the National Labor Relations Board must be identical, he required the defendant to \u201cdemonstrate that the <em>claims . . . </em>are the same as [those that] could be presented to the [National Labor Relations Board].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Judge Holzberg characterized the claim that could be presented to the National Labor Relations Board as \u201cwhether it was an unfair labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>practice for the defendant to bargain directly with the plaintiffs at the time they were still salaried employees,\u201d while framing the issue in state court as \u201cnot whether the defendant\u2019s actions constitute an unfair labor practice, but whether: (1) the defendant agreed to pay a wage supplement; (2) whether such [an] agreement is enforceable; and (3) whether the defendant has breached that agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Likewise, the plaintiffs argue that, in order to invoke <em>Garmon </em>preemption, the claims presented in each forum must be identical. They contend that \u201c[t]here is no possible interpretation of the [National Labor Relations Act that] would allow [the] defendant to demonstrate that [the] plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of contract are identical to claims that could be brought before the [National Labor Relations Board].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">It is the controversy at issue, and the activity that a state seeks to regulate\u2014in this case through a judicial decision based on state contract law\u2014not the specificity of the claim, that is at the crux of the \u201carguably\u201d protected or prohibited prong of <em>Garmon. Local 926, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 676. Although an \u201carguable federal violation and the state [claim may arise] in the same factual setting, [if] the respective controversies presented to the state and federal forums would not have been the same,\u201d then a state retains jurisdiction. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>San Diego County District Council of Carpenters, </em>supra, 436 U.S. 196-97 (trespass claim under state law arising from union picketing that arguably violated federal labor law \u201ccreatefd] no realistic risk of interference with the [National] Labor [Relations] Board\u2019s primary jurisdiction to enforce the statutory prohibition against unfair labor practices\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">In <em>Local 926, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 682, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Supreme Court, in addressing preemption of a state action brought by a discharged supervisor against a union for interference with his individual contract of employment distinguished <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>The court acknowledged that its \u201capproach to the pre-emption issue [had] been stated and restated\u201d; id., 676; and reiterated that \u201cthe <em>Garmon </em>pre-emption doctrine not only mandates the substantive pre-emption by the federal labor law in the areas to which it applies, but also protects the exclusive jurisdiction of the [National Labor Relations] Board over matters arguably within the reach of the [National Labor Relations] Act.\u201d Id., 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In <em>Local 926, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO, </em>the plaintiff claimed that his state court action against the union and any potential unfair labor practice charge arising from the union\u2019s conduct were not \u201csufficiently alike\u201d to warrant preemption. Id., 681. The plaintiff conceded that, if the union\u2019s interference with his contract for employment had coerced the employer into discharging him, it would have been an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (b) (1) (B). Id. The plaintiff argued, however, that, had the union\u2019s conduct amounted to noncoercive interference, it would not have implicated that act, and his state law claim could have continued. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In rejecting that argument, the court recognized that \u201ca fundamental part\u201d of a state law claim for noncoer-cive interference would have been that the union actually had caused the employer to discharge the plaintiff. Id., 682. That \u201csame crucial element\u201d also would have been necessary for an unfair labor practice charge. Id. Thus, because \u201cthe federal and state claims [would have been] the same in a fundamental respect . . . [t]he risk of interference with the [National Labor Relations] Board\u2019s jurisdiction [was] obvious and substantial.\u201d Id., 682-83. Further, the court rejected the contention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>the issues raised in state court satisfied the exceptions to avoid preemptions because they were of \u201cperipheral concern to the federal labor policy\u201d or because those claims were \u201cdeeply rooted in local law . . . .\u201d Id., 683; see also <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s Assn., AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 392; <em>United Assn. of Journeymen &amp; Apprentices of the Plumbing &amp; Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States &amp; Canada, Local No. 57 v.

Ed. 2d 923 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In the present case, although it is true that the plaintiffs could not have brought a breach of contract claim against the defendant before the National Labor Relations Board, it is the <em>enforceability </em>of the alleged individual contracts that is the \u201csame crucial element\u201d that guides our decision. <em>Local 926, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 682. The trial court acknowledged that it would be required to pass on the question of enforceability as a matter of state law. We believe that, if we were to enforce the alleged contracts herein, by imposing liability on the defendant for breaching those contracts, we would run the risk of placing our imprimatur on conduct that, at least <em>arguably, </em>violates \u00a7\u00a7 7 or 8 of the National Labor Relations Act. Even if we assume that negotiating the alleged contracts for the wage supplements in this case did not amount to direct dealing, enforcing the terms of the contracts through an award of damages would condone conduct that may otherwise be contrary to federal labor policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The potential for conflict and state interference with federal labor law in this case is \u201cobvious and substantial.\u201d Id., 683. We risk validating an agreement to pay future bargaining unit employees an hourly supplement above the wage rates dictated by the collective bargaining agreement when that very agreement arguably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>circumvented the entire collective bargaining process. It is conceivable that the National Labor Relations Board could conclude that such a scheme is contrary to federal law. See <em>Caterpillar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 397-98 (noting that \u201cif an employer wishes to dispute the continued legality or viability of a preexisting individual employment contract because an employee has taken a position covered by a collective bargaining agreement, it may raise this question in state court . . . [and argue] that enforcement of the individual employment contract arguably would constitute an unfair labor practice\u201d preempted under <em>Garmon); Loewen Group International, Inc. </em>v. <em>Haberichter, </em>65 F.3d 1417, 1426 (7th Cir. 1995) (as long as employer is not attempting to circumvent union or undermine collective bargaining agreement, more favorable contracts with individual employees may be negotiated); <em>Mechanical Contractors Assn. </em>v. <em>Greater Bay Area Assn., </em>66 Cal. App. 4th 672, 689-90, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 225 (1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1114, 119 S. Ct. 1759, 143 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1999) (refusing to address validity of contract as matter of state law because National Labor Relations Board had exclusive jurisdiction as to question of whether contract violated collective bargaining process itself); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Caterpillar, Inc., </em>258 Ill. App. 3d 792, 797, 629 N.E.2d 830 (1994) (claims asserted in state court were \u201cin essence unfair labor practices claims\u201d; whether unfair labor practice has occurred falls within exclusive jurisdiction of National Labor Relations Board).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>The plaintiffs claim farther, however, that they may avoid preemption under <em>Garmon </em>because \u201cthe state\u2019s interest in protecting the sanctity of contracting, and the attendant remedies for breach of contract\u201d satisfies the exception concerning \u201cinterests deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility.\u201d <em>Belknap, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>supra, 463 U.S.. 488. The plaintiffs rely primarily upon <em>Belknap, Inc., </em>contending that that interest is \u201cprecisely the interest that the Supreme Court . . . held to be sufficiently important to trump <em>Garmon </em>preemption.\u201d See id., 511. We find <em>Belknap, Inc., </em>to be inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">In that case, the court addressed the issue of \u201cwhether the National Labor Relations Act . . . pre-empts a misrepresentation and breach-of-contract action against [an] employer brought in state court by strike replacements who were displaced by reinstated strikers after having been offered and [having] accepted jobs on a permanent basis and assured they would not be fired to accommodate returning strikers.\u201d Id., 493. The court concluded that the state law claims were not preempted under <em>Garmon. </em>Id., 512. With respect to the misrepresentation claim, the court concluded that it was \u201cof no more than peripheral concern to the [National Labor Relations] Board and the federal law\u201d; id., 511; because the state court action \u201ccould not fairly be called identical\u201d to any unfair labor practice charge that could have been brought before the National Labor Relations Board. Id., 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The court also determined that the breach of contract claim was not preempted under <em>Garmon </em>because the federal interests, \u201con the one hand, and the interest of the State in providing a remedy to its citizens for breach of contract, on the other, are discrete concerns . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 512. The court reasoned that, even if the National Labor Relations Board had ordered the reinstatement of the striking workers, it merely would have precluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>the replacement workers, who had been laid off, from seeking specific enforcement of the alleged contracts for permanent employment. Id. The court saw \u201cno basis for holding that permitting the contract cause of action [would] conflict with the rights of either the strikers or the employer or would frustrate any policy of the federal labor laws.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In the present case, the plaintiffs emphasize that they are not seeking specific performance of the alleged contracts for the wage supplement, but that they, like the replacement workers in <em>Belknap, Inc., </em>are simply seeking damages for breach of individual contracts that implicate neither federal labor law nor policy. See <em>White </em>v. <em>National Steel Corp., </em>938 F.2d 474, 485 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 974, 112 S. Ct. 454, 116 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1991) (\u201c[e]mployees who have made valid individual contracts that conflict with subsequent federal labor agreements, and thus cannot be specifically enforced, are still free to bring damages claims against their employer for breach of contract\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Unlike the replacement workers in <em>Belknap, Inc., </em>the plaintiffs herein, in order to receive the benefit of the wage supplement program, agreed to accept positions in the bargaining unit. They continued to work for the defendant in those positions, reaping the benefit of the collective bargaining agreement, as well as the supplemental wage program, when the defendant and the union had agreed to discontinue the program. The breach of contract action in this case is not peculiarly local, but, rather, because the plaintiffs agreed to return to the bargaining unit, it implicates the \u201ccomprehensive amalgam of substantive law and regulatory arrangements that Congress set up in the [National Labor Relations Act] to govern labor-management relations affecting interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Local 926, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 675-76. The remedy that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>plaintiffs seek in this case, damages as opposed to specific performance, is predicated on an enforcement of the alleged contracts, wherein lies the potential for conflict with federal law. See <em>J.A. Croson Co. </em>v. <em>J.A. Guy, </em>Inc., 81 Ohio St. 3d 346, 353, 691 N.E.2d 655, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 871, 119 S. Ct. 169, 142 L. Ed. 2d 138 (1998) (noting that range and nature of remedies that are and are not available is fundamental part of comprehensive federal labor system; state wage statutes preempted by National Labor Relations Act to extent that they restrain federally protected conduct under act); cf. <em>Pennsylvania Nurses Assn. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania State Education Assn., </em>supra, 90 F.3d 803 (noting that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has ordinarily applied [the local interests] exception in cases where the conduct alleged concerned activity traditionally recognized to be the subject of local regulation, most often involving threats to public order such as violence, threats of violence, intimidation and destruction of property,\u201d as well as trespass and certain personal torts).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">As noted previously, even if we were to agree with the plaintiffs that Connecticut\u2019s interest in providing a remedy for breach of contract is sufficiently weighty to quality for the exception to <em>Garmon </em>preemption, we would still be required to balance \u201cthe State\u2019s interest in controlling or remedying the effects of the conduct . . . against both the interference with the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s ability to adjudicate controversies committed to it by the [National Labor Relations] Act . . . and the risk that the State will sanction conduct that the Act protects.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Belk-nap, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>supra, 463 U.S. 498-99; see also <em>Pennsylvania Nurses Assn. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania State Education Assn., </em>supra, 90 F.3d 801. We already have concluded in this case that there is a palpable risk that the state may enforce contracts under state law that the National Labor Relations Board could deem contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>to federal labor policy. Cf. <em>Mechanical Contractors Assn. </em>v. <em>Greater Bay Assn., </em>supra, 66 Cal. App. 4th 689-90 (noting that when dispute centers on whether challenged conduct violated collective bargaining process itself, exceptions to preemption do not apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Whether an employer may negotiate a contract to pay employees who agree to return to the bargaining unit a supplemental hourly wage in addition to the maximum rates dictated by the collective bargaining agreement, and more importantly, whether a bargaining unit employee may enforce such a contract as a matter of federal labor law and policy, are matters that are best left to the federal agency charged with administering the National Labor Relations Act. \u201cCongress evidently considered that centralized administration of specially designed procedures was necessary to obtain uniform application of its substantive mies and to avoid these diversities and conflicts likely to result from a variety of local procedures and attitudes toward labor controversies. ... A multiplicity of tribunals and a diversity of procedures are quite as apt to produce incompatible or conflicting adjudications as are different mies of substantive law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s Assn., AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 389, quoting <em>Garner </em>v. <em>Teamsters, Chauffeurs &amp; Helpers Local Union 776, </em>346 U.S. 485, 490-91, 74 S. Ct. 161, 98 L. Ed. 228 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We conclude that the issue of the enforceability of the alleged individual contracts in this case is neither of \u201cperipheral concern\u201d to federal labor law, nor does it touch \u201cinterests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility\u201d to avoid the broad preemptive scope of the National Labor Relations Act under <em>Garmon. </em>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s Assn., AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 392, quoting <em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>v. <em>Garmon, </em>supra, 359 U.S. 243-44.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accordingly, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are preempted under <em>Garmon, </em>and the trial court was without jurisdiction to proceed.

Ed. 126 (1908), and only when [the] plaintiffs well-pleaded complaint raises issues of federal law, see <em>Gully </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 112-13, 57 S. Ct. 96, 97-98, 81 L.

See <em>Foy </em>v. <em>Pratt &amp; Whitney Group, </em>127 F.3d 229, 234 (2d Cir. 1997) (review of terms of collective bargaining agreement to decide preemption question is not \u201cinterpretation\u201d warranting preemption; if preemption were warranted on that basis, it would \u201cswallow the rule that employees can assert nonnego\u00fcable state law rights that are independent of their collective bargaining agreements\u201d); <em>Loewen Group International, Inc. </em>v. <em>Haberichter, </em>65 F.3d 1417, 1423 (7th Cir. 1995) (if examining collective bargaining agreement to determine if conflict existed constituted interpretation for preemption purposes, doctrine would \u201cswallow rule that employees ... are entitled to assert legal rights independent of that rule\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Marion v. Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co., </em>52 F.3d 86, 89 (4th Cir. 1995) (contracting parties free to borrow terms from collective bargaining agreement and that fact does not bring alleged individual contract within \u00a7 301 of Labor Management Relations Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\"> Section 157 of title 29 of the United States Code provides that \u201c[ejmployees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 158 (a) (3) of this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Section 158 (a) of title 29 of the United States Code delineates activities by employers and labor organizations that constitute unfair labor practices, providing in part that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201c(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 ... (3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization . . . [and] (5) to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his [or her] employees</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> We recognize that the issue of the enforceability of the individual contracts could be presented to the National Labor Relations Board in a number of ways. In fact, two of the members of the plaintiffs\u2019 class filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against the <em>union </em>for allegedly violating the National Labor Relations Act by negotiating the elimination of the wage supplement program. The record before us does not contain any information concerning the outcome or resolution of those charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b768-12\"> We need not address whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are also preempted by the National Labor Relations Act under <em>Local 76, International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, </em>supra, 427 U.S. 146 (state law that upsets balance of power between labor and management preempted). See <em>Caterpillar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 397 (employer may argue that individual employment contract not subject to preemption under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act is preempted under <em>Machinists </em>due to principle of exclusive representation in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159 [a]). Nor do we address any of the remaining claims in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
