The plaintiff thereafter filed a motion seeking a deficiency judgment pursuant to \u00a7 49-14. The trial court denied the plaintiffs motion, concluding that the deficiency judgment provisions of \u00a7 49-14 do not apply to tax lien foreclosures. The plaintiff appealed from the denial of its motion for a deficiency judgment to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. Because we agree with the trial court that a deficiency judgment is not available in a tax hen foreclosure action, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. The defendant failed to pay certain municipal real estate taxes for tax years 1990 through 1997 on property that it had owned at 9-11 Birdsall Street in Winsted. Consequently, the plaintiff filed tax hens on that property, covering tax years 1990 through 1996. The plaintiff commenced a foreclosure action and, thereafter, the trial court, <em>DiPentima, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure. The trial court found that the value of the property was $39,000 at the time judgment was rendered and that the defendant owed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the plaintiff a total of $48,464.06.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The debt, therefore, exceeded the value of the property by $9464.06. After title to the property had vested in the plaintiff in accordance with the trial court\u2019s judgment, the plaintiff filed a motion for a deficiency judgment pursuant to \u00a7 49-14. The trial court, <em>Frazzini, J., </em>denied the plaintiffs motion, concluding that a municipality that obtains a judgment of strict foreclosure in a tax lien foreclosure action pursuant to \u00a7 12-181 is not entitled to a deficiency judgment under \u00a7 49-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In rejecting the plaintiffs claim, the trial court relied on the fact that neither of the two relevant statutory provisions, namely, \u00a7 12-181, which governs the foreclosure of tax liens; see footnote 1 of this opinion; and \u00a7 49-14, which sets forth the procedure pursuant to which a deficiency judgment may be obtained in a mortgage foreclosure action; see footnote 2 of this opinion; contains any language indicating that a deficiency judgment is available in a tax lien foreclosure action. On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the conclusion of the trial court, claiming that a tax lienor has the right to seek a deficiency judgment because (1) we previously have indicated that the efficient resolution of lien foreclosure actions is promoted by allowing the lienor to obtain a deficiency judgment, and (2) a deficiency judgment rendered pursuant to \u00a7 49-14 may be obtained in judgment lien foreclosure actions pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-380a (c);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Supply Corp. </em>v. Kosa, 220 Conn. 643, 651, 600 A.2d 1 (1991); and in condominium lien foreclosure actions pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47-258 (j);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> see <em>Linden Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>247 Conn. 575, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>588, 726 A.2d 502 (1999). We are not persuaded by the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Our resolution of this appeal is guided by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case .... In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Finally, because the question presented by this appeal involves an issue of statutory construction, our review is plenary.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schreck </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 592, 596-97, 737 A.2d 916 (1999). In applying the foregoing principles to this case, we are persuaded that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">First, the relevant statutory language provides no support for the plaintiffs contention. Section 12-181, which specifies the manner in which a tax hen foreclosure may be obtained, contains no reference to the availability of a deficiency judgment. Section 49-14, which addresses deficiency judgments in mortgage foreclosure actions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>makes no mention of tax lien foreclosures. Thus, there is nothing in the text of either \u00a7 12-181 or \u00a7 49-14 to suggest that a deficiency judgment is available in a tax lien foreclosure action. Furthermore, the plaintiff has provided us with no legislative history, and we are aware of none, to substantiate its claim that the legislature intended to permit deficiency judgments in tax lien foreclosure actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Moreover, when the legislature has intended to make available the remedy of a deficiency judgment in connection with the foreclosure of a lien, it has done so explicitly. For example, the legislature has provided that, with respect to judgment lien foreclosures, \u201c[a] judgment lien on real property may be foreclosed or redeemed in the same manner as mortgages on the same property.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-380a (c). We observed in <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 643, that, as reflected in the plain language of \u00a7 52-380a (c), the legislature intended that \u201c[e]very aspect of a mortgage foreclosure appl[y] equally to a foreclosure of a judgment lien, <em>including the right to a deficiency judgment pursuant to \u00a7 49-14 (a).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 651. Using language similar in all material respects to that of \u00a7 52-380a (c), the legislature also expressly has provided for the availability of a deficiency judgment in condominium lien foreclosure actions. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-258 (j) (\u201c[t]he association\u2019s lien may be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real property\u201d); see also <em>Linden Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 588. As evidenced by the unambiguous language of \u00a7\u00a7 52-380a (c) and 47-258 (j), if the legislature had intended to make a deficiency judgment available in tax lien foreclosure actions, it easily could have done so. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>250 Conn. 188, 199, 736 A.2d 790 (1999). Finally, under the statutory interpretation urged by the defendant, a plaintiff who forecloses on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>a tax lien is not without a remedy to recover the balance of any taxes owed by a defendant: the plaintiff is free to commence a second action against the defendant for that purpose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The plaintiff claims that we should reject the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 12-181 and 49-14 because considerations of efficiency militate against requiring the plaintiff to commence a second action solely to obtain a full recovery against the defendant. We acknowledge that judicial economy might be enhanced if the statutory scheme permitted a tax lienor to obtain a deficiency judgment in circumstances in which, as in this case, the judgment of strict foreclosure does not cover fully the amount of the debt owed to the municipality. In the absence of any indication that the legislature intended to provide tax lienors with the remedy of a deficiency judgment, however, we are not at liberty to engraft that remedy onto the statute. See, e.g., <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 195, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995) (\u201c[w]e will not impute to the legislature an intent that is not apparent from unambiguous statutory language in the absence of a compelling reason to do so\u201d). Rather, \u201c[w]e are bound to interpret legislative intent by referring to what the legislative text contains, not by what it might have contained.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>Local 218 Steamfitlers Welfare Fund </em>v. <em>Cobra Pipe Supply &amp; Coil Co., </em>207 Conn. 639, 645, 541 A.2d 869 (1988). Thus, if \u00a7 12-181 should be in need of repair, it is for the legislature to repair and not this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The plaintiff further notes that we previously have acknowledged our public policy favoring such efficiency in concluding that a deficiency judgment is available in judgment lien foreclosure actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-380a (c); <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 649-50; and condominium lien foreclosure actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 47-258 (j); <em>Linden Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 586. As we have explained, however, \u00a7\u00a7 52-380a (c) and 47-258 (j) expressly incorporate the deficiency judgment provisions of \u00a7 49-14; our conclusions that deficiency judgments are available under those statutoiy subsections were predicated upon that clear legislative language. As the plaintiff must concede, there is no such link between \u00a7\u00a7 12-181 and 49-14. Consequently, the plaintiff cannot prevail on its claim that our holdings in <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>and <em>Linden Condominium Assn., Inc., </em>support the contention that a tax lienor, like a judgment or condominium lienor, is entitled to seek a deficiency judgment pursuant to \u00a7 49-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-181 provides: \u201cWhenever used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, \u2018municipality\u2019 has the meaning given thereto in section 12-141. The tax collector of any municipality may bring suit for the foreclosure of tax liens in the name of the municipality by which the tax was laid, and all municipalities having tax liens upon the same piece of real estate may join in one complaint for the foreclosure of the same, in which case the amount of the largest unpaid tax shall determine the jurisdiction of the court. If all municipalities having tax liens upon the same piece of real estate do not join in a foreclosure action, any party to such action may petition the court to cite in any or all of such municipalities as may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>be omitted, and the court shall order such municipality or municipalities to appear in such action and be joined in one complaint. The court in which action is commenced shall continue to have jurisdiction thereof and may dispose of such action in the same manner as if all the municipalities had commenced action by joining in one complaint. If one or more municipalities having one or more tax liens upon the same piece of properly are not joined in one action, each of such municipalities shall have the right to petition the court to be made a party plaintiff to such action and have its claims determined in the same action, in which case the same court shall continue to have jurisdiction of the action and shall have the same rights to dispose of such action as if all municipalities had originally joined in the complaint. The court having jurisdiction under the provisions of this section may limit the time for redemption, order the sale of the real estate, determine the relative amount of the undivided interest of each municipality in real estate obtained by absolute foreclosure if two or more municipalities are parties to one foreclosure action or pass such other decree as it judges to be equitable. If one or more municipalities foreclose one or more tax liens on real estate and acquire absolute title thereto and if any other municipality having one or more tax liens upon such real estate at the time such foreclosure title becomes absolute has not, either as plaintiff or defendant, been made a party thereto, the tax liens of each of such other municipalities shall not be thereby invalidated or jeopardized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 provides: \u201cDeficiency judgment, (a) At any time within thirty days after the time limited for redemption has expired, any party to a mortgage foreclosure may file a motion seeking a deficiency judgment. Such motion shall be placed on the short calendar- for an evidentiary hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen days following the filing of the motion, except as the court may otherwise order. At such hearing the court shall hear the evidence, establish a valuation for the mortgaged property and shall render judgment for the plaintiff for the difference, if any, between such valuation and the plaintiffs claim. The plaintiff in any further action upon the debt, note or obligation, shall recover only the amount of such judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\u201c(b) Upon the motion of any party and for good cause shown, the court may refer such motion to a state referee, who shall have and exercise the powers of the court with respect to trial, judgment and appeal in such case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\u201c(c) Any party to a mortgage foreclosure who has moved for an appraisal of property for the purpose of obtaining a deficiency judgment, but has not been granted a deficiency judgment, or has not received full satisfaction of any deficiency judgment obtained subsequent to the filing of such motion, may make a motion to the court for a deficiency judgment as set forth in subsection (a) of this section. If such morion is made on or before November 1, 1979, such moving party shall be deemed to have complied with all of the requirements of subsection (a) of this section and shall be entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>benefit of any deficiency judgment rendered pursuant to said subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\u201c(d) Any appeal pending in the Supreme Court with regard to any deficiency judgment or proceedings relating thereto shall be stayed until a hearing is held pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
