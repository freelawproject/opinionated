The Superior Court for Juvenile Matters, following plea agreements, committed the two juvenile respondents, Jason C. and Greily L., to the department of children and families (department) for eighteen months. During those delinquency commitments, the department, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed petitions to extend the respondents\u2019 confinement. Both respondents filed motions to dismiss the petitions. The trial court granted the respondents\u2019 motions to dismiss the extension petitions on due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>cess and double jeopardy grounds. We affirm the judgment of the trial court on due process grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The following facts are relevant to the disposition of these appeals. One appeal brought by the department involves Jason C., a sixteen year old male. In August or September of 1996, Jason C. allegedly committed an act likely to impair the health and morals of a child under the age of sixteen in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to a plea agreement, the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters adjudicated Jason C. a delinquent on February 10, 1997, following his plea of nolo contendere to the risk of injury to a child charge. The trial court committed Jason C. to the department for a period not to exceed eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">In March, 1997, prior to his commitment for the risk of injury to a child charge, Jason C. allegedly engaged in sexual conduct with a four year old child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He appeared before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>trial court on October 30, 1997, for the adjudication of this charge. Pursuant to a plea agreement, the court again adjudicated Jason C. a delinquent following a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of sexual assault in the fourth degree. Pursuant to the plea agreements of February 10,1997, and October 30,1997, the court committed Jason C. to the department for eighteen months, effective October 31,1997. The trial court did not advise Jason C. during either plea canvass of the possibility that the department could petition for an extension of his commitment. Jason C.\u2019s original delinquency commitment was extended by agreement until October 30, 1999. On October 1, 1999, however, the department again filed a petition, this time seeking to extend the commitment for an additional twelve months.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The other appeal brought by the department involves Greily L., a seventeen year old female.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to a plea agreement, the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters adjudicated Greily L. a delinquent on April 6, 1998, following her plea of nolo contendere to the charge of violating a court order in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 46b-120.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court committed Greily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>L. to the department, effective April 9,1998, for a period not to exceed eighteen months. The trial court did not advise Greily L. during her plea canvass of the possibility that the department could petition for an extension of her commitment. On September 23,1999, the department filed a petition seeking to extend the commitment for an additional eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Jason C. and Greily L. each filed motions to dismiss the extension petitions on November 22, 1999, and December 3, 1999, respectively. They claimed that: (1) the trial court lacked personal and subject matter jurisdiction; (2) granting the petition to extend commitment would violate the plea agreement; (3) the attorney general lacked authority to pursue the petition for extension of commitment; (4) \u00a7 46b-141, which permits extension of juvenile delinquency commitments, is void for vagueness; and (5) granting the petition for extension of commitment would violate the prohibition against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">On January 12,2000, the trial court, in a joint decision, granted each respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition to extend commitment based on two grounds. First, the trial court determined that the failure to advise the respondents of a possible extension of delinquency commitment prevented them from entering a knowing and voluntary plea, thereby rendering the plea invalid. Second, the trial court concluded that an extension of delinquency commitment would subject the respondents to a second punishment for the original offense in violation of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. The department appealed from the judgment of the trial court in each case to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The department\u2019s appeals are limited to the following issues: (1) whether the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters is required, at the time it accepts a plea agreement from a juvenile regarding a delinquency matter, to advise the juvenile of the possibility of an extension of delinquency commitment; and (2) whether an extension of delinquency commitment violates the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. We conclude that the trial court is required to advise a juvenile of the possibility that his or her delinquency commitment may be extended beyond the period of time stated in the plea agreement. Because the respondents had not been so advised, their delinquency commitments cannot be extended. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court in each case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The respondents argue that due process requires a . trial court, in accepting a plea agreement, to advise a juvenile of possible extensions to the delinquency commitment. Specifically, they claim that the trial court\u2019s failure to warn of the possible extension of commitment prevented the respondents from making a knowing arid voluntary plea, as mandated by law. The department counters this claim with two arguments. First, it contends that the mere possibility of a commitment extension is a collateral consequence of the plea and, therefore, is too speculative to warrant the requirement of such an advisement. Second, the department argues that the fundamental rehabilitative nature of the juvenile justice system undermines the use of criminal standards in a juvenile setting. We agree with the respondents and conclude that, when accepting a plea agreement, due process requires a court to advise a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>juvenile of possible extensions to the delinquency commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">An overview of the law governing pleas is necessary for our disposition of this issue. \u201cA plea of guilty or nolo contendere involves the waiver of several fundamental constitutional rights and therefore must be knowingly and voluntarily entered so as not to violate due process. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>[395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969)]; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>[200 Conn. 412, 417-18, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986)] .... These constitutional considerations demand the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and its consequences. . . . Under our rules of practice, a trial judge must not accept a plea of nolo contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is voluntarily made under Practice Book \u00a7 [39-20]<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that the defendant fully understands the items enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19].<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>[182 Conn. 353, 357, 438 A.2d 114 (1980)] ....</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>\u201cThus, for a plea to be valid, the record must affirmatively disclose that the defendant understands the nature of the charge upon which the plea is entered . . . Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (1)]; the mandatory minimum sentence, if any; Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (2)]; the fact that a statute does not permit the sentence to be suspended; Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (3)]; the maximum possible sentence; Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (4)] . . . and that the defendant has the right to plead not guilty or to persist in that plea if already made, the right to a trial by a jury or judge, the right to assistance of counsel, the right to confront the defendant\u2019s accusers and the right against compelled self-incrimination. . . . Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (5)] .... The record must further disclose that the plea is voluntary and not the result of threats or promises. Practice Book \u00a7 [39-20].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>202 Conn. 369, 381-82, 521 A.2d 547 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\u201cThere is no requirement, however, that the defendant be advised of every possible consequence of such a plea.\u201d Id., 383. \u201cAlthough a defendant must be aware of the direct consequences of a plea, the scope of direct consequences is very narrow. ... In Connecticut, the direct consequences of a defendant\u2019s plea include only the mandatory minimum and maximum possible sentences; Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (2) and (4)]; the maximum possible consecutive sentence; Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (4)]; the possibility of additional punishment imposed because of previous conviction(s); Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Book \u00a7 [39-19 (4)]; and the fact that the particular offense does not permit a sentence to be suspended. Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (3)] .... The failure to inform a defendant as to all possible indirect and collateral consequences does not render a plea unintelligent or involuntary in a constitutional sense.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 383 n.17. This court recently summarized the issue of what constitutes a direct consequence when we stated that \u201cour case law clearly and consistently has limited the direct consequences of a guilty plea to those consequences enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 39-19.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>253 Conn. 497, 507, 752 A.2d 49 (2000).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">This court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>176 Conn. 7, 404 A.2d 871 (1978), is relevant to the disposition of this appeal. In <em>Collins, </em>the trial court did not inform the defendant until his sentencing that the offenses to which he pleaded guilty would run consecutive to other sentences he was serving. Id., 8. The trial court refused to allow the defendant to withdraw his plea. Id., 9. In reversing the judgment, this court explained that, \u201c[i]n order for a plea of guilty to be constitutionally valid, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>must be <em>equally </em>voluntary and knowing .... [I]t cannot be truly voluntary unless the defendant possesses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts. ... An understanding of the law in relation to the facts must include all relevant information concerning the sentence. The length of time a defendant may have to spend in prison is clearly crucial to a decision of whether or not to plead guilty. At the time that the defendant entered his plea of guilty, however, there was no discussion of whether the agreed-upon sentence would run consecutively to or concurrently with any outstanding sentence. Therefore, when the defendant responded at the plea hearing that he had been informed of the maximum penalty provided by law for the offense charged, it is clear that he had not, in fact, been fully apprised of the consequences of his plea.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 9-10. Thus, this court concluded that the plea was not made intelligently. Id., 10.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In the present case, the respondents each entered into a plea agreement with the understanding that they would be committed to the department for a period not exceeding eighteen months. Neither respondent was advised of the possibility that the department could petition for an extension of his or her commitment, an action that would have the effect of extending the time of confinement beyond eighteen months. The trial court\u2019s failure to make this advisement stands in stark contrast to Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (4), which requires a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>court to determine that the defendant understands the maximum possible sentence. Here, the respondents were not made aware of their maximum possible sentence even though it is a direct consequence of their decision to enter a nolo plea. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 507; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 383 n.17. Accordingly, they did not have all the relevant information required by our long-standing and well settled law. We therefore conclude that their pleas were not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The department nevertheless claims that the rehabilitative nature of the juvenile justice system permits extensions to delinquency commitments even if a court has not advised the juvenile of that possibility at the time of the plea. Although we agree with the department that one of the primary goals of the juvenile system is to do what is in the best interest of the child,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>conclude that due process nevertheless requires a court to make such an advisement at the time of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The United States Supreme Court clearly has established that constitutional due process protections apply in the juvenile setting. <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967). In <em>In re Gault, </em>supra, 27-28, the court explained that \u201c[i]t is of no constitutional consequence\u2014and of limited practical meaning\u2014that the institution to which [a child] is committed is called an Industrial School. The fact of the matter is that, however euphemistic the title, a \u2018receiving home\u2019 or an \u2018industrial school\u2019 for juveniles is an institution of confinement in which the child is incarcerated for a greater or lesser time. ... In view of this, it would be extraordinary if our Constitution did not require the procedural regularity and the exercise of care implied in the phrase \u2018due process.\u2019 Under our Constitution, the condition of being a [child] does not justify a kangaroo court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Thus, the question we must answer is not whether due process applies in the juvenile setting, but rather to what extent are those procedural safeguards applicable. Id., 13-14.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The underlying difficulty in this analysis arises because the state has a \u201cparens patriae interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child . . . .\u201d <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 766, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982). The state\u2019s role in juvenile proceedings presents a fundamental difference from adult criminal trials, where no such interest exists. <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>467 U.S. 253, 263, 104 S. Ct. 2403, 81 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">This court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Steven G., </em>210 Conn. 435, 556 A.2d 131 (1989), demonstrates such a conflict. In that case, the juvenile respondent claimed that his rights to adequate and fair notice had been violated when the state was permitted, after the trial had commenced, to amend its petition, adding additional charges arising out of the same incident. Id., 436. In affirming the Appellate Court\u2019s decision to uphold the trial court\u2019s allowance of the amended petition, we underscored \u201cthe need to balance the state\u2019s essentially nonpunitive objectives in juvenile delinquency proceedings with the fundamental demands of due process.\u201d Id., 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">This attempt to balance fundamental fairness with the unique characteristics of the juvenile justice system is also exemplified through the handling of juvenile matters in our rules of practice. Practice Book \u00a7 34-2 (a) provides that \u201c[a]ll [juvenile] hearings are essentially civil proceedings except where otherwise provided by statute. Testimony may be given in narrative form and the proceedings shall at all times be as informal as the requirements of due process and fairness permit.\u201d Thus, we have tried \u201cto strike a balance\u2014to respect the informality and flexibility that characterize juvenile proceedings . . . and yet to ensure that such proceedings comport with the fundamental fairness demanded by the Due Process Clause.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 467 U.S. 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>In an attempt to strike such a balance between the unique characteristics associated with juvenile proceedings and the fundamental fairness required by due process, we compare these aspects in relation to our present facts. We begin by noting that in choosing to enter a guilty plea, an adult defendant necessarily waives several constitutional rights, including his privilege against self-incrimination and right to confrontation. See <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 395 U.S. 243; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 394 U.S. 466; <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 503. For this reason, we require that the defendant make that decision knowingly and intelligently in order to comport with due process. See <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 243; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 466; <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 503. Additionally, the Supreme Court has held that certain rights are so fundamental to an accurate fact-finding process that they not only extend to adults, but also to juveniles. <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>403 U.S. 528, 543, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1971). These rights include notice of charges, right to counsel, privilege against self-incrimination, right to confrontation and cross-examination; <em>In re Gault, </em>supra, 387 U.S. 31-57; proof beyond a reasonable doubt; <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); and the prohibition against double jeopardy. <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519, 95 S. Ct. 1779, 44 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1975). Thus, when the respondents in the present case made their decisions to enter a nolo plea, they necessarily waived some of the same rights that require an adult defendant to make a knowing and voluntary plea. Moreover, we note that Practice Book \u00a7 31-1 (c) specifically requires that a juvenile\u2019s plea be knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>In that regard, it is important to understand that \u201c \u2018commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>463 U.S. 354, 361, 103 S. Ct. 3043, 77 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1983), quoting <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 425, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 60 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1979). \u201cA proceeding where the issue is whether the child will be found to be \u2018delinquent\u2019 and subjected to the loss of his liberty for years is comparable in seriousness to a felony prosecution.\u201d <em>In re Gault, </em>supra, 387 U.S. 36. \u201c[Commitment is a deprivation of liberty. It is incarceration against one\u2019s will, whether it is called \u2018criminal\u2019 or \u2018civil.\u2019 \u201d Id., 50. The seriousness involved in the confinement of a juvenile compels us to conclude that the decision to enter a plea has no less of an implication on the rights of a juvenile than it does on the rights of an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">We weigh the importance of requiring a knowing and voluntary plea against the need to maintain \u201cinformality and flexibility\u201d in the juvenile setting; <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 467 U.S. 263; and conclude that there will be little, if any, negative effect of such a requirement on the distinctiveness of the juvenile proceeding. Indeed, we see nothing to suggest that the requirement \u201crisk[s] destruction of beneficial aspects of the juvenile process.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>supra, 397 U.S. 366.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ment, however, claims that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>supra, 403 U.S. 528, undermines any argument for the extension of the advisement to juvenile proceedings. We conclude that the department\u2019s reliance on that case is misguided. In <em>McKeiver, </em>the court refused to extend the right to a trial by jury to juvenile proceedings. In concluding that our legal system does not require a jury for accurate fact-finding, the court cited equity, workers\u2019 compensation, probate, and deportation cases as examples wherein a jury is not required. Id., 543. The court also determined that \u201c[t]here is a possibility, at least, that the jury trial, if required as a matter of constitutional precept, will remake the juvenile proceeding into a fully adversary process and will put an effective end to what has been the idealistic prospect of an intimate, informal protective proceeding.\u201d Id., 545. We have no reason to believe that the unique setting presented by a juvenile proceeding similarly will be damaged by requiring that a juvenile be advised of the possibility of commitment extension before a plea is accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Because of the seriousness involved in the institutionalization of a juvenile, and the lack of a negative effect on juvenile proceedings, we conclude that a juvenile is entitled to be advised of the possibility of commitment extensions when making a plea. The status of being a juvenile does not warrant abandonment of the well established rule that a defendant be advised of the direct consequences of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-141 (b) provides: \u201cThe Commissioner of Children and Families may petition the court for an extension of the commitment as provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) beyond the eighteen-month period on the grounds that such extension is for the best interest of the child or the community.

[None of those cases has held] that there are direct consequences to a guilty plea other than those enumerated in \u00a7 39-19.

Therefore, <em>Collins . . . </em>does not stand for the proposition that the trial court must advise the defendant of <em>any consequence </em>to a plea that may increase the actual time he will spend in prison.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 508-509.

The Supreme Court, however, also has refused to extend certain rights to the juvenile setting. See, e.g., <em>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, </em>403 US. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L.

Nor will there be any effect on the informality, flexibility, or speed of the hearing at which the factfinding takes place. And the opportunity during the post-adjudicatory or dispositional hearing for a wide-ranging review of the child\u2019s social history and for his individualized treatment will remain unimpaired. Similarly, there will be no effect on the procedures distinctive to juvenile proceedings that are employed prior to the adjudicatory hearing.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>supra, 397 U.S. 366-67.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
