After a hearing held pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>32 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court, <em>Rodriguez, J., </em>found the defendant, Emanuel Smith,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in violation of one of the conditions of his probation and rendered judgment imposing the defendant\u2019s original sentence of eight years imprisonment, which had been suspended. The defendant appeals, claiming a violation of his due process rights under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The following facts are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. On March 21, 1995, the defendant pleaded guilty to several offenses under two separate, unrelated cases. In the first case, the defendant pleaded guilty to the charges of burglary in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the second case, the defendant pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>guilty to a violation of probation in violation of \u00a7 53a-32,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with the underlying offenses being possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-277 (a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and interfering with an officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the first case, the trial court, <em>Mints, J., </em>imposed a sentence of ten years imprisonment, execution suspended after four years, followed by five years probation; and in the second case, a sentence of two years imprisonment to run consecutive to the first sentence. Thus, the court approved a total effective sentence of twelve years imprisonment, execution suspended after four years, followed by five years probation. The original conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation included no contact with the victim, compliance with a standing criminal restraining order, substance abuse evaluation, and \u201ctreatment as deemed appropriate.\u201d While the defendant was incarcerated, his probation officer, Dale Thur-ston, modified the defendant\u2019s probation to include participation in a sex offender treatment program.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>copy of the amended condition was delivered to the defendant in prison, which he signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Upon the defendant\u2019s release from prison, William Anselmo, who was the probation officer now overseeing the defendant\u2019s case, made an appointment for the defendant at the sex offender unit of special services in Norwalk, and informed him of that date. Anselmo stressed to the defendant the importance of the evaluation process. Anselmo stated that the time allotted for the defendant to meet with the therapist would be very limited, and that even being fifteen minutes late for an appointment could prevent the therapist from meeting with the defendant. The evaluation process, if the defendant were cooperative, normally could be completed in three to four visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">After attending a few meetings on time, the defendant arrived late to a meeting on February 24, 1998, did not receive an evaluation that day, and was informed that he would be removed from the program if he were late again. On March 24, 1998, the defendant arrived late again and was told that he was expelled from the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Thereafter, the probation department moved to have the defendant\u2019s probation revoked. At the revocation hearing, the trial court determined that the defendant had violated his probation because he failed to comply with the condition of probation regarding sexual offender treatment. The trial court then sentenced the defendant to the unexecuted term of his original sentence.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant appealed from the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">This appeal is limited to the following issues: (1) whether the modification of the defendant\u2019s probation by the office of adult probation without a hearing and counsel denied him due process of law under the federal constitution;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (2) if the modified condition of probation was validly imposed, did the trial court abuse its discretion in concluding that the defendant violated his probation and that the rehabilitative needs of probation were no longer being met?</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The defendant, at the revocation hearing, did not claim that his probation was modified in violation of his due process rights under the federal or state constitution and, therefore, asks this court to review his unpreserved claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69-70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40. \u201cThe first two steps in the <em>Golding </em>analysis address the reviewability of the claim, while the last two steps involve the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>246 Conn. 268, 275, 717 A.2d 168 (1998). We review the defendant\u2019s claim because the record is adequate for review and the claim is constitutional in nature. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>253 Conn. 354, 359, 752 A.2d 40 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 308-309, 630 A.2d 593 (1993). The defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>however, because we conclude that due process does not require a court hearing or counsel before the office of adult probation modifies a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Over the past seventy years, the United States Supreme Court has expanded the protections afforded a defendant regarding the right to counsel and the right to a court hearing in criminal proceedings. See <em>Arger-singer </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25, 37, 92 S. Ct. 2006, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530 (1972) (expanding right to counsel to state felony or misdemeanor cases through fourteenth amendment); <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 41, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967) (right to counsel attaches at juvenile proceedings in which institutional confinement would result); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 462, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938) (right to counsel expanded to attach to all federal cases); <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Ala</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number><em>bama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 71, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (indigents afforded right to counsel under sixth amendment in all federal capital offense cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">In addition, the Supreme Court also has sought to establish certain minimum procedural protections for individuals on parole and probation. In <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 482-83, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972), the court held that the due process clause requires that an individual on parole be afforded a hearing before his parole is revoked. In determining whether the nature of the parolee\u2019s interest was within the due process protection of the fourteenth amendment, the court stated: \u201cThe parolee has been released from prison based on an evaluation that he shows reasonable promise of being able to return to society and function as a responsible, self-reliant person. Subject to the conditions of his parole, he can be gainfully employed and is free to be with family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments of normal life. Though the State properly subjects him to many restrictions not applicable to other citizens, his condition is very different from that of confinement in a prison. He may have been on parole for a number of years and may be living a relatively normal life at the time he is faced with revocation. The parolee has relied on at least an implicit promise that parole will be revoked only if he fails to live up to the parole conditions. In many cases, the parolee faces lengthy incarceration if his parole is revoked. We see, therefore, that the liberty of a parolee, although indeterminate, includes many of the core values of unqualified liberty and its termination inflicts a \u2018grievous loss\u2019 on the parolee and often on others.\u201d Id., 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Subsequently, in <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S. Ct. 1756, 36 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1973), the Supreme Court affirmed the principles set forth in <em>Morrissey </em>and held that, because revocation of probation results in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>the same loss of liberty, the same guarantee of due process applies to revocations of probation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Relying on the standard set forth in <em>Morrissey </em>and <em>Gagnon, </em>the defendant in the present case argues that modifications of probation result in a loss of liberty similar to the loss caused by revocation, and he urges this court to extend due process procedural protection to probation modifications. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">We previously have never considered whether due process requires that an individual on probation be afforded an opportunity to be heard with counsel before the office of adult probation may modify the defendant\u2019s conditions of probation. Although the right to counsel and a hearing has been expanded over the years, particularly with regard to parole and probation revocations, we agree with the numerous federal and state courts that have held that due process does not require a court hearing or counsel before the conditions of an individual\u2019s probation may be modified. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>83 F.3d 289, 292 (9th Cir. 1996) (extension of probation period); <em>Forgues </em>v. <em>United States, </em>636 F.2d 1125, 1127 (6th Cir. 1980) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cornwell, </em>625 F.2d 686, 688-89 (5th Cir. 1980) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>565 F.2d 545, 546-47 (8th Cir. 1977) (same); <em>Skipworth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>508 F.2d 598, 600-602 (3d Cir. 1975) (same); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>State, </em>216 Ga. App. 740, 741, 456 S.E.2d 213 (1995) (adding condition of completing sex offender treatment); <em>People </em>v. <em>Britt, </em>202 Mich. App. 714, 716-17, 509 N.W.2d 914 (1993) (adding condition that defendant wear electronic monitor or tether); <em>Ockel </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>541 S.W.2d 535, 544 (Mo. 1976) (extension of probation period); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeisler, </em>19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Ohio App. 3d 138, 141, 483 N.E.2d 493 (1984) (adding condition that defendant complete probation diversion program); <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>State, </em>603 S.W.2d 869, 870 (Tex. App. 1980) (adding condition that defendant ingest anta-buse). Accordingly, we conclude that an order of probation may be modified by the probation authorities ex parte, and that there is no requirement that the defendant be given a court hearing with the benefit of counsel before the modification properly may occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The key distinction regarding this issue is that a modification of an individual\u2019s probation does not require the same procedural protections as a probation revocation. In particular, the nature of the interest and the loss resulting from a modification simply do not parallel the fundamental nature of the interest or the seriousness of the loss involved in <em>Morrissey </em>or <em>Gagnon. </em>The primary loss occasioned by a modification of a condition of probation is still only the possibility of future revocation, a loss that potentially occurs only if the condition is not met.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because a probationer is entitled to a hearing prior to revocation, the potential of loss caused by modifying a condition of probation is not considered sufficiently grievous to require a hearing. See <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 482; see also <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 224-25, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1976) (rejecting argument that \u201cany\u201d loss is sufficient to invoke due process, noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>that \u201cdetermining factor is the nature of the interest involved rather than its weight\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Revocation proceedings often resolve a contested factual determination that requires the trial court to decide whether there was, in fact, a violation of probation. For modifications of probation, however, it is not necessary for the trial court to make a finding of a probation violation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, an individual on probation has an opportunity at the probation revocationproceeding to contest the modified condition. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooley, </em>3 Conn. App. 410, 414-15, 488 A.2d 1283, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 805, 492 A.2d 1241 (1985) (defendant\u2019s probation will not be revoked on ground that he violated condition of probation if that condition is shown at revocation hearing to have no rehabilitative purpose). Even prior to the violation of probation hearing, if an individual on probation believes that the office of adult probation imposed an unreasonable condition, he may request a hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (c).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Although \u201c[probation is the product of statute\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 167, 540 A.2d 679 (1988); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-29<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> et seq.; modifications of probation routinely are left to the office of adult probation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> When the court imposes probation, a defendant thereby accepts the possibility that the terms of probation may be modified or enlarged in the future pursuant to \u00a7 53a-30.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Thorp, </em>57 Conn. App. 112, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>117, 121, 747 A.2d 537, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 913, 754 A.2d 162 (2000) (court approved adult probation office\u2019s requirement of sex offender treatment for probationer where such treatment had not been explicitly included in court-ordered terms of probation; due process does not require hearing); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mobley, </em>42 Conn. Sup. 574, 591-95, 634 A.2d 305, aff'd, 33 Conn. App. 103, 105, 633 A.2d 726 (1993), cert. denied, 228 Conn. 917, 636 A.2d 849 (1994) (adopting as well reasoned trial court\u2019s \u201cdetailed and comprehensive memorandum of decision\u201d). Thus, requiring a hearing with counsel every time a condition of probation is modified by the office of adult probation would severely impair the supervisory and rehabilitative role of the office of adult probation. We also are persuaded that the additional condition imposed on the defendant, attending sex offender treatment, was not unreasonable because the condition could have been included in the original probation conditions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>We conclude that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution does not require notice and a hearing with the benefit of counsel prior to an order modifying the terms of probation. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The defendant also claims that, although \u00a7 53a-30 (b),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the statute addressing modifications of probation, does not require a court hearing before the office of adult probation may modify a condition, such a procedure is required because of the accompanying provision of \u00a7 53a-30 (c).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is well settled that this court will not review statutory claims that are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>198 Conn. 397, 401-402, 503 A.2d 163 (1986). Furthermore, statutory, nonconstitutional claims are not reviewable under <em>Golding. </em>Id. Based on the defendant\u2019s admission at oral argument before this court that this statutory argument was not raised in the trial court, we find no basis in the record to consider his newly raised statutory claim, which was \u201cnever called to the attention of the trial court and upon which it necessarily could have made no ruling in the true sense of the word . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>153 Conn. 72, 86, 214 A.2d 362 (1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 921, 86 S. Ct. 1372, 16 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1966); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The defendant next claims that, even if the modified condition of probation validly had been imposed, the trial court abused its discretion and improperly revoked his probation because: (1) the defendant\u2019s tardy arrivals at the sex offender treatment sessions did not warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>revocation of probation; and (2) the rehabilitative purposes of probation were still being served. Having reviewed the record, briefs and arguments of the parties, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is entirely without merit because the late arrivals and uncooperative attitude were sufficient grounds to revoke his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">\u201cThe standard of review of an order revoking probation is whether the trial court abused its discretion; if it appears that the trial court was reasonably satisfied that the terms of probation had been violated, and, impliedly, that the beneficial proposes of probation were no longer being served, then the order must stand.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>165 Conn. 73, 80, 327 A.2d 556 (1973). In making this determination, the trial court is vested with broad discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 167 (defendant who seeks to reverse exercise of judicial discretion assumes heavy burden); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 290, 641 A.2d 370 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Repetti, </em>60 Conn. App. 614, 619-20, 760 A.2d 964 (2000) , cert. denied, 255 Conn. 923, 763 A.2d 1040 (2001) ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Treat, </em>38 Conn. App. 762, 767, 664 A.2d 785, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 920, 665 A.2d 907 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">We recognize that, in the present case, sex offender treatment was a key component of the rehabilitative process because it was directly connected to one of the underlying crimes to which the defendant had pleaded guilty. Failure to comply with a condition of probation is a sufficient basis upon which to order a violation of probation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 302; <em>State </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>40 Conn. App. 395, 401-402, 671 A.2d 379, cert. denied, 236 Conn. 918, 673 A.2d 1145 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Treat, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 765-66; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMasi, </em>34 Conn. App. 46, 56, 640 A.2d 138, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 906, 644 A.2d 920 (1994). Here, the defendant failed to complete the conditions of his probation because he repeatedly had arrived late to the sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>offender treatment sessions. Moreover, the defendant was told multiple times about the importance of the evaluation process and sex offender treatment sessions, that he must be there on time, and that if he were late, the therapist would not be able to meet with him. In fact, prior to being terminated from the sex offender treatment session in March, 1998, the defendant was told that if he were late one more time he would be removed from the treatment program. Lastly, the defendant indicated that he could not arrange to arrive on time and his actions demonstrated that the treatment sessions were not a priority in his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The trial court, therefore, reasonably could have found that, without the treatment, the likelihood of the defendant committing such crimes again had not decreased, and that the goals of rehabilitation were not being adequately met.
