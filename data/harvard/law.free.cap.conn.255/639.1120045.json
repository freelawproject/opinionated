The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the trial court properly denied Brayton\u2019s motion to dismiss even though the plaintiffs right to recover against Bray-ton for his alleged malpractice had been extinguished by virtue of Brayton\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy. The plaintiff claims that the trial court properly concluded that she may maintain her action against Brayton because she seeks a judgment against Brayton solely for the purpose of obtaining a recovery under a professional liability insurance policy (policy) under which Brayton was insured and not against Brayton personally. Brayton contends that, because the policy contains a provision stating that Continental\u2019s \u201cright and duty to defend\u201d is subject to a $5000 deductible payable by Brayton, the plaintiffs action exposes him to personal liability and, therefore, the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss in violation of the fresh start policy of the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court properly denied Brayton\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>For purposes of this appeal, we accept as true the following facts alleged by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff retained Brayton to perform certain legal services for her and for the estate of her deceased father, who died in 1991. Brayton allegedly performed those services negligently, thereby causing \u201cinjury, loss and damage\u201d to the plaintiff and to her father\u2019s estate. When Brayton performed those services, he was covered under a professional liability insurance policy issued by Continental. That policy, which contains a liability limit of one million dollars, requires the payment of a deductible and declares that Continental\u2019s \u201cright and duty to defend\u201d any action brought against Brayton is subject to Brayton\u2019s payment of the first $5000 in costs, expenses or damages resulting from such action. Under the policy, these costs and expenses include attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">On November 22, 1996, subsequent to his alleged negligent representation of the plaintiff, Brayton filed a bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq. (Sup. II 1996). Brayton\u2019s petition, which alleged that he had no assets, named the plaintiff as a creditor. Brayton thereafter received a discharge in bankruptcy, thereby extinguishing any right that the plaintiff would have had to recover against Brayton stemming from Brayton\u2019s alleged legal malpractice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>After Brayton\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy, the plaintiff filed this action against Brayton and Continental seeking recovery only to the extent of Brayton\u2019s coverage under the policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Continental agreed to defend the action against Brayton while reserving its right to deny coverage in the event that Brayton\u2019s conduct fell outside the scope of the policy\u2019s coverage or within a policy exclusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Brayton moved to dismiss the complaint against him on the ground that the action violates the fresh start policy of the Bankruptcy Code; see footnote 3 of this opinion and accompanying text; in that the action subjects him to exposure under the $5000 deductible provision of the policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court denied Bray-ton\u2019s motion to dismiss, and Brayton filed a petition for certification to appeal from the denial of that motion pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Justice Borden, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>acting in the absence of the Chief Justice, granted Bray-ton\u2019s petition under \u00a7 52-265a.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">On appeal, Brayton renews his claim that the plaintiffs action against him violates the fresh start policy of the Bankruptcy Code. Specifically, Brayton asserts that the plaintiffs action exposes him to personal liability because the policy requires him to pay the first $5000 in costs, expenses or damages incurred in connection with that action. The plaintiff counters that her action does not expose Brayton to any personal liability and, therefore, does not violate the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s fresh start policy because Brayton\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy released him from any obligation to Continental notwithstanding the $5000 deductible provision in the policy. We agree with the plaintiff. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Before addressing the merits of Brayton\u2019s claim, we note, preliminarily, that, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727, a debtor whose bankruptcy petition satisfies the requirements of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code generally is entitled to the discharge of any debt that arose prior to the filing of the petition. The discharge of a debt pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u00a7 727 triggers the operation of the provisions of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which shield the debtor from any personal liability for that debt by affording the debtor the right to \u201can injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action ... to collect, recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability of the debtor ____\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524 (a) (2) (1994). Llowever, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524 (e)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> expressly provides that the relief accorded the debtor under the provisions of \u00a7 524 does not extend to other parties. \u201cTogether, the language of these sections reveals that Congress sought to free the debtor of his [or her] personal obligations while ensuring that no one else reaps a similar benefit.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Welsh, </em>956 F.2d 30, 33 (2d Cir. 1992); accord <em>Terwilliger </em>v. <em>Terwilliger, </em>206 F.3d 240, 247 (2d Cir. 2000). Thus, \u201cthe purpose of [\u00a7] 524 of the Bankruptcy Code is to protect the debtor and not to shield third parties such as insurers who may be liable on behalf of the debtor. . . . The fresh-start policy is not intended to provide a method by which an insurer can escape its obligations based simply on the financial misfortunes of the insured.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jet Florida Systems, Inc., </em>883 F.2d 970, 975 (11th Cir. 1989). Furthermore, as Brayton concedes, a claimant is not barred from obtaining a judgment against a discharged debtor solely for the purpose of establishing the debtor\u2019s liability when, as in the present case, a judgment against the debtor is a prerequisite to recovering against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>debtor\u2019s insurer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 38a-321.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>bears emphasis, however, that \u201c[t]his exception to the permanent injunction under [\u00a7] 524 (a) is necessarily conditioned upon the debtor\u2019s being exempted from any exposure to personal expense or liability, resulting from the creditor\u2019s action, which would imperil [his or her] fresh start. <em>... In re Walker, </em>[927 F.2d 1138, 1142 (10th Cir. 1991)]; <em>In re Jet [FloridaSystems, Inc., </em>supra, 975]; <em>In re Edgeworth, </em>[993 F.2d 51, 53-54 (5th Cir. 1993)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>224 B.R. 315, 323 (Bankr. D. Md. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Finally, \u201c[a] claim will be deemed pre-petition when it arises out of a relationship recognized in, for example, the law of contracts or torts. A claim exists only if before the filing of the bankruptcy petition, the relationship between the debtor and the creditor contained all of the elements necessary to give rise to a legal obligation\u2014a right to payment\u2014under the relevant non-bankruptcy law.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Cha-teaugay Corp., </em>53 F.3d 478, 497 (2d Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Brayton contends that the plaintiff cannot maintain her action against him without subjecting him to personal liability because he is responsible for paying the first $5000 in costs, expenses or damages incurred in connection with the defense of the plaintiffs action pursuant to the provisions of the policy. In other words, Brayton claims that, even though the plaintiff does not seek to recover against him personally, her action violates the fresh start policy of the Bankruptcy Code in light of Brayton\u2019s obligation to pay up to a $5000 deductible under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">We would agree with Brayton\u2019s claim that, if the deductible were enforceable by Continental, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>plaintiffs action against Brayton would run afoul of the Bankruptcy Code because Brayton would be required to pay up to $5000 in connection with a discharged claim, namely, the plaintiffs claim against him for legal malpractice. We conclude, however, that Brayton\u2019s obligation to pay the deductible to Continental also was extinguished when he received his discharge in bankruptcy and, consequently, Brayton has no exposure to personal liability under the provisions of the policy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The Bankruptcy Code defines \u201cdebt\u201d as a \u201cliability on a claim . . . .\u201d11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (12) (1994). \u201cThis definition reveals Congress\u2019 intent that the meanings of \u2018debt\u2019 and \u2018claim\u2019 be coextensive.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>495 U.S. 552, 558, 110 S. Ct. 2126, 109 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1990). A \u201cclaim\u201d is defined under the Bankruptcy Code as a \u201cright to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured . . . .\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (5) (A) (1994). \u201cCongress intended by this language to adopt the broadest available definition of \u2018claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Home State Bank, </em>501 U.S. 78, 83, 111 S. Ct. 2150, 115 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1991). \u201cBy this broadest possible definition ... [of the term claim, the Bankruptcy Code] contemplates that all legal obligations of the debtor, <em>no matter how remote or contingent, </em>will be able to be dealt with in the bankruptcy case.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Chateaugay Corp., </em>944 F.2d 997, 1003 (2d Cir. 1991), quoting H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 309 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6266; see also 2 W. Collier, Bankruptcy (15th Ed. Rev. 2000) \u00b6 101.05 [1], pp. 101-25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>through 101-27. \u201cThe Bankruptcy Code does not specifically define contingent claims. However, in the context of a contract claim, [as in the present case] . . . contingent claims refer to obligations that will become due upon the happening of a future event that was within the actual or presumed contemplation of the parties at the time the original relationship between the parties was created.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Manville Forest Products Corp., </em>209 F.3d 125, 128-29 (2d Cir. 2000), quoting <em>In re Chateaugay Corp., </em>supra, 944 F.2d 1004; see also 2 W. Collier, supra, \u00b6 101.05 [1], pp. 101-26 through 101-27 (\u201c \u2018Claim\u2019 may . . . include a cause of action or right to payment that has not yet accrued or become cognizable. Neither the contingency of the debt nor the immaturity of the obligation affects whether a right to payment is a claim. A creditor\u2019s right to payment that arose from the earliest point in the relationship between debtor and creditor is a claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">In applying the foregoing principles of bankruptcy law to the present case, we are persuaded that the deductible required by the policy is an obligation that was extinguished by virtue of Brayton\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy. Payment of the deductible is an obligation of the policyholder, Brayton, that was contingent upon the occurrence of a future event, namely, the filing of a malpractice claim against Brayton within the time period covered by the policy. Because an obligation is subject to discharge even if it is contingent, the dis-chargeability of Brayton\u2019s obligation to pay the deductible pursuant to the provisions of the policy was not affected by the fact that, when Brayton purchased the policy, it was uncertain whether and how much Brayton might be required to pay as a deductible. Although the deductible provision in the policy did not give rise to a <em>payment </em>obligation until after the plaintiff had commenced her action against Brayton, the deductible constituted an obligation that would \u201cbecome due upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the happening of a future event that was within the actual . . . contemplation of [Brayton and Continental] at the time the original [prepetition] relationship between [them] was created.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Manville Forest Products Corp., </em>supra, 209 F.3d 128-29; see also <em>In re Rosteck, </em>899 F.2d 694, 696-97 (7th Cir. 1990); <em>In re Lamb, </em>171 B.R. 52, 55 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 1994); <em>In re Wasp, </em>137 B.R. 71, 72-73 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1992); <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Morse Shoe Co., </em>218 App. Div. 2d 624, 625-26, 630 N.Y.S.2d 1003 (1995). In other words, Continental\u2019s right to recover against Brayton pursuant to the deductible provision in the policy constitutes a dis-chargeable claim for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code because Brayton\u2019s obligation under the deductible provision of the policy existed prepetition and, although his payment obligation thereunder was contingent on the occurrence of an event in the future, that future occurrence\u2014the filing of a legal malpractice action against Brayton\u2014was within the contemplation of Brayton and Continental when the policy was issued. Indeed, Brayton purchased the Continental policy to insure against the risk of a claim being filed against him arising from his professional negligence. We conclude, therefore, that Continental\u2019s right to recover the deductible from Brayton was extinguished when Brayton was granted his discharge in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Because Brayton has no enforceable obligation to pay the deductible to Continental under the policy, the plaintiff can maintain her action against Brayton\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>solely for the purpose of obtaining a judgment against Brayton as a necessary prerequisite to seeking a recovery against Continental\u2014without subjecting Brayton to any exposure to personal liability under the policy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The plaintiffs action against Brayton, therefore, does not violate the fresh start policy of the Bankruptcy Code. Consequently, the trial court properly denied Brayton\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The decision of the trial court denying Brayton\u2019s motion to dismiss is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-5\"> The plaintiff brought this action in her individual capacity and as executrix of the estate of her deceased father, Victor Benedetto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-6\"> Continental is a party to the underlying action but is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\"> \"For nearly 100 years it has been the primary purpose of the old Bankruptcy Act and now the new Bankruptcy Code to relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness and permit him [or her] to start afresh, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>[United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co.], </em>236 U.S. 549, 554-55, 35 S.

Each insurance company which issues a policy to any person, firm or corporation, insuring against loss or damage on account of the bodily iivjury or death by accident of any person, or damage to the property of any person, for which loss or damage such person, firm or corporation is legally responsible, shall, whenever a loss occurs under such policy, become absolutely liable, and the payment of such loss shall not depend upon the satisfaction by the assured of a final judgment against him for loss, damage or death occasioned by such casualty. No such contract of insurance shall be cancelled or annulled by any agreement between the insurance company and the assured after the assured has become responsible for such loss or damage, and any such cancellation or annulment shall be void. Upon the recovery of a final judgment against any person, firm or corporation by any person, including administrators or executors, for loss or damage on account of bodily injury or death or damage to property, if the defendant in such action was insured against such loss or damage at the time when the right of action arose and if such judgment is not satisfied within thirty days after the date when it was rendered, such judgment creditor shall be subrogated to all the rights of the defendant and shall have a right of action against the insurer to the same extent that the defendant in such action could have enforced his claim against such insurer had such defendant paid such judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\"> In this case, the relevant nonbankruptcy law is, of course, state contract law. Furthermore, as we have indicated, it is undisputed that Continental issued its policy to Brayton prepetition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\"> We note that Brayton makes no claim that his failure to name Continental as a creditor in his bankruptcy petition, which alleged that he had no assets, affects the dischargeability of his obligation to Continental. Cf. <em>In re Madaj, </em>149 F.3d 467, 472 (6th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\"> As we have indicated, Brayton, in accordance with the terms of the deductible provision of the policy, has paid attorney\u2019s fees totaling $1252.34 in connection with the defense of the plaintiffs action. See footnote 8 of this opinion. In light of our conclusion regarding the dischargeability of Brayton\u2019s obligation to pay the deductible, it is apparent that Brayton had a complete defense to any claim by Continental that he make such payment. For purposes of this appeal, we need not consider the propriety of Bray-ton\u2019s payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b673-15\"> We note that Brayton may be required to participate in further proceedings relating to this case, including, for example, deposition or trial testimony, as requested by the plaintiff or Continental. This fact alone, however, does not impermissibly interfere with his fresh start; see, e.g., <em>In re Doar, </em>234 B.R. 203, 206 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1999); and Brayton makes no such claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
