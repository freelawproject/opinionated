The plaintiffs, Sebastian Gangemi and Rebecca J. Gangemi, appeal, pursuant to our grant of certification, from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the judgment of the trial court. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the defendant\u2019s denial of their application to invalidate the no rental condition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly dismissed their appeal because the continued maintenance of the condition violates the strong public policy against restraints on the alienation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In 1986, the plaintiffs secured a zoning variance from the board, one condition of which was \u201c[o]wner occupancy only.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1996, the Fairfield zoning enforcement officer determined that the plaintiffs were violating the condition by renting their property, and he ordered them to comply with the condition. The plaintiffs applied to the board requesting that it invalidate the condition. The board denied the application. The plaintiffs appealed to the trial court, which rendered judgment dismissing the appeal. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Gangemi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>54 Conn. App. 559, 736 A.2d 167 (1999). This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The procedural history and certain of the undisputed facts of the case are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court as follows. \u201c[T]he plaintiffs are the owners of property located at 863 Fairfield Beach Road in Fairfield. On March 13, 1986, the plaintiffs filed an application with the board requesting a variance in the setback requirements from the Fairfield zoning regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tions. The variance that the plaintiffs sought would have allowed them to enlarge their nonconforming home<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and also would have allowed them to convert the home from summer use to year-round use. The plaintiffs asserted that to complete the conversion of the home, they needed to enclose the existing porch, enlarge the bathroom and construct a furnace room. In their application, the plaintiffs indicated that they \u2018[intended] to use the property for family use only on a year-round basis.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u201cThe board conducted a public hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application. On May 1,1986, the board granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application subject to the following conditions: (1) the plaintiffs would provide two off-street parking spaces; and (2) the use of the home would be limited to family use and would not be used for rental purposes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs did not appeal or otherwise challenge the validity or imposition of either condition. Thereafter, in 1990, the plaintiffs moved out of the home and started renting the property to various tenants. On May 20,1996, Peter Marsala, Fairfield\u2019s zoning enforcement officer, issued to the plaintiffs an order to comply that indicated that the plaintiffs were violating the board\u2019s conditional approval by renting the home and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ordered the plaintiffs to have the tenants vacate the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u201cThereafter, on June 3, 1996, the plaintiffs filed an application with the board requesting that the board invalidate the no rental condition and, thereby, reverse the order to comply. On August 1, 1996, the board conducted a public hearing and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court on August 21,1996, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (b). The Superior Court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to file an appeal challenging the validity of the no rental condition within fifteen days from the date when notice of the board\u2019s decision was published in 1986 deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\u201d Id.,'561-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In addition, certain other sets of facts are undisputed. The first involves the extent and context of the variance at issue as it is currently maintained. The variance permitted the plaintiffs to reduce the required side setback line from 7 feet to 3.2 feet, thus giving them an additional 3.8 feet of footprint and adding 59.6 square feet to then-house. In this connection, we note that the variance also gave the plaintiffs permission to convert the house from a seasonal cottage to a year-round dwelling by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>enclosing the open porch and adding a one-story addition in order to enlarge the bathroom and construct a furnace room. At oral argument before this court, the parties informed us that, at the time the variance was granted, applicable zoning regulations permitted only seasonal use of the plaintiffs\u2019 property. The parties further informed us, however, that the zoning regulations have since been amended to eliminate the prior seasonal restriction, thereby permitting year-round use.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, under the current zoning regulations, the plaintiffs\u2019 house, as well as all of the other houses in the Fairfield beach district, may now be used year-round irrespective of the variance and its original conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Second, the property in question is located within the Fairfield beach district, which is subject to \u00a7 11.1.1 of the Fairfield zoning regulations. Section 11.1.1 of the Fairfield zoning regulations imposes the following limitations: \u201cA single detached dwelling for one family . . . [and] no dwelling or dwelling unit in the Beach District may be occupied by more than four (4) unrelated persons.\u201d Thus, there is nothing in the zoning regulations that prohibits either the plaintiffs or any other property owners in the beach district from renting their houses to others. Moreover, there is nothing in our zoning statutes that, at least specifically, permits such a flat prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The third set of facts involves the absence from the applicable zoning restrictions of any provision limiting occupancy to \u201cfamilies.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The only restriction in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>regard is in \u00a7 11.1.1 of the Fairfield zoning regulations that \u201cno dwelling or dwelling unit in the Beach District may be occupied by more than four (4) unrelated persons.\u201d Thus, presumably all other property owners in the beach district are permitted, and but for the no rental condition in question the plaintiffs would be permitted, to rent their houses to four friends or, for that matter, to four individuals who do not even know one another but who are willing to share a beach rental for the summer\u2014or even for the entire year. In fact, <em>all </em>the property owners in the beach district, <em>including </em>the plaintiffs, could legally <em>sell </em>their properties to four such individuals. The point is that the town has not seen fit to limit occupancy in the beach district beyond these two elements: (1) no more than four unrelated persons; and (2) occupying a single-family type structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">With this undisputed factual background in mind, we turn to the legal standard that controls the present case. In <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 96, 102, 616 A.2d 793 (1992), we held that the plaintiff, \u201chaving secured [certain zoning] permits in 1983 subject to condition seven and not having challenged the condition by appeal at that time, was precluded from doing so in the 1986 enforcement proceedings at issue in this case.\u201d Two considerations, which are relevant to the present case,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> led to that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">First, we reasoned that the rules requiring a contemporaneous appeal from the imposition of a zoning condition, and thus depriving a trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over a subsequent challenge, rest \u201con the need for stability in land use planning and the need for justified reliance by all interested parties\u2014the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ested property owner, any interested neighbors and the town\u2014on the decisions of the zoning authorities.\u201d Id. Second, we noted that \u201cthere are limits to the notion that subject matter jurisdictional defects may be raised at any time\u201d; id., 103; and that those limits applied to that case because \u201c[t]he lack of jurisdiction, if any, was far from obvious, [the plaintiff] had the opportunity to challenge it at the time, and we perceive [d] no strong policy reasons to give [the plaintiff] a second opportunity to do so now.\u201d Id., 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Despite this conclusion and reasoning, however, we \u201crecognize[d] . . . that there may be exceptional cases in which a previously unchallenged condition was so far outside what could have been regarded as a valid exercise of zoning power that there could not have been any justified reliance on it, <em>or in which the continued maintenance of a previously unchallenged condition would violate some strong public </em>policy.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 104-105. We conclude that, under the facts of the present case, the continued maintenance of the no rental condition violates our strong public policy against restrictions on the free alienability of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">We begin by emphasizing that, under this prong of the <em>Upjohn Co. </em>formulation, we focus, not on the state of affairs that existed when the condition at issue originally was imposed, but on the current state of affairs in which the condition is being enforced. Thus, in the present case, we do not focus, as we do with regard to the first prong of <em>Upjohn </em>Co., on whether the condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>was so far outside the normal limits of zoning authority that there could not have been any \u201cjustified reliance\u201d on the challenged condition. Id., 105. Instead, we focus on the \u201ccontinued maintenance\u201d of the condition, and whether, irrespective of the fact that the condition was \u201cpreviously unchallenged,\u201d it nonetheless currently \u201cviolatejs] some strong public policy.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">It is undisputable that \u201c[i]t is the policy of the law not to uphold restrictions upon the free and unrestricted alienation of property unless they serve a legal and useful purpose.\u201d <em>Peiter </em>v. <em>Degenring, </em>136 Conn. 331, 336, 71 A.2d 87 (1949). It is also undisputable that this policy is strong and deeply rooted. J. Dukeminier &amp; J. Krier, Property (3d Ed. 1993) p. 223 (\u201c[t]he rule against direct restraints on alienation is an old one, going back to the fifteenth century or perhaps even earlier\u201d). Moreover, it is undisputable that the right of property owners to rent their real estate is one of the bundle of rights that, taken together, constitute the essence of ownership of property. See, e.g., id., p. 86 (\u201c[property] consists of a number of disparate rights, a \u2018bundle\u2019 of them: the right to possess, the right to use, the right to exclude, the right to transfer\u201d). The question that the present case poses, therefore, is whether, under the facts of this case, the continued maintenance of the no rental condition serves \u201ca legal and useful purpose.\u201d <em>Peiter v. Degenring, </em>supra, 336; see also T. Tondro, Connecticut Land Use Regulation (2d Ed. 1992) p. 89 n.185 (\u201c[t]he real question is whether a valid zoning objective is being served\u201d). We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Owners of a single-family residence can do one of three economically productive things<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> with the resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>dence: (1) live in it; (2) rent it; or (3) sell it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, if the owners of a single-family residence do not choose, for reasons of family size<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or other valid reasons, to live in the house they own, their only viable options are to rent it or to divest themselves entirely of their ownership by selling it. Stripping the plaintiffs of essentially one third of their bundle of economically productive rights constituting ownership is a very significant restriction on their right of ownership. In addition, when the variance was granted in 1986, the no rental condition deprived the plaintiffs only of the right to rent their property on a seasonal basis.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> With the change in the zoning regulations, however, the plaintiffs now also have lost the more significant right to rent their property on a year-round basis, resulting in a total loss of the right to rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Furthermore, the maintenance of the no rental condition in the present case not only strips the plaintiffs of one of those three options, it also significantly reduces the value of the third because when they do put the house on the market it will necessarily bring significantly less than the fair market value that it would have commanded without the condition. It takes little imagination to predict that the only pool of potential buyers for a house with a no rental condition perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>nently attached to it would be those persons who are so confident that their life circumstances will never change that, despite the passage of time or changes in health or family circumstance, they will, forever, either occupy the house or sell it. Moreover, those potential buyers also will have to be supremely confident that, when <em>they </em>go to sell it, they also will be able to find buyers who have the same degree and type of confidence. Needless to say, this surely will be a very small pool of buyers, thus significantly and adversely affecting the fair market value of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Finally, insofar as this record discloses, the condition limiting the plaintiffs\u2019 economic use of the house to occupancy, and prohibiting their economic use of it by renting it, is a limitation that does not adhere to the rest of the property owners in the beach district. Thus, the most obvious consequence of the continued maintenance of the no rental condition on the plaintiffs\u2019 property is to give those other property owners a grossly unfair advantage over the plaintiffs in the marketplace. A house, particularly a house located in a beach district, that can never be rented obviously would be significantly less desirable to a potential purchaser than the rest of the houses in the beach district, which do not have such a drastic limitation on their economic use.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Neither the state zoning statutes nor the local zoning regulations place any such limitation on those other property owners. Thus, whatever adverse consequences to other properties may be imagined to flow from occupancy of the houses in the beach district by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>renters </em>as opposed to <em>owners </em>cannot be reasonably attributable to the plaintiffs\u2019 use of their property, because presumably no other properties are so encumbered. Put another way, if all or most of the other houses in the beach district legally can be rented to any group of four or fewer unrelated persons, we fail to see how this condition on this one house conceivably may serve any legal or useful purpose\u2014except to maintain the unfair market advantage that the other unencumbered houses have, a purpose that the law should hardly label as \u201clegal and useful . . . .\u201d <em>Peiter </em>v. <em>Degenring, </em>supra, 136 Conn. 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Finally, the continued maintenance of this no rental condition violates another strong and deeply rooted policy, namely, the policy against economic waste. Our law has long recognized such a policy. See <em>Levesque </em>v. <em>D &amp; M Builders, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 177, 181-82, 365 A.2d 1216 (1976). By artificially and significantly devaluing the plaintiffs\u2019 property, as compared to the value of the surrounding parcels, the continued maintenance of the condition in question removes from the marketplace, and thereby from the economy, that significant differential in value. We can see no legal or useful purpose in doing so. The consequence of such conduct is economic waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We acknowledge that permitting the plaintiffs to challenge the condition now means that they will receive what could be regarded as a windfall, because they secured a variance in 1986 coupled with the no rental condition, and it is possible that, had the condition not been imposed, either the zoning authority might not have granted the variance<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or an aggrieved neighbor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>might have successfully challenged the granting of the variance by way of appeal at that time. Moreover, for the period between 1986, when they secured the variance, and whenever the zoning regulations were amended to eliminate the seasonal use restriction on the beach district, the plaintiffs had the full benefit of the variance. That, however, does not alter our conclusion, however, for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">First, whenever the law permits a previously imposed condition to be challenged collaterally\u2014as the dictum in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>suggested and as we now hold\u2014some similar windfall is afforded the property owner. Indeed, subsequent to our decision in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>we implicitly permitted a condition that was personal to the property owner to be challenged collaterally. <em>See Reid </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, of Appeals, </em>235 Conn. 850, 670 A.2d 1271 (1996). Thus, the presence alone of such a windfall cannot be enough to preclude such a collateral attack because it is inherent in the <em>Upjohn Co. </em>formulation. Second, on the facts of the present case the windfall amounts to: (1) an additional 3.8 feet of width and 59.6 square feet to the plaintiffs\u2019 house; and (2) the full use of the variance for a finite period of time, namely, from 1986 to whenever the zoning regulations were amended. Against this, however, must be balanced the current effects of the condition. Those effects are: (1) the drastic and direct restriction on the alienability of the plaintiffs\u2019 property; (2) its grossly unfair consequence, when compared with the freedom of alienability of the other property owners in the beach district; and (3) the fact that the restriction is, unlike the second part of the windfall, temporally unlimited\u2014in fact, permanent. This balance leads us to conclude that the no rental condition is so restrictive of the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to alienate their property that it outweighs the public policy considerations underlying the bar on collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>attacks.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We need not, and do not, decide whether a no rental condition may never be valid in the zoning context. Compare <em>Kirsch Holding Co. </em>v. <em>Manasquan, </em>59 N.J. 241, 281 A.2d 513 (1971) (invalidating regulation prohibiting rental to groups of persons not meeting statutory definition of family), <em>United Property Owners Assn. of Belmar v. Belmar, </em>185 N.J. Super. 163, 447 A.2d 933 (1982) (invalidating regulation prohibiting rental for one year or less when residence not intended to be permanent residence of renter), <em>Kulak </em>v. <em>Zoning Hearing Board, </em>128 Pa. Commw. 457, 563 A.2d 978 (1989) (condition to special exception requiring apartment building owner to reside in one apartment did not serve any valid zoning purpose, but owner nonetheless bound because not appealed from when imposed), and 5 A. Rathkopf &amp; D. Rathkopf, The Law of Zoning and Planning (4th Ed. Ziegler 2000) \u00a7 56A.02 [1] [e], p. 56A-8 (\u201c[t]he principle that zoning enabling acts authorize local regulation of land use\u2019 and not regulation of the \u2018identity or status\u2019 of owners or persons who occupy the land would likely be held to apply to invalidate zoning provisions distinguishing between owner-occupied and rental housing\u201d), with <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Carmel-bythe-Sea, </em>234 Cal. App. 3d 1579, 286 Cal. Rptr. 382 (1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 914, 112 S. Ct. 1950, 118 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1992) (upholding constitutionality of ordinance prohibiting rental of residential property for fewer than thirty days), and <em>Kasper </em>v. <em>Brookhaven, </em>142 App. Div. 2d 213, 535 N.Y.S.2d 621 (1988) (upholding ordinance requiring homeowners who apply for accessory rental apartments to occupy principal residence).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">It may be that where such a condition is imposed by virtue of a statute or regulation that is of district-wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>application and is tailored to a specific land use policy; see, e.g., <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Carmel-by-the-Sea, </em>supra, 234 Cal. App. 3d 1590 (maintenance of residential character of district by prohibiting very short-term rentals); such a condition might be valid. Where, however, as in the present case, the no rental condition is not district-wide and therefore presumably applies only to the property at issue, thereby affording the other property owners in the beach district a distinct market advantage, and there is no other regulation even approaching its scope or purpose, the continued maintenance of the no rental condition serves no valid purpose, and violates the strong and deeply rooted public policy in favor of the free and unrestricted alienability of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In this opinion NORCOTT, PALMER and VERTEFEU-ILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\"> Judith Kramer and Barry Kramer, the owners of the property abutting the property owned by the plaintiffs, intervened as defendants in the trial court, and have participated as such in this appeal.

This Board further finds that because of the proximity of the houses in the beach section it does create a uniqueness and because of its uniqueness this condition of family use only can be defended as it does promote the public health of the neighborhood, it promotes the general welfare of the neighborhood and it does in fact conserve the value of the buildings located in the neighborhood.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gangemi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 54 Conn.

Gangemi, claim that: (1) the no rental condition imposed by the defendant, the zoning board of appeals of the town of Fairfield (board), in connection with the board\u2019s granting of a setback variance was personal to them and, therefore, void; (2) the board had no jurisdiction to impose the condition; (3) there was no reasonable relationship between the condition and the land use regulatoiy purpose threatened by the granting of the variance; (4) the condition discriminates against renters and, therefore, is against the strong public policy favoring the development of housing opportunities for all residents and the promotion of housing choice and economic diversity; (5) the condition violates the public policy favoring free and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>unrestricted alienation of property; (6) the condition violates public policy in that it violates article first, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution; and (7) the condition violates public policy in that it constitutes a taking of property without just compensation in violation of the federal and state constitutions. On the basis of the foregoing claims, the plaintiffs argue that, although they failed to appeal the imposition of the variance within the statutory time period, they may attack the no rental condition in a collateral enforcement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The majority concludes that the no rental condition violates the public policy against unreasonable restraints on alienation, and, therefore, that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is excepted from the general bar on collateral attacks.

Zoning regulates the use of land irrespective of who may be the owner of such land at any given time and is defined as a general plan to control and direct the use and development of property in a municipality or a large part of it by dividing it into districts according to the present and potential use of the properties. <em>State ex rel.

In other words, in order to determine whether the [zoning action] in question was within the authority of the [board] . . . we do not search for a statutory prohibition against such an [action]; rather, we must search for statutory authority for the [action], <em>Avonside, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning &amp; Planning Commission, </em>153 Conn. 232, 236, 215 A.2d 409 (1965); [accord] <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>203 Conn. 14, 19, 523 A.2d 467 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Builders Service Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 267, 274-75, 545 A.2d 530 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>This court previously has concluded that \u201c[a] zoning board of appeals may, without express authorization, attach reasonable conditions to the grant of a variance.\u201d <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Jencik, </em>168 Conn. 506, 509, 362 A.2d 1338 (1975).

This court concluded, however, that \u201c[n] either of these principles . . . requires the conclusion . . . that the recipient of a zoning permit that had been granted subject to a condition may accept both the benefits of the permit and the condition attached to it, by failing to challenge the condition by way of direct appeal . . . and then, years later, defend against the enforcement of the condition by attacking its validity ab initio.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 101-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u201c[W]e have uniformly held that failure to file a zoning appeal within the statutory time period deprives the trial court of jurisdiction over the appeal. <em>Cardoza </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 78, 82, 557 A.2d 545 (1989); <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>176 Conn. 581, 593, 409 A.2d 1029 (1979). We have also consistently held that when a party has a statutory right of appeal from the decision of an administrative agency, [it] may not, instead of appealing, bring an independent action to test the very issue which the appeal was designed to test. <em>Carpenters. Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 598 .... Moreover, we have ordinarily recognized that the failure of a party to appeal from the action of a zoning authority renders that action final so that the correctness of that action is no longer subject to review by a court. <em>Haynes v.

All of these rules rest in large part, at least in the zoning context, on the need for stability in land use planning and the need for justified reliance by all interested parties\u2014 the interested property owner, any interested neighbors and the town\u2014on the decisions of the zoning authorities. It would be inconsistent with those needs to permit ... a challenge to a condition imposed on a zoning permit when the town seeks to enforce it [many] years later. See <em>Spectrum of Connecticut, Inc. v. Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>13 Conn.

Under this rationale, at least where the lack of jurisdiction is not entirely obvious, the critical considerations are whether the complaining party had the opportunity to litigate the question of jurisdiction in the original action, and, if he did have such an opportunity, whether there are strong policy reasons for giving him a second opportunity to do so.

I would conclude, however, that there is nothing in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>to suggest that this court\u2019s reasoning in that case is not applicable to variance conditions. If a condition to a variance does not operate to ensure that the variance is in harmony with the purpose and intent of legitimate zoning ordinances, it is not within the zoning power delegated to the board.

These authorities suggest that regulations that restrict forms of ownership and that affect the occupants, rather than the particular use, of a property, may be valid if they are reasonably related to a legitimate zoning purpose. But see <em>FGL &amp; L Property Corp. </em>v. <em>Rye, </em>66 N.Y.2d 111, 114, 116, 485 N.E.2d 986, 495 N.Y.S.2d 321 (1985) (recognizing that \u201cit is a \u2018fundamental rule that zoning deals basically with land use and not with the person who owns or occupies it\u2019 \u201d and holding that planning board does not have power to require certain form of ownership).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Although this court previously has not considered the issue, other jurisdictions have considered the application of the principle that the zoning power must be exercised to regulate the use, not the user, to restrictions on the rental of property. A number of courts have upheld such restrictions. See, e.g., <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Carmel-by-the-Sea, </em>234 Cal. App. 3d 1579, 1584, 1598, 286 Cal.

As I noted previously in this opinion, there are no Connecticut appellate cases considering whether a limitation or prohibition on renting is within the zoning power, and the case law of other jurisdictions is split on the issue. Accordingly, for reasons that I will discuss more fully in part III of this opinion, the board reasonably could have believed that the no rental condition advanced the legitimate zoning puipose of enhancing the residential character of the neighborhood and its year-round stability, a purpose that was threatened by the granting of the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The majority distinguishes the no rental condition from the no rental regulations upheld in other jurisdictions on the grounds that the no rental condition is not district-wide and is not tailored to a specific land use policy. I would note, however, that, although the owner occupancy requirement in <em>Kasper </em>v. <em>Brookhaven, </em>supra, 142 App. Div. 2d 213, was a district-wide ordinance in the sense that it applied to anyone in the district who wished to maintain an accessory apartment, it operated, in effect, as a condition to a special permit. See id., 215-16 (ordinance allowed maintenance of accessory apartment upon obtaining special permit). Furthermore, the court in <em>Kasper </em>found that the owner occupancy requirement had \u201cthe permissible legislative purpose of providing occupying homeowners of modest means with additional income for use in retaining ownership of their residences\u201d; id., 223; a purpose <em>less </em>related to land use than the purposes advanced by the board in the present case. Accordingly, without necessarily agreeing with the court in <em>Kasper, </em>I would conclude that case does support the board\u2019s claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>imposition of the no rental condition was within the powers delegated to it by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">I would conclude that the board reasonably could have believed that the imposition of the no rental condition was within its power. Although, as the plaintiffs note, such a reasonable belief would not have conferred subject matter jurisdiction on the board, it does indicate that any lack of jurisdiction was not obvious and that reliance on the condition by interested parties was justified. I further note that there is no claim in this case that the plaintiffs did not have a prior opportunity to challenge the condition at the time the variance was granted. Finally, I note that the plaintiffs themselves, in their application for a variance, represented that: \u201cOwners intend to use the property for family use only on a [year-round] basis.\u201d Interested parties reasonably could have inferred from the plaintiffs\u2019 application that the plaintiffs intended to use the property themselves, and not for rental purposes. I recognize, as the plaintiffs note, that their representation that the property would be for family use only did not confer subject matter jurisdiction on the board to limit the use of the property to the plaintiffs. Nevertheless, because the inference that the plaintiffs did not intend to rent the property was reasonable, I would conclude that reliance on the condition was not unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Accordingly, I would conclude that the no rental condition is not subject to collateral attack on the ground that the lack of jurisdiction to impose it was obvious, or that it was \u201cso far outside what could have been regarded as a valid exercise of zoning power that there could not have been any justified reliance on it . . . .\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Relying on <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Jencik, </em>supra, 168 Conn. 506, the plaintiffs also argue that, even if the board had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the power to impose a no rental condition, it did not have the authority to do so in this case. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the condition had no relationship to the granting of the variance and that, accordingly, they may collaterally attack it. Cf. <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 105. Because I would not decide, as a general matter, that the board had no jurisdiction to impose the no rental condition, I must address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Jencik, </em>supra, 168 Conn. 507, the defendant property owners sought a variance from the building setback lines in order to build a garage. The zoning board of appeals granted the variance on the condition that the garage would \u201cbe used exclusively for the private garaging of automobiles and not for commercial repair work of any type.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Commercial uses generally were allowed in the zone. See id., 510. The defendants did not appeal from that decision. Id., 508. The property owners built the garage and used it for the storage and sale of merchandise. Id. The town brought an action seeking to enjoin the property owners from using the garage for commercial purposes and prevailed. Id. The property owners appealed to this court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">This court noted that the function of a condition to a variance is to \u201c[alleviate] the harm which might otherwise result\u201d from the granting of the variance without the condition. Id., 509. This court concluded that the condition banning commercial use was in harmony with the purpose of the variance from the setback requirements, which was to relieve intolerable parking conditions in the neighborhood, and upheld it as a valid use of the zoning power. Id., 510-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">I would not conclude in the present case that the no rental condition was so obviously unrelated to the variance from the setback requirements that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tiffs should be permitted to attack the condition collaterally. As this court implicitly recognized in <em>Jencik, </em>a condition to a variance need not be directly related to the alleviation of a threat to the purposes of the <em>specific </em>regulation from which the applicant received the variance. The ban on commercial uses in <em>Jencik </em>did not directly further the zoning goals underlying setback requirements. See <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 484, 487, 227 A.2d 91 (1967) (\u201c[t]he obvious purpose of yard requirements and setback lines is to prevent fibre hazards, provide for proper drainage and make suitable provision for light and air\u201d). Rather, the imposition of a condition on a variance is a valid exercise of the board\u2019s power when the condition is reasonably related to the alleviation of harms to the <em>general </em>purpose and intent of the zoning ordinances potentially caused by granting the variance. <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Jencik, </em>supra, 168 Conn. 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In the present case, the board reasonably could have believed that the no rental condition alleviated the harm caused by permitting the intensification of the plaintiffs\u2019 nonconforming use of their property. In granting the variance\u2014which had the effect of permitting year-round use of the <em>property\u2014only </em>on the condition that the property would not be rented, the board reasonably could have believed that, even though its action could result in an increase in the population density of the neighborhood during winter months, which the board saw as a harm to the zoning scheme, the condition mitigated that harm by advancing the neighborhood\u2019s character as a place for family residences and its year-round stability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the other hand, had the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>granted the variance without the owner occupancy requirement, its action potentially would have contributed to the population density of the neighborhood during the winter months and its instability year round, without any countervailing benefits to the neighborhood. Thus, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the board was not necessarily discriminating arbitrarily against families that rent a property in favor of families that own and occupy a property, but, rather, was attempting, at least arguably, to promote continuous use by families on a year-round basis. I would not conclude that this was an obviously illegitimate zoning purpose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The majority points out that the board stated at oral argument that the zoning regulations were changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>after the variance in the present case was granted to eliminate restrictions on year-round use. I first note that the board represented in its brief to this court that, when the variance was granted, \u00a7 2.5.1 of the Fairfield zoning regulations governed changes from seasonal to year-round use. Section 2.5.1, however, governs extensions of nonconforming uses in general and does not address the issue of year-round use. I would conclude, therefore, that the record is insufficient for this court to determine whether there was any change in the regulations concerning year-round use and, if so, what that change entailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Even if it is assumed, however, that there was such a change, that would not change my analysis. Even if the change in regulations gave the plaintiffs the abstract right to occupy their house year round, without the existence of the setback variance, which enabled the plaintiffs to enlarge a bathroom in order to install a shower, and to install a furnace room, they would not have been able to do so. The essential point is that, regardless of what the regulations allowed for conforming properties, the variance allowed an intensification of the plaintiffs\u2019 nonconforming use, and, therefore, the board had the power to impose conditions to alleviate potential harms caused by that intensification. I would conclude that the board reasonably could have concluded that the no rental condition did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that the board did not single out the plaintiffs\u2019 property for special or discriminatory regulation vis-a-vis other neighboring properties or in general, but imposed the no rental condition because the plaintiffs themselves applied to the board for a variance, i.e., special and discriminatory favorable treatment. In my view, under the circumstances of this case, in which the plaintiffs themselves <em>volunteered </em>in their application that, if the board were to grant the variance, they would use the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>property for family use only, it would be unjustified to allow them to attack that condition now, while allowing them to retain the benefit of the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Accordingly, without deciding whether the no rental condition would be found on a direct appeal to be related to the alleviation of the harm caused by granting the variance or, if not, whether a less restrictive limitation on renting would be permissible, I would conclude that the board reasonably could have believed that the condition advanced the purpose and intent of the zoning scheme, and, therefore, that the absence of any relationship between the condition and the variance was not obvious. Therefore, I would conclude that the no rental condition in the present case does not fall within the narrow exception to the bar on collateral attacks set forth in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">I now address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the no rental condition falls within the exception to the bar on collateral attacks for zoning actions that violate a strong public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The plaintiffs first argue that the prohibition on renting is discriminatory against renters and, therefore, in violation of \u00a7 8-2 (a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which provides that the regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>of land shall encourage the development of housing opportunities for all residents of the municipality and promote housing choice and economic diversity. I would follow the Appellate Court\u2019s reasoning and conclusion that the plaintiffs do not have standing to raise this claim. See <em>Gangemi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 569-70 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The plaintiffs also argue that the no rental condition restricts their ability to grant a periodic tenancy in their property and, therefore, violates the public policy against \u201crestrictions upon the free and unrestricted alienation of property unless they serve a legal and useful purpose.\u201d <em>Peiter </em>v. <em>Degenring, </em>136 Conn. 331, 336, 71 A.2d 87 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">I recognize that, to some extent, the no rental condition restricts the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to alienate their property. This court implicitly recognized, however, in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 96, that there occasionally will be restrictions, including otherwise improper restrictions, on property rights, that, because of the important public policy favoring reliability and finality of zoning actions, are not subject to collateral attack, even though they probably would be invalidated in a direct appeal. See id., 104-105 &amp; n.6.1 would conclude that the no rental condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>is not so restrictive of the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to alienate their property that that consideration outweighs the important public policy considerations underlying the bar on collateral attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The majority states that, in this case, this court should not \u201cfocus ... on whether the condition was so far outside the normal limits of zoning authority that there could not have been any justified reliance on the challenged condition. . . . Instead, [this court should] focus on the continued maintenance of the condition, and whether, irrespective of the fact that the condition was previously unchallenged, it nonetheless currently violate[s] some strong public policy.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) To the extent that the majority suggests that the considerations of reliance, fairness and finality underlying the policy against permitting collateral attacks of zoning decisions; see <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 104 n.6; are not at issue when a decision implicates public policy rather than the limits of zoning authority, I disagree. Nothing in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>supports such a distinction. Nor does the case law of other jurisdictions. As I discuss later in this opinion, one court has held that, even when a condition is of a type that, several years after having been imposed, is found to be \u201c \u2018an out-and-out plan of extortion\u2019 \u201d and in violation of the state constitution, the policy favoring finality of zoning decisions operates to bar the property owners from challenging the condition after the time limitation on appeals has expired. <em>Auburn </em>v. <em>McEvoy, </em>131 N.H. 383, 384-85, 553 A.2d 317 (1988) (Souter, J.).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>McEvoy, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the condition operated to require the property owners to convey 3.3 acres of their property to the town outright. Id., 384. Thus, the property owners in <em>McEvoy </em>were deprived of every stick in their bundle of property rights, not, as in the present case, just one.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, I would conclude that, regardless of whether the zoning action is alleged to be outside the zoning power or to violate some public policy, this court must weigh the burden imposed by the action against the considerations of reliance and finality underlying the bar on collateral attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In the present case, the public policy at issue is \u201cthe policy of the law not to uphold restrictions upon the free and unrestricted alienation of property <em>unless they serve a legal and useful </em>purpose.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Peiter </em>v. <em>Degenring, </em>supra, 136 Conn. 336. As I previously noted, I would conclude that the board reasonably could have believed that the no rental condition did serve a legal and useful purpose. Accordingly, I would conclude that the board reasonably could have believed that the condition did not violate the public policy against restraints on alienation, and, therefore, reliance on the condition was not unjustified under the public policy prong of <em>Upjohn Co. </em>Therefore, I would conclude that the plaintiffs cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The plaintiffs also claim that the condition violates the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 1, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>provides in relevant part: \u201c[N]o man or set of men are entitled to exclusive public emoluments or privileges from the community.\u201d The plaintiffs, however, have failed to provide any authority or analysis in support of this claim. \u201cWe are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>47 Conn. App. 542, 558, 706 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 908, 713 A.2d 829 (1998). Accordingly, I would decline to consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the no rental condition was an unconstitutional taking under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 11, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> I do not agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>conclusion that, because \u201cthe Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, it is unnecessary ... to address this claim.\u201d <em>Gangemi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 561 n.3. Although, according to the Appellate Court, the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal on the ground that imposition of the condition was obviously outside the board\u2019s power, an unconstitutional condition may violate strong public policy and, therefore, fall within the public policy exception to the bar on collateral attacks. <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 105. Accordingly, I would address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the condition is subject to collateral attack because it is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">I first consider whether an unconstitutional condition automatically should come within the public policy exception to the general bar on collateral attacks. In <em>Upjohn Co., </em>this court implicitly recognized that not every zoning action that restricts property rights, but is not reasonably related to advancing a legitimate zoning purpose and is therefore ultra vires, will be excepted from the general bar on collateral attacks. I see no reason why a different rule should apply to a zoning action that has unconstitutionally infringed upon property rights. Therefore, I would conclude that an unconstitutional zoning action should not be excepted automatically from the bar on collateral attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">This conclusion is bolstered by the ruling of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire in <em>Auburn </em>v. <em>McEvoy, </em>supra, 131 N.H. 383. In that case, the defendant property owners had sought approval for the subdivision of their property. Id. The town\u2019s subdivision regulations conditioned approval of a subdivision application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>on the developer\u2019s dedication of at least 5 percent of the total area of the subdivision to the town. Id., 383-84. The subdivision was approved subject to the condition, and the property owners did not appeal. Id., 384. Thereafter, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire ruled in <em>J.E.D. Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>121 N.H. 581, 584, 432 A.2d 12 (1981), that such ordinances violate the state constitution. The property owners sought recon-veyance of the property that had been dedicated to the town, and the town brought a declaratory judgment action to determine the rights of the parties. <em>Auburn </em>v. <em>McEvoy, </em>supra, 384. The trial court ruled against the property owners on the ground of laches; id.; based on a finding \u201cthat changed circumstances would render any reconveyance inequitable . . . [because] the subdivision\u2019s residents were aware when they purchased their properties that the lot in question was meant to remain available for recreation, and had changed their positions expecting that the lot would remain commercially undeveloped.\u201d Id., 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">On appeal, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire recognized that the purpose of the statutory time limitation for bringing appeals from zoning decisions was to \u201cendue such [decisions] with finality, at least insofar as the [decision] applies a town\u2019s land use regulations in the particular instance\u201d; id.; and noted that a broad rule exempting constitutional claims from the time limitation \u201cwould be justifiable only if the appeal period . . . imposed an unreasonable restriction on the assertion of constitutional property rights, whereas the [property owners] have proffered no reason to suppose that this is so.\u201d Id., 388. Accordingly, the court held that the property owners were barred from bringing the claim. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">I am persuaded by the reasoning of the court in <em>McEvoy. </em>Nevertheless, our suggestion in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 104-105, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>that there may be exceptional cases in which collateral attacks may be brought against zoning actions that violate strong public policy, would lead me to reject a categorical rule barring collateral attacks on unconstitutional zoning actions. Rather, by analogy to our holding in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>that a zoning action that is allegedly ultra vires is subject to collateral attack only when the lack of subject matter jurisdiction is obvious or the action is \u201cso far outside what could have been regarded as a valid exercise of zoning power that there could not have been any justified reliance on it\u201d; id., 105; I would conclude that allegedly unconstitutional zoning actions are subject to collateral attack only when the unconstitutionality is obvious, or when the action is so invasive of constitutional property rights that there could have been no justified reliance on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Accordingly, I would consider whether the no rental condition is in this category of unconstitutional zoning actions that is subject to collateral attack. The plaintiffs, relying on <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Tigard, </em>512 U.S. 374, 377, 391, 114 S. Ct. 2309, 129 L. Ed. 2d 304 (1994) (considering constitutionality of condition to approval of building permit requiring that landowner dedicate portion of land to public use and holding that there must be \u201c \u2018rough proportionality\u2019 \u201d between dedication and nature and impact of proposed development), and <em>Nollan </em>v. <em>California Coastal Commission, </em>483 U.S. 825, 827, 837, 107 S. Ct. 3141, 97 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1987) (considering constitutionality of condition to approval of building permit requiring that landowner grant public easement across property and holding that unless condition serves same governmental purpose as original building restriction, condition is \u201c \u2018an out-and-out plan of extortion\u2019 \u201d and thus unconstitutional), argue that the no rental condition does not meet the constitutional requirement that a condition imposed by a zoning agency be related to the discretionary benefit that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>agency is conferring. The court in <em>Dolan </em>and <em>Nollan </em>considered whether exactions, that, in and of themselves, clearly would have been unconstitutional takings; <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Tigard, </em>supra, 384; <em>Nollan </em>v. <em>California Coastal Commission, </em>supra, 831; were constitutional conditions to the approval of building permits when imposed in exchange for the granting of discretionary government benefits. The court concluded that the exactions were unconstitutional takings, because, in each case, there was an insufficient nexus between the condition and the benefit. See <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Tigard, </em>supra, 394-95; <em>Nollan </em>v. <em>California Coastal Commission, </em>supra, 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The board argues, however, that, in the present case, the no rental condition was not a per se unconstitutional taking and, therefore, not subject to analysis under <em>Dolan </em>and <em>Nollan. </em>Although I recognize, as is discussed later in this opinion, that a zoning action that is ultra vires may be an unconstitutional taking per se, I would agree with the board. Analyzing the condition from the perspective of the board\u2019s reasonable belief that the imposition of the condition was within its authority, the condition did not constitute a regulatory taking and was not so invasive of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional property rights that there could have been no justified reliance thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">This court previously has held that, \u201c[w]hile [a]ll property is held subject to the right of government to regulate its use in the exercise of the police power; <em>Figarsky </em>v. <em>Historic District Commission, </em>171 Conn. 198, 206, 368 A.2d 163 (1976); if regulation goes too far, it will be recognized as a taking. . . . <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 1014, 112 S. Ct. 2886,120 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1992). In analyzing regulatory action to determine whether it goes too far, we are mindful that the difference between a regulation that results in a compensable taking and one that does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>generally is a matter of degree. <em>Luf </em>v. <em>Southbury, </em>188 Conn. 336, 349, 449 A.2d 1001 (1982). Although at one extreme a regulation may deprive an owner of the beneficial use of property so as to constitute a practical confiscation, thereby requiring compensation; see <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>supra, 1015; <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 221, 256, 662 A.2d 1179 (1995); if a regulation results in something less than a practical confiscation, the determination of whether a taking has occurred must be made on the facts of each case with consideration being given not only to the degree of diminution in the value of the land but also to the nature and degree of public harm to be prevented and to the alternatives available to the landowner. . . . The financial effect on a particular owner must be balanced against the health, safety and welfare of the community. . . . <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 256; see <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. </em>v. <em>DeBenedictis, </em>480 U.S. 470, 492, 107 S. Ct. 1232, 94 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1987) (determination of whether regulatory action constitutes taking necessarily requires weighing of private and public interests).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>244 Conn. 206, 220-21, 710 A.2d 746 (1998). \u201c[0]ur test for regulatory taking requires us to compare the value that has been taken from the property with the value that remains in the property . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 253. \u201c[W]e have held that zoning reclassifications can constitute an unconstitutional taking when they leave a property owner with <em>no economically viable use of his [or her] land other than exploiting its natural state.\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The no rental condition does not deprive the plaintiffs of all economically viable use of their property. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>may occupy the property themselves or, as the board has noted, they may relinquish the variance and rent it out seasonally. Furthermore, although I would not decide in the present case whether the burden imposed by the condition was balanced by its advancement of a legitimate zoning purpose when the condition was imposed, inasmuch as the absence of any such purpose was not obvious, I would conclude that any effect of the condition on the value of the property is mitigated, at the present time, by the public \u201cneed for stability in land use planning and the need for justified reliance by all interested parties ... on the decisions of the zoning authorities\u201d that underlie the policy against allowing collateral attacks. <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 102. Accordingly, because the condition is not an obviously unconstitutional regulatory taking, I would conclude that it is not subject to collateral attack, especially in light of the fact that the plaintiffs volunteered the condition before the board had granted the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">I recognize that a zoning action that is beyond the zoning power may constitute an unconstitutional taking, no matter how far it goes. E.g., <em>Nectow </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>277 U.S. 183, 48 S. Ct. 447, 72 L. Ed. 842 (1928); see also <em>Port Clinton Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>217 Conn. 588, 600, 587 A.2d 126, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 814, 112 S. Ct. 64, 116 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1991) (\u201c[w]hen the regulation itself is not a \u2018valid\u2019 exercise of the police power, United States Supreme Court precedents imply that no matter how \u2018far\u2019 it goes, the regulation may constitute a taking\u201d). I concluded in part II of this opinion, however, that the board reasonably could have believed that the no rental condition was within its authority to impose, and that the imposition of that condition, therefore, was not an obviously invalid use of the board\u2019s power. Therefore, without deciding whether the condition, as an ultra vires action, was an unconsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>tutional taking under <em>Nectow, </em>I would conclude that, because the board\u2019s lack of jurisdiction was not obvious, any such unconstitutionality was not obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In sum, I would conclude that the no rental condition does not fall within any of the exceptions to the bar on collateral attacks of zoning actions, and that the trial court, therefore, lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-10\"> The Appellate Court characterized as dictum our language in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 104-105, recognizing possible exceptions to the bar on collateral attacks. <em>Gangemi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 569 n.7. I disagree. As I discuss more fully later in this opinion, this court clearly indicated in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>that its analysis would have been very different had it concluded that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>was an obvious lack of jurisdiction or that the condition was \u201cso far outside what could have been regarded as a valid exercise of zoning power that there could not have been any justified reliance on it . . . .\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. v. Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 105. To that extent, those statements were not unrelated to this court\u2019s determination of the issue in that case. Furthermore, this court did not merely make an off hand reference to the abstract possibility of future exceptions to the bar on collateral attacks, but directly addressed the issue and clearly indicated that it would be open to allowing such attacks if certain criteria were met. Finally, none of the parties has argued that permitting collateral attacks on zoning actions in rare, exceptional cases would be ill-considered. As the Appellate Court previously has stated, \u201cit is not dictum when a court of [appeal] intentionally takes up, discusses and decides a question germane to, though not necessarily decisive of, the controversy .... <em>Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Fairfield Resources Management, Inc., </em>41 Conn. App. 89, 109-10, 674 A.2d 1335 (1996). Rather, such action constitutes an act of the court which it will thereafter recognize as a binding decision.

App. 3d 1579.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\"> The court in <em>Kirsch Holding Co. </em>v. <em>Manasquan, </em>supra, 59 N.J. 241, based its conclusion on the unreasonableness and arbitrariness of the ordinances, concluding that the ordinances did not \u201chave a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained\u201d; id., 251; and that they were \u201csweepingly excessive.\u201d Id., 252. The court\u2019s reasoning focused on the ordinances\u2019 restrictive definition of family, rather than on the rental ban. See generally id., 251-52. To the extent that <em>Kirsch Holding Co. </em>may be read as holding that restrictions on the definition of family are inherently unconstitutional, that holding has been superseded by New Jersey cases holding that the strict use, not user principle had been implicitly overruled, and that regulations on users of land, as opposed to land use, are not inherently ultra vires. See <em>Taxpayers Assn. of Weymouth Township, Inc. </em>v. <em>Weymouth Township, </em>supra, 71 N.J. 277; <em>Bonner Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franklin Township Planning Board, </em>supra, 185 N.J. Super. 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Nevertheless, the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Kirsch Holding Co. </em>is equally applicable to the validity of the ban on rentals, an issue on which there is no superseding authority. The court in <em>Kirsch Holding Go. </em>indicated that \u201cthe evil [sought to be prevented by the ordinances] arises because of the offensive <em>personal behatvior </em>of many of these unrelated groups\u201d; (emphasis in original) <em>Kirsch Holding Co. </em>v. <em>Manasquan, </em>supra, 59 N.J. 253; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>land use regulation may not be used to cure such a problem. Id., 253-54. Rather, the court suggested that \u201cobnoxious personal behavior can best be dealt with officially by vigorous and persistent enforcement of general police power ordinances and criminal statutes . . . .\u201d Id., 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>Kirsch Holding Co. </em>was criticized in <em>Boraas </em>v. <em>Belle Terre, </em>367 F. Sup. 136, 149 (E.D.N.Y. 1972), a case that ultimately was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. See <em>Belle Terre </em>v. <em>Boraas, </em>416 U.S. 1, 94 S. Ct. 1536, 39 L. Ed. 2d 797 (1974). In the latter case, the United States Supreme Court suggested that the zoning power includes the power to enact an ordinance restricting the definition of family for zoning purposes provided that the ordinance does not infringe upon any fundamental right and is rationally related to a permissible state objective. See id., 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\"> I assume that, before the granting of the variance, the plaintiffs\u2019 property was used as a summer cottage. In granting the variance with the no rental condition, the board reasonably could have expected that the properly would be used by the occupants as a year-round home. As was suggested at oral argument, the board also reasonably could have expected that, had it granted the variance without a no rental condition, the properly could be rented to students for nine months of the year and used as a summer residence during the summer months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\"> The majority states that it \u201cfail[s] to see how this condition . . . conceivably may serve any legal or useful purpose\u2014except to maintain the unfair market advantage that the other unencumbered houses have, a purpose that the law should hardly label as \u2018legal and useful,\u2019 \u201d thus suggesting that the board and the intervening defendants, who are the owners of the property abutting the plaintiffs\u2019 property, have a nefarious, unstated motive in opposing the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. I note, however, that, although the no rental condition may have some negative effect on the marketability of the plaintiffs\u2019 property, that effect hardly could have been the <em>purpose </em>of the board or the other property owners in the beach district. First, I note that it was the plaintiffs who offered the condition in exchange for the variance. If the other property owners in the beach district have any interest in the condition at all, it simply is that they believe that the condition will improve living conditions within the beach district. If they are correct, the condition will directly improve their living conditions while they occupy their properties and, admittedly, likely will increase their property values, both of which are legitimate zoning purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">I recognize that the plaintiffs bear a burden that some of the other benefited property owners do not bear\u2014although, as the majority notes, an unknown number of other beach district property owners also are bound by similar no rental conditions. See footnote 17 of majority opinion. That was also the case, however, in <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Jencik, </em>supra, 168 Conn. 506. Indeed, that always will be the case when a condition is imposed on a variance. Finally, I note that, to the extent that property values in the area generally are enhanced by the existence of no rental conditions on some of the properties, the negative effect of the condition on the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 property will be offset to some extent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The zoning commission of each city, town or borough is authorized to regulate, within the limits of such municipality, the height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures; the percentage of the area of the lot that may be occupied; the size of yards, courts and other open spaces; the density of population and the location and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes, including water-dependent uses as defined in section 22a-93, and the height, size and location of advertising signs and billboards. Such bulk regulations may allow for cluster development as defined in section 8-18. Such zoning commission may divide the municipality into districts of such number, shape and area as may be best suited to carry out the purposes of this chapter; and, within such districts, it may regulate the erection, construction, reconsl ruction, alteration or use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>of buildings or structures and the use of land. . . . Such regulations shall also encourage the development of housing opportunities, including opportunities for multifamily dwellings, consistent with soil types, terrain and infrastructure capacity, for all residents of the municipality and the planning region in which the municipality is located, as designated by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management under section 16a-4a. Such regulations shall also promote housing choice and economic diversity in housing, including housing for both low and moderate income households, and shall encourage the development of housing which will meet the housing needs identified in the housing plan prepared pursuant to section 8-37t and in the housing component and the other components of the state plan of conservation and development prepared pursuant to section 16a-26. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b199-5\"> As I note in part IV D of this opinion, I would not hold, as the New Hampshire Supreme Court did inMcEvoy, that, based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 96, a regulation that constitutes \u201can out-an-out plan of extortion\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Auburn </em>v. <em>McEvoy, </em>supra, 131 N.H. 384; is immune from collateral attack. I cite <em>McEvoy </em>simply to demonstrate that there is no principled reason to distinguish zoning actions that are ultra vires from actions that violate public policy for purposes of determining whether the interests of finality and fairness preclude a collateral attack. In either case, a zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>action must be egregiously \u201cout of bounds\u201d before a collateral attack will be permitted. I would hold that the no rental condition does not meet that standard in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\"> In this regard, I note that there are innumerable sticks in the bundle of property rights, e.g., the right to exclude, to occupy the property, to improve the property, to conduct a business thereon, to subdivide, to grant limited interests in the property, etc., and, therefore, the majority\u2019s characterization of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to rent as \u201cone-third\u201d of their bundle of rights is arbitrary. I fail to see why renting is an economic choice, but subdividing, improving or conducting a business on a property is not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\"> Because the plaintiffs have not argued that the state constitution affords them a greater level of protection than the fifth amendment takings clause, and because this court never has \u201cinterpreted the two provisions to require different analys[e]s\u201d; <em>Bauer v. Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 221, 250 n.16, 662 A.2d 1179 (1995); I assume, for purposes of (his opinion, that article first, \u00a7 11, provides the same level of protection for property owners as its federal counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The board argues that the plaintiffs may not raise a constitutional challenge under the appeal procedures set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 8-8, but, rather, must bring a separate action for declaratory and injunctive relief.

The rationale for that rule is that \u201ca party cannot seek the relief provided in an ordinance or statute and later in the same proceeding raise the question of its constitutionality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 139 n.7. Furthermore, a facial challenge to a generally applicable ordinance \u201ccould seriously affect the rights of other property owners in the community\u201d; id., 140; and, therefore, procedures that permit notice to and intervention by all interested parties must be used. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">In the present case, the plaintiffs have not attacked any ordinance under which they previously had sought relief and are not mounting a facial challenge to a generally applicable ordinance.
