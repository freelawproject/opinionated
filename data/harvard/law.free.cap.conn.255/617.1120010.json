The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), we transferred the appeal to this court. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The record discloses the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff, Marguerita Marrocco, and the defendant, Michael A. Giardino, are the parents of a child bom on October 31, 1985. The plaintiff has primary physical custody of the child. In 1996, then family support magistrate Paul Matasavage entered a default order requiring the defendant to pay child support in the amount of $50 per week plus $5 per week toward an undisclosed arrearage. On January 5, 1999, the defendant filed a motion for modification of child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>support on the grounds that he was incapacitated as a result of a motor vehicle accident and derived his sole support from supplemental security income (SSI), pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq., and from state supplementation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17b-600.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, the family support magistrate temporarily suspended his prior order of child support and continued the matter to September 14, 1999, for purposes of considering whether, under the updated child support guidelines, effective August 1, 1999, the defendant would be required to pay child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">On September 14,1999, another family support magistrate, Denise Chisholm Langley, heard arguments on the defendant\u2019s motion to modify and the plaintiffs motion for contempt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that time, the defendant submitted a financial affidavit indicating that he had been receiving federal and state public assistance benefits consisting of SSI benefits in the amount of $500 per month, a state supplementation of $247 per month, and food stamps in the amount of $81 per month. On the basis of that affidavit, the family support magistrate determined that the defendant had no income under the guidelines, and, therefore, pursuant to those guidelines, owed $0 in current support. She concluded, however, that the best interests of the child justified a deviation from the guidelines, and, accordingly, ordered the defendant to pay $12 per week in child support and $1 per week toward any arrearages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the family support magistrate determined that it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d to follow the guidelines in this case, noting that if the plaintiff and the defendant had been living together, the defendant would have had to share his SSI benefits and food stamps with his family.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She further noted that \u201cit was unreasonable and outrageous\u201d for the defendant to have made \u201cno offer [of child support] in the best interests of [his] minor child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The defendant appealed from the family support magistrate\u2019s decision to the trial court. The trial court, <em>Dran-ginis, J., </em>dismissed the appeal, concluding that the guidelines did not prohibit the family support magistrate from using the deviation criterion\u2014the best interests of the child\u2014in ordering an award of child support when the defendant\u2019s income consisted only of public assistance. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly upheld the family support magistrate\u2019s decision to deviate from the guidelines in concluding that the defendant must pay child support out of his SSI benefits and public assistance grants. Specifically, he maintains that the SSI and state supplementation are expressly excluded from gross income in determining child support pursuant to \u00a7 46b-215a-l (11) (A) (ix) and (B) (ii)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. The defendant further argues that the trial court improperly concluded that the family support magistrate had improperly used the best interests of the child criterion to justify her decision to deviate from the guidelines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The plaintiff argues, conversely, that the trial court was correct because the family support magistrate had acted within her discretion in deviating from the guidelines pursuant to \u00a7 46b-215a-3<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>icut State Agencies on the basis that, given the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>interests of the child, application of the guidelines would have been inequitable and inappropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\u201cResolution of this issue requires us to interpret the statutory scheme that governs child support determinations in Connecticut, and, therefore, constitutes a question of law.\u201d <em>Unkelbach </em>v. <em>McNary, </em>244 Conn. 350, 357, 710 A.2d 717 (1998); <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>243 Conn. 584, 587-88, 704 A.2d 231 (1998); see also <em>Charles </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>243 Conn. 255, 258, 701 A.2d 650 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1136, 118 S. Ct. 1838, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1089 (1998). The standard of appellate review governing questions of law dictates that \u201c[w]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Unkelbach </em>v. <em>McNary, </em>supra, 357; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 588. \u201cWhen the question of law involves statutory interpretation, that determination is guided by well settled principles.\u201d <em>Unkelbach </em>v. <em>McNary, </em>supra, 357. In construing statutes, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>mon law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 588. Moreover, \u201c[o]ur rules of statutory construction apply to administrative regulations. . . . <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Marcinek, </em>[226 Conn. 737, 744 n.8, 629 A.2d 350 (1993)]; <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>218 Conn. 821, 829 n.9, 591 A.2d 421 (1991).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vitti </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>245 Conn. 169, 178, 713 A.2d 1269 (1998). Our examination of the language, history and purpose of the guidelines leads us to conclude that the defendant offers the more sound inteipretation of the guidelines. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We begin with a brief overview of the relevant statutory and regulatory framework. In 1989, the legislature enacted No. 89-203 of the 1989 Public Acts, first codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 46b-215a,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ing the third commission for child support guidelines, charged with three specific statutory mandates: (1) to review previous child support guidelines; (2) to establish criteria and promulgate new guidelines to \u201censure the appropriateness of child support awards\u201d; and (3) \u201cto issue updated guidelines not later than January 1, 1991 and every four years thereafter.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 46b-215b (a), <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the legislature made four significant changes in the application of the guidelines to questions of child support. These changes, moreover, replaced the \u201cflexible and nondirective approach\u201d taken by previous sets of guidelines that, although made available to the court, were in no way binding on it. See <em>Favrow </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>222 Conn. 699, 707-15, 610 A.2d 1267 (1992) (discussing history of and changes to guidelines). The statute provides: (1) that the guidelines \u201cshall be considered in all determinations of child support amounts within the state\u201d; (2) that \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that the amount of such awards which resulted from the application of such guidelines is the amount of support to be ordered\u201d; (3) that in order \u201cto rebut the presumption in such case,\u201d a court or family support magistrate must make a \u201cspecific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate in a particular case\u201d; and (4) that such a specific finding must be \u201cdetermined under criteria established by the commission . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 46b-215b (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In response to these statutory mandates, the commission promulgated new guidelines in 1991, which were later revised in 1994, and again in 1999. The primary puiposes of the current guidelines are: \u201c(1) To provide uniform procedures for establishing an adequate level of support for children, and for repayment of child support arrearages, subject to the ability of parents to pay ... (2) [t]o make awards more equitable by ensuring the consistent treatment of persons in similar circumstances ... (3) [t]o improve the efficiency of the court process by promoting settlements and by giving courts and the parties guidance in setting the levels of awards . . . [and] (4) [t]o conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory mandates.\u201d Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines (1999) preamble, \u00a7 (b), p. i.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The guidelines are based upon the concept that children \u201cshould receive the same proportion of parental income that [they] would have received had the parents lived together.\u201d Id., preamble, \u00a7 (c), p. i. Thus, \u201c[t]oward that end, the guidelines are income driven, rather than expense driven. At each income level, the guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>allocate a certain percentage of parental income to child support. The percentage allocations contained in the guidelines aim to reflect the average proportions of income spent on children in households of various income and family sizes, and contain a built-in self-support reserve for the obligor . . . ,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The result is that the guidelines incorporate an allocation of resources between parents and children that the legislature has decided is the appropriate allocation. Consequently, our interpretation of the guidelines must seek to preserve this allocation.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Unkelbach </em>v. <em>McNary, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 357-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Under \u00a7 46b-215a-2a of the guidelines, the child support obligation first is determined by calculating the parent\u2019s net income, defined as \u201cgross income minus allowable deductions . . . .\u201d Child Support and Arrear-age Guidelines (1999) preamble, \u00a7 (f), p. v. Deviation criteria such as \u201cthe best interests of the child,\u201d become relevant only if a deviation from the amount of support calculated under the guidelines is sought pursuant to \u00a7 46b-215a-3.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The amount of support determined <em>without reference to the deviation criteria, </em>however, is presumed to be the correct amount of support. This presumption may be rebutted only by a specific finding on the record that it would be inequitable or inappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ate to apply the guidelines because of evidence satisfying one of the guideline\u2019s deviation criteria. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">In considering the applicability of deviation criteria to change the presumptive amount of child support, we have stated that \u201cLj]ust as different statutes must be read so as to form a consistent whole . . . the deviation criteria must be read, insofar as possible, so as to form a consistent whole with the guidelines, both of which were issued by the same commission.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Favrow </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 715. In addition, we have recognized that because \u201cthe guidelines evolved from an experimental, intentionally nondi-rective and flexible approach to the imposition of standards that are <em>presumptively binding </em>on the court or magistrate ... in general . . . the ensuing work of the commission substantially circumscribes the traditionally broad judicial discretion of the court [to deviate from the guidelines] in matters of child support.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">With these principles in mind, we now turn to the plaintiffs claims in this appeal. The plaintiff concedes that under the guidelines, the defendant\u2019s presumptive child support obligation is $0. Indeed, she acknowledges that SSI benefits and any state supplementation are excluded from the determination of gross income for purposes of ascertaining child support.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Relying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>primarily upon the public policy embodied in the preamble to the guidelines, however, the plaintiff argues that the intent of the guidelines is to ensure that all parents are responsible for their children, noting additionally that, \u201cnowhere [in the guidelines] is there even an indication\u201d that the commission intended to exempt SSI recipients from having to support their children. On that basis, she contends that the family support magistrate properly questioned the defendant about his living expenses, determined that cable television was a \u201cdiscretionary expense,\u201d and used that expense as the basis for deviating, in the best interests of the child, from the presumptive child support order of $0 to $12 per week. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The policies underlying the commission\u2019s decision to exclude both SSI and public assistance grants from the guideline\u2019s presumptive calculation of child support compel a conclusion that deviation from the guidelines cannot be premised on the availability of income attributable to those sources. First, the commission\u2019s decision to exclude SSI from gross income in 1994 was based on the fact that SSI is a federal social welfare program designed to provide a guaranteed <em>minimum </em>income level necessary for the subsistence of individuals who cannot work because of age, blindness or disability. <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>450 U.S. 221, 223, 101 S. Ct. 1074, 67 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1981); Child Support and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Arrearage Guidelines (1994) preamble, \u00a7 (f) (1) (c), p. viii (\u201c[SSI] has been eliminated as a gross income inclusion because it is a means tested federal assistance grant\u201d). \u201cBecause of the nature of the program\u2019s mission, SSI recipients have a very low income level and little, if any, opportunity to raise that level because of their age or disability.\u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>802 S.W.2d 594, 598 (Tenn. 1990). Similarly, state supplementation is designed to provide only a <em>minimum level </em>of support to those recipients of SSI whose expenses exceed their current benefits. General Statutes \u00a7 17b-600.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Thus, both SSI and state supplementation are awarded on the basis of need and are designed to protect the individual recipients from poverty. It therefore follows that allowing child support payments to be deducted from this already small figure, would reduce the recipient\u2019s income below that necessary to protect him or her from poverty; <em>Becker County Human Services </em>v. <em>Peppel, </em>493 N.W.2d 573, 575 (Minn. App. 1992); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 802 S.W.2d 598; in contravention to the legislative intent that drives these programs. The fact that the commission <em>expressly excluded </em>both SSI and public assistance grants from the calculation of gross income indicates that the commission recognized the purpose underlying these programs and determined that parents should not be required to subsist on below poverty level incomes so that they may provide <em>something </em>in child support.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, although the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>is correct in her assertion that the intent of the guidelines is to ensure that parents support their children, that principle has no application to those parents whose sole source of income is SSI and state supplementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Second, the most recent revision of the guidelines confirms what has been noted previously, namely, that the commission did not intend to require parents to pay child support from SSI benefits and state supplementation. In 1999, in response to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Jenkins </em>v. Jenkins, supra, 243 Conn. 584,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the commission reconsidered the definition of gross income under the guidelines and interpreted it broadly to include items that, in effect, increase the amount of income that is available for child support purposes. Specifically, the commission expanded the definition to include social security benefits received directly by the children of a noncustodial parent, benefits not previously included in the determination of gross income. Id., 595. It nevertheless maintained, however, the exclusion of SSI and public assistance benefits from that calculation. Id., 590-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In 1999, the commission also vastly increased the child support orders of <em>low income </em>obligors, those indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>viduals who indeed had <em>some </em>income under the guidelines, by significantly reducing the amount of income that he or she was permitted to retain after payment of child support.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The commission considered, however, but did not adopt, a fixed minimum payment provision under which a person would have been required to pay a minimum amount of support, regardless of whether he or she had any income under the guidelines.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, although the commission made significant changes in the direction of expanding the amount of income that is available for child support purposes, indeed providing less protection to individuals earning very little, it nevertheless recognized a distinction between those with <em>no </em>earning capacity and those with <em>some </em>earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Third, we are not persuaded that public assistance grants, including SSI benefits and state supplementation, qualify under the deviation criterion, \u201cbest interests of the child.\u201d As noted previously herein, the deviation criteria must be read so as to be consistent with the guidelines. <em>Favrow </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 715. To allow a deviation from the guidelines in this case, premised on the availability of public assistance grants, would be inconsistent with the guidelines because \u201c[t]he guidelines expressly provide that public assistance grants are not to be included in [the] determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>nation of gross income.\u201d <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Feliciano, </em>37 Conn. App. 856, 859, 658 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In <em>Feliciano, </em>the Appellate Court addressed a nearly identical issue to the one in the present case, namely, whether public assistance grants, although expressly excluded from the definition of gross income, qualified under the deviation criterion, \u201cother equitable factors,\u201d and therefore could be considered in calculating child support. Id. The court concluded that allowing this deviation would create \u201ca back door method to consider something the legislature believed should not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The Appellate Court reasoned that \u201c[w]here one part of the guidelines provides that public assistance benefits are not to be considered in establishing gross income, it would be manifestly inconsistent to allow those same benefits to be used as a deviation criterion under the catchall exception of other equitable factors.\u201d Id. This court affirmed that determination. <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Felici-ano, </em>236 Conn. 719, 721, 674 A.2d 1311 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Similarly, in <em>Favrow </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 699, this court addressed whether the trial court properly determined that the living expenses of a noncustodial parent could be considered in awarding child support under the same deviation criterion, \u201cother equitable factors.\u201d We concluded that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s order finding a deviation from the guidelines on the basis of the respondent\u2019s actual living expenses amounted to a disagreement with the guidelines themselves, rather than an application of the deviation criteria established by the commission.\u201d Id., 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Specifically, in <em>Favrow </em>we noted: \u201cIt is true that the language of [the \u2018other equitable factors\u2019] criterion is very broad and would, at first glance, appear to give the trial court almost as much discretion as it had before the promulgation of the guidelines. To read this crite<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>rion, however, so as to permit the court to deviate from the guidelines solely on the basis of the noncustodial parent\u2019s actual living expenses, even when they are relatively modest in amount, would in effect permit the exception to swallow the rule. . . . Furthermore, to give precedence to current living expenses would be to read the catch-all, [\u2018other equitable factors\u2019] deviation criterion so as to be inconsistent with and, in effect, to govern the application of the guidelines themselves. Finally, to do so would be inconsistent with the circumscribed discretion that the guidelines have imposed on the trial court by the 1989 legislation that replaced the broad discretion that the trial court had in such matters before the promulgation of the guidelines.\u201d Id., 715-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In the present case, the best interests of the child criterion is comparable to the catchall deviation criterion, other equitable factors, addressed in <em>Favrow </em>and <em>Feliciano. </em>Similarly, although the best interests of the child criterion appears to give the trial court unlimited discretion to deviate from the presumptive award of child support, to give consideration to SSI and state supplementation would be to read the best interests of the child deviation criterion \u201cso as to be inconsistent with and, in effect, to govern the application of the guidelines themselves.\u201d Id., 716; see <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 254, 258, 608 A.2d 1174 (1992) (\u201c[w]hen construing a statute, we do not interpret some clauses in a manner that nullifies others, but rather read the statute as a whole and so as to reconcile all parts as far as possible\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), overruled on other grounds, 242 Conn. 689, 699 A.2d 1003 (1997). Indeed, as this court acknowledged in <em>Favrow </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 716, permitting public assistance grants to qualify as a deviation criterion would allow the \u201cexception to swallow the rule.\u201d Moreover, it would create \u201ca back door method to consider something the legislature believed should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Feliciano, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Lastly, in further support of our conclusion that the legislature intended SSI and state supplementation to be excluded from the determination of child support, we consider the tenet of statutory construction known as expressio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is, translated as \u201c \u2018the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes \u00a7 211 (1974). \u2018[W]here express exceptions are made, the legal presumption is that the legislature did not intend to save other cases from the operation of the statute.\u2019 73 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 316; see <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>[supra, 222 Conn. 258]; <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 200, 585 A.2d 96 (1991).\u201d <em>Gay &amp; Lesbian Law Students Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>236 Conn. 453, 476, 673 A.2d 484 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In 1999, for the first time, the commission expressly excluded from gross income the \u201cregularly recurring contributions or gifts of a spouse or domestic partner.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-l (11) (B) (iv). The commission, however, also determined that those contributions or gifts may, \u201cin limited circumstances, constitute a financial resource <em>justifying deviation from presumptive support amounts.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines (1999) preamble, \u00a7 (h) (2).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7 46b-215a-3 (b) (1) (D) explicitly delineates such resources as bases for deviating from the guidelines. See footnote 8 of this opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Moreover, that section provides explicit guidance to trial courts as to the exact circumstances that may justify a support order different from the presumptive amount calculated under the guidelines. Specifically, under \u00a7 46b-215a-3 (b) (1) (D), such circumstances are limited to those in which a parent has either \u201creduced his or her income or has experienced an extraordinary reduction of his or her living expenses as a direct result of such contributions or gifts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In contrast, public assistance benefits and SSI, like contributions and gifts, are expressly excluded from the definition of gross income. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-l (11) (b) (ii); see footnote 6 of this opinion. Neither SSI, nor public assistance benefits are, however, expressly <em>included </em>in the deviation criteria. The absence of deviation criteria relating specifically to SSI and public assistance grants reflects that they were not intended to qualify as bases upon which a trial court may justify a deviation from the guidelines. In reliance on the classic inclusio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is principle, we conclude that, had the commission wanted to allow SSI and public assistance grants to be considered in determinations of child support, it would have provided a separate deviation criterion specifically including them, similar to that afforded to contributions and gifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Of course, every parent has a moral obligation to support his children. See <em>Rose </em>v. Rose, 481 U.S. 619, 632, 107 S. Ct. 2029, 95 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1987) (\u201cfamily support obligations are deeply rooted moral responsibilities\u201d). The defendant here, however, a disabled, noncustodial and indisputably indigent parent, is living on public assistance benefits directed at providing him with the minimum support necessary to live. By requiring these benefits, specifically designed to guarantee a floor for the defendant, to be diverted for child support purposes would be tantamount to uprooting that floor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>indeed, undercutting the minimum support guarantee that these programs intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In promulgating the guidelines, the commission recognized the purpose underlying SSI and public assistance grants. Indeed, it <em>expressly excluded </em>both SSI and public assistance grants from the definition of gross income, and thereafter, made no mention of these benefits as deviation criteria. Moreover, although balancing the financial needs of children against the needs of disabled parents who survive solely on SSI and public assistance grants is a difficult policy choice to make, it is neither the family support magistrate\u2019s nor our function to override the commission\u2019s legislative determination that SSI and public assistance may not be considered in determining child support. To allow a deviation from the guidelines, premised on income attributable to SSI and state supplementation would be inconsistent with the guidelines as well as the purpose of these programs. We therefore conclude that deviation from the guidelines cannot be based on income attributable to SSI and state supplementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment sustaining the defendant\u2019s appeal and to award $0 in current child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\"> See Regs., Conn.

Had it been the intent of Congress that SSI funds would also benefit the recipient\u2019s dependents, these payments obviously would not have been set up in this way.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 598.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b655-9\"> In <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 595, this court concluded that social security dependency benefits received by the children of a noncustodial parent on account of that parent\u2019s disability must be included in the noncustodial parent\u2019s income for purposes of determining the parent\u2019s child support obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\"> Under the 1994 guidelines, an obligor retained a self-support reserve of $145 per week. The 1999 revision replaced that flat amount with a variable self-support reserve equal to net income minus a minimal support order, that order being as low as $1 for parents earning only $10 per week.

The response stated that the commission instead had chosen the variable approach \u201cbecause it is not an arbitrary fixed amount, but is dependent on the obligor\u2019s income, and <em>is consistent with the obligor\u2019s ability to pay.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)
