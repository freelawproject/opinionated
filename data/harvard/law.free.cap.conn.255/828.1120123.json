The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant, concluding, despite the trial court\u2019s curative instructions, \u201con the basis of the severity of the misconduct, its centrality to the critical issues in the case and the weakness of the state\u2019s case, that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>55 Conn. App. 502, 519, 739 A.2d 732 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">We granted certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court correctly con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>elude that a due process violation resulted from prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>252 Conn. 941, 747 A.2d 520 (2000). This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Having examined the record on appeal, studied the briefs and heard the arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be affirmed. The thoughtful and comprehensive opinion of the Appellate Court properly resolved the issues in this certified appeal. A further discussion by this court would serve no useful purpose. See, e.g., <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Burger King Corp., </em>244 Conn. 204, 206, 707 A.2d 30 (1998); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Buonato, </em>241 Conn. 319, 321-22, 696 A.2d 320 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 provides in relevant part: \u201cCriminal liability for acts of another, (a) A person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 provides in relevant part: \u201cConspiracy. ...
